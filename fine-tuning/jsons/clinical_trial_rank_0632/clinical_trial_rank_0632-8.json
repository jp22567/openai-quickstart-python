INTRODUCTION', '2.1', 'Background', 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic immune/inflammatory disease characterized by', 'persistent synovitis, with synovial cell proliferation and destructive changes in bone and', 'cartilage of multiple joints. Untreated, RA can lead to destruction, deformation, and', 'dysfunction of affected joints, which may result in significant morbidity, and accelerated', 'mortality (Jacobsson et al, 2007). Moderately to severely active RA is often treated with', 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), with methotrexate (MTX) being the', 'most commonly used conventional DMARD (cDMARD). For patients with an inadequate', 'response to cDMARDs, biologic agents (i.e., biologic DMARDs [bDMARDs]) are the next', 'step, and include, but are not limited to, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-) inhibitors (TNFi),', 'interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor (IL-6R) antagonists, and T-cell co-stimulation modulators.', 'Among these, TNFi, especially in combination with MTX, are used most often', '(Smolen et al, 2014). Despite early treatment with cDMARD and/or bDMARD therapy,', 'approximately 30% to 40% of patients with established RA fail to respond and 50% to 60%', 'of patients fail to achieve a major clinical American College of Rheumatology (ACR)', 'response or good European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response', '(Marchesoni et al, 2009; Rubbert-Roth and Finckh, 2009; Cohen et al, 2008). Even among', 'responders, the majority do not achieve remission. Thus, there continues to be an unmet', 'medical need for new therapeutic approaches in the RA patient population.', 'One such therapeutic approach is to target IL-6 directly instead of indirectly via a receptor', 'antagonist. Interleukin-6 is a pleiotropic, pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by a variety', 'of cell types including lymphocytes, monocytes, and fibroblasts. It is involved in multiple', 'immunologic processes such as T-cell activation, B-cell proliferation, initiation of', 'acute-phase response, stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cell growth, differentiation and', 'trafficking, as well as osteoclast differentiation, which subsequently contributes to joint', 'destruction. Due to the key role played by IL-6 in several RA mechanisms, targeting IL-6 is', 'considered an attractive therapeutic option.', '2.2', 'Study Treatment', '2.2.1', 'Olokizumab', 'Olokizumab (OKZ; CDP6038; L04041) is being developed by R-Pharm International for the', 'treatment of moderately to severely active RA. Olokizumab was previously developed by', 'UCB Pharma SA, and was transferred to R-Pharm International for further global', 'development.', 'Amendment 2: 06 March 2019', '22', 'Confidential']['R-Pharm International', 'CL04041024: Clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis Development for Olokizumab (CREDO) 4', 'Olokizumab', 'Olokizumab is a humanized (complementarity determining region [CDR]-grafted)', 'monoclonal antibody (mAb) of immunoglobulin (Ig) G4/kappa isotype, developed as an', 'antagonist of IL-6 that is anticipated to have utility in a wide range of', 'autoimmune/inflammatory conditions.', 'Interleukin-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to play a central role in', 'immune regulation, inflammation, hemopoiesis, and oncogenesis, and has been linked to a', 'wide range of human diseases. It is a glycoprotein of 184 amino acids that is produced by', 'a', 'wide range of cell types including monocytes/macrophages, fibroblasts, epidermal', 'keratinocytes, vascular endothelial cells, renal mesangial cells, glial cells, chondrocytes,', 'T and B cells, and some tumor cells. Stimuli of IL-6 production include TNF-a,', 'lipopolysaccharides, and viral infections; inhibitors of IL-6 production include', 'glucocorticoids. Within the context of an immune and inflammatory response, IL-6 has been', 'shown to exert a wide range of effects, such as those described below:', 'Induction of antibody production by B cells', 'Important role in the generation of a subpopulation of T-helper cells, Th17 cells,', 'which may play an important pathogenic role in a number of autoimmune diseases', 'Key driver of the acute phase response (the increased production, mainly by the liver,', 'of soluble factors, such as C-reactive protein [CRP] and serum amyloid A [SAA],', 'during inflammation)', 'In developing an antagonist mAb to IL-6, potential therapeutic strategies include inhibition', 'of nonsignaling IL-6R receptor alpha chain (gp80), which gives the IL-6 family members', 'their specificity, and the IL-6R signal-transducing subunit (gp130). The identification of the', 'optimum epitope to target on IL-6 (binding IL-6 in a region that is predicted to be involved', 'with gp80 or gp 130) was conducted using antibodies with similar affinities, but different', 'binding axes, as determined by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Antibodies directed', 'against mouse or human IL-6 that targeted the gp 130 axis were more potent than those that', 'targeted the gp80 axis in inhibiting IL-6-dependent phosphorylation of signal transducer and', 'activator of transcription 3 in in vitro cell-based assays and in inhibiting the secretion of the', 'acute phase protein SAA in vivo. Olokizumab binds to a region of IL-6 involved with', 'gp130 binding. The epitope recognized by OKZ was initially established by BIAcore and', 'confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Olokizumab has been shown to have a', 'high affinity for human IL-6 as determined using BIAcore analysis. In vitro whole blood and', 'cell line assays as well as animal studies have shown that OKZ potently neutralizes', 'IL-6-mediated effects in vitro and in vivo, respectively.
