{"prompt": "['1. INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND', 'Kenya is classified as having three main forms of malnutrition: overweight, anaemia and stunting', '[1], exhibiting a double burden of malnutrition nutritional landscape [2]. Indicators of overweight', 'and obesity, and diabetes in both adult men and women either show no progress or are worsening', \"when looking at trends from the 80's to present [3]. Iron and zinc, whose deficiencies (acute or\", 'chronic) manifest as iron deficiency anaemia and stunting are micronutrients of public health', 'concern in Kenya [4]. Type-2 diabetes is one of the priority non-communicable diseases (NCDs)', '[5] in Kenya with a prevalence of 5.8% and 6.2% in men and women [6].', 'Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes. It is a chronic metabolic disease', 'occurring when the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or when the body', 'cannot effectively utilize produced insulin, or both. Insulin regulates the amount of glucose in', 'blood and T2DM is characterized by hyperglycemia [7]. Diabetes due to its nature has an', 'inflammatory disease character, with higher inflammatory processes as a result of diseases', 'duration and glycemic control [8]. Iron homeostatsis is affected by hepcidin levels. Hepcidin levels', 'are abnormally high during inflammation, resulting in a decrease in iron uptake in the gut [9].', 'Investigators have observed positive associations between serum ferritin and blood glucose levels,', 'body mass index (BMI) and lipid profiles [11, 12]. This suggests that the incidence of anemia is', 'likely to increase in poorly controlled diabetes. Therefore, reducing blood glucose levels could', 'help reduce the risk of anemia in diabetic populations. Zinc is found in highest concentrations in', 'the pancreatic \u00df-cell in the human body [12]. Dysregulation of zinc is known to occur in both type', '1 and type 2 diabetes. However there is no conclusive evidence as to whether zinc deficiency', 'causes the diabetes or is merely a consequence of the disease [13]. Suggested potential beneficial', 'mechanisms of action of zinc among diabetes patients are its antioxidant role. Studies have', 'reported the association of high zinc levels with reduced oxidative stress (lowering lipid', 'peroxidation [14], chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and \u00df-cell loss [15]).', 'We conducted a baseline study during quarter 4, 2018 in Makueni County to study the double', 'burden of malnutrition at the individual level in T2DM (N=168). Preliminary reports from the', 'study show anaemia as present in 34.4% and 24.8% in men and women respectively. 142', 'participants had a random blood sugar of >8.5mmol/L. 72.2% of the participants were also', '6']['hypertensive (reported current use of hypertension medication). Diets consumed were', 'characterized by low sources of readily bioavailable iron and zinc. Diet quality is at the core of', 'both diabetes management and the double burden of malnutrition. From the daily consumption', 'data, we found the intake of both iron and zinc to be lower than their respective estimated average', 'requirement (EAR). Further considering the characteristic low bioavailability diet, improvements', 'in the quality of diets among this population is thus crucial.', 'This study aims to study the associated glucose, insulin and appetite responses associated with the', 'consumption of a novel common bean product. This product profiling is key to inform dietary', 'management of T2DM patients using this specific product.', '2. PROBLEM STATEMENT AND JUSTIFICATION', 'Problem Statement', 'Though prevalence of T2DM in Makueni County is unknown, a high number of diabetes-related', 'outpatient morbidity cases has been reported [16]. The double burden of malnutrition at the', 'individual level has hardly been little studied and is less well understood than the prevalence of', 'the double burden of malnutrition observed at country or household level.', 'Zinc is found in very high concentrations in pancreatic beta-cells [17]. Low zinc levels have been', 'reported elsewhere among diabetes patients as compared to non-diabetic patients [18].', 'Associations between dysregulation in zinc homeostasis and pancreatic beta-cell function has been', 'suggested [19]. Evidence is however still inconclusive as to whether zinc deficiency causes the', 'disease or is a consequence of the disease [15]. Studies suggest that inflammatory state associated', 'with obesity lead to alterations in iron homeostasis. However, work on iron metabolism during', 'inflammation has been focused on studies on obesity combined with anemia in women, or in', 'persons undergoing bariatric surgery [20, 21]. The metabolic basis and complications associated', 'with T2DM result in dysregulation in zinc, iron and copper homeostasis. Dietary management of', 'T2DM has concentrated on macronutrient consumption[22, 23].', 'Problem justification', 'Micronutrients are cofactors in \u00df-cell function, glucose metabolic pathways, and in insulin', 'signaling. Baseline data shows us inadequate mean daily zinc and iron intakes in a characteristic', 'low bioavailable diet. Additionally, presence of anaemia was >20% in T2DM patients in Makueni,', '7']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
