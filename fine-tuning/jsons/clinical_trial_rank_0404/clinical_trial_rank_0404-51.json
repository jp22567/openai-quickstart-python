Through investigation of PGx by technologies such as', 'genotyping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome-Wide Association Studies, the', \"relationship between gene profiles and a drug's kinetics, efficacy or toxicity may be better\", 'understood. As many diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic variations, PGx', 'research may identify which genes are involved in determining the way a subject may or may', 'not respond to a drug.', 'OBJECTIVES', 'The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is', 'exploratory.
