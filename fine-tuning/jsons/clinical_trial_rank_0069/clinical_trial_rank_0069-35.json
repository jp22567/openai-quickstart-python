Guidelines Regarding Proper a- and \u00df-Adrenergic Blockade', '-Adrenergic blockade should be started first, under the care of a hypertension specialist, to', 'normalize blood pressure and expand the contracted blood volume. On the second or third day of', '-adrenergic blockade, patients are encouraged to start a diet high in sodium content (>5,000 mg', 'daily) because of the catecholamine-induced volume contraction and the orthostasis associated', 'with a-adrenergic blockade. This degree of volume expansion may be contraindicated in patients', 'with congestive heart failure or renal insufficiency. After adequate a-adrenergic blockade has', 'been achieved (typically 5 to 7 days), -adrenergic blockade is initiated. The whole process', 'should take place at least 1-2 week prior to initiation of lenvatinib.', 'For -adrenergic blockade phenoxybenzamine is the preferred drug. The initial dosage is 10 mg', 'once or twice daily, and the dose is increased by 10 to 20 mg in divided doses every 2 to 3 days', 'as needed to control blood pressure. The final dosage of phenoxybenzamine is typically between', '20 and 100 mg daily. The patient should be warned about the orthostasis, nasal stuffiness, and', 'fatigue that occur in almost all patients.
