Since both', 'pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas arise from chromaffin cells they share', 'many common clinicopathologic characteristics and treatment strategies, and for', 'that reason they have historically been grouped and studied together.', 'Both pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare tumors. The prevalence', 'of adrenal pheochromocytomas is not precisely known and estimates range from', '1-2 per 100,000 patients to 1.9% depending on the method of detection (Beard,', 'Sheps et al. 1983; Stenstrom and Svardsudd 1986; Smythe, Edwards et al. 1992;', 'McNeil, Blok et al. 2000). In general 10% of pheochromocytomas are malignant', \"(Sinclair, Isles et al. 1987; Anderson, Blakeman et al. 1994; Goldstein, O'Neill et\", 'al. 1999; Omura, Saito et al. 2004).

Histopathologically, however, it is', 'impossible to distinguish benign from malignant pheochromocytomas or', 'paragangliomas - and the diagnosis of malignant disease relies solely on the', 'demonstration of tumors in non-chromaffin tissue (Eisenhofer, Bornstein et', 'al.', '2004; Tischler, Kimura et al. 2006).', '1.12', 'Presentation and clinical course', 'The presentation of malignant pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas depends', 'mainly on their location and their ability to secrete catecholamines.', 'Pheochromocytomas generally have longer overall survival than paragangliomas.', 'However, in patients with metastatic disease from either pheochromocytoma or', 'paraganglioma, the overall survival appears similar (Ayala-Ramirez, Feng et al.', '2011).', 'Adrenal or extra-adrenal tumors of the abdomen and thorax frequently secrete', 'catecholamines.
