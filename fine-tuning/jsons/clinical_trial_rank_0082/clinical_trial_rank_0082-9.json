In the United States alone, these wounds are estimated to affect between', '2.4 to 4.5 million patients. 1 Chronic wounds are typically classified as vascular ulcers', '(venous and arterial ulcers), diabetic ulcers, and pressure ulcers. As these wounds last on', 'average 12 to 13 months and recur in up to 60% to 70% of patients, they can lead not only to', 'a loss of function and a decreased quality of life, but also to an increase in morbidity.', 'Primarily a condition of the elderly, chronic wounds are becoming more prevalent as', 'populations age in developed countries and are associated with high treatment costs,', 'estimated at 2% to 3% of the healthcare budgets in these countries.\u00b2', 'The physiological process of wound healing progresses through 4 main phases: hemostasis,', 'inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.\u00b3 Immediately after an injury, vasoconstriction', 'and blood clotting occurs, preventing blood loss and providing a provisional matrix for cell', 'migration. Platelets secrete growth factors, and cytokines attract endothelial cells,', 'fibroblasts, and immune cells. The inflammation stage usually lasts up to 7 days, during', 'which time phagocytic cells are at work: neutrophils release reactive oxygen species and', 'proteases that prevent bacterial contamination and cleanse the wound of cellular debris, and', 'monocytes differentiate into tissue macrophages that remove bacteria and nonviable tissue', 'and release growth factors and cytokines. As blood vessels are repaired and immune cells', 'undergo apoptosis, the inflammation phase winds down and the proliferation phase begins.', 'During the proliferation phase, tissue granulation, angiogenesis, and epithelialization occur.', 'During the remodeling phase, which begins after the wound has closed and may last 1 to', '2 years or longer, the provisional matrix is remodeled into organized collagen bundles.\u00b3', 'Chronic wounds often stall in the inflammation phase. Although they may differ in etiology,', 'chronic wounds usually share some common features: elevated levels of proinflammatory', 'cytokines, proteases, reactive oxygen species, and senescent cells; persistent infection; and a', 'deficiency of stem cells and/or dysfunctional stem cells. Repeated tissue injury induces', 'platelet-derived factors to stimulate the constant influx of immune cells; thus, the', 'proinflammatory cytokine cascade becomes amplified and persists for a prolonged period,', 'leading to elevated levels of proteases. Eventually, protease levels exceed the levels of their', 'inhibitors, leading to the destruction of the extracellular matrix and the degradation of growth', 'factors and their receptors. The destruction of the matrix not only prevents a progression to', 'the proliferative phase, but also attracts more inflammatory cells, amplifying the', 'inflammation cycle. Similarly, elevated levels of reactive oxygen species also damage the', 'extracellular matrix, which stimulates proteases and inflammatory cytokines. This amplified', 'inflammation cycle, together with the deficiency of functional stem cells, results in a failure', 'to achieve complete re-epithelialization in tissue repair.3,4', 'In caring for chronic wounds, the concurrent management of both the underlying systemic', 'problem (e.g., diabetes, peripheral arterial disease) and the wound bed preparation', 'encourages the proper environment in which autolytic tissue repair can take place.
