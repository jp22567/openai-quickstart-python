Molluscum is common in the pediatric population and', 'is prevalent worldwide. It produces small flesh-colored papules and papulovesicles,', '1-4 mm in diameter, which typically have an umbilicated or dimpled center. There is', 'often little inflammation associated with molluscum papules, and the presence of an', 'inflammatory reaction to such papules often heralds resolution of the disease.', 'Molluscum lesions are generally not painful, but they may itch or become irritated.', 'Picking or scratching the bumps can lead to autoinoculation, secondary bacterial', 'infection or scarring.', 'Molluscum is spread readily by autoinoculation and by person-to-person contact. The', 'virus may also be transmitted by touching objects such as towels, clothing, or toys.', 'Most immunocompetent individuals will spontaneously clear the disease in an average', 'of 13 months, although 25% children still have the disease after 18 months. [3] Spread', 'to siblings and friends, as well as the development of additional lesions in neighboring', 'sites during this time causes parental langst, socialization challenges for the afflicted', 'individuals[1,2] and has been shown to negatively impact quality of life. [3] The highest', 'incidence is in children up to 14 years of age, where the incidence rate ranges from 12', 'to 14 episodes per 1000 children per year. [4]', 'There is no approved product by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the', 'treatment of molluscum. Given that there are no approved options, physicians employ', 'a variety of treatment approaches including (a) benign neglect; (b) curettage; (c)', 'cryotherapy; (d) expressing the molluscum bodies; (e) retinoic acid creams; (f) caustic', 'agents; (g) topical immunotherapeutics; and (h) non-standardized, compounded', 'cantharidin products of various purity, formulations, and strengths.', '1.2', 'CANTHARIDIN', 'Cantharidin (1,2-dimethyl-3,6-epoxyperhydrophthalic anhydride) is a lipophilic', 'natural compound that can be isolated from the body fluids of the blister beetle,', 'primarily of the family Meloidae. Blister beetles are found in many parts of the world,', 'including the southern United States and Asia (Mylabris Cichorii L and Mylabris', 'Page 17']['CONFIDENTIAL', 'Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.', 'VP-102', 'Clinical Protocol: VP-102-103', 'phalerata). Lytta vesicatoria, a metallic green beetle, was primarily used as a source', 'of cantharidin in the early 1900s, as it is endemic to the United States. Regardless of', 'species of blister beetle, the structure of the cantharidin molecule is maintained with', 'only variations in the quantity of compound that can be readily isolated. The Mylabris', 'species of beetle contains a much greater concentration of cantharidin and is the', 'primary type of beetle used in modern cantharidin preparations.', 'Cantharidin functions as a vesicant, weakening desmosomes in the epidermis when', 'applied topically via a liquid film-forming formulation. Application to the skin causes', 'the release of neutral serine proteases resulting in the destruction of intercellular', 'desmosomes responsible for holding the layers of the skin together. [5] Intracellular', 'tonofilaments are also weakened, the result being a fluid-filled, thin-walled epidermal', \"vesicle. The superficial nature of the blisters is attributed to cantharidin's lesser effect\", 'on hemidesmosomes in the basal layer compared to the more superficial desmosomes.', 'In almost all patients, this process does not cause a scar, as the underlying dermal layer', 'of skin is undamaged. Cantharidin has no known direct antiviral effects.', 'Many physicians prefer cantharidin to other therapies for the treatment of molluscum', 'such as cryotherapy, curettage or pricking individual lesions with subsequent', 'expression of molluscum bodies because it is painless upon application, requires only', 'limited treatment cycles for significant lesion reduction or complete resolution and is', \"well-tolerated by patients, most of whom are children. Further, cantharidin's long\", 'history of use has provided strong evidence of its safety when applied topically.', 'Although cantharidin has been used extensively for decades in the treatment of several', 'dermatologic conditions including molluscum and verruca vulgaris, specifications for', 'the quality of active pharmaceutical ingredient or a standardized formulation have', 'never been established. Furthermore, a lack of reliable and regulated vendors of the', 'compounded drug increases the chance of the drug product being inappropriately', 'prepared, tested, stored or applied, which in turn increases the potential for unintended', 'or even dangerous consequences in the future. Most currently used cantharidin', 'preparations are prepared as 0.7% w/v (weight/volume) solutions in an acetone solvent', 'with a flexible-collodion base in a screw-top glass bottle at volumes intended for', 'repeated use across multiple patients by the medical professional. This type of', 'container closure system paired with highly volatile formulations presents multiple', 'challenges.
