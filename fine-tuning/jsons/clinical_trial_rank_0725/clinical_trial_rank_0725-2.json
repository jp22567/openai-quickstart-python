Concussions can result in a variety of long-term', 'cognitive, psychological, and physical symptoms. Self-reported memory and attention', 'complaints are the most common cognitive effects and may persist for several years post-injury4', '6', 'It has also been reported that in 75% of all sports-related concussions, athletes experience', 'reduced balance and symptoms of dizziness7.
