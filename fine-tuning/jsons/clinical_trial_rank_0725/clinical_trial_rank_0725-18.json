The name of this study is \"A Multi-', 'modal Evaluation of a Physical Intervention Approach to Treating Persistent Post-Concussive', 'Symptoms\". Please keep in mind that this is an invitation, and by no means are you required to', 'participate. This study has been funded through the Northern Ontario Academic Medical', 'Association (NOAMA) through their Clinical Innovation Opportunities Fund. We have asked', 'you to participate because you have been referred by Dr. Wark, are currently experiencing', 'persistent post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and it has been two weeks to six months since the', 'date of injury, are 18-50 years of age, free of any psychological/neurological disorder, no history', 'of substance abuse, are not currently undergoing therapy or counselling for depression, and have', 'a valid drivers license.', 'We are a group of researchers and doctors from the Northern Ontario School of Medicine', '(NOSM) and Lakehead University. The research team includes Dr. Sheryl Wark, Dr. Simon', 'Lees, Dr. Paolo Sanzo, Dr. Jane Lawrence-Dewar, Dr. Carlos Zerpa, and Dr. Michael Wesner.', '42']['RP-506-07112017', 'V 1.5: November 30th, 2018', 'What is the usual treatment?', 'Treatment of concussions usually involves complete physical and mental rest until', 'symptoms are no longer present. In many people, symptoms of a concussion can resolve in 7-10', 'days. In a minority of people, these symptoms can last longer than 7-10 days and may last', 'months or years. In persons who experience long term symptoms, some studies have shown that', 'mental and physical rest may not be beneficial.', 'Why is this study being done?', 'Persons with PCS may experience difficulties completing day to day tasks, such as', 'driving, concentrating, or exercising. This reduces a person quality of life and puts a strain on the', 'healthcare system. The goal of the research study is to determine the effectiveness of an aerobic', 'exercise therapy (AET) on PCS, which will include mild aerobic and balance training. An AET', 'program has previously been studied for the treatment of PCS, and results have been promising.', 'If you are participating, you will complete a few initial assessments over the course of one week.', 'These assessments include a computerized concussion test, balance test, reaction test, driving', 'test, and a saliva test. Following completion of the assessments, you will complete either an AET', 'or standard of care (SC) intervention for eight weeks. After eight weeks you will repeat the', 'assessments.', 'If you would like to participate in this study, an appointment will be set up between you', 'and a member of the research team at Lakehead University. The purpose of this appointment will', 'be to inform you of your rights as a participant and fill out an informed consent form. Over the', 'course of the whole study, you will be asked to participate in up to eight assessment visits, four', 'at the beginning, four at the end (described below), including a computerized concussion test,', 'simple balance test, reaction tests, and driving simulation. Your saliva will also be collected at', 'some point during this week as well. If you are in the AET group, you will also be asked to', 'participate in 24 training visits, described below. Additionally, you will be given an activity', 'monitor to be worn on your wrist for the duration of the study.', 'The ImPACT computerized concussion test and simple balance test will be conducted at', 'the Sanders building, Lakehead University. For the ImPACT test, you will be seated at a', 'computer station, where you will follow on screen instructions designed to evaluate mental', 'functioning. The balance test will involve single and double leg stances, with and without your', 'eyes closed. The balance test will be performed on a force platform, which will measure how', 'much your center of mass and center of pressure moves, as well as the speed at which they move.', 'The entire session should last approximately one hour', 'For the brain imaging, you will meet a member of the research team at the Sanders', \"building, Lakehead University, where you will be escorted to Dr. Michael Wesner's Vision\", 'Laboratory at Lakehead University. Here, you will complete two computer-based reaction tasks', 'while wearing a specialized head cap. This cap will allow us to measure brain activity non-', 'invasively during tasks. In order for the recording electrodes to monitor brain activity, we will', 'place electrode gel at each recording location. The gel may feel slimy and cool at first.
