The AMTI force platform measures the', 'ground reaction forces that are generated by a body standing or moving across the plate. The', 'AMTI force plate is also capable of measuring torques about each axis and has six degrees of', 'freedom, which includes three forces (fz, fx, and fy) and three moments (Mz, Mx, and My). All of', 'these measures are fed into an AMTI amplifier and converted to digital signals via an analog to', 'digital converter. The information collected by the force platform is then uploaded into', 'BIOSOFT computer software which allows the researcher to view and analyze data following', 'collection. The BIOSOFT computer software calculates the X and y moments of postural sway', 'which are used to compute the variables of interest and produces graphical representations of this', 'data. Descriptive statistics will be calculated to provide the mean and standard deviations for the', 'variables of interest including the area of the centre of pressure, velocity of centre of pressure,', 'length of centre of pressure, and displacement of centre of pressure. The main objective of the', 'analysis is to compare pre- and post-treatment changes in balance. The ImPACT', 'measures components of cognitive functioning including: attention, concentration, reaction time,', 'memory, processing speed, decision making, problem solving, and response variability. The', 'main objective of this component of the analysis will be to compare pre-and post-treatment', 'changes in composite scores for the variables described.', 'Dr. Carlos Zerpa will perform the analysis on the data collected from the driving simulator.
