{"prompt": "['Describe safety findings and statistical rules that would temporarily suspend enrollment', 'and/or study intervention until a safety review is convened (either routine or ad hoc) to', 'determine whether the study should continue per protocol, proceed with caution, be', 'further investigated, be discontinued, or be modified and then proceed.', 'Examples of. findings that might trigger a safety review are the number of SAEs overall,', 'the number of occurrences of a particular type of SAE, severe AEs/reactions, or', 'increased frequency of events. Such findings are presented to the study statistician or to', 'the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) statistician to review the events by group', 'to determine whether there are statistical as well as clinical concerns. The statistician', 'reports his findings to a closed session of the DSMB or to the Safety Officer and/or NIA.', 'The findings are used to determine what steps will be taken.', '9.4', 'Outcomes', 'Discuss how the outcomes will be analyzed.

The pilot outcomes, methods for measurement, and timing of', 'measurement are outlined in Table 2 (page 40).', '1) Outcome: Rates of enrollment and percentage of eligible patients enrolled', 'a. Measurement: Each week, research assistants will compile running counts of', 'patients who are screened, found eligible, and enrolled. Reasons for non-', 'enrollment will be recorded. The measured outcomes will also be placed in', 'graphical format to plot a comparison of expected versus actual rates for', 'eligibility and enrollment.', 'b. Timing: The reports of numerical and graphical values will be reviewed', 'every other week at our videoconference (Teams) team meeting that will', 'include both study sites.', '2) Outcome: Proportion of participants completing all study visits', 'a. Measurement: Research assistants will maintain running counts of', 'participants who complete each study visit. We will evaluate rates of', 'completing (attending) each study visit and calculate the final proportion of', 'patients who complete all visits. This will be presented to the study team in', 'numerical and graphical format', 'b. Timing: Reports will be reviewed at each every other week study team', 'meeting.', '3) Outcome: Proportion of missing data', 'a. Measurement: For each visit, every study instrument will be entered into our', 'electronic database and missing items will have a separate code number (-', 'Protocol Template, Version 2.0', '39']['99) to facilitate easy counting of missing items VS total items to complete.', 'Research assistants will generate a report showing overall percentage of', 'missing data (number of missing items/current number of possible items for', 'each patient) and the percent of missing data for each patient.', 'b. Timing: Each bi-weekly team meeting will involve a review of missing data', 'at the overall study and patient level.', '4) Outcome: Time to complete study evaluations and instruments', 'a. Measurement: Research assistants will time participants while completing', 'each study research form and will also time the entire encounter at each', 'study visit.', 'b. Timing: Data will be collected at each visit and will be reviewed by the', 'study team at the last team meeting of each month to establish reasonably', 'stable estimates of time.', '5) Outcome: Participant satisfaction with study procedures and instruments', 'a.', 'Measurement: At each visit, after completing all other study forms and', 'procedures, participants will be asked to complete a brief 10-item Likert-', 'type score to measure overall satisfaction with the study visit and a similar', 'item assessing satisfaction with the time burden of the instruments.', 'Additionally, we will conduct a brief interview with open-ended questions at', 'the end of each visit asking patients to provide any feedback on the study', 'procedures or instruments. These will not be recorded but field notes by the', 'research assistant will be taken.', 'b. Timing: Assessments will occur at each study visit and will be reviewed at', 'the last team meeting of each month.', '6) Outcome: Whether survey instruments can be eliminated due to redundancy', 'a. Measurement: To determine whether we can reduce the survey burden by', 'eliminating redundant measures, we will employ methods outlined by', 'Harrell for data reduction. 22 Each survey instrument will be evaluated as the', 'dependent variable in a separate linear regression with the scores of all other', 'instruments used as predictors, along with demographic information. The', 'adjusted R\u00b2 (explained variance) for each regression will be estimated. Any', 'instrument where the R\u00b2 exceeds 40% will be eliminated based on the idea', 'that little additional information is provided by including that instrument (i.e.', 'the other surveys explain a substantial portion of the information contained', 'within that instrument).', 'b. Timing: We will assess survey redundancy once 25% of planned enrollment', 'is achieved and we will measure again at 75% enrollment. This will provide', 'reasonable data stability for estimation and also provide time for us to test', 'study procedures after eliminating any instruments that are found to be', 'redundant.', '7) Outcome: Estimating sample size for fully powered trial', 'a. Measurement: For continuous variables, we will estimate means and', 'standard deviations. For categorical variables, we will estimate proportions', 'and 95% confidence intervals.', 'b.
