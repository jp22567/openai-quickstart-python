Trail Making Tests Parts A and B: The Trail Making Test is one of', 'the most popular neuropsychological tests for detecting processing', 'speed, attention, and visual scanning. 28 Part A requires participants to', 'draw a line between circles containing numbers, and the circles must', 'be connected in numerical order.

Any patient with an allergic reaction will also be', 'admitted for 24 hour observation that includes monitoring of vital', 'signs, and blood pressure support with intravenous fluids.

Spermatic cord injury or orchitis: during surgical repair, the', 'spermatic cord (including vas deferens, spermatic artery, venous', 'plexus) are mobilized away from the hernia sac.
