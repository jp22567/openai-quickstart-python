Clinical manifestations of', 'psoriasis can be of multiple forms, including, among others, plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis,', 'palmoplantar psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis (Lebwohl, 2018). Psoriasis is characterized by an', 'abnormal keratinocyte proliferation in the interfollicular epidermis along with an infiltration', 'of antigen-presenting cells and release of pro inflammatory cytokines, leading to a local', 'inflammation (ppagunta et al., 2016; Lowes et al., 2007). The aetiology of the disease is not', 'fully understood, but a number of risk factors are recognized, including family history and', 'environmental risk factors, such as smoking, stress, obesity, and alcohol consumption (Huerta', 'et al., 2007). The prevalence of psoriasis is difficult to evaluate with precision but is estimated', 'around 2-4% in western countries (Gelfand et al., 2005; Kurd and Gelfand, 2009; Stern et al.,', '2004). In France, the prevalence of psoriasis is estimated to 4,4 % (Richard et al., 2018).', \"Psoriasis causes considerable psychosocial disability and has a major impact on patients'\", 'quality of life (Krueger et al., 2001).', 'The severity of psoriasis can be influenced by a great variety of factors including extent of the', 'disease, inflammation, lesions location and impact on quality of life.

Indeed, a multinational study has already shown', \"that a discrepancy exists between the physician's assessment of the disease severity and the\", \"patient's (van de Kerkhof et al., 2015). This could be, at least partially, explained by the use of\", 'standardized tools, by the physician which not necessarily take into consideration the patients', 'therapeutic expectation which could sometimes be a subjective parameter. (van de Kerkhof', 'et al., 2015). Currently, the higher efficacy observed with new biologics means that PASI 90 or', 'even PASI 100 response are increasingly being considered as a new treatment goal (Daud\u00e9n et', 'al., 2016; Kerdel and Zaiac, 2015; Lebwohl et al., 2015). However, other quality of life aspects', 'of chronic affections such as psoriasis that are not being assessed by tools like the PASI, must', 'not be overlooked Multiple patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaires are available to', \"evaluate the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life. Among the available PROs, the\", 'Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is the most frequently used (Puig et al., 2017). It is', 'composed of ten questions grouped in 6 domains \"symptoms and feelings\", \"daily activities\",', '\"leisure\", \"work/school\", \"personal relationships\" and \"treatment\". Each answer is graded', 'from 0 to 3. The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a', 'maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.', \"A score higher than 10 indicates that the patient's life is being severely affected by their skin\", 'disease (Finlay and Khan, 1994). However, the DLQI is a standardized tool which missing', 'potentially some quality of life specific issues for psoriasis patient. Consequently, among', 'patients, some cannot seem to completely restore a normal quality of life (DLQI 0-1) even', 'though they reached a perfect PASI score (100). This phenomenon may be explained by the', \"fact that the patient's own perception can be different from the physician's perspective and\", 'may have changed between follow-ups. Although, the Patient Benefit Index has been devised', 'to allow the patient to weigh the therapeutic goals in order to define which ones are the most', 'important for him/her (using a 4 points Likert Scale, (Augustin et al., 2008)), it is not', \"discriminatory enough towards the patient's principal expectation (Feuerhahn et al., 2012).\", 'In addition, it is widely recognized that alexithymia (difficulty to express emotion) is more', 'prevalent in the psoriasis patients than in the general population and psoriasis patients with', 'alexithymia appear to suffer higher psoriasis burden as they have more difficulties to express', 'their expectations (Sampogna et al., 2017).
