{"prompt": "['MitraClip NT System', 'Clinical Investigation Plan Version: 1.0', 'Abbott', 'The Steerable Guide Catheter', 'The Steerable Guide Catheter consists of a hydrophilic-coated multi-lumen shaft, a radiopaque distal tip ring,', 'an atraumatic distal soft tip, and hemostasis valve located at the distal end of the handle. The Steerable', 'Guide Catheter is steered and actuated by the use of a control knob located on the handle. Four lumens', 'spaced within the catheter shaft wall provide conduits for cables which transmit tension to the distal tip when', 'the control knob (+/-) is turned on the handle. The Steerable Guide Catheter and Dilator are designated for', 'professional use only.', 'The hemostasis valve is designed to accommodate the dilator and subsequent use of the MitraClip NT Clip', 'Delivery System (CDS). The hemostasis valve minimizes or prevents blood backflow through the catheter', 'thru-lumen as well as minimizes the risk of air introduction into the vasculature. An alignment marker is placed', 'on the hemostasis valve to aid in the proper insertion of the CDS into the Guide. The flush port is a standard', 'female luer fitting that allows for aspiration of air and infusion of liquids into the thru-lumen of the Guide.', 'The Dilator consists of a single lumen extrusion secured to a standard rotating hemostasis valve. The dilator', 'has an echogenic tapered distal tip with a molded spiral groove. The Dilator is used for the introduction of', 'the Guide into the femoral vein and left atrium.', 'Page 21 from 61']['MitraClip NT System', 'Clinical Investigation Plan Version: 1.0', 'Abbott', 'Figure 6 - Steerable Guide Catheter and Dilator', 'Silicone Plate is used in a sterile field.
