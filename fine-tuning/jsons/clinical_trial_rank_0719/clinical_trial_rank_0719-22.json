TED is divided by severity into\", 'mild, moderate, and severe disease, with moderate-to-severe disease representing 25-50% of', 'cases [Bartley, 1994; Noth et al, 2001; Tanda et al, 2013]. In terms of time course, TED can be', 'considered as 2 distinct conditions: \"active TED,\\' which is an autoimmune inflammatory', 'response targeting orbital soft tissues; and \"inactive TED,\" which is the name given to the', 'expanded and fibrotic tissues that are the sequelae of the active disease. Active TED typically', 'lasts 1 to 3 years, and then the inflammation spontaneously subsides to leave the permanent', 'pathology of inactive TED [Burch et al, 1993].', 'The annual incidence rate of TED in the US has been estimated to be 16 cases per 100,000', 'people for women and 2.9 cases per 100,000 people for men [Bartley, 1994]. The incidence', 'appears to be comparable in Europe [Abraham-Nordling et al, 2011; Mostbeck et al, 1998; Noth', 'et al, 2001; Tanda et al, 2013]. Patients aged between 30 and 50 years are most frequently', 'affected, with severe cases more frequent in those older than 50 years [Dickinson, 2010]. The', 'occurrence and severity of TED is associated with smoking [Prummel et al, 1993].', 'A mounting body of evidence in the scientific literature indicates that the pathophysiology of', 'active TED involves the autoimmune activation and proliferation of orbital fibroblasts [Bahn,', '2010; Boschi et al, 2005; Smith, 2010]. The activation of fibroblasts triggers release of', 'inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of immune cells into orbital soft tissues (muscle, interstitial', 'and adipose), excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix, and tissue expansion and remodeling', '(ibid). Clinical features of moderate-to-severe TED include orbital pain, swelling, dry eye,', 'redness and discomfort of the lids and ocular surface, thickening and retraction of the eyelids,', 'and proptosis (exophthalmos) due to the expansion of tissue behind the eye [Bahn, 2010; Burch', 'et al, 1993; Dickinson, 2010; Mallika et al, 2009].', 'In its moderate-to-severe form, TED has high morbidity [Bartalena et al, 2008; Bartley, 1994;', 'Dickinson, 2010; Gerding et al, 1997]. Morbidity takes the form of orbital pain, together with a', 'number of serious, sight-threatening conditions, including diplopia (due to inability to correctly', 'align the eyes), corneal ulceration (due to inability to close lids), and dysthyroid optic neuropathy', '(due to proptosis, tissue crowding, and stress on the optic nerve). These combine to produce', 'marked reductions in quality of life (QoL) (e.g., physical functioning, role functioning, social', 'functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain) [Gerding et al, 1997; C. Terwee et al,', '2002]. TED can also produce profound psychosocial problems, in particular anxiety and', 'depression, due to the alarming and disfiguring changes in appearance [Bartley et al, 1996;', 'Coulter et al, 2007; G.
