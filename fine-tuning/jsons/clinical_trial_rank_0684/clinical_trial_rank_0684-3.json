{"prompt": "['3.2 Potential Interventions to address Behavioral Symptoms in Younger Breast Cancer Survivors', 'Despite the increased behavioral symptoms reported by younger BCS, few psychosocial interventions have', 'specifically targeted this vulnerable age group. 11-13 In a focus group study with 36 younger BCS conducted', 'by', \"Partridge's\", 'group,', '14 participating women reported feeling different from older women, especially with', 'regard to relationships, fertility, menopausal symptoms, treatment side effects, and work/financial issues.', 'They also reported facing unique challenges (e.g. partner relationships, dating, infertility, concerns about', 'their young children, work and finances), and noted substantial difficulties transitioning into the', 'survivorship phase of care. Finally, younger BCS reported desiring assistance, including connecting with', 'other', 'young patients, help navigating the healthcare system, tailored educational materials, and referrals to', 'appropriate counselors. 14 These findings document the desire for intervention among younger women and', 'provide some direction with regard to how to address the emotional and physical needs of this group.', 'In', 'a', '2012', 'systematic review,3 we identified only three published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that', 'specifically targeted younger women with breast cancer.

A third study targeted younger', 'survivors', 'who', 'were 5 years post-diagnosis and provided education-based workshops delivered in 3', 'monthly sessions. 15 This intervention led to improvements in breast-cancer related knowledge and physical', 'activity, though effects on quality of life and symptoms were not assessed. In the broader literature,', 'psychoeducational interventions have been recommended for addressing depressive symptoms and fatigue', 'in cancer patients and survivors. 16,17 These studies provide preliminary evidence that psychoeducational', 'approaches may be helpful to younger BCS during treatment and into the survivorship period.
