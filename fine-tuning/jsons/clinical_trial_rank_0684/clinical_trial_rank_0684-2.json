BACKGROUND', '3.1', 'Younger Breast Cancer Survivors are a Vulnerable Population', 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer in younger women (< 50 years), with 1 in 53 women in this age', 'group developing breast cancer. Breast cancer is also the most common cause of cancer death for younger', 'women. 1 However, with advances in detection and treatment, the number of women who survive breast', 'cancer has increased significantly, with five-year survival rates approaching 90%, resulting in an estimated', '3 million North American women surviving long-term.\u00b2 As survival times increase, addressing the impact', 'of breast cancer and its treatments on long-term outcomes has become increasingly important, especially', 'for younger women who make up approximately 25% of breast cancer cases. These young women can', 'expect several decades of survival after breast cancer treatment ends; however, they are at high risk for', 'adverse psychological and physical problems that can negatively impact the quality and potentially, the', 'length of their survivorship. Indeed, younger women are at elevated risk for breast cancer recurrence and', 'cancer-specific mortality, as well as secondary cancers, premature menopause, osteoporosis, and cognitive', 'declines.', 'Studies have consistently shown that younger women have greater psychological morbidity after breast', 'cancer than older women and age-matched women with no cancer history, including elevated levels of', 'depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived stress.3,4 Younger breast cancer survivors experience greater', 'impact from cancer, perceive cancer as more threatening\u00b3 and report greater fear of recurrence.
