The phosphorylated STAT proteins are in turn translocated to the', 'nucleus where they initiate transcription leading to promotion of growth and activation of a', 'variety of cells. The JAK family is thus essential for cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of', 'various diseases with an immune-inflammatory component to exhibit their physiological', 'activity.
