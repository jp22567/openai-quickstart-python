Summarize the proposed changes to the protocol in lay terms (including details of ALL', 'changes proposed AND modify all relevant protocol sections and attachments accordingly).', 'By way of a brief reminder, subjects in the current study include two mental health care', 'stakeholder groups: (1) therapists affiliated with Psychological and Behavioral Health', 'Consultants (PsycBC) who are providing outpatient psychotherapy, and (2) adult patients', 'receiving psychotherapy (for varied mental health complaints) from the participating PsycBC', 'therapists. PsycBC is a formal subcontract to UMass on this project, and their role on this', 'project is restricted to providing the research team access to these two subject populations,', \"and assisting the team in recruitment. Thus, PsycBC is not engaged in human subjects' research.\", 'The amendment proposed here deals solely with patient recruitment procedures. There are no', 'changes to the research protocol itself.', 'Specifically, we are behind in our recruitment milestones, and our funder, PCORI, has asked us', 'to consider strategies for increasing recruitment. In response, and internal to their business,', 'PsycBC has provided additional resources to help boost recruitment. For example, they have', 'devoted more intake staff to accept calls and to pitch the study via our verbal recruitment', 'scripts. We initially rolled out the recruitment via just one of several intake call lines in order to', 'work closely with just one PsycBC staff member. This, however, limited the number of potential', 'patients to be recruited during a given day; opening up multiple lines for recruitment should', 'help increase our numbers. PsycBC has also implemented a financial bonus for the intake', \"worker who successfully recruits the most patients. We appreciate PsycBC's active role in\", 'attempting to bump recruitment; however, our PCORI Program Officer is concerned that these', 'internal resources changes might not be sufficient on their own. Hence the present proposed', 'amendment.', 'For context, at present, more PsycBC patients than we anticipated simply decline to learn more', 'about the study during their initial intake call, presumably because they are eager to be']['73', 'assigned to a clinician immediately on that initial call vs. going to a website to read about the', 'study, to consent, to complete baseline measures, and then to return to a second intake call to', 'be assigned to their clinician. Although we have successfully recruited 40 patients at present,', 'with data to support that people are generally willing to participate if they agree to access the', 'study information/consent form, we need to increase the number of people agreeing to access', 'our online study consent form in order to catch up to our recruitment milestone projections', '(currently set at 66 patients recruited by March 1, and 112 by April 15).', 'The proposed strategy, which was recommended by our Program Officer, is to provide a', 'monetary incentive for patients to agree to review our study materials online vs. declining', 'outright on the initial intake call. PCORI has worked with research teams in the past who have', 'used this strategy to successful effect, and they are willing to help us re-work our budget if the', 'IRB approves this recruitment incentive. Our rationale is that a small monetary incentive may', 'have a big impact in getting people to agree to pause momentarily their intake process to learn', 'about, and consent to, our study (as noted, once patients get to the consent form, they often', 'agree to participate). Given that reading the consent form takes several minutes, and that the', 'person has to be willing to have their intake process span two different calls (which can delay', 'by minutes to hours their assignment to a PsycBC therapist), we think that it is reasonable to', 'compensate potential participants $15 for this time added to the intake process. As noted,', 'because this money is tied to recruitment only, not participation, it is squarely a recruitment', 'incentive, not a participant compensation/paymen (for which a compensation schedule', 'already exists in the current protocol). Although PCORI originally suggested offering $25, as did', 'our DSMB and Advisory Board when consulting them about our recruitment issue, we feel that', 'this might end up being a disincentive to actually participate (i.e., a person may be content with', 'earning $25 simply to read a consent form, but then say \"no thanks\" to participating). Instead,', 'we think that offering enough to be an incentive, but an amount that is more proportional to', 'the time ask and to the compensation being offered for engaging in the full study protocol (i.e.,', '$50), is likely to be more effective.', 'In sum, we are asking for approval to offer a $15 recruitment incentive to access our study', 'consent form. We are also increasing the upper age limit of patients from 65-70. As the', 'literature does not demarcate older adulthood at 65, this change is very minor, but might allow', 'us to recruit a few extra patients who are interested in participating. There are no new', 'attachments or other revisions to the study protocol language for this proposed amendment,', 'and this recruitment incentive incurs no additional risk to potential participants.', '2. Indicate Level of Risk involved with the changes proposed.', 'No change.', '3.
