The risk associated with such reactions will be addressed', 'clinically by the therapists who are treating these issues and who have peer and', 'administrative support. To reiterate, these treatment risks would occur in the course', 'of treatment-as-usual. These are not additional risks stemming from the research', 'protocol. Further, the TOP outcome monitoring system, which is at the center of our', 'research project, is already being used by PsycBC providers without incident.', 'As is typical in psychological research, some of the assessment questions from the', 'research measures may be experienced as intrusive and/or may cause anxiety. The', 'risk from such increased anxiety, however, is mitigated by the use of skilled and', 'extensively trained assessors who are aware that such reactions may be related to a', \"person's presenting problems, or simply a function of the intimate and emotionally\", 'intense nature of psychological services. In addition, the Pls, PCs, and/or PsycBC', 'staff and administrators will be available to meet with any participant who may be', 'unduly disturbed due to the few research tasks. Because the pre- and posttreatment', 'diagnostic interviews will be conducted via telephone, the graduate RA (being', 'trained as a clinician and supervised by their site PI, Dr. Constantino or Boswell, both', 'of whom are licensed clinical psychologists and mental health care providers) will', \"have the patient's contact information (phone number and email address) on hand.\", 'If the patient reveals clinically elevated suicidality or homicidality, the RA will', \"contact 9-1-1 and report the patient's contact information and location address\", '(which they will request verbally, if necessary) for emergency response.
