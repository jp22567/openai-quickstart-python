Summary of the 2nd formal modification to the PCORI contract (September 2018), and the', 'full revised study protocol (2nd revision) submitted to, and approved by, the University of', 'Massachusetts Amherst Institutional Review Board (March 2018)', 'CONTRACT MODIFICATION SUMMARY', 'On September 14, 2018, PCORI approved the 2nd contract modification (IHS-1503-28573', 'Modification 002), which included the following changes - all in the service of boosting patient', 'recruitment and retention:', 'We increased the number of PsycBC telephone intake specialists who were trained to', 'recruit and assign study patients. This increased the number of potential patients who', 'could be recruited to the study on any given day.', 'We revised the language of the study script/pitch that the PsycBC telephone intake', 'specialists used to recruit patients. This revision better emphasized how completing a', 'routine outcome measure was already standard practice at PsycBC, and how completing', \"such a measure at intake could improve a patient's quality of care through personalized\", 'matching to providers. This immediately normalized the measurement process as part', 'of usual care, and it highlighted personalized care over participant burden. In fact, the', 'entire first part of the recruitment pitch had to do with clinical care; the introduction of', 'the study came after, and it was billed as an opportunity to be part of an ongoing', 'project on this personalized care notion and to earn financial compensation for doing', 'so.', 'PsycBC began offering periodic incentives (in the form of a payment bonus or tickets to', 'local events) to the intake specialist who successfully directed the most patients to our', 'online study consent form in a given period of time (e.g., a 1-week competition). This', 'bonus was completely unrelated to the project budget; it was a motivational strategy', 'within their own payroll system.', 'We started offering a $15 recruitment incentive. This compensation incentivized', \"patients' willingness to leave the initial intake call to review the study consent form. We\", 'felt that this would be useful given that a high percentage of people were enrolling if', 'they reviewed the materials. However, getting potential participants to agree to review', 'the form was an early challenge.', 'We eliminated the diagnostic interview calls (using the M.I.N.I.), as these assessments', 'were providing little yield and may have been perceived as off-putting and burdensome.', 'In practice, many early patients who enrolled in the study were failing to keep their', 'baseline telephone assessment appointment with our research assistants. Although we', 'regularly followed up to reschedule, we feared that these potentially burdensome', 'assessments were posing a risk to retention. Moreover, even if it was not leading to a', 'patient dropping out of the study, many enrolled patients were completing all']['71', 'assessments other than the M.I.N.I., which was resulting in missing data regardless. We', 'also wondered whether when people read the consent form and saw that we were', 'asking them to engage in two 30-minute phone calls in addition to completing', 'measures, this may have deterred them from enrolling. Thus, given the limited yield (at', 'best) and overt disruption (at worst) of the diagnostic interview, we dropped it from our', 'protocol. Fortunately, the data were never intended to be primary, and we could still', 'characterize our sample with the TOP data (our primary match and outcome measure).', \"Further, the diagnostic assessments were not included in PsycBC's standard intake\", 'process (as they were with our former clinical partner). Thus, using them actually', 'rendered our study less naturalistic vis-\u00e0-vis the system that we were trying to', 'affect/improve with our intervention.', 'PsycBC hired a full-time employee whose sole job description was to recruit patients to', 'the trial.', 'Our PsycBC collaborator, Tom Swales, who holds a significant amount of regional', 'credibility, agreed to liaise with community physicians to market the study, which they', 'could then mention to their patients prior to them contacting PsycBC. We suspected', 'that the more patients were in the know about the project prior to calling or arriving for', 'care, the more likely they would agree to take part vs. view it as an unexpected', 'inconvenience.', \"We posted a special announcement about the study on PsycBC's website, with the idea\", 'that it might predispose patients to participate if they read about the potential personal', 'benefits before the intake call.', 'We raised the upper age limit of study-eligible patients to 70 instead of 65. The', 'literature does not demarcate older adulthood at 65, so we felt that raising the age', 'would have no untoward effect on response to treatment.', 'We continued to monitor PsycBC therapists who were not enrolled in the study, but', 'now had the requisite number of baseline cases with TOP data for which we could', 'establish a baseline report card. This would allow us to recruit from this pool if there', 'was employment turnover from study-enrolled clinicians, or if other strategic needs', 'arose (e.g., if having more therapists at a particular site could also positively affect', 'patient recruitment and retention).', \"The project's milestone schedule was unrevised for this contract modification.\", 'For this modification, the only major changes to the protocol included the recruitment', 'incentive and increase in the upper patient age limit, which our funder, PCORI, had already', 'suggested and verbally approved in March 2018. Thus, at that time, we submitted the following', '2nd (and minor) revision of our study protocol to the UMass IRB, which was approved in March']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
