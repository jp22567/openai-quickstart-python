Describe past findings leading to the formulation of the study.', 'Research has consistently identified significant variability in skill and outcomes', 'between therapists (Baldwin & Imel, 2013; Boswell et al., 2013; Westra,', 'Constantino, Arkowitz, & Dozois, 2011), even when therapists utilize an empirically', 'supported treatment (EST). In fact, differences between treatment providers', 'account for a greater portion of treatment outcome variance than the specific', 'interventions delivered in controlled trials (Krause, Lutz, & Saunders, 2007;', 'Wampold & Imel, 2015). Thus, improvements in MHC can occur by identifying', 'effective providers in addition to promoting ESTs (Kraus et al., 2007).', \"In the largest study to date on this topic, our team investigated therapists'\", 'naturalistic treatment outcomes over many different problem domains (e.g.,', 'depression, anxiety, substance use, mania, sleep) in a sample of 6,960 patients and', 'nearly 700 providers (Kraus, Castonguay, Boswell, Nordberg, & Hayes, 2011). The', 'majority of therapists demonstrated a differential pattern of effectiveness']['89', 'depending on the problem domain, and therapist domain-specific effectiveness', 'correlated poorly across domains suggesting that therapist competencies may be', 'domain-specific, rather than reflecting a core attribute or general underlying', 'therapeutic skill. Importantly, although some therapists demonstrated effectiveness', 'over multiple problem domains, no therapists demonstrated reliable effectiveness', 'across all domains. Further, a small, but notable 4% of the therapists did not', 'demonstrate effective outcomes on any domain. These data suggest that in any', 'population of therapists (payer network, hospital, or community mental health', 'system), there is an opportunity for behavioral health to do what medicine did', 'decades ago - encourage provider specialization. Virtually every clinician has an area', 'where they are above average (82-96%; Kraus et al., 2011, 2016), and our research', 'suggests that if they specialize to their unique skills, population-level outcomes (i.e.,', 'symptom reduction, behavior change, increased functionality) will improve', 'dramatically. This would reflect a major, and likely highly impactful shift to current', 'MHC systems.', 'However, patients and referrers are typically unaware of the unique track record', '(\"report cards\") of local-area providers, which represents a critical gap in knowledge', 'transfer within the MHC system. Without systematically collecting and disseminating', 'performance report cards, stakeholders (e.g., patients, therapists, administrators', 'responsible for case assignment, primary care physicians) lack vital information on', 'which to base MHC choices and referral decisions, and that can inform personalized', 'treatment (Boswell, Constantino, Kraus, Bugatti, & Oswald, 2015). Conversely, there', 'is potentially immense advantage to matching patients to providers based on', 'scientific outcome data (Constantino, Boswell, Bernecker, & Castonguay, 2013).', 'Consistent with this notion, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) has', \"made recommendations to: (a) customize care based on the patient's needs, (b)\", 'share knowledge, (c) engage in data-driven decision-making, (d) promote', 'transparency (including information on performance and patient satisfaction; Kohn,', 'Saxena, Levav, & Saraceno, 2004), and (e) use valid and reliable assessment', 'instruments to assess progress and to aid decision-making.
