Thus, improvements in MHC can occur by identifying', 'effective providers in addition to promoting ESTs (Kraus et al., 2007).', \"In the largest study to date on this topic, our team investigated therapists'\", 'naturalistic treatment outcomes over many different problem domains (e.g.,', 'depression, anxiety, substance use, mania, sleep) in a sample of 6,960 patients and', 'nearly 700 providers (Kraus, Castonguay, Boswell, Nordberg, & Hayes, 2011).
