{"prompt": "['76', 'Research has shown that mental health care (MHC) providers differ significantly in', 'their ability to help patients.

Knowledge of these', 'provider differences is based largely on patient-reported outcomes collected in', 'routine MHC settings.', 'Unfortunately, provider performance information is not systematically used to refer', 'or assign a particular patient to a scientifically based best-matched provider.
