{"prompt": "['1. Introduction', 'Although the risk of cancer increases with age, and the number of older cancer patients is expected to', 'rise in the coming years (1-4), research on older cancer patients and survivors has been limited (3,5). In', 'Denmark, approximately 65% of all cancers are diagnosed among patients > 65 years of age, and the', 'number of incident cancers is expected to increase with 30% towards 2030 solely because of the', 'increasing elderly population (6). Before discussing the impact of cancer disease in older individuals, it', 'is necessary to describe the normal aging process and psychosocial factors related to aging.', '1.1 The aging process', \"The age at which a person is considered being 'elderly' or 'older' varies in the literature and currently\", \"no definitive consensus exists. Age above 65 years has traditionally been chosen as the 'cut-off' as it\", 'represents the age of retirement in many Western countries. Aging involves a continuum of changes in', 'function, biological, psychological and social structures that vary depending on individual differences', 'in genetic factors. It must be empathized that older people represent a widely heterogeneous group and', 'that chronological age does not accurately describe the capacity, resources and functioning of an older', 'person. In a biological view, aging involves physiological changes in the organisms that lead to a decline', 'of biological functions and the ability to adapt to metabolic stress. The biological changes involve a', 'decrease in cardiac function and capacity due to reduced muscle strength, vascular stiffness, increased', 'ventricular wall thickness, atherosclerosis, and loss of elasticity of the vessel walls (7). The respiratory', 'tract undergoes structural and functional changes which are often associated with a decrease in lung', 'function, limited regeneration and an enhanced susceptibility to infections and pulmonary diseases (8).', 'Despite large variation among individuals, aging is also associated with a decline in kidney function,', 'including a decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which makes drug excretion', 'more problematic (9). In the gastrointestinal tract, age-related physiological changes (e.g. decrease in', 'gastric acid and functional absorption, alterations in gastric motility and gastrointestinal hormones) may', 'significantly alter the absorption and metabolisms of nutrients and medications, and thereby places older', 'persons at a major disadvantage when they are exposed to weakness or disease (10). The aging process', 'typically involves changes in the body composition with an increase in fat mass and a decrease in muscle', 'mass. Evidence suggests that age-related loss of muscle mass starts in the fifth decade with an annual', 'rate of up to 1-2%, and mainly influences the lower body skeletal muscle mass (11, 12) Loss of muscle', 'mass is accompanied by an even faster deterioration of muscle strength (13). With age, the bones', 'deteriorate in composition, structure and function. Increased bone resorption and reduction in bone', 'formation leads to a fall in bone mineral density, and increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures', '(14). Aging also has an effect on immunity, with evidence indicating that the cell-mediated immunity', 'consistently displays age-related declines in function (15). The reduction of reserve capacity in bone', '10', 'Protocol TOLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06.2018']['marrow that occurs with aging deduces the ability to respond to stressors such as infections or blood loss', '(15, 16). Comorbidity, defined as the occurrence of two or more medically diagnosed diseases, increases', 'with age and heightens the risk of disability and mortality (17, 18). Furthermore, the use of multiple', 'drugs for multiple diseases, also known as polypharmacy, leads to an increased risk of drug interactions,', 'adverse drug reactions, and poor adherence (19). The aging process also entails cognitive and', 'psychosocial changes. Despite significant heterogeneity among older individuals, cognitive changes are', 'recognized as a normal part of the aging process, and some cognitive abilities such as memory,', 'processing speed, and conceptual reasoning decline over time(20). Social structures and roles also', 'change with aging because of multiple factors and events such as retirement, limited social network, loss', 'of family members or close friends, decreased functional ability, and increased dependency(21).', '1.2 Cancer and aging', 'Aging itself is associated with limitations in physical function, reduced reserve capacity, a poorer', 'resilience to physiological stressors, and an increased burden of comorbidities (17, 22). A diagnosis of', 'cancer and its accompanying treatments can lead to numerous symptoms and side effects, physical', 'disability, psychological distress and increased health care needs (23). The interplay between age-related', 'and cancer-related declines in health increases vulnerability and the risk of development of short and', 'long-term disability (24, 25). Compared to older individuals without a history of cancer, older cancer', 'patients and survivors suffer from a greater incidence of limitations in activities of daily living (ADL),', 'reduced quality of life (QOL), lower self-rated health, and higher prevalence of geriatric syndromes such', 'as depression, falls and osteoporosis (26,27). Research suggests that older cancer patients derive benefits', 'to chemotherapy similar to the benefits derived by younger patients (28-30). However, older cancer', 'patients are at increased risk of chemotherapy toxicity due to age-related physiologic changes, e.g.', 'decreased stem-cell reserves, reduced ability to repair cell damage, and progressive loss of body protein', '(31). Furthermore, comorbidities and their associated treatments increase risk of chemotherapy toxicity', 'even further (31). Recommendations from an expert group meeting in 2016 concluded that rehabilitation', 'services should be offered early to older cancer patients to optimize tolerance to cancer treatment,', 'minimize toxicity, and improve outcomes (32).', '1.3 Sarcopenia and cancer cachexia', 'Loss of muscle mass and strength is a part of the normal aging process, and is often referred to as', '\"sarcopenia\\'. In accordance with an European consensus report, sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized', 'by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength (33). Sarcopenia has', 'multiple contributing factors including aging process itself, insufficient nutrition, sedentary lifestyle or', 'bedrest, and chronic diseases and certain medical drugs. Sarcopenia that occurs solely due to aging is', '11', 'Protocol TOLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06.2018']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
