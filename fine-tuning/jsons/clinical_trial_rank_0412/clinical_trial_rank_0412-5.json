The clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia is made from the presence of low muscle', 'mass in combination with low muscle function (either low muscle strength or performance), and can be', \"diagnosed with different validated measurement techniques (33). Besides sarcopenia, 'cachexia' is\", 'another depleting syndrome that causes weight loss and muscle wasting due to an underlying disease.', 'Cachexia is an important complication among cancer patients, particularly in advanced-stage cancer.', 'Cancer cachexia is \"a multi-factorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with', 'or without loss of fat mass) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads', 'to progressive functional impairment\" (35). The pathophysiology of cancer cachexia is complex and', 'includes a combination of reduced energy intake, hormonal alterations, and abnormal metabolism and', 'inflammation.
