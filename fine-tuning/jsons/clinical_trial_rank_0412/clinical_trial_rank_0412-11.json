To measure physical capacity and endurance, the six-minute-walk-test', '(6MWT) will be used. The 6MWT measures the distance an individual can walk over a total of', 'six minutes on a hard and flat surface. It was originally developed for use in frail older patients,', 'but it has been used and validated in a variety of chronic diseases and populations (e.g. cardiac,', 'cancer and pulmonary patients) (96, 97). Prior studies have demonstrated that the 6MWT is a', 'reliable and valid measure of physical capacity and endurance in older adults and in cancer', 'patients, and that the test may have prognostic value among cancer patients (98,99). To measure', 'physical function of the upper-body, the handgrip strength test (HST) will be used. Handgrip', 'strength will be measured using a hand-held Jamar dynamometer and with three attempts', 'performed for each hand. Measurements of grip strength with the Jamar dynamometer have', 'evidence for good reliability and validity (100). Patient will be sitting down during the', 'assessment with their elbow flexed at 90\u00b0. The best measure in the strongest hand will be used', 'as test score. Research has shown that handgrip strength may be independently associated with', 'functional capacity, QOL and survival in patients with advanced cancer (101). To measure lower', 'extremity muscle power a stair climb test (SCT) will be used. The patient will climb a flight of', 'stairs (20 steps) as fast as possible. The best of three trials will be used as test score. Leg power', 'is an influential factor in the mobility performance of older adults (102). The SCT is a clinically', 'relevant measure of lower extremity power among older adults and is associated with more', 'complex modes of testing power (103). All physical tests will be conducted by blinded', 'physiotherapists.', '4. Feasibility measures: feasibility of the intervention will be evaluated as acceptability, attrition', 'and adherence. Acceptability will be measured as the number of eligible patients who agree to', 'participate in the study. Also, reasons for refusing participation will be registered and evaluated.', 'Attrition is the number of patients who do not complete the study (drop-outs). For each', 'component of the intervention (supervised exercise, protein supplement after exercise sessions,', 'and walking program) adherence to the intervention will be assessed. Safety (adverse event) and', 'tolerability will be evaluated at every training session and at the weekly evaluation of the walking', 'program.', '5. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs): Patient reported performance status (PRPS)', 'will be assessed using ECOG PS (Appendix 1). PS is a known and common-used prognostic tool', 'for assessment and decision making in oncology and palliative settings. Evidence suggests that', '24', 'Protocol TOLCA - Breast Cancer Exercise v8 18.06.2018']['patients are reliable assessors of their own performance status, and that PRPS is a predictor of', 'cancer-related outcomes (104). To measure symptom burden, M.D. Anderson Symptom', 'Inventory (MDASI) will be used (Appendix 3). MDASI is a multi-symptom PROM to assess the', 'severity of symptoms and the interference with daily living as assessed by cancer patients based', 'on the last 24 hours (105). MDASI consists of 13 core symptom items representing symptoms', 'that have been found to have the highest frequency and/or severity among cancer patients with', 'various cancers and treatment types, and 6 interference items representing commonly', 'experienced symptom interference with daily activities (105). To assess QoL the European', 'Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30', 'and the breast cancer specific module QLQ-BR23 (EORTC QLQ-C30 & BR23) will be used', '(Appendix 4). EORTC QLQ-C30 comprises 30 items, is designed to be cancer specific, and', 'consists of six functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social functioning, and', 'global QOL) and symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, sleep disturbance, constipation,', 'diarrhea, appetite loss, dyspnea) (69, 106). EORTC QLQ-C30 is developed in a way that is', 'appropriate for self-administration and for use across a range of cultural setting. To assess', 'symptoms of depression and anxiety, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will', 'be used (Appendix 5). HADS comprises a total of 14 items and is designed to measure general', 'anxiety and depression by self-administration (107).', '6. Physical activity: Data of steps counts will be assessed daily for patients in the intervention', 'group. Data of walked steps, distance and energy consumption for all patients (intervention group', 'and control group) will be assessed in a 3-days period both before and after the intervention', 'period (at baseline and 12-week post-intervention). Data on physical activity will be measured', 'with an activity tracker.', '7. Chemotherapy tolerance: data on completion of scheduled chemotherapy, dose-reductions,', 'treatment discontinuations, toxicity (according to the National Cancer Institute Common', 'Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4) will be registered from medical records.', '8. Body composition: data on weight, height, BMI, and body composition will be registered.', 'Weight, height and BMI will be assessed using standard procedures (no shoes, light clothing).', 'Body composition will be assessed by whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan', '(DXA) and by bioelectrical impedance (BI) assessment.
