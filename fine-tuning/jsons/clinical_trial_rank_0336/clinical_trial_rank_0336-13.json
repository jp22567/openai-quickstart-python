As this is unlikely to be the case', 'in a group randomized trial, we will discuss the adjustment of the sample size estimate to account', 'for this correlation between patients in the next subsection. A recent Cochrane review suggests', 'that most patients can accurately answer 50% (standard deviation of 12%) of the questions asked', 'of them.70 On average, DAs increase that knowledge by 20% to 60% of questions asked being', 'answered correctly, but 95% of trials show absolute knowledge increases of 10% or greater.

Note that', 'the four arms of this study make up a 2 X 2 factorial design. Thus, it is natural to consider', 'evaluating the decision aids using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). In this case, the', 'two factors in the ANOVA will be having received during-consultation Prostate Choice (yes or', 'no) and having received pre-consultation DA (yes or no). We will consider simultaneously', 'testing (at a significance level of 0.025 for each test) the main effects of the two decision aids as', 'our primary analysis.

A total sample of 100 patients (25 patients', 'per arm) would give us approximately 85% power to detect a difference between those receiving', 'pre-consultation DA and those not receiving pre-consultation DA, under the alternative that the', 'average knowledge among those receiving pre-consultation DA is 58%, and that the average', 'knowledge among those not receiving pre-consultation DA is 50%, using a two-sample t-test', '(with two-sided alternative) with a 2.5% significance level (this is equivalent to the F test for the', 'main effects in the ANOVA). Under a similar alternative, the same can be said for the during-', 'consultation Prostate Choice decision aid. Thus, if patients within each site were not correlated', 'with each other, our target sample size would be 100 patients. There will be some, but', 'insufficient power to detect an interaction between the two decision aids, but such effects are', 'rare and not anticipated in this study.

Thus, the application of', 'the standard sample size calculation, as above, may lead to an underpowered study. Since we', 'expect k=20 sites to participate in this clinical trial, we would need about m = 5 patients to be', 'enrolled from each site (on average) to achieve a total enrollment of 100 patients.
