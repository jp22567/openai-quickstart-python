COMPARATORS', 'This section details the main independent variables that will be used to compare outcomes of HRQoL,', 'sequencing of treatment regimens and kidney function.', 'In all 3 study aims we will be comparing both the frequency of use of first, second and third line and', 'beyond therapies (SSAs, bevacizumab, cytotoxic chemotherapy, everolimus, Interferon alpha,', 'embolization, PRRT, small molecule TKIs) and the effects of their ordering/sequencing on other', 'secondary outcomes (i.e.: symptom burden, survival and adverse toxicity). These interventions have', 'been selected as they are listed as potential biological therapies, liver directed therapies or', 'chemotherapies that are routinely available to NET patients, and for which there is no clear consensus', 'as to the effectiveness of their ordering (or concomitant use).', '8.1. Aim 1 (Frequency of treatment regimens)', 'In this aim we will describe the frequencies of treatment regimens by line of therapy and multi-line', 'sequences. Information from Aim 1 will also be used - with input from the Patient Advocacy Committee', '(PAC) and Clinician Group - to finalize the comparators for Aims 2 and 3.', '8.2. Aim 2 (Treatment selection and outcomes)', 'With input from the Patient Advocacy Committee (PAC) and Clinician Group we will examine predictors', 'of treatment selection and outcomes of overall survival and disease progression using chosen', 'comparators from aim 1.

Aim 3 (Comparative effectiveness of PRRT regimens)', 'Comparators will be PRRT with vs. without administration of other systemic therapies and PRRT before', 'vs. after embolization therapy and chemotherapy. Comparisons will be with respect to renal toxicity,', 'disease progression, patient-reported symptoms, and HRQoL. Heterogeneity of treatment effects will', 'be assessed for these comparators in subgroups defined by tumor grade and type (GEP or lung NETs).', '36']['NET-PRO Protocol v1.3', 'April 2022', '9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN', '9.1. General Statistical Approach', 'Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation,', 'median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by count and percentage.', \"Group comparisons will be assessed using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables,\", 'and an analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables where appropriate.', 'Adjustment for covariates listed in Tables 2 and 3 will be explored for each analysis as needed to', 'account for potential confounding effects. Time-dependent covariates will be incorporated to capture', 'changes in covariates across time, as necessary. Inclusion of random effects to account for potential', 'clustering of patients treated at the same study site will be explored. Depending on the rate and pattern', 'of missing data, multiple imputation methods may be considered to account for data missing at random', 'or attributable to non-ignorable drop-out [56]. Planned study outcomes are summarized in Table 4.', '9.1.1. Aim 1', 'Mixed effects regression models will be utilized to assess changes in HRQoL and symptoms within and', 'between groups (i.e.: different treatment regimens) over time. Random effects will be employed to', 'account for the longitudinally correlated nature of repeated questionnaire measurements. Should', 'completion of questionnaires deviate from the planned assessment time points, a spatial power', 'covariance structure will be included to account for the unequal time spacing between assessments', 'within a patient.', '9.1.2. Aim 2', 'Multinomial logistic regression models will be used to identify which patient, clinical, and tumor', 'characteristics (Table 2), and patient attitudes and beliefs (Table 3) influence selection of treatment', 'regimens for each line of treatment. The conditional Cox regression model proposed by Prentice,', 'Williams, and Peterson (PWP) will be used to simultaneously model the gap times between initial', 'diagnosis and first progression and between subsequent progressions as a function of the prognostic', 'factors of interest for progression-free survival. The baseline hazard is expected to differ for first-line', 'therapy and for subsequent lines of therapy, thus event-specific estimates will be obtained. A robust', 'sandwich estimator will be used to account for potential dependencies within patients. Overall survival', 'will be evaluated using a Cox regression model.', '9.1.3. Aim 3', 'Statistical analyses for Aim 3 will mimic those outlined in Aims 1 and 2, but with a special interest in', 'evaluating the effectiveness of PRRT regimens on each of the outcomes. PRRT regimens to be evaluated', 'include: PRRT alone, PRRT other biological therapy, PRRT prior embolization. Additionally, the PRRT', 'isotope used (177Lu vs 90-Y) will be evaluated.', '9.2. Sample Size and Power', 'For this prospective analysis we will have an estimated sample size of 3,010 patients. The sample size is', 'computed for the population with minimum representation in the total sample. 2019 rates of PRRT were', '15% in this population. Using a conservative estimation of 10% PRRT administration, and erring on the', 'side of caution, our sample size and power justification is based on approximately 300 subjects', '(excluding HRQoL questionnaire completion rates).
