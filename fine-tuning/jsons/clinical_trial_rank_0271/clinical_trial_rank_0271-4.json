Background', 'NETs are a group of rare and heterogeneous neoplasms that originate in specialized neuroendocrine', 'cells, predominantly in the small bowel, pancreas and lung, collectively affecting fewer than 172,000', 'individuals in the United States [1]. Although NETs may arise in most organs, more than half originate', 'from endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas [2], referred to as', 'gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs). Both GEP-NETs and lung NETs, including typical and atypical', 'carcinoid tumors and bronchial NETs, meet the criteria for orphan disease status. Despite this, the age-', 'adjusted incidence rate of NETs increased 6.4-fold from 1973 (1.09 per 100000) to 2012 (6.98 per', '100 000) [3, 4], and serves only to highlight the growing impact and burden these cancers will continue', 'to have on the health of our population.', '1.1.1. Health related quality of life impact of NETs', 'NETs are typically slow-growing in nature with prolonged survival and significant symptom burdens,', 'however few studies have examined quality of life impacts.

Metastatic disease is observed', 'in up to 40% of NETs at initial diagnosis [1], and many patients with liver or other distant metastases', 'experience carcinoid syndrome, a direct result of the tumors capacity to synthesize and secrete an', 'excess of bioactive amines, peptides, and polypeptides. Carcinoid syndrome manifests with clinical', 'symptoms ranging from watery diarrhea and flushing to bronchospasm, to hypotension and right-sided', 'cardiac deficits (carcinoid heart disease) due to serotonin hypersecretion [4]. In fact, a Surveillance', 'Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) analysis has shown that 19% of all NET patients have symptoms of', 'carcinoid syndrome at diagnosis, increasing to over 50% in patients with metastatic well-differentiated', 'small bowel NETs [5]. Thus, NET patients typically experience prolonged survival with active disease, and', 'many have significant symptom burdens. With a conscious shift in medical practice from disease-', 'centered to patient-orientated care, quality of life represents an important measure for gauging patient', 'perspectives on treatment effectiveness and outcomes. However, the assessment of health-related', 'quality of life (HRQoL) in NET patients is relatively infrequent and transfer of HRQoL results into clinical', 'practice is hindered by the often limited quality of HRQoL outcomes reporting [6]. Unsurprisingly, where', 'these studies have been undertaken, some have identified worse HRQoL scores in NET patients as', 'compared with the general population [7-10], specifically poorer patient-reported outcomes and unmet', 'needs [11, 12].
