Although the underlying mechanisms of CIPN are only partially', 'understood,\u00b2 CIPN is a small fiber neuropathy that results in reduced nerve fiber density in the', 'skin and can lead to physiologic changes in nerve conduction and anatomic changes in', 'peripheral nerve anatomy. CIPN is more prevalent and more severe in African American (A-A)', 'compared to women of other races, but the reason for this is not understood. 3,4', 'CIPN is a significant problem for cancer survivors. Prevalence rates of CIPN vary widely based', 'on different patient populations, different grading systems and symptom assessments, but', 'have been found in up to 80% of patients receiving chemotherapy.5 In fact, CIPN is the most', 'common reason for dose reduction in breast cancer patients receiving taxane chemotherapy.', 'One study found that 42% of early stage breast cancer survivors had CIPN two years after', 'chemotherapy6 and another reported that 50% of women cancer survivors reported symptoms', 'of CIPN six years after treatment.7 Similarly, platinum agents including cisplatin, carboplatin,', 'and oxaliplatin also commonly result in peripheral neurotoxicity.
