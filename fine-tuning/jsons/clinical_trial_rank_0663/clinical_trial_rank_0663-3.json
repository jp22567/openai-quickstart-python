The', 'foot moves in three planes, with most of the motion occurring in the rear', 'foot; this will enabling three fundamental functions: supporting, shock', 'absorbing, and weight bearing (Wozniacka et al., 2013)', 'The foot divided into three regions:', 'The rear foot: consisting of the talus and the calcaneus.', 'The mid foot: including the navicular, cuneiforms, and the cuboid.', 'The forefoot : containing the metatarsals and the phalanges (Standring,', '2016)', '9']['The tarsal bones arranged in a proximal and distal row, similar to the', 'carpal bones in the wrist.

Foot musculature:', 'The foot and ankle are worked by both extrinsic and intrinsic musculature.', 'The extrinsic muscles all originate from proximal to the foot. The intrinsic', 'muscles of the foot originate and insert within the foot and act primarily on', 'the toes. Their secondary function is to maintain postural balance through', 'stabilization of the osteocartilaginous architecture of the foot.', 'The plantar muscles of the foot can be thought of as organized by layers', 'from sole of the foot progressing deep to the bony structures The first layer', 'consists of muscles found just beneath the plantar aponeurosis - the flexor', 'digitorum brevis, the abductor hallucis, and the abductor digiti minimi.', 'These muscles extend from calcaneus to toes and create a functional group', 'that assists in maintaining foot concavity. All three have been described as', 'local pedicles muscle flaps, and all have type I vascular supply.
