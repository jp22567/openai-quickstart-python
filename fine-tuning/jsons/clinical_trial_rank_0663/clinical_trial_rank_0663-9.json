First, RSWT have a more superficial effect, compared to', 'FSWT, which reach a maximal energy in the focus in deeper body tissues.

How these measures relate to', 'biological tissue is unknown. These measures are also dependent on the', 'device that is used and the energy setting. Overall, FSWT will travel further', 'and have more impact on deeper body tissues. Second, research has shown', 'that pressure waves generated by RSWT from a fundamental point of view', 'cannot be called Shockwave because they lack the characteristic physical', 'features of Shockwave such as a short rise time, a high peak pressure and', 'nonlinearity (van der Worp et al., 2013).', 'Moreover, Radial extracorporeal Shockwave therapy (RSWT) is', 'extensively used as a non-invasive treatment of various musculoskeletal', 'disorders.
