The primary outcome is participant-reported back-related', 'functional limitations (mobility and activities of daily living [ADLs]) at 3 months, as measured by the Roland-', 'Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include activity tracker-assessed step counts, back pain', 'intensity, reduction in opioid use, and quality of life.

After the 3-month main study period, participants will be offered the option to either be', 'unblinded to their treatment allocations or to remain blinded to their assigned treatments for up to 9 additional', 'months of optional monthly study outcome assessments. Unblinded participants may make subsequent', 'treatment decisions as they wish, so optional assessments after the study period may be affected by', 'unblinding and other changes in treatment and are not truly randomized comparisons.
