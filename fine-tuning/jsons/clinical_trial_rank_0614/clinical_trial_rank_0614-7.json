DP2 is', 'expressed on a variety of cells implicated in the allergic process including eosinophils, basophils,', 'and epithelial cells (Kupczyk, 2017; Singh, 2017) as well as Group 2 innate lymphoid cells', '(ILC2) and T Helper cell type 2 (Th2) cells (Kato, 2019). GB001 is being developed as a once-', 'daily oral add-on maintenance treatment for patients with moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma', 'and related diseases, and for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps', '(NP).', 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and', 'pharmacodynamics (PD) of GB001 compared with placebo in patients with chronic', 'rhinosinusitis with or without bilateral NP.', '2.2.', 'Background', 'Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as any inflammatory condition of the paranasal sinuses', 'and associated nasal mucosa for more than 12 weeks (Fokkens, 2007). The loss of epithelial', 'barrier function plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of CRS, with the loss of tight', 'junctions permitting access to the sinus stromal tissue by allergens, bacteria, and bacteria-derived', 'antigens. Clinical symptoms include nasal obstruction and congestion, reduction in or loss of', 'sense of smell, anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, and facial pain. These symptoms can impact', \"greatly upon a patient's quality of life.\", 'Current recommendations for phenotyping CRS are based on the presence of nasal polyps', '(chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps [CRSwNP]) or absence of nasal polyps (chronic', 'rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps [CRSsNP]) (Fokkens, 2007). In a multinational study', 'undertaken by the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network, the total prevalence of', 'CRSwNP and CRSsNP has been estimated at 15.5% and 10.9% in the USA and Europe,', 'respectively (Collins, 1997; Hastan, 2011). Patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma (~30%)', 'have a poor therapeutic response and a high recurrence rate, and their disease tends to be more', 'resistant to treatment (Thomas, 2008; Fokkens, 2007).', 'Within the group of patients with aspirin sensitivity, nasal polyps are found in 36% to 60% of', 'patients. Patients with aspirin sensitivity, asthma, and NP, also known as aspirin-exacerbated', 'respiratory disease (AERD), are usually non-atopic and the disease prevalence increases over the', 'age of 40 years. Notably, these patients have an increased expression of DP2 (Rothenberg, 2017).', 'Eicosanoid changes in paranasal sinus diseases, including AERD, are generally characterized by', 'an up-regulation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs), lipoxin A4 (LXA4), and prostaglandin D2', '(PGD2) and a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).', 'Classification of CRS by nasal polyp phenotype is based on the observation that nasal polyp', 'disease is more likely to be associated with an eosinophil-mediated Th2-high (IL-4, IL-5,', 'and IL-13) cytokine profile. In contrast, CRSsNP is thought to present as a non-eosinophilic', 'disease (Crombruggen, 2011). Emerging data, however, suggest that NP status alone can often', 'be inadequate for defining a Th2-high/IL-5-high eosinophilic phenotype (Tan, 2017). The Tan', '18', 'CONFIDENTIAL']['GB001, Inc.', 'GB001', 'Protocol GB001-2101', 'Version 5.0, 16 Apr 2020', 'study examined tissue concentrations of IL-5 and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) as surrogate', 'markers for tissue eosinophilia. While values were significantly greater in patients with', 'CRSwNP, there was extensive overlap in ECP concentrations between patients with and without', 'NPs. Similarly, in a cluster analysis, expression of IL-5 in patients with CRS was identified in', 'clusters with and without NPs (Tomassen, 2016).', 'Within these two groups, CRSwNP and CRSsNP, patients with an eosinophilic phenotype,', 'eosinophilic CRS (eCRS) have a subtype of chronic sinusitis that is thought to occur secondary', 'to chronic and systemic eosinophil activation. Patients with eCRS show overlapping mechanisms', 'for eosinophilia and tend to have a poor response to medical and surgical management', '(Ferguson, 2004). In a recent cross-sectional study of adult patients with CRS (N = 345)', 'undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, eCRS was defined by histopathological assessment', 'showing > 10 eosinophils/high-power field on sinus mucosal biopsy.
