Dr. Saag', 'thinks you may be a good candidate to participate in this study. You and your doctor have decided that', 'you will begin treatment for your gout with a drug named KRYSTEXXAR (also known as pegloticase).', 'The information in this form tells you about the clinical trial and what it means to participate in the study.', 'PURPOSE OF THE STUDY', 'You are being asked to take part in this clinical trial study because you have chronic gout and your', 'signs and symptoms of gout are not controlled by your current medications. The purpose of this study is', 'to figure out how to best use 8 mg of KRYSTEXXA R in combination with the drug Mycophenolate', 'Mofetil (MMF) also called CellCept\u00ae or mycophenolic acid (MPA) in patients 18 years of age and over', 'for the treatment of chronic gout. KRYSTEXXAR has been approved by the US Food and Drug', 'Administration (FDA) for the treatment of gout (caused by high uric acid). MMF is a US Food and Drug', \"Administration (FDA) approved drug that affects the body's immune system and is used for many\", 'chronic diseases. Many gout patients that use KRYSTEXXAR develop antibodies and must stop using', 'it. We are trying to determine if MMF can allow gout patients to use KRYSTEXXAR for a longer period', 'of time.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY,TESTS YOU WILL UNDERGO, AND OTHER THINGS YOU WILL', 'BE ASKED TO DO DURING THE STUDY', 'You will be assigned by chance, similar to a flip of the coin, into one of two groups. Neither you nor Dr.', 'Saag can choose the group you will be in and you will not know whether you are receiving', 'Mycophenolate Mofetil or the inactive placebo (i.e., a sugar pill). One group will receive KRYSTEXXAR', 'plus MMF therapy, and the other group will receive KRYSTEXXAR plus placebo therapy. The research', 'will be conducted at the UAB Arthritis Clinical Intervention Program (ACIP) clinic.', 'Your participation in this study will be 40 weeks (see timeline), and will include 20 study related visits.', 'At each of these visits blood collections and/or urine samples will be collected Study visits that include', 'a KRYSTEXXAR infusion will last roughly 4 hours. All other study visits will last approximately 1 hour.', 'The things you will be asked to do are described in detail later in the consent form.', 'The first visit will be for screening to determine if you can participate in the study and if you are free of', 'any infections. You will be one of approximately 8 people at UAB to be asked to be in this study. Before', 'you can start the study, the study doctor or study staff will talk to you about the study.', 'Version 06/29/18', 'Page 1 of 11']['At this initial screening visit, you will undergo a blood draw, and physical examination where Dr. Saag', 'and/or a member of the study team will ask you questions about your medical history. If you are unable', 'to complete all screening tests, you will be scheduled to return to the study center within two days of', 'Visit 1 (screening visit) to complete any outstanding screening tests. If you continue to qualify to', 'participate in this study by meeting all study requirements, you will be scheduled to return to the study', 'center two weeks after the screening visit.', 'During the study, it is possible that you may not meet certain study requirements at some study visits. If', 'this happens the study doctor may discontinue your participation. If you are unable to continue in the', 'study, you will stop receiving the study medication and your study doctor may advise you to start other', 'treatments to control your gout. At that point, your participation in the study will end.', 'Blood Tests: Blood will be drawn 20 times during this study. Needle sticks are painful for a short', 'period of time and sometimes will cause bruising at the site for a couple of days. You might feel dizzy or', 'faint during a blood draw but this generally passes within a few minutes. Each time we draw blood, we', 'will take about 11/2 tablespoons of blood. We will do several tests to make sure it is safe to use the', 'study medicine, and to look for any side effects of the study medicine to use the study medicines. This', 'will include tests to check for infection, measure your kidney function, and to make sure you have', 'enough of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, or G6PD, which helps red blood cells', '(RBCs) function normally.', 'Urine Test and Collection: Women capable of becoming pregnant will have a serum pregnancy test to', 'exclude women who are pregnant at the beginning of the study before enrollment and urine pregnancy', 'tests before Visits 1-15 to make sure you do not become pregnant during the study period. The study', 'doctor or study staff will tell you if the pregnancy test results are positive.
