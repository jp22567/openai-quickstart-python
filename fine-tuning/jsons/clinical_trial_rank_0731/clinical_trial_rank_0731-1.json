{"prompt": "['II. Research Strategy', 'A. Challenge, Innovation and Impact Statement: An estimated 1,275,000 Americans are living with', 'spinal cord injury (SCI) [1], and the prognosis for those with complete motor paralysis is particularly poor. Such', 'injuries are often accompanied by cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, and', 'attendant medical, personal, and economic impacts can be devastating. The current treatment paradigm is to', 'provide compensatory therapeutic interventions which focus on improved function above the spinal cord lesion,', 'with the singular hope that in the future some regenerative approach - perhaps using stem cell technologies', '-', 'will reach clinical trials. The hope of stem cell-based interventions is a lingering one, precisely because it is', 'thought that re-establishing anatomical connectivity of supraspinal input to the spinal cord is essential for', 'recovery of movement and autonomic function. In this proposal we challenge 1) the concept that movement', 'and autonomic function can only be restored by re-establishing anatomical connections from supraspinal to', 'spinal neurons; and 2) that those with clinically motor complete SCI have essentially no hope of neurologic', 'recovery, even with therapeutic intervention.', 'Individuals with complete motor paralysis suffer from a myriad of complications that result in mortality,', 'morbidity, hospitalization, high burden of care and health care costs, and a drastically lowered quality of life.', 'We propose to demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) can be used to recover significant', 'levels of autonomic control of cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual function, as well as the', 'ability to stand and to voluntarily control leg movements below the injury level. This intervention would provide', 'an immediate therapeutic alternative to individuals who now have no recourse for treatment, and the expected', 'reduction in SCI-related healthcare and caregiver costs would be dramatic. The U.S. could save an estimated', '$400 billion on direct and indirect lifetime costs if we can develop therapies to treat SCI. Also, the cost in', 'emotional stress and well-being to the individual and family is demanding.', 'From a scientific perspective, this novel intervention challenges the long-held belief that with the', \"development of the primate's cortex, the spinal cord became solely a conduit to carry signals from the brain to\", 'execute movement.', 'B. Rationale: In the context of studies of human locomotion, we made the astonishing observation that', 'four individuals who had been diagnosed as clinically motor complete (unable to voluntarily activate muscles', 'below their level of lesion) developed the ability to voluntarily move their toes, ankles, knees and hips only in', 'the presence of tonic scES of the lumbosacral spinal cord when also receiving intense locomotor training [2].', 'Even more surprising, over a period of months, they reported improvements in temperature regulation and', 'bladder and bowel function and normalization of sexual function. We also measured significant improvements', 'in cardiovascular and respiratory function that persisted throughout the day even without stimulation. These', 'observations have led us to three assumptions. First, the observation that precise coordinated voluntary', 'movement after complete paralysis can be executed only in the presence of epidural stimulation demonstrates', 'a key role for the spinal circuitry. Second, the function of residual anatomical connections that are clinically', 'undetectable can reach neural activation and functional significance via activity-dependent plasticity via sces', 'and task specific training. Third, secondary complications of injury can be attributed not only to the direct loss', 'of supraspinal input, but also to the lack of weight-bearing neuromuscular activity generated by proprioception.', 'These novel hypotheses challenge current theoretical paradigms for the control of movement in humans and', 'indicate possible therapeutic treatments that have not been considered previously for those with severe', 'paralysis. A collaborative team of scientists and clinicians will comprehensively and systematically study a', 'cohort of individuals who suffer chronically from severe SCI with paralysis and associated cardiovascular,', 'respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. We will test hypotheses of the neural control of human', 'movement and autonomic function while also obtaining knowledge for optimizing therapeutic strategies that', 'can be immediately translated to larger numbers of patients who now have no treatment options. We will', 'obtain comprehensive, quantitative and sensitive neurophysiological outcomes that will improve our', 'understanding of the physiology of SCI and recovery, and will help us to design therapeutic interventions that', 'can treat those with paralysis and autonomic dysfunction, regardless of the cause.', '1. Voluntary Leg and Trunk Movement. The critical role of the corticospinal tract in generating', 'voluntary movements - with the spinal cord simply being a conduit of these signals in primates - has long', 'been a widely held belief. If this premise is correct, options for recovery from paralysis would be limited to', 'repair or regeneration of these pathways. Our recent observations of four individuals with motor complete', 'injury regaining the ability to voluntarily move their hips, knees and ankles upon command only in the presence', 'of SCES (Figure 1) challenges this theory and provides a novel treatment strategy for paralysis.', 'Version Date: 02/08/2019', 'Page 3 of 61']['2. Cardiovascular Function. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity for', 'individuals with SCI [3]. Individuals with high-lesion SCI often present with cardiac, vascular, and cognitive', 'dysfunction and frequently exhibit orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia, which contribute to the', 'reduced quality of life often reported by these patients [4-6]. With time post injury, episodes of orthostatic', 'hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia become more prominent in many individuals with cervical and high', 'thoracic injuries. The causes of cardiovascular dysfunction in individuals with SCI are multifactorial, and can be', 'classified into either neurogenic (related to autonomic nervous system injury which controls cardiovascular', 'function and has tracts through the spinal cord) or other physiologic consequences of SCI [3-10]. A', 'combination of sympathetic agonists and venous compression devices are the only measures currently', 'available for treatment of these symptoms.', 'We have observed in preliminary studies that scES can increase blood pressure during hypotension (Figure', '2).
