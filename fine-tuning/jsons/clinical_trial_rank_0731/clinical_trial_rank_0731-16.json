{"prompt": "['b. Sexual Function in Female Participants.', 'Procedure: The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) along with the International SCI Female Sexual and', 'Reproductive Function Basic data set will be used [58, 154, 155]. These are recommended tools for assessing', 'female sexual function for clinical trials. The 19 question FSFI yields an overall score and 6 index scores in the', 'following categories: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. Participants will be asked to', 'complete the questionnaires on the same day they present for Urodynamics (when bladder and bowel', 'questionnaires are completed). A private room will be used to complete the questionnaires.', 'Analysis: The questionnaire has 19 questions that assess six domains of sexual function including desire,', 'arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain. Score ranges for items 3-14 and 1-19 are 0-5 and for', 'items 1, 2, 15, 16 are 1-5. The composite score is determined by the sum of domains multiplied by the domain', 'factor. Add the six domain scores to obtain the full scale score (see below). The full-scale score range is from 2', 'to 36 with higher scores associated with a lesser degree of sexual dysfunction. It should be noted that within', 'the individual domains, a domain score of zero indicates that the participant reported having no sexual activity', 'during the past month.

Electrode Configuration Selection and Interventions.', '1. Mapping Studies.', 'Procedure: Initially research participants will participate in mapping studies to identify the neurophysiological', 'response to various anode and cathode selections, amplitude, frequency and pulse width combinations to', 'provide a basis for identifying the specific configurations for each intervention. These may include ramped', 'changes in voltage at a given frequency, ramped frequencies at a given voltage, or variations of pulse widths', 'with', 'different anode and cathode electrode combinations. These studies will be done as the first stimulation', 'studies after surgery and continue throughout the study as needed.', '2. Voluntary Intervention.', 'Procedure: Participants will participate in laboratory sessions until all optimal configurations for joint movement', 'and trunk control are found. Participant will demonstrate safe use of the patient programmer and ability to', 'perform the leg voluntary movement independently or in the presence of a care giver. This will take', 'approximately 3-5 days. Once the participant has demonstrated safe use of programs they will be allowed to', 'conduct the sessions at home. Participants will be asked to train daily (7 days a week) for a total of 80', 'sessions.', 'Participants in the Voluntary-scES group (A1) will receive Core voluntary training focusing on trunk', 'exercises, sitting balance, and lower extremity training for 6 hours daily. Voluntary training will be performed in', 'the laboratory under supervision of trained research staff until they can perform each task safely and', 'independently. Then they will be able to conduct their training at home. Approximately every two weeks, lower', 'extremity voluntary configurations will be assessed by research staff to make sure they are still optimized for', 'the desired movement. They may train in the laboratory more often.', '3. Cardiovascular Intervention.', 'Participants will undergo testing in the laboratory to determine the optimal stimulator configuration(s) for', 'blood pressure regulation. The first 5 training sessions will be performed in the laboratory.

If cardiovascular parameters remain stable, the', 'participant will be able to begin the home training program of 6 days a week and 1 day in lab training.', 'Participants will be asked to train with CV-scES for CV for approximately 6 hours daily (7 days a week) for a', 'total of 80 CV training sessions. Participants are instructed to monitor blood pressure for at least 15 minutes', 'prior to starting CV-scES each day in order to insure a stable baseline prior to starting stimulation.', '4. Stand Intervention.', 'During the stand training sessions, participants will use the custom designed standing apparatus described in', 'the \"Standing Assessments\\' section above. In case of upper limbs and trunk control insufficient for safely using', 'the standing apparatus, participants will be placed on the treadmill, and a body weight support system with a', 'harness will be used to avoid trunk collapse and knee buckling. In this case, the level of body weight support will', 'be continuously reduced over the course of the training sessions as the individuals increase their ability to bear', 'weight on the lower limbs. A trainer positioned behind the participant will aid in pelvis and trunk stabilization; the', 'trainer will ensure that the trunk and pelvis are not flexed or hyper-extended during standing. Trainer(s)', 'positioned at the lower limb will provide manual facilitation using a customized technique developed by this', 'research team that facilitates knee extension during standing. Trainer(s) promote knee extension by applying', 'gentle pressure at the tibial tuberosity and stimulation of the patellar tendon. Manual facilitation at the trunk-', 'pelvis and at the legs will be used only when needed. Participants will undergo 80 sessions of stand training (two', '1 hour sessions, 5 days per week), always with lumbosacral epidural stimulation. Participants will be encouraged', 'to stand for as long as possible throughout the training session, with the goal to stand for 120 minutes with the', 'least amount of assistance. Seated resting periods will occur when requested by the individuals. This will be', 'done with Stand-scES.', 'F. Home and Community Integration.', 'Participants that choose to keep the stimulator at the conclusion of the laboratory training phase and would', 'like to receive stimulation configurations that were not part of their group interventions will receive home and', 'community integration for approximately 2-6 weeks depending on the intervention(s) needed. For voluntary', 'activity, configurations will be optimized for trunk and lower extremity movement. Participants will be asked to', 'demonstrate safe use of the patient programmer while practicing lower extremity movements from the supine', 'or seated position.', 'For those participants not achieving independent standing during the stand training phase of the protocol, the', 'home and community integration will include training in a customized standing device. Standing devices will be', 'designed to match the level of assistance required to safely translate the training to the home environment.', 'This phase can also include training of care givers or personal trainers to assist the participants in achieving', 'safe and independent standing.', 'G. Statistical approaches.', 'For the primary aims (comparing to baseline), paired sample t-tests will be used the primary endpoints', '(hypotheses 1a, 1b, 1c) comparing the results at the end of the second intervention period to the baseline', 'period.', 'For the secondary aims, each endpoint will be analyzed separately with a common linear model', 'framework.

Thus, for example we', 'have a coefficient which measures the additional benefit of weight bearing stand training and a stimulation', 'setting over and above that stimulation setting alone.
