{"prompt": "['1. Recruitment, pre-screening, screening and enrollment', 'a. Recruitment. Potential research participants will be identified by our research database (UofL', 'IRB 06.0647) that currently contains over 6,000 individuals. When individuals agree to be entered into the', 'database they answer a series of IRB approved questions that allow us to identify the most likely candidates to', 'approach. We anticipate that we will need to contact approximately 200 individuals in the initial stage of', 'recruitment. Potential research participants will be selected in the order that they initially entered the database.', 'Those who have already been screened for other studies from the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research', 'Center (KSCIRC) Screening Protocol (UofL IRB 07.0224) and/or have completed studies previously will be', 'contacted first. The KSCIRC Screening protocol allows for general screening of individuals for all studies', 'conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center. These individuals would not need to go', 'through the pre-screening process as all of the information normally collected during pre-screening (below)', 'would have been collected during the KSCIRC screening protocol.', 'The clinical coordinator will contact the individual and provide them with general information regarding the', 'research study. If the individual is interested in learning more about the study, the clinical coordinator will set', 'up an info session via teleconference or a meeting at Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center with a', 'project leader, Dr. Harkema, Dr. Angeli, and/or the Research Manager. During the info session the project', 'leader will describe the time commitment, the requirement of surgery, the general assessments and', 'interventions involved and that the interventions will be selected randomly as well as that the individual will', 'need to live in Louisville during the research study. The potential risks will also be discussed. All questions', 'from the potential research participant will be answered. The objective of this info session is to provide a first', 'educational session of the research program and ascertain if given the time commitment, need to relocate, and', 'the need for invasive surgery, the individual has an interest in being screened for the study. If they have an', 'interest in potentially participating in the study, we will then send them a copy of the consent form for review', 'and ask them to discuss the study with their family, friends, and physicians and to call the clinical coordinator if', 'they decide to consent to participate in the screening process.', 'b. Pre-Screening (1st consent). If the potential research participant agrees to screening we will', 'give them the choice to conduct some pre-screening assessments at their location. Pre-screening will be', 'offered because the majority of the research participants will likely not be from our geographic region. Travel', \"and housing costs will be the research participant's financial responsibility. Therefore, we would like to allow a\", 'pre-screening process to avoid those who would be ineligible after review of standard medical assessments', 'having to travel to Louisville at their expense. They will also have the option to have all the pre-screening', 'assessments conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center in Louisville.', 'If they choose the pre-screening option, the clinical coordinator will request their medical history related to', 'their spinal cord injury that may include surgical and medical records from their initial injury; spinal cord MRIs,', 'DXAs, hospitalizations and/or surgeries they have had since their injury; and medical records from their', 'physician visits that document their overall health. We will also have them fill out a self-report of their medical', 'status. If they have not had a spinal cord MRI within 3 years, we may request they obtain one. We will request', 'a drug screening test. If they are female, they will be asked to obtain a pregnancy test. All medical tests will', 'be covered by the research study using a pre-paid credit card loaded with the costs of the tests. The clinical', 'coordinator will obtain pricing and send a gift card pre-loaded with the funds for the testing to avoid any', 'insurance billing or out of pocket expense. The clinical coordinator will work with the potential research', 'participant to identify the medical location for the tests and the costs and will provide the pre-paid credit card', 'for payment. The individual can decide if they would like to conduct all or some of these medical tests at their', 'location.', 'These records will be reviewed by the study doctor and he/she may request consultation from Drs. Boakye,', 'Neimat and/or Hirsch. The study physician(s) will provide a medical recommendation to Dr. Harkema as to', 'whether they should be invited to the screening process. If the study physician(s) approve the screening and', 'the potential research participant chooses to come to Louisville to complete the screening, the clinical', 'coordinator will contact the individual and identify the dates for their screening. The research staff will then', 'work with the research participant to schedule their screening assessments at Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury', 'Research Center.', 'C. Screening (2nd consent). If the individual is potentially eligible for the study, as determined from', 'the pre-screening assessments, from the KSCIRC Screening (UofL IRB 07.0224) or had chosen from the info', 'session to have all screening assessments done onsite at the Neuroscience Collaborative Center, and is', 'Version Date: 02/08/2019', 'Page 9 of 61']['interested in participation, he/she will be consented for screening. If the individual has had prior assessments', 'these will be used by the investigators in the screening process to determine eligibility so all assessments', 'listed may not be done to avoid unnecessary repetition. The investigators of this project, Dr. Maxwell Boakye,', 'Dr. Neimat, Dr. Glen Hirsch, Dr. Alexander Ovechkin, Dr. Claudia Angeli, and Dr. Susan Harkema, will', 'participate in the initial screening of the research participants. All eligible SCI research participants will be', 'invited to the Neuroscience Collaborative Center at Frazier Rehab Institute to discuss the complete protocol', 'and its risks and benefits with Dr. Harkema and/or Dr. Angeli. Dr. Harkema and/or Dr. Angeli will verbally', 'review all other assessments that will occur and explain that the research participant can refuse any of the', 'assessments and discontinue their participation at any time without penalty. Dr. Harkema and/or Dr. Angeli will', 'answer any questions the potential research participant or family members may have in relation to the', 'research. All potential risks will be discussed with the potential research participant.', \"The potential research participant will be assessed for medical eligibility by the research team's\", 'neurosurgeon, cardiologist and study physician. The study physician will conduct a medical history and', 'physical examination and determine medical eligibility based on the clinical inclusion criteria (#1-4, see section', 'IV.A below) and exclusion criteria (#1-6, see section IV.A below) and consideration of the risk assessment', 'specific for the individual based on their medical history and examination. Following medical clearance for the', 'assessments and participation in the screening portion of the study by the study physician, the potential', 'research participant will undergo behavioral, neurophysiological, and cardiovascular assessments (Appendix', '#1). Pre-usual care assessments may also be done during the screening visit to reduce the number of study', 'visits for participants who do not live locally. Potential study eligibility will be determined by the investigators', 'based on the evaluation of these assessments to be consistent with the inclusion criteria (#5-9, see section', 'IV.A below). The research participant will then be seen by the study cardiologist who will review the medical', 'record and the cardiovascular assessments. The study neurosurgeon will then review their medical history', 'and the MRI and provide a preliminary recommendation for surgical implantation. Drug/Nicotine Testing: The', 'intent is to avoid nicotine users. If a potential research participant tests positive for nicotine during the', 'screening period or the post-usual care/pre-implant assessments, they will be ineligible for the study. After', 'implantation, we will conduct random nicotine testing using a urine sample and levels will be recorded.', 'Nicotine testing will then be done daily until levels are negligible and then weekly for one month. If nicotine', 'levels remain absent, testing will return to random testing. The individual will not be removed from the study', 'after implantation but nicotine levels will be monitored and if detected, levels will be recorded.', 'Dr. Harkema and/or Dr. Angeli will meet with the potential research participant at the end of the screening', 'and review the results of the assessments and discuss their eligibility. If they are ineligible, the reasons will be', 'explained and they will be asked if they would like to remain in the database for recruitment in future studies. If', 'they are eligible, then all the potential risks will be discussed with them. They will be informed that if they are', 'still interested in participating in the study the next phase is for them to continue with their current daily', 'activities for at least 80 days without any intervention (Usual Care). In some cases an additional pregnancy', 'test may be done if the pre-screen and screen time points are more than 6 months apart.', '2. Usual Care (3rd Consent). If the individual is determined to be eligible for the Usual Care period of', 'the study, as determined by the screening assessments, he/she will be consented for Usual Care. The Usual', 'Care period will last for at least 80 days without any intervention and the participant will continue with his/her', 'current daily activities.
