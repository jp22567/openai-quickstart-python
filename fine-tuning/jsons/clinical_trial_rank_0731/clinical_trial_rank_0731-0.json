Overall and Specific Aims', 'We propose to understand the role of lumbosascral spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) in recovery of', 'autonomic nervous system function, voluntary movement, and standing in individuals with severe spinal cord', 'injury (SCI). Thirty-six individuals with severe SCI who have cardiovascular and respiratory dysfunction and', 'who are unable to voluntarily move their legs or stand will receive scES for cardiovascular function, voluntary', 'movement, or standing with and/or without weight-bearing stand. Training will consist of practicing voluntary', 'movements or standing in the presence of specific scES configurations designed for the voluntary movements', 'of the legs and trunk (Vol-scES), or epidural stimulation configurations specific for standing (Stand-scES).', 'Specific configurations epidural stimulation for cardiovascular function (CV-scES) will be provided during sitting', 'and supine and during maneuvers of orthostatic or cardiovascular stress. Ability to move voluntarily, stand, as', 'well as cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual function will be assessed in these individuals', 'with chronic severe spinal cord injury. Quality of life and costs of health care also will be assessed.', 'An estimated 270,000 newly injured Americans are living with spinal cord injury (SCI) [1], and the prognosis', 'for those with complete motor paralysis is particularly poor. Such injuries are often accompanied by', 'cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction, and attendant medical, personal, and', 'economic impacts can be devastating. We will test hypotheses related to neural control of human movement', 'and cardiovascular function after human SCI, while also obtaining knowledge for optimizing spinal cord', 'epidural stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We will work to quickly translate scES to larger numbers of', 'patients with SCI, many of whom currently lack treatment options for the secondary consequences of their', 'injuries. We will also assess the effect of scES on quality of life and health care costs.', 'Specific Aim 1: Understand the effect of epidural stimulation alone using specific configurations on', 'outcomes for voluntary movement, cardiovascular function, and independent standing.', 'Specific Aim 2: Understand the effect of epidural stimulation in combination with stand training on outcomes', 'for voluntary movement, cardiovascular function, and independent standing.', 'Specific Aim 3: Understand the effects of scES alone and scES with stand training on respiratory, bladder,', 'bowel, and sexual function.', 'Specific Aim 4: Assess the impact of scES and training on quality of life.', 'Specific Aim 5: Measure impact of SCES and training on healthcare resource utilization.', 'We will recruit and enroll 36 participants who have non-progressive SCI, who are 18 years of age or older,', 'and who have been injured for at least 2 years. They will not be able to voluntarily move all single joints of the', 'legs, and will have cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction. They will be randomized', 'into one of four different treatment interventions among two groups.', 'Group A: Receive one of the following interventions:', '1) Specific scES parameters optimized for successful voluntary movement (Vol-scES) during voluntary leg', 'movement and trunk mobility training while sitting or lying supine.', '2)', 'Specific scES parameters optimized for maintaining normal systolic blood pressure during scES (CV-', 'scES) during sitting or lying supine.', 'Group B: Receive the same SCES as the three interventions as Group A with the addition of Stand-scES', 'during weight-bearing stand training.', 'After at least 80 sessions of the interventions, Group A will then receive at least 80 sessions of the same', 'scES as in the first 80 sessions with the addition of Stand-scES during stand training. Group B will repeat the', 'same interventions that were done in the first 80 sessions. This trial will allow us to determine the degree of', 'functional gain, below injury voluntary control, and recovery of autonomic function that can be gained as the', 'result of activation of spinal circuits with scES with or without weight bearing stand training with Stand-scES in', 'humans with severe paralysis. We will compare scES alone to scES with weight bearing stand training to both', 'identify optimal parameters and to determine whether stand training is needed to achieve improvement in', 'cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel, and sexual function as well as the ability to move the legs', 'voluntarily and the ability to stand. In addition to securing scientific advances, our proposed experiments are', 'critical to translating this novel therapeutic approach to a larger scale, and to expand its clinical impact.', 'Version Date: 02/08/2019', 'Page 2 of 61']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
