Under normal conditions,', 'these locations require particular management and have a significant impact on the health-', 'related quality of life (physical, functional, emotional impact) (4-6). As this is such an important', 'factor for the patients it is often higher ranking than corresponding disease indexes.', '6.1', 'Background and Rationale', 'Palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) is a rare condition in which erythematous and scaly plaques', 'studded with sterile pustules persist on the palms or soles. The disease is chronic and very', 'resistant to treatment. It is much more common in those who smoke (or have smoked in the', 'past). PPP is a disease of adults and is rare in children. It usually starts in the fifth or sixth', 'decade of life, although age of onset can also be earlier.', 'In most series, there has been a predominance of women. The disease presents itself with', 'one or more well-delineated scaly erythematous plaques. Within this plaque, pustules are', 'present, usually 2-5mm in diameter. Fresh pustules are yellow; older ones are yellow-brown', 'or dark brown as the pustule dries up. Eventually, the desiccated pustule is exfoliated. Usually,', 'pustules in all stages of evolution are seen. Itching is variable, but often serious; often, the', \"patients report a 'burning' discomfort in the lesions. On the hands, the thenar eminence is the\", 'predilection site. On the feet, the instep, the medial or lateral border of the foot at the level of', 'the instep, or the sides or back of the heel are frequently involved. A striking symmetry of the', 'lesions on the hands or feet is common, but sometimes a solitary lesion may persist for weeks', 'or months before other lesions appear. Additionally, patients are often unable to walk or to', 'work due to the pain and thus are severely affected in activities of daily life (7).', 'Palmoplantar pustulosis is a therapeutically challenging condition that can significantly impact', 'patient quality of life (8). It often affects smokers, but quitting smoking does not always help', 'clear the disease. Apart from intense topical therapy (with or without occlusion), phototherapy,', 'and psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), oral retinoids (acitretin) have traditionally been the first', 'drug of choice. Phototherapy including PUVA therapy has the disadvantage, apart from', 'cancerogenicity, that it has to be performed several times per week at an outpatient clinic or a', 'private practice of a dermatologist. Acitretin is usually not given to girls and women of', 'childbearing potential due to its teratogenic potential that persists for up to three years after', 'discontinuation of the drug. Methotrexate or cyclosporine have been described to be effective', 'in PPP in some patients as well (9-12). Alternative treatment options for patients with PPP who', 'do not respond to conventional antipsoriatic therapies include the use of antimycotics (13) or', 'antibiotics (14), which have been described in single case reports and studies.
