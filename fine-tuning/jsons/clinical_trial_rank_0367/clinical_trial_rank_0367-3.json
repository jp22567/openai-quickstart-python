It is related to', 'disequilibrium in the angiogenic balance, resulting from abnormal homeostasis between the factors involved', 'in the activation phase and those involved in the maturation phase of angiogenesis. ENG (Endoglin) and', 'ACVRL1 encoding ALK1 (Activine receptor like kinase 1) genes are responsible for 90% of cases of HHT.', 'These genes both intervene in the signaling pathway of the Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) family', 'in endothelial cells.', 'The recognized manifestations of HHT are all due to abnormalities in vascular structure. Lesions may be', 'small (telangiectases) or large arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Telangiectases and AVMs vary widely', 'between individuals and even within the same family. Epistaxes are spontaneous, very variable, recurrent in', '90% of patients, and associated with severe anemia in 2-10%.
