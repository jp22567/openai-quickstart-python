TS was', 'thought to be a psychogenic disorder until improvement with neuroleptics was first observed in', 'the 1960s, leading to the theory of central dopaminergic hyperactivity as a possible mechanism', 'of tics associated with TS. When the symptoms impair function, most physicians utilize alpha', 'adrenergic drugs (guanfacine, clonidine), typical neuroleptics (haloperidol, pimozide,', 'fluphenazine), or atypical neuroleptics (olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole) to control tics', '(Gilbert and Jankovic 2014, Wijemanne et al 2014).
