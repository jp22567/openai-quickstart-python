While a significant proportion of GPP cases are associated', 'with deficiency of IL-36Ra, also known as DITRA, approximately 51% to 84% of patients', 'reported no mutation of the IL-36RN. Other genetic defects have also been associated with GPP,', 'including mutations in the APIS3 and CARD14 genes (Mahil 2016; Jordan 2012; Ohkawara', '1996).
