The IL-36 cytokines', '(IL-36a, IL-36\u00df, and IL-36y) engage with IL-36R to initiate signaling events leading to', 'pro-inflammatory responses. IL-36 signaling is counter balanced by IL-36Ra, an IL-36 receptor', 'antagonist that binds to IL-36R and competes with activity of IL-36 cytokines. Mutations in the', 'gene encoding the IL-36Ra (IL-36RN) result in uncontrolled activation of the IL-36 pathway', 'leading to the development of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP), a severe and life-threatening', 'disease (Marrakchi 2011, Benjegerdes 2016). As such, inhibition of IL-36 signaling, by targeting', 'IL-36R with a specific mAb, may represent a novel strategy to control the pathological', 'inflammatory cascade driven by the IL-36 pathway activation. ANB019 is being developed as a', 'potential first-in-class therapy for GPP, palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP), and other', 'inflammatory diseases where the IL-36 pathway might play a pathogenic role.', '2.1', 'Study Rationale', 'This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of ANB019 in', 'subjects with GPP. Generalized pustular psoriasis is a severe, debilitating, and life-threatening', 'systemic inflammatory disease (Marrakchi 2011, Benjegerdes 2016). Skin lesions manifest with', 'widespread sterile pustules on erythematous skin over large BSAs. Skin rash is accompanied by', 'high fever, general malaise, leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and frequently', 'includes functional extracutaneous organ involvement that might lead to mortality (Marrakchi', '2011). The IL-36 is associated with acute and chronic inflammation and has been shown to play', 'a key role in pathogenesis of GPP. Several studies have identified GPP-associated IL-36RN in a', 'subset of GPP patients (Marrakchi 2011; Onoufriadis 2011; Sugiura 2012; Capon 2013, Navarini', '2017). These mutations disrupt the inhibitory function of IL-36Ra, leading to uncontrolled', 'IL-36R activation. Other genetic defects have also been associated with GPP, including', 'mutations in the APIS3 and CARD14 genes (Mahil 2016; Jordan 2012; Farooq 2013). Regardless', 'of mutations, activation of the IL-36 pathway has been associated with a sustained inflammatory', 'response in pustular psoriasis suggesting a key role of IL-36 in inflammatory skin diseases.', 'Currently there is no approved therapy for GPP. Treatment options are limited to existing plaque', 'psoriasis (PP) and systemic immunomodulatory therapies, which have limited and inconsistent', 'efficacy (Benjegerdes 2016). ANB019 is an mAb that specifically binds the IL-36R and', 'antagonizes IL-36 signaling. Therefore, inhibition of IL-36 signaling by blocking IL-36R may', 'provide a novel strategy to control the pathological inflammatory cascade driven by IL-36', 'pathway in patients with pustular psoriasis.
