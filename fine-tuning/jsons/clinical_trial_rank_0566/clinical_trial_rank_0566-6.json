The presentation and severity of symptoms can differ greatly by patient and by the', 'form of ichthyosis, but generally include skin inflammation and fragility, pruritus, fissuring and', 'cracking of thickened skin, ectropion, anhidrosis, and in some severe cases, an increased', 'susceptibility to infection. Recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI), which occurs at a frequency of', 'about one in 2500 (in males), is clinically characterized by widespread, dark brown, polygonal', 'scales, and generalized dryness (2). The diagnosis can be confirmed using genetic testing to', 'identify a complete deletion of the gene encoding steroid sulfatase (STS) that is located at the', 'terminus of the X chromosome (3). Autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis-lamellar ichthyosis', '(ARCI-LI), which occurs at a frequency of about one in 100,000 to 300,000, is a member of the', 'nonsyndromic autosomal recessive CI group which manifests itself clinically as hyperkeratosis', 'and dry, scaling skin across the entire body (4); pathogenesis is related to a severely disturbed', 'barrier function due either abnormal corneocytes or to a defective deposition of stratum corneum', 'lipids and is typically caused by truncation or missense mutations in the gene encoding', 'keratinocyte transglutaminase type 1 (TGM1) (1, 4).', 'Isotretinoin is a \"natural\" retinoid (13-cis isomer of naturally occurring tretinoin [all-trans-retinoic', 'acid {RA}]) that was initially developed as a synthetic retinoid, but it is also present in cells as a', 'naturally occurring metabolite (5). Isotretinoin is structurally and pharmacologically related to', 'vitamin A, which regulates epithelial cell growth and differentiation (6).
