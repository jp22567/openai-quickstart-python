The analgesic', 'activity of opioids is mediated via central mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the central nervous', 'system (CNS). However, MORs are also present on endothelial cells\u00b9 and in human tumors', '(peripheral MORs), including lung2-4 and prostate\u00b3 cancer. Compelling pre-clinical studies', 'indicate that expression and activation of peripheral MORs are associated with tumor', 'progression in animal models. Recent clinical studies raise the possibility that opioid exposure', 'is also associated with tumor progression in patients with various malignancies including lung', 'cancer. See section 1.7.
