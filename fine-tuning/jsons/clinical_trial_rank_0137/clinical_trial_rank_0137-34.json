{"prompt": "['Alliance A221504', 'Optional Sample Collections for Laboratory Studies and/or Biobanking for', 'Possible Future Studies', 'Researchers are trying to learn more about pain, cancer, and other health problems. Much of this', 'research is done using samples from your blood or tissue. Through these studies, researchers', 'hope to find new ways to prevent, detect, treat, or cure health problems.', 'Some of these studies may be about genes. Genes carry information about features that are found', 'in you and in people who are related to you. Researchers are interested in the way that genes', 'affect how your body responds to treatment.', 'If you choose to take part in this study, the study doctor for the main study would like to collect', 'blood for research on substances in the body that cause pain and others that relieve pain. Researchers', 'would also like to study samples from your lung cancer tissue that were obtained from you for', 'diagnosis. The tissue will be analyzed for factors that are involved in causing pain and others that', 'are involved in promoting tumor growth. We are asking for your permission to store and use', 'your samples and related health information (for example, your response to cancer treatment,', 'results of study tests and medicines you are given) for medical research. The research that may', 'be done is unknown at this time. Storing samples for future studies is called \"biobanking\". The', 'Biobank is being run by the Alliance Biorepository at Mayo Clinic and supported by the', 'National Cancer Institute.', 'WHAT IS INVOLVED?', 'If you agree to take part, here is what will happen next:', '1) About two extra teaspoons of blood will be collected from a vein in your arm once', 'before starting the study medication and twice more (at about 3 and 6 weeks) after', 'you start the study medication). All these blood samples will be collected at the time', 'you are giving blood samples for routine (usual) tests related to your anti-cancer', 'therapy. You will NOT have to undergo extra needle sticks to provide blood samples', 'for these laboratory studies.', '2) In addition, a sample from the tissue that was collected previously at the time of your', 'biopsy or surgery will be sent to the Biobank. You will NOT be asked to undergo', 'another biopsy to provide tissue for these laboratory studies.', '3) Your sample and some related health information will be sent to a researcher for use', 'in the study described above. Remaining samples may be stored in the Biobank, along', 'with samples from other people who take part. The samples will be kept until they are', 'used up.', '4) Qualified researchers can submit a request to use the materials stored in the Biobanks.', 'A science committee at the clinical trials organization, and/or the National Cancer', 'Institute, will review each request. There will also be an ethics review to ensure that', 'the request is necessary and proper. Researchers will not be given your name or any', 'other information that could directly identify you.', '5) Neither you nor your study doctor will be notified when research will be conducted or', 'given reports or other information about any research that is done using your samples.', '6) Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in central databases that', 'may be public, along with information from many other people. Information that', 'could directly identify you will not be included.', '71', 'Update 2', 'Version Date 6/25/2019']['Alliance A221504', 'WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS?', '1) The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and', 'possibly a bruise.', '2) There is a risk that someone could get access to the personal information in your', 'medical records or other information researchers have stored about you.', '3) There is a risk that someone could trace the information in a central database back to', 'you. Even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique', 'to you. The researchers believe the chance that someone will identify you is very', 'small, but the risk may change in the future as people come up with new ways of', 'tracing information.', 'HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE?', 'Your privacy is very important to the researchers and they will make every effort to protect it.', 'Here are just a few of the steps they will take:', '1) When your samples are sent to the researchers, no information identifying you (such', 'as your name) will be sent. Samples will be identified by a unique code only.', '2) The list that links the unique code to your name will be kept separate from your', 'sample and health information. Any Biobank and Alliance for Clinical Trials in', 'Oncology staff with access to the list must sign an agreement to keep your identity', 'confidential.', '3) Researchers to whom Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology send your sample and', 'information will not know who you are. They must also sign an agreement that they', 'will not try to find out who you are.', '4) Information that identifies you will not be given to anyone, unless required by law.', '5) If research results are published, your name and other personal information will not', 'be used.', 'WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS?', 'You will not benefit from taking part in these laboratory studies. The results may help other', 'patients in the future.', 'ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS?', 'There are no costs to you or your insurance. You will not be paid for taking part. If any of the', 'research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not share in any', 'profits.', 'WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND?', 'If you decide you no longer want your samples to be used, you can call the study doctor,', ', (insert name of study doctor for main trial) at', '(insert telephone number of study doctor for main trial) who will let the researchers know. Then, any', 'sample that remains in the bank will no longer be used and related health information will no', 'longer be collected. Samples or related information that have already been given to or used by', 'researchers will not be returned.', '72', 'Update 2', 'Version Date 6/25/2019']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
