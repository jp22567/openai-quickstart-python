{"prompt": "['The standard therapy for patients with hemophilia A is intravenous (IV) FVIII replacement', 'therapy with recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) products or plasma-derived Factor VIII (pdFVIII)', 'concentrates. FVIII replacement treatment regimens can be broadly categorized into two', 'types: episodic or on-demand therapy (in which FVIII concentrates are administered in', 'response to the occurrence of bleeding symptoms) and prophylactic (in which they are', 'administered on a scheduled basis to prevent the onset of bleeding symptoms). Prophylaxis', 'has been shown to markedly reduce the bleed rate in adult patients with severe hemophilia', 'A (Manco-Johnson et al. 2013; Valentino et al. 2012). Prophylactic therapy aims to maintain', 'FVIII activity levels above 1% or higher and effectively prevents the onset or progression of', 'hemophilic arthropathy by providing a minimum concentration of FVIII to avert spontaneous', 'bleeding, particularly in the case of repeated bleeding into joints. The treatment regimens', 'used to achieve optimal prevention of bleeding events vary on an individual basis; some', 'patients will need trough FVIII levels of 1%, whereas others require higher trough FVIII levels', 'to achieve the desired therapeutic outcome (Ahnstr\u00f6m et al. 2004; Collins et al. 2010).', 'Current standard prophylactic regimens commonly use infusion therapy administered three', 'times weekly; other regimens require every other day administration, depending on the', \"patient's needs (Shapiro 2013). In developed countries, the availability and overall utilization\", 'of FVIII prophylaxis has increased in recent years due to the therapeutic advantages', 'conferred by this type of therapy and expansion of the rFVIII concentrate supply (Geraghty', 'et al. 2006). In such countries, the current standard of care for children with severe', 'hemophilia A is primary prophylaxis, which involves regular FVIII infusions that are started', 'following their first bleed, or by 2 years of age, with the aim of avoiding the development of', 'any joint abnormality in the future (Astermark 2003; Manco-Johnson et al. 2007).', 'The required adherence to demanding therapeutic regimens, that involve frequent morning', 'infusions to achieve adequate hemostatic coverage during periods of highest activity,', 'reduces patient compliance thereby making these regimens less effective and compromising', 'their cost-benefit ratio (Thornburg 2010). Major issues with current regimens are the need for', 'adequate venous access and patient/family compliance with regular prophylaxis, especially', 'in the very young pediatric population. In this population, central venous access devices', '(CVADs) have been used to overcome technical difficulties. Although CVADs make', 'prophylaxis feasible in young children, they are associated with complications, including', 'mechanical failure, dehiscence of the skin over the reservoir, infection, and thrombosis', '(Ewenstein et al. 2004). In addition, significant healthcare provider (HCP) efforts are required', 'to manage optimal treatment solutions and to overcome identified issues (Schrijvers et al.', '2013). Thus, both the disease and potential therapeutic options have the potential to affect', 'HRQoL, the latter through limitations on daily activities.', 'The development of inhibitory alloantibodies (inhibitors) occurs in approximately 20%-30%', 'of patients with severe hemophilia A and in 3%-13% of those with moderate or mild disease', '(Franchini and Mannucci 2013). Inhibitors neutralize the activity of endogenous FVIII as well', 'as of FVIII administered as replacement therapy. For patients with a history of a high-titer', 'inhibitor (= 5 Bethesda units [BU]/mL) following a re-challenge with FVIII administration', '(high-responding inhibitor), the only hemostatic options currently available are pro-', 'thrombotic coagulation factors that augment other parts of the coagulation cascade (i.e.,', '\"bypassing agents\"). Bypassing products include Factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity', '(FEIBA), an activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC; FEIBA will be referred to as', 'Emicizumab - F.

Both of these products have been used as prophylactic therapies to prevent', 'bleeding in patients with inhibitors against FVIII. However, in most countries, the only', 'available product for this indication is the aPCC FEIBA.', 'aPCCs may be associated with side effects, such as thromboembolic events,', 'hypersensitivity reactions, myocardial infarction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation', '(Bui et al. 2002; Dentali et al. 2011; Tj\u00f8nnfjord 2004; W\u00f3jcik et al. 2009). Both aPCC and', 'rFVIla are administered intravenously, with aPCC prophylaxis requiring every other day', 'dosing and rFVIla requiring daily (or more frequent) dosing.', 'The development of effective prophylactic treatment options with less frequent dosing', 'requirements is a high, unmet medical need in the population of patients with hemophilia A', 'with FVIII inhibitors. Reducing the time and burden associated with frequent IV dosing and', 'the impact of the disease on aspects of physical health and other areas of functioning and', 'well-being, while promoting increased efficacy, may further improve HRQoL. This hypothesis', 'is supported by a study in which patients receiving a prophylactic treatment with FEIBA had', 'improved HRQoL than those who received episodic therapy (i.e., administered following', 'bleeds) with FEIBA (Gringeri et al. 2013). Therefore, despite major therapeutic advances in', 'the treatment of hemophilia A, opportunities still remain to optimize and transform therapy, in', 'particular for patients with inhibitors.', '1.2', 'BACKGROUND ON EMICIZUMAB', 'Emicizumab (also known as ACE910, CH5534262, and RO5534262) is a recombinant,', 'humanized, bispecific, immunoglobulin G4 (lgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds with', 'moderate affinity to activated Factor IX (FIXa) and Factor X (FX), thereby mimicking the co-', 'factor function of FVIII. In patients with hemophilia A, hemostasis can be restored', 'irrespective of the presence of FVIII inhibitors, as emicizumab shares no sequence', 'homology with FVIII. Emicizumab therefore has no potential to induce or enhance the', 'development of direct inhibitors to FVIII or other coagulation factors. In addition, emicizumab', 'offers the possibility of SC administration, removing the need for venous access. Finally,', 'because of the expected pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of this antibody, markedly', 'extending the dosing interval to once weekly or even more, this compound has the potential', 'to improve the treatment of patients with hemophilia A with and without FVIII inhibitors who', 'are in need of effective, safe, and convenient prophylactic therapy.', '1.2.1', 'Preclinical Experience', 'As mentioned above, emicizumab binds with moderate affinity in the low M range to FIXa', 'and FX and mimics the co-factor activity of FVIII.
