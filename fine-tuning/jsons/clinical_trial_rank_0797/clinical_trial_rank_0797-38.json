The gene', 'that encodes FVIII is located on the X chromosome. Genetic defects are expressed through', 'X-linked recessive inheritance or de novo FVIII mutations, and more than 99% of hemophilia', 'patients are males. The prevalence of hemophilia A is approximately 1 in 5,000 live-born', 'males or 1 out of every 10,000 live births (CDC 2016; Franchini and Mannucci 2013;', 'NIH 2013). No racial differences have been reported, and the numbers of patients registered', 'in 2014 in various regions included 4,870 in Japan, 21,052 in North America, and 11,029 in', 'just two European nations (United Kingdom and France) (World Federation of Hemophilia', '2014).', 'Hemophilia A is most commonly caused by an inherited FVIII gene mutation within the Xq28', 'region of the X chromosome. It occurs almost exclusively in males who have one defective', 'copy of the relevant gene on their X chromosome. As an affected male will transmit a normal', 'Y chromosome to all his sons and an abnormal X chromosome to all his daughters, his sons', 'will not be affected and all of his daughters will be carriers. For female carriers, with each', 'birth there is a 50% chance to transmit the disorder to male infants and a 50% chance for', 'female infants to be a carrier. Females who are carriers of hemophilia A may experience', 'bleeding symptoms similar to those seen in men with mild hemophilia A, as approximately', '10% of carriers have a FVIII activity that is less than 35% (Plug et al. 2006). Rarely, women', 'have more severe bleeding symptoms requiring treatment and may develop FVIII inhibitors.', 'Approximately 30% of patients with hemophilia A do not have a family history of the disorder;', 'these cases arise from spontaneous FVIII gene mutations.', 'The main bleeding sites are intra-articular, intramuscular, subcutaneous (SC), intraoral,', 'intracranial, gastrointestinal, and intranasal (Karaman et al. 2015; Srivastava et al. 2013).', 'Repeated intra-articular bleeding is a major factor that decreases health-related quality of life', '(HRQoL) in patients with hemophilia A, because it may progress to hemophilic arthropathy', 'with walking difficulties, and joint replacement surgery may eventually be necessary.', 'The absence or functional deficiency of FVIII leads to a lifelong bleeding tendency.

The severity of hemophilia A is classified in accordance with endogenous FVIII', 'activity in the blood. Patients with FVIII activity of less than 1% have severe disease, those', 'with activity between 1% and 5% have moderate disease, and those with activity greater', 'than 5% and less than 40% have mild disease.
