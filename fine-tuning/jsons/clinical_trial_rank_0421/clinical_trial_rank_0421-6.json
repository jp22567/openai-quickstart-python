The CNGA3 gene encodes the alpha subunit of the cone', 'photoreceptor-specific cGMP-gated cation channel, which is critical for cellular responses to light.', 'Absence of this alpha subunit results in absent/extremely poor cone function and hence very poor', 'daylight vision. Although loss of cone photoreceptor cells may occur in a limited number of patients,', 'the rate of cell death is very slow, resulting in retinas containing surviving but non-functioning cones.', 'Improvement of cone function by provision of CNGA3 could provide a clear, rapid and reliable measure', 'of outcome. Furthermore, the relatively non-progressive nature of Achromatopsia, with extended', 'survival of cone photoreceptors, means that the window of opportunity for effective intervention by', 'gene supplementation may extend into adulthood.
