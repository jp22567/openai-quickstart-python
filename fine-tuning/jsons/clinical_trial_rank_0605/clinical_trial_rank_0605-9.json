Upon activation, Akt, also a serine/threonine kinase, proceeds to phosphorylate', '(and thereby inactivate) tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (Tsc2) [88]. Tsc2, along with its counterpart', 'tuberous sclerosis protein 1 (Tscl), form the Tscl/Tsc2 complex. When activated, the Tscl/Tsc2', 'complex acts as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) for Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain', 'protein), thus inhibiting it. When the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex is neutralized through Akt activation,', 'however, resultant Rheb disinhibition leads to activation of mTOR and formation of mTORC1.', 'Activated Rheb is not, however, capable of increasing mTORC2 activity. In fact, little is known', 'about upstream activators of nTORC2.', 'mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) consists of the proteins mTOR, raptor (regulatory associated', 'protein of mTOR), Pras40, and mLST8 [83]. Raptor is critical for mTORC1 function (it is an', 'adaptor protein and binds to and presents substrates to the catalytic region of mTOR). In', 'particular, raptor binds S6K and 4EBP, allowing them to undergo phosphorylation by mTORC1.', 'Raptor is also an area that itself undergoes phosphorylation to modulate mTOR activity by', 'proteins such as AMPK, p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and mTORC1 itself. Raptor also acts', 'as a regulatory subunit of mTOR and can be phosphorylated at a variety of serine residues by', 'enzymes such as AMPK and ribosomal S6 kinase, and Rheb to either promote or inhibit', 'mTORC1 activity. The remaining mTORC1 proteins serve either a scaffolding or regulatory', 'capacity. Deptor is a protein that is able to independently bind and negatively regulate mTORC1.', 'mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin, which competes with raptor to bind the FRB domain of', 'mTOR [89]. mTORC1 has a variety of important functions, many of which have been', 'characterized by using rapamycin. Perhaps the two most notable and well-described substrates of', 'mTORC1 are 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, both of which are phosphorylated by mTORC1 [83].

HIF is an important', 'molecule that is involved in the expression of a variety of genes that modulate angiogenesis,', 'erythropoiesis, and metabolism. As the name implies, HIF is activated under hypoxic conditions.', 'mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) is only similar in structure to mTORC1 in that it contains m TOR', 'and the protein mLST8.

Chronic', 'exposure does inhibit mTORC2 activity through disruption of new mTORC2 complex assembly', '[103]. In fact, only rictor that is newly synthesized can be affected by rapamycin; thus, existing', 'mTORC2 complexes appear to be all that is resistant to rapamycin therapy [89]. That said,', 'chronic rapamycin treatment results in suppression of Akt and PKC signaling through a', 'reduction in mTORC2.', 'As of yet, the upstream signaling pathway of m TORC2 is relatively unknown. There is some', 'evidence that mTORC2 may be activated through either PI3K signaling or through crosstalk with', 'mTORC1 via p70S6K [102]. Also, some data suggest that m TORC2 may be positively regulated', 'by the Tsc1/Tsc2 complex in a fashion that is independent of its inhibitory activity on mTORC1', '[102, 104].

This is particularly interesting because it may help to explain', 'why lesions that are seen when Tscl or Tsc2 is lost (as in tuberous sclerosis) are benign and not', 'cancerous. Because mTORC2 may be jointly regulated by Tsc1/Tsc2 (positively) and', 'mTORC1/p70S6K (negatively), when mTORC1 is constitutively active (such as in tuberous', 'sclerosis) these feedback loops aid in dampening Akt activation [102].', 'One target of mTORC2 is protein kinase C-alpha (PKC), which, through phosphorylation, has its', 'activity, stability, and localization regulated [89]. Among the many known functions of PKC,', 'perhaps the most notable with regards to neuronal activity is its regulation of synaptic plasticity.', 'PKC also is involved in cell growth and actin cytoskeletal organization [105], regulation of ion', 'channels [106], modulation of GABAA receptor function and trafficking [107, 108], and', 'calcium-dependent vesicular signaling in astrocytes [109].
