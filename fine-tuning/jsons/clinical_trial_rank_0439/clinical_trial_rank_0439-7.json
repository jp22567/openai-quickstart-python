Varicella (chickenpox)', 'shortly occurs after primary VZV infection and is characterised by systemic illness and a', 'widely disseminated rash. Herpes Zoster (HZ, shingles) occurs when VZV reactivates', 'from latency and typically manifests as a localised, dermatomal rash. The typical HZ rash', 'usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks and is usually accompanied by pain; that is often described as', 'burning, shooting, or stabbing, and pruritus, which can also be severe, may be as', 'common as pain. In some patients, even touching the affected area lightly may cause', 'severe pain, a phenomenon known as allodynia. The most common complication of HZ is', 'postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain that persists after the resolution of the HZ', 'rash. Patients affected by PHN typically report constant burning, throbbing, intermittent', 'sharp or electric shock-like pain, or allodynia. PHN tends to improve over a period of', 'months and about 70-80% of cases resolve within 1 year. However, in some persons PHN', 'persists for many years [Dworkin, 2007].', 'Inclusion of subjects in clinical trials may be biased for various reasons, e.g.', 'inclusion/exclusion criteria, selection of patients by investigators, self-selection of', 'patients. As such, the aim of this study is to explore if the subjects in the ZOSTER-006', 'and ZOSTER-022 studies were representative of an older adult population. This will be', 'done by exploring the baseline frailty status and quality of life scores of subjects within', 'the studies.', 'Several studies have demonstrated that the incidence and severity of HZ increases with', 'age [CDC, 2008]. It is also likely that the incidence and severity of HZ is higher in frail', 'subjects. However, as with age vaccine efficacy may somewhat lower in frail subjects.', 'This study will therefore allow a synthesis of the benefit of vaccination in frail subjects,', 'i.e. in terms of increased incidence, vaccine efficacy, safety and immunogenicity.', '1.1.1.', 'Risk factors for herpes zoster', 'Several risk factors for developing HZ have previously been identified, amongst which', 'the age of the individual is the most common. The incidence of HZ is relatively constant', 'at 2-3 cases per 1000 persons per year until age 40, and then increases progressively with', 'age: At 50-59 years of age (YOA) the incidence is about 5 cases per 1000 persons per', 'year, and it increases to 10 cases per 1000 persons per year in people > 60 YOA [CDC,', '2008]. Half of all HZ cases occur in subjects over the age of 60, and individuals who', 'reach 85 years old have a 50% chance of having HZ during their lifetime [Oxman, 2005].', 'Age has also been demonstrated to be a risk factor for the development of PHN amongst', 'patients with HZ [Oxman, 2005; Scott, 2006; Kanbayashi, 2012; Kawai, 2015].', '11-FEB-2019', '21', '70882527ffe6806e42bab9a20b06541da11028ce']['CONFIDENTIAL', '204878 (ZOSTER-064)', 'Protocol Administrative Change 3 Final', 'A second factor that has been consistently related to HZ development is the presence of', 'immunosuppressive conditions [Cohen, 2007; Buchbinder, 1992; Langan, 2013].
