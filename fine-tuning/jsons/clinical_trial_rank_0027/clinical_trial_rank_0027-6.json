The current standard of care for', 'the management of peanut allergy is peanut avoidance, and education of the patient and', 'family on recognition and management of allergy symptoms and appropriate use of rescue', 'medications (eg, epinephrine auto-injectors).', 'Despite efforts at strict peanut avoidance, accidental exposure remains a major concern', 'because allergic responses may be triggered by minute quantities (milligrams) of peanut', 'protein. Strict adherence to an avoidance diet can be complicated by difficulty in interpreting', 'food labels (Joshi, 2002), the presence of undeclared or hidden allergens in commercially', 'prepared foods (Vierk, 2002; Altschul, 2001), and inattention to or mistrust of food warning', 'labels (Vierk, 2007). Foods prepared outside the home (eg, at school, daycare centers,', 'restaurants, homes of family/friends) present additional sources of accidental exposure.', 'Accidental food allergen exposures are common, with 55% of peanut-allergic patients', 'experiencing at least 1 allergic reaction over approximately 5 years (Sicherer, 1998).
