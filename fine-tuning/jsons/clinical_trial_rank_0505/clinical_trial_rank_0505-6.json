The study will enroll up to 1500 subjects from 50-150 sites in geographic regions', 'of ST product distribution over a two-year period. Physicians will recruit subjects during routine care visits', 'and assess whether subjects with chronic pain are candidates for medical cannabis treatment. Once enrolled,', 'subjects will be followed for 1 year to collect data on demographics, chronic pain classification, cannabis', 'experience, treatment goals, concomitant medication(s), ST treatment regimen, clinical assessment, subject-', 'reported outcomes, and safety.', 'The study includes five physician-verified visits (baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 months), and four at-home', 'subject-verified follow-ups (months 1, 3, 6, 10). Physician verified follow ups can be conducted in person', \"or via telemedicine. Additionally, should there be a need, according to the physician's judgement, there\", 'may be other unscheduled visits, either in-clinic, or via telemedicine. All data will be collected using', 'REDCap Cloud via online eCRFs. The study time-points were selected based on the typical timeframe of', 'titration in routine care, and adverse event (AE) emergence for the use of cannabis products in new subjects;', 'a majority of titration occurs within the first month of taking a new cannabis product29. Visits were also', 'spaced out so that subject retention may be maximized, and treatment adjusted in a timely manner.

A pregnancy test will be administered', 'to women of childbearing potential, and the site physician or study site personnel will confirm subject', 'eligibility criteria. Following this, the site physician or study site personnel trained in the use of REDCap', 'Cloud will assist each subject in creating a REDCap Cloud account and completing the baseline assessment', '(Appendix 1).
