The average life expectancy in IPF patients is 3-5 years (U07-1248-', '07). Nintedanib (OFEV) is a small molecule anti-fibrotic kinase inhibitor (PDGF/R [platelet', 'derived growth factor/receptor], FGF/R [fibroblast growth factor/receptor], VEGF/R', '[vascular endothelial growth factor/receptor]) that has been developed for the treatment of', 'IPF. Theoretical and pharmacological models suggest that inhibition of these kinase receptors', 'may interfere with the fibrotic signaling cascade. OFEV was approved as a treatment for IPF', 'in 2014.', '1.2', 'DRUG PROFILE', 'Nintedanib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and', 'non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs).
