The motor cortices in the left and right hemispheres of human brain are strongly', 'interconnected, with each side naturally inhibiting the activity of the other side - and achieving', 'a natural balance. If one side is lesioned as in stroke, however, its activation is decreased and', 'its inhibition to the other side is reduced, leading to increased activation in the non-lesioned', 'side. Additionally, the non-lesioned side still provides inhibitory signals to the lesioned side,', 'even more than in the prior healthy balance situation. This mismatch leads to a condition where', 'the lesioned hemisphere cannot easily deliver action potentials to the lower motor neuron and', 'the corresponding muscles. As result, the ability to participate in motor training which is', 'necessary for recovery of function is severely challenged.', 'Still, there is ample evidence that rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task', 'practice (task-oriented therapy) results in long-term functional recovery.
