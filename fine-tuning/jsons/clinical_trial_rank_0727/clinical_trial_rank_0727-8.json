Subjects will be noted as positive', 'responders if the participant experiences a decrease in numeric pain scores of at least 50% at least 15', 'minutes after the injection. All subjects with a positive response will be eligible for the study.', 'Subjects randomized to CRFA will be placed in a supine position on a fluoroscopy table with a pillow', 'under the popliteal fossa to alleviate discomfort. The true AP fluoroscopic view of the tibiofemoral joint will', 'be obtained to show the tibiofemoral joint space with equal width interspaces on both sides. An', 'appropriately sized cooled radiofrequency needle will be placed overlying the affected knee joint and', 'using fluoroscopic guidance, the needle will be advanced to a bony endpoint on the superiolateral portion', 'of the femoral condyle of the affected knee. A second needle will be advanced to a bony endpoint on the', 'superiomedial portion of the femoral condyle. A third needle will be advanced to the bony endpoint at the', 'inferiomedial portion of the tibial condyle. The final needle will be placed at the midline of the femur about', '2 cm cephalad of the upper patellar border. Lateral x-ray views should be taken to confirm appropriate', 'location at 50% depth of the femur and tibia prior to lesioning. Care should be taken to avoid inserting the', 'RF probe into the inferolateral area of the knee to avoid the common peroneal nerve and potential foot', 'drop. If pooling of blood or fluid is seen in the stylet, aspirate and reposition as necessary.', 'AP and lateral x-ray views should be taken during the procedure which show all the needles in final', 'positioning for maintenance in the source documentation. Motor stimulation must be tested at 2.0 volts', 'with no leg movement. Sensory stimulation should be conducted at < 0.5 volts in all four locations with', 'concordant pain reproduction. A mixture consisting of lidocaine (1% or 2% preferred) should then be', 'slowly injected. Then, radiofrequency ablation of each of the four targeted geniculate nerves will be', 'conducted at 60\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds at each of the 4 anatomic locations.
