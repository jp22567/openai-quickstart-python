Severe worry in late-life carries a significant health care risk.', 'Worry is defined as a complex affective and cognitive process, negative-affect', 'laden, and relatively uncontrollable [6].

Severe worry is also associated with', 'interruption in functioning and reduced quality of life and with a higher risk of all-', 'cause mortality in midlife and late-life.', '2. Severe worry in late-life responds poorly to traditional interventions.', 'Traditionally, severe worry has been confined to categories such as Generalized', 'Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), multiple lines of', 'research support the presence of severe worry in several other anxiety and mood', 'disorders. Thus, while GAD is built around the concept of severe, uncontrollable', 'worry, only 20% of severe older worriers qualify for a GAD diagnosis. This evidence', 'supports a major recent shift in the conceptualization of worry as a transdiagnostic', 'entity most suitable for dimensional investigations. Current late-life GAD treatment', 'choices, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant', 'pharmacotherapy, have proven moderately efficacious in reducing overall burden of', 'anxiety but ineffective in reducing worry severity. The ineffectiveness of current', 'treatments in reducing worry severity may be at the root of the chronic, relapsing', 'course of late-life GAD, which is one of the least likely mental disorders to remit and', 'most likely to relapse.', '3. Novel circuit-based targets for intervention.', 'Several neuroimaging studies have investigated both activation and functional', 'connectivity among various brain regions involved in GAD - in adolescents and', 'young adults. Our team has published exclusively on the neural markers of GAD in', 'older adult participants. Also, very few studies used fMRI paradigms specifically', 'tailored to induce worry or analyzed specifically the effect of worry severity at rest or', 'during task.
