Baseline laboratory studies will be drawn at screening,', 'including Blood Counts: hemoglobin, platelets; Iron Tests: iron, TIBC, ferritin; Thyroid Test: TSH;', 'and Von Willebrand Tests (VWF:RCo (activity), VWF:Ag, VIII:C, multimers, and VWF genotype).', 'Before initiating treatment, subjects will be trained by the HTC nurse on 1) reading urine', 'pregnancy tests and 2) completion of the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC), cycle severity', 'score (CSR), and cycle length (CL); and 3) completion of patient diary.
