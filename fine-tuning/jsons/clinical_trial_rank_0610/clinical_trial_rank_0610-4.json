The VWF gene is', 'located on the short arm of chromosome 12 and is encoded by an 8.7 kb VWFmRNA expressed by vascular', 'endothelial cells and bone marrow megakaryocytes (3). Typical bleeding symptoms include mucosal', 'bleeding in the oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract (1-3). Among women with VWD,', 'the most common symptom is heavy menstrual bleeding, or menorrhagia, occurring in more as many as', '80% (3-5).', 'Menorrhagia is associated with significant morbidity, including iron deficiency anemia up to two-thirds,', 'early hysterectomy, and reduced quality of life (4-5, 17-19). Among women with menorrhagia, the', 'prevalence of VWD is 5-20%, with overall prevalence of 13% (4-5, 20). These figures may underestimate', 'the true prevalence of menorrhagia, as it may not be recognized as symptom of a coagulation disorder or', 'not readily diagnosed, as the extragenic influences of blood group, exogenous estrogens, and stress, may', 'increase VWF and lead to apparently normal VWF studies (2-3). Menorrhagia is defined as menstrual', 'bleeding exceeding 80 cc/month, a level at which progressive iron loss and iron deficiency anemia occur', '(19). The health burden of menorrhagia is high, with excess days lost from work, lifestyle disruptions,', 'psychologic morbidity, poor quality of life, and increased health care costs (17-18).

Finally, although', 'the severity of nonspecific bleeding in VWD is measured by BSS, and BSS correlates with VWF:RCo level', '(3, 28, 29), neither PBAC nor menorrhagia severity appear to correlate with VWF levels (26, 27).', 'The lack of effective treatment for menorrhagia is a major unmet health need among women with', 'bleeding disorders (5, 6), and as such constitutes a major public health problem (5, 17, 23).
