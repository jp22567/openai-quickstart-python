Sexual Function Assessments', 'Research participants may feel uncomfortable answering questions regarding sexual health and function. A', 'private room will be used to complete the questionnaires and it will be explained to the participant that he/she', 'may refuse to answer any question that makes him/her feel uncomfortable.', 'i.', 'Safety Features and Additional Assistance During Standing with TPAD', 'A. Hardware:', 'a. Emergency Stops: Three emergency stops are available to stop the power to the motors, in case of an', 'adverse event. These are available to the research participant, PT/Physician, and trainers. In case of an', 'unexpected situation, the power to the motors can be shut down abruptly. In this case, the tension in the', 'motors stops at its current value. The user and/or personnel can back drive the motor to free the user', 'from the cables and allow the individual to sit.', 'b. Device Exit: The device is designed with an \"easy exit\" configuration. In case of an emergency or need', 'for quick sitting and exit, the motors can be turned off and the individual can perform an assisted transition', 'from standing to sitting onto their wheelchair within approximately 30 seconds. Also, the belts can be', 'subsequently removed within a minute.', 'C. Ergonomics: The TPAD attachments for knees, pelvis and trunk are cushioned to ensure comfort and', 'appropriate gripping while wearing. This reduces any contact stress and/or pinching. All parts near the', 'user will be covered with protective foam and all electrical wires are mounted on the side of the aluminum', 'frame, away from the user.', 'd. Additional external assistance: Trainers will have immediate access to reach the research participant and', \"provide additional manual assistance if needed. Moreover, if the participant's lower limb, trunk, and upper\", 'limb control is insufficient to safely use the TPAD system for standing, he/she will be further assisted', 'using a safety harness, which is a backup for fall prevention. In case of motor failure, user slippage or', 'fall, the safety harness is capable of providing body weight support up to 300lbs or 136 kg. Body weight', 'support may be also applied if needed. If so, it will be gradually decreased and removed, as appropriate,', 'to allow participants to safely stand with minimal assistance.', 'e. Electrical Outage: The system consists of all commercially available parts, and is powered by an AC', 'outlet. In case of power failure or outage, the power to the motors and system are automatically shut off,', 'thus turning the system off. In this case, the motors stop at their current configuration and can be manually', 'manipulated by the user or personnel. The motors used in this system are high quality DC motors. All', 'electrical components are grounded and properly insulated. The connectors and cables are properly', 'shielded. The motors are mounted to an aluminum frame which is also grounded to reduce electrical', 'interference. The only part in contact with the patient is a PVC (plastic) coated steel cable, which reduces', 'any possible electric conductivity.', 'B. Software:', 'The device is controlled by a computer program. Safety guidelines are programmed to ensure safe', 'functionality of the motors/system. These ensure that forces applied to the user stay within a specified limit.', 'This limit is controlled and determined by the operating personnel. This can be in the form of percent body', 'weight force, limiting all forces to be applied within safe limits. The forces can also be turned off immediately', 'with a click of a button.', '7. Interventions', 'a. Stand, Step and Voluntary Intervention', 'The skin integrity will be checked, and the joints will be examined for swelling or redness after every', 'assessment and training session. Before and after every experiment and training session, a physical therapist', \"or activity-based technician will examine the subject's skin for irritations and abrasions. If skin irritations or\", 'abrasions are caused by the recording or stimulating electrodes, or hand placements of trainers, electrode and', 'hand placement will be modified appropriately.

If needed the study physician or nurse practitioner will be notified and', 'will also examine the individual. Immediate medical care will be provided when necessary.', 'Blood pressure and heart rate will be routinely measured. If the individual displays symptoms of syncope', '(dizziness, light headedness, darkening of vision) during standing, stepping or voluntary assessments, they will', 'be immediately returned to sitting position and if necessary their legs raised above the heart. If the individual', 'displays symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia (sudden pounding headache; sweating, generally above level of', 'lesion; unease; flushed/reddened face; goose-bumps below the level of the lesion; cold/clammy skin below the', 'level of the lesion; stuffy nose) during standing, stepping or voluntary assessments, the activity will be ceased', 'immediately. Staff will Identify and relieve the noxious stimulus (i.e. stop stimulation, check catheters, check', 'harness,', 'check shoes and shocks). If the stimulus cannot be identified the study physician or nurse practitioner', 'will be notified and will also examine the individual. Immediate medical care will be provided when necessary.', 'b. Cardiovascular Training Intervention', 'Participants will stimulate at home based on configurations that have been studied and determined safe in the', 'lab. In the laboratory environment all configurations will be tested with EMG and continuous blood pressure', 'and ECG monitoring to evaluate the effects of the stimulation on cardiovascular parameter. Research', 'personnel will set limits on frequency and voltage of stimulation to make sure participants remain within safe', 'ranges of stimulation. We do not anticipate any added risks of stimulation in the home environment as', 'stimulation parameters will be limited to those thoroughly tested in the lab. If participants present unstable or', 'inconsistent responses to stimulation in the laboratory they will be required to train in the lab under the', 'supervision of a research staff member. Home training will not be allowed until the effects of stimulation on the', 'cardiovascular system is well understood for each participant and the research team is confident that', 'stimulation at home will be safe.', 'C. Respiratory Training Intervention', 'Prior to each respiratory training day, brachial arterial blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and', 'assess of participant readiness will be obtained. We also request and check that each participant has', 'catheterized bladder before the training day begins. The standard training day regimen involves six breathing', 'sessions that are five minutes in duration while the participant is seated upright in their personal', 'wheelchair. We assess additional blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels after each five-', 'minute training periods during the standard three-minute break between sessions. We allow enough rest time', 'for the blood pressure and heart rate to return to baseline before beginning the next five-minute session. On', 'one training day per week we will record beat-by-beat blood pressure and heart rate continuously to observe', 'changes during each five-minute breathing sessions. Since functional ability varies between participants, we', 'monitor how each participant tolerates the standard training regimen. If a participant has trouble completing', 'six full five-minute sessions, we decrease the number and duration of the training sessions until the participant', 'acclimates to the standard regimen. Additionally, the pressure threshold level on the training device is', 'increased gradually and in accordance with participant performance and readiness. During respiratory training', 'sessions, participants will be closely monitored for any signs of dizziness, lightheadedness, shortness of', 'breath, fatigue, and significant changes in blood pressure. Should any of these symptoms occur, the training', 'session will be stopped, and the participant will be allowed as much time as needed to recover until the', 'symptoms have abated before beginning again. Each occurrence and abatement of symptoms will be', 'recorded in the training notes. If any training related symptoms persist and/or worsen, the training day will be', 'cancelled, and the research medical team will be contacted. At this point the research nurse and/or study', 'physician will examine the participant and manage care appropriately.
