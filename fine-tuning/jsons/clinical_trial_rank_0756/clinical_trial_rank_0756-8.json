Recruitment.', 'Recruitment for each proof of principle study will be based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria (Section', 'III.A); current availability (study being open to enrollment) and order of registration in our research database.', 'Potential research participants will be identified by our research database (UofL IRB# 06.0647) that currently', 'contains over 6,000 individuals.

Pre-Screening.', 'If the potential research participant agrees to screening, we will give them the choice to conduct some pre-', 'screening assessments at their location.

Participants may', 'require additional blood work, a urine test, nasal and peri-rectal swabs to determine infection risk for surgical', 'implantation (i.e. if participant tests positive for MRSA, they may not be eligible for immediate participation). All', 'medical tests will be covered by the research study using a pre-paid credit card loaded with the costs of the', 'tests. The clinical coordinator will obtain pricing and send a pre-paid card pre-loaded with the funds for the', 'testing to avoid any insurance billing or out of pocket expense. The clinical coordinator will work with the', 'potential research participant to identify the medical location for the tests and the costs and will provide the', 'pre-paid credit card for payment. The individual can decide if they would like to conduct all or some of these', 'medical tests at their location.', 'These records will be reviewed by the research nurse and she/he may request consultation from the', 'research physician, neurosurgeon and/or cardiologist.
