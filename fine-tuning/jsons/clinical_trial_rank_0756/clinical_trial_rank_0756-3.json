To date, most intervention studies following SCI have focused on', 'plastic changes occurring within the corticospinal tract alone, neglecting the potential impact of other', 'extrapyramidal pathways on the recovery of motor function.

Interestingly, following human SCI, and in the', 'absence of training interventions, these non-pyramidal pathways already exhibit plastic changes, with non-', 'pyramidal pathways strengthening after injury as potential compensation for the loss of corticospinal input [35-', '38].
