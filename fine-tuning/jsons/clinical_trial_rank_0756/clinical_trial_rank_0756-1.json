In addition to motor paralysis, these injuries are also', 'accompanied by cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, and attendant medical,', 'personal, and economic impacts can be devastating. The current treatment paradigm is to provide', 'compensatory therapeutic interventions which focus on improved function above the spinal cord lesion, with', 'the singular hope that in the future some regenerative approach - perhaps using stem cell technologies - will', 'reach clinical trials. The hope of stem cell-based interventions is a lingering one, precisely because it is thought', 'that re-establishing anatomical connectivity of supraspinal input to the spinal cord is essential for recovery of', 'movement and autonomic function. In this proposal, we challenge 1) the concept that movement and', 'autonomic function can only be restored by re-establishing anatomical connections from supraspinal to spinal', 'neurons; and 2) that those with the most severe injuries including those with clinically motor complete SCI', 'have essentially no hope of neurologic recovery, even with therapeutic intervention.', 'Also, the mechanisms discovered from these early feasibility studies can be translated into new therapeutic', 'approaches that may not need to use epidural stimulation for those who are treated early after intervention of', 'have more incomplete injuries. This approach provides potential therapies for the most severely injured', 'individuals but also knowledge about the nervous system following injury that can be used for all those who', 'have paralysis.', 'Individuals with complete motor paralysis suffer from a myriad of complications that result in mortality,', 'morbidity, hospitalization, high burden of care and health care costs, and a drastically lowered quality of life.', 'We propose to demonstrate that spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) can be used to recover significant', 'levels of autonomic control of cardiovascular, respiratory, bladder, bowel and sexual function, as well as the', 'ability to stepping, standing and to voluntarily control leg movements below the injury level. This intervention', 'would provide an immediate therapeutic alternative to individuals who now have no recourse for treatment, and', 'the expected reduction in SCI-related healthcare and caregiver costs would be dramatic. The U.S. could save', 'an estimated $400 billion on direct and indirect lifetime costs if we can develop therapies to treat SCI. Also, the', 'cost in emotional stress and well-being to the individual and family is demanding.', 'From a scientific perspective, this novel intervention challenges the long-held belief that with the', \"development of the primate's cortex, the spinal cord became solely a conduit to carry signals from the brain to\", 'execute movement.', 'Version: 01/07/2022', 'Page 3 of 167']['Study Title: Task and physiological specific stimulation for', 'recovery of function after severe spinal cord injury', 'In the context of studies of human locomotion, we made the astonishing observation that four individuals', 'who had been diagnosed as clinically motor complete (unable to voluntarily activate muscles below their level', 'of lesion) developed the ability to voluntarily move their toes, ankles, knees and hips only in the presence of', 'tonic scES of the lumbosacral spinal cord when also receiving intense locomotor training [2]. Even more', 'surprising, over a period of months, they reported improvements in temperature regulation and bladder and', 'bowel function and normalization of sexual function.

First, the observation that precise', 'coordinated voluntary movement after complete paralysis can be executed only in the presence of epidural', 'stimulation demonstrates a key role for the spinal circuitry. Second, the function of residual anatomical', 'connections that are clinically undetectable can reach neural activation and functional significance via activity-', 'dependent plasticity via scES and task specific training.

Motor Control', 'Spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES) has been applied alone in a number of individuals with clinically', 'complete spinal cord injury (SCI), showing that some alternating stepping-like actions can be induced [3]. scES', 'has been used in combination with repetitive stepping on a treadmill for facilitation of walking-like movements', 'after an incomplete lesion in two individuals showing stepping could be sustained for a longer period of time', 'with less effort in the presence of scES [4]. This report provides promising results of a combination of', 'locomotor training and scES.

Several recent findings suggest that a combination of scES and locomotor', 'training in individuals with clinically complete SCI could be very successful for the recovery of standing and', 'walking. Locomotor-like patterns can be facilitated by scES in complete spinally transected rats [6], cats [7],', 'and humans with clinically complete SCI [8].
