{"prompt": "['Study Title: Task and physiological specific stimulation for', 'recovery of function after severe spinal cord injury', 'been demonstrated that the reticulospinal pathway appears to be strengthened [36, 57]. Additionally, this has', 'also been shown in individuals with deficits in the corticospinal tract without motor weakness, indicating that this', 'tract may allow for motor compensation in the presence of reduced descending corticospinal input [58]. Lastly,', 'only very recently has it been demonstrated that the reticulospinal pathway is responsible for gross finger', 'movements following human SCI [59], however, it remains to be determined whether the integrity of this pathway', 'below the level of a complete lesion can account for other types of motor recovery following human SCI, and', 'whether the excitability of this pathway can be altered with interventions.', 'Vestibulospinal Pathway', 'Vestibular information is pertinent in balance control during a variety of movements. The vestibular apparatus', 'consists of the semicircular canals and otolith organs within the ears. These irregularly firing afferents provide', 'information about angular velocity, linear acceleration and velocity of the head [31]. The role of the', 'vestibulospinal pathway in human movement control has best been elucidated through the use of galvanic', 'stimulation (GVS). GVS directly modulates the firing of vestibular afferents and produces a signal of head', 'movement that has a whole-body effect on motor responses. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that only', 'muscles engaged in a balance task are modulated by GVS and that the response is distributed in response to', 'the load placed on the limb [31]. Additionally, small changes in posture such as shifts in body weight and', 'distance between feet can drastically alter the amplitude of the responses. When comparing the effects of GVS', 'during a variety of different tasks such as overground walking, treadmill walking, standing and bicycling it', 'becomes apparent that the vestibulospinal pathway likely plays a greater role in tasks where changes in the', 'centre of mass and base of support are dynamic [60-62]. Additionally, the lack of effect of GVS during cycling', 'again reiterates its role in balance control, despite similar muscle activations in ankle muscles during walking', 'and cycling [61]. Lastly, when comparing walking to standing, although there are similarities in the responses', 'to GVS there are also some notable differences. Namely, there appears to be different patterns of muscle', 'activity depending on the task (coactivation and increased involvement of muscles around the ankle joint', 'during walking) [60-62]. Finally, studies examining changes in the efficacy of transmission along the', 'vestibulospinal pathway after SCI are very few. In one study it was demonstrated that GVS-evoked responses', 'in the trunk muscles correlated well with the level of impairment of the individual [63]. Additionally, when', 'examining GVS-evoked responses in the leg muscles the magnitude of responses was similar to those of non-', 'injured participants, however the latency of the responses was significantly delayed indicating compromised', 'transmission of the vestibulospinal signals [29]. However, it is important to note that in all these studies only', 'individuals with incomplete SCI were examined. In a more recent study examining motor complete SCI', 'individuals, vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials were only elicited in the legs of 2 individuals, however, the', 'authors highlight the need to refine the experimental protocol which utilizes a different method to elicit', 'vestibulospinal responses [53]. Nevertheless, this study highlights that even after a severe SCI (AIS A/B)', 'there', 'may still be residual vestibulospinal pathways below the level of the lesion. Therefore, the likelihood of', 'strengthening these residual pathways with ES and training exists and perhaps underlies the recovery of such', 'tasks like independent standing and walking which require greater balance control.', 'Propriospinal Pathways', 'As one of several components that form part of the motor pathway, the propriospinal pathway includes', 'interneurons that link several segments of the spinal cord and consists of both short and long projections within', 'the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord. The short propriospinal neurons span only a couple segments,', 'while the long ascending and descending pathways allow coupling between the cervical and lumbar', 'enlargements with cell bodies originating in C3-4 and terminating in L2-5 and vice versa. After injury, and', 'subsequently during recovery, marked plasticity within the propriospinal system can contribute to functional', 'reorganization following SCI in animal models [64-67]. More specifically, after an incomplete injury in the rat,', 'corticospinal tract axons were shown to exhibit sprouting to both short and long propriospinal neurons [65]. Of', 'interest, only contacts with longer propriospinal neurons that bridged the lesion were maintained [65]. These', 'long propriospinal neurons arborized onto lumbar motoneurons facilitating recovery of locomotion in these', 'animals [65]. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that propriospinal circuitry undergoes significant', 'remodeling after injury. In a delayed, staggered hemisection model in mice, it has been demonstrated that a', 'Version: 01/07/2022', 'Page 9 of 167']['Study Title: Task and physiological specific stimulation for', 'recovery of function after severe spinal cord injury', 'relay of short propriospinal neurons in the thoracic spinal cord can provide an alternative route to bypass the', 'lesions and allow transmission of neural signals that can facilitate locomotor recovery [67]. The', 'pharmacological ablation of thoracic propriospinal neurons abolishes the recovery of stepping in these same', 'animals [IEEE Trans Neural Syst Rehabil Eng. 2019 Sep;27(9): 1855-1864 doi:', '10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2933381. Epub 2019 Aug 5.67]. Additionally, this pathway can be shaped by training', 'interventions, with increased labelling of short propriospinal neurons in quadrupedal step-trained rats where', 'cervicolumbar coupling would be targeted [68].', 'In humans, propriospinal pathways account for a large proportion of the fibres within the spinal cord, with a', 'greater percentage of fibres in the lumbar spinal cord attributed to this pathway [27]. While most research has', 'focused on the cervical (C3-4) propriospinal pathways [69, 70], some have demonstrated interlimb reflexes in', 'humans as well [32, 37, 71-74]. Specifically after human SCI, interlimb reflexes thought to be mediated by', 'propriospinal neurons appear to undergo plastic changes following injury [37, 38, 74-76]. The link between the', 'excitability of these likely propriospinally-mediated interlimb reflexes and functional neurophysiological', 'assessment (FNPA) or ASIA scores has not been examined, despite the interesting finding that the more', 'rostral the lesion, the greater the gain in locomotor function following SCI [77]. This finding indicates that the', 'circuitry within the spinal cord that enables locomotor activity is not restricted to one specific segment of the', 'spinal cord, but rather spans a network of intersegmental pathways. In humans, it is well established that CPG', 'mechanisms contribute to locomotion and that afferent feedback modulates this activity [78-84]. It has also', 'been suggested that the phase and task-dependent modulation of various reflexes in the upper limbs during', 'arm cycling indicate a similar CPG organization to that describing locomotion of the legs [34, 85-87]. In', 'addition, strong evidence has shown the existence of task-dependent coupling between arm and leg muscle', 'activity during walking, crawling and swimming [33]. During treadmill walking, interlimb reflexes in both arms', 'and legs evoked by cutaneous nerve stimulation were phase-modulated during the walking cycle and task-', 'dependent [88]. Additionally, reciprocal organization of reflex responses from hand to foot and from. foot to', 'hand were observed. Taken together, these findings have suggested the existence of coupled neural', 'oscillators, with two controlling arm movements, and another two controlling leg movements [33]. This coupling', 'may explain why following SCI, gait is significantly improved when patients are able to utilize arm swings in', 'combination with body-weight supported locomotor training [89, 90]. Additionally, following incomplete cervical', 'SCI, rhythmic arm motions were able to elicit locomotor muscle activity in leg muscles [91]. Therefore, it is', 'apparent from numerous findings that innate circuitry within the spinal cord can generate rhythmic, patterned', 'muscle activity at various levels of the spinal cord that involve both the arms and the legs. Additionally,', 'strengthening the cervicolumbar coupling within the cord may translate to greater recovery of locomotor', 'function following SCI [25, 92] because it incorporates this circuitry along the spinal cord rather than utilizing a', 'discrete network at a specific level of the spinal cord. Therefore, it is highly likely that the recovery of stepping', 'following ES and locomotor training in individuals with complete SCI could arise through strengthening of these', 'long propriospinal pathways.', 'B.
