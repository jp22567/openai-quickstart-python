Medical Events Unrelated to the Study', 'A medical event is defined within our program as \"any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a', 'human research participant that occurs during the same time period the research participant is enrolled in the', 'study and is not study related and is not serious.\" It is an anticipated medical issue that is unfortunately', 'common to individuals with chronic spinal cord injury and can occur daily, weekly monthly, or several times a', 'year. These medical events can include urinary tract infections, kidney stones, hypotension, autonomic', 'dysreflexia, skin sores and pressure sores with prolonged healing, joint swelling, joint soreness, joint sprain,', 'ligament sprain, fracture, infections (non-UTI), spasticity and falls. Our standard operating procedure is that if', 'any of these medical issues arise while directly participating in our research, if not immediately resolved, the', 'study physician is notified, and the individual is referred to the appropriate medical care. This medical care can', \"be provided by our study physician or their colleagues or by the medical specialist of the research participant's\", 'choice. The study physician can medically treat the issue to resolution, if appropriate, and the research', 'participant chooses the study physician as their clinical choice for medical treatment. In this case the study', 'physician would notify the principal investigator only if the medical issue affects their medical eligibility in the', 'study or any of the research assessments or training paradigms. If another physician treats the medical issue', 'the study physician or nurse practitioner will follow the individual to only assess whether the medical condition', 'affects their medical eligibility in the study or any of the research assessments or training paradigms and will', 'notify the principal investigator. All non-study related medical events are followed by the research team and', 'will be reported to the IRB at the time of the continuing annual review.
