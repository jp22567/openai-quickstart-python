About 80% of affected patients complain of pruritus (Gottlieb, 1998). The psoriatic', 'appearance of the skin is initiated by an antigen presenting cell (APC) - T-cell interaction', 'leading to the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines (Nestle, 2009). In time, this leads to an', 'increased rate of epidermal proliferation with impaired differentiation of keratinocytes, resulting', 'in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum.
