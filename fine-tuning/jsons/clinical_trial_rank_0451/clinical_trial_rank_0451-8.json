The general risk of serious adverse events during CPET is low at 0.0 to', '8.3 per 10,000 tests. 14-23 Pre-screening minimizes the risk to almost negligible levels.', 'Exercising at submaximal intensities, such as during aerobic exercise training, carries', 'with it an even lower risk of serious adverse events that is not greater than that occurring', 'during routine activities or exercising in unsupervised settings.', 'To minimize risk and maximize safety, subjects will be evaluated by medical history and', 'physical examination, ECG, Doppler cardiac echocardiography, and pulmonary function', 'tests with DLCO, to exclude those with contraindications to exercise prior to initial', 'CPET. During CPETs, subjects will be monitored by continuous 12-lead EKG and before', 'beginning the tests subjects will be informed of the signs and symptoms of heart disease', 'and questioned frequently during the test regarding their presence. Staff with training', 'appropriate for exercise testing and training will supervise CPET and training sessions for', 'individuals with chronic illnesses, credentialed by the NIH Clinical Center, Rehabilitation', 'Medicine Department, in which the testing and training procedures will take place.', '2.
