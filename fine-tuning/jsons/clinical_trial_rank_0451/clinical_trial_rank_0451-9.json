{"prompt": "['4. Fatigability Tests: Subjects are instructed to walk as far as possible around an 80-meter', 'circular corridor in 10 minutes. The major risks to this test are stumbles and falls, which', 'could result in sprains, strains, fractures, contusions, and concussion. Additional risks', 'include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, pallor, diaphoresis, heart attack, cardiac', 'arrest and sudden death similar to the CPET.', 'To maintain the safety of participation in this test, all Fatigability tests will be conducted', 'after the CPET, which imposes volitionally maximum cardiovascular stress. Only', 'subjects able to tolerate the CPET without clinical signs and symptoms of cardiovascular', 'disease will be enrolled in the study. Therefore, subjects will have demonstrated their', 'ability to tolerate exercise intensities and stress greater than that imposed by the 10-', 'minute walk test. Credentialed staff with expertise in exercise testing will conduct the 10-', 'minute walk test. Subjects will sit immediately following the test to avoid falling in the', 'event they would become dizzy after strenuous exercise.', '5. NIRS Test with Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxygenation Capacity Test: The near', 'infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) test involves placing infrared light emitters and sensors on', 'the belly of the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle. These are held in place by a sticky cement', 'and are often covered with an elastic wrap to help hold them in place. The light itself', 'does not cause burns and we could find no reports of any untoward events regarding the', 'use of NIRS. Some very minor risk may be due to minor skin breakdown under the', 'emitter/sensor patches. This usually resolves in a few hours to several days and is usually', 'not painful or uncomfortable.', 'This test also involves total occlusion of blood flow just above the knee. Subjects may', 'experience pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the lower leg during the test. To diminish', 'these effects, occlusion time will be kept minimal, after observing complete', 'deoxygenation of the gastrocnemius muscle (not more than 10 minutes). No ischemic', 'injury is associated with this test due to the high anaerobic capacity of skeletal muscle', 'and the short occlusion time.', 'Arterial occlusion for measures of reactive hyperemia is a non-invasive and safe', 'technique commonly used in patients with peripheral vascular disease. We are using', 'arterial occlusion in our current interstitial lung disease (ILD) protocol. Of the 16', 'participants who have completed the ILD study, three participants did not participate in', \"the arterial occlusion due to Raynaud's Syndrome and one requested to stop due to\", 'discomfort. All participants fully recovered within minutes of cuff removal with no', 'reports of residual pain or discomfort after leaving our facility. There have been no', 'adverse events from arterial occlusion in our lab. It is a well-accepted procedure deemed', 'safe and tolerable.', '6. Bioimpedance Cardiography (ZCG) Test: This test involves passing a small,', 'unnoticeable electrical current between electrodes of known distance on the thorax and', 'back. The voltage and amperage of the current is below the threshold for perception or', 'stimulation of action potentials in skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle and sensory, motor', 'or CNS neurons. We could find no reports of adverse events due to use of the ZCG. Risks', 'are basically those associated with skin breakdown due to sliver/silver chloride electrode', 'patch contact with the skin. Some slight itching has been reported in some subjects.', 'These symptoms are minimal and last only for a few hours to a few days.', '7. Treadmill Exercise Training: The risks are those associated with aerobic exercise and', 'treadmill walking in general. These are the risks of provocation of signs and symptoms of', 'SLE and Exercise', '20', 'Leighton Chan', '9/23/2019']['cardiovascular disease including chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness/syncope,', 'diaphoresis, sweating, nausea, heart attack and sudden death. Risks also include', 'contusions, abrasions, concussion, sprains, strains and fractures associated with falling on', 'a moving treadmill. Subjects are likely to experience immediate or delayed muscle', 'soreness due to initiating an exercise-training program after having been sedentary. The', 'onset of muscle soreness typically occurs immediately or within 48 hours and lasts a few', 'days to a week.', 'As a method of establishing her exercise training regimen is within the ranges', 'recommended for safe and effective exercise by the ACSM and as a safety precaution,', 'subjects will have undergone CPET prior to beginning exercise training. The intensity for', 'training will be well below the maximum attained on the CPET and subjects presenting', 'clinical signs and symptoms on the CPET will be excluded from the study. All subjects', 'will be pre-screened and approved for participation by a medical staff member before', 'beginning participation. In addition, treadmills used for training will have handrails and', 'an emergency stop button easily accessible for the subject in the event they begin to fall', \"or need to stop immediately. The stop button is linked to a clip worn on the subject's\", 'clothing and in the event she falls the treadmill will stop immediately preventing further', \"abrasions from a moving treadmill belt. Subjects' treadmill exercise training sessions will\", 'be overseen and monitored by staff specifically credentialed for the supervision of', 'aerobic exercise.', '8. Echocardiography: The use of diagnostic transthoracic ultrasound is not associated with', 'significant risk. There is however the possibility of an allergic response to the gel used to', 'optimize contact of the ultrasound transducer with the skin in a few people. The allergy', 'may present as a rash and/or itching localized to the area of contact and subsides after a', 'few hours to a few days.', '9. PFT with DLCO: Serious risks are not associated with pulmonary function tests or lung', 'diffusion tests. Patients may experience perceptions associated with exertion on the PFT', 'and may feel dizzy and short of breath for a short time after completion of the test.', 'Patients may also experience slight dizziness and shortness of breath during and shortly', 'after the DLCO procedure. In both cases these symptoms are not specific to any emergent', 'condition, unless severe and persistent, and should only last a few minutes following the', 'tests.', '10. Blood draw: The risks are those associated with routine blood draws. These include', 'infection, vein collapse, and the need for multiple sticks. These risks will be minimized', 'by personal credentialed at the Clinical Center for obtaining and handling blood samples.', 'On occasion, some subjects may be come dizzy, nauseous, or may faint at the sight of', 'their own blood. We will instruct subjects to face a different direction during the draws if', 'they are prone to these reactions. If these reactions do occur, subjects will be given', 'appropriate instructions for managing them by the trained technician acquiring the', 'sample.', '11. Electrocardiogram: There is no clinically significant risk associated with this procedure.', 'There may be minor discomfort, when the ECG electrodes taped to chest are removed.', 'Rarely, a reaction to the electrodes may cause redness or swelling of the skin.', '12. Vascular function studies: SphygmoCor, CAVI, and Endopat, (optional). These', 'procedures are very well tolerated.
