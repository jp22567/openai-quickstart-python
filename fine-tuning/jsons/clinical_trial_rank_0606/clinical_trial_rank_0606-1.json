The aorta gives a', 'number of side branches throughout its trajectory from the mediastinum to the chest and abdomen. These', 'branches include the coronary arteries, innominate artery, left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery,', 'celiac axis (CA), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), renal arteries and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and', 'various lumbar arteries. The aorta terminates at the aortic bifurcation where it divides into the common iliac', 'arteries. Several smaller parietal side branches originate throughout the length of the aorta and include', 'bronchial, intercostal, phrenic and lumbar arteries. A number of anatomical variants and accessory', 'branches have been described. Approximately 15% to 30% of individuals have one or more accessory renal', 'arteries. The hepatic arteries can originate as a separate branch from the aorta, or as replaced branches from', 'the left gastric or SMA in 5% to 15% of individuals\u00b9.
