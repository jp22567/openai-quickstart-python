However, prognosis', \"(outcome) remains extremely poor, with most people surviving just over 12 months, and as a patient's\", 'tumour grows patients experience a reduction (decline) in their quality of life. Therefore, we need to', 'ensure quality of life, which remains difficult. The main treatments for GB are surgery, radiotherapy and', 'chemotherapy, given in combination.', 'For patients where it is thought that surgery will benefit, a surgeon often removes as much tumour as', 'possible, whilst limiting the risk of causing damage, such as weakness, speech, or cognitive difficulties.', 'However, which technology a surgeon should use during surgery to remove the tumour safely is unclear.', 'This can affect how soon the cancer returns, what effects of surgery or symptoms a patient develops,', 'and how a patient feels.', 'High frequency sound waves that create an image, called Ultrasound (US), is one of the tools a surgeon', 'can use during the operation to find the tumour and see how much is removed.
