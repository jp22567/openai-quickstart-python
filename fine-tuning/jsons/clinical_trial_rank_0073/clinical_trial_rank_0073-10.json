An', 'unblinded staff member will contact participants regularly to remind them to attend.', 'Group interventions will occur in waves. In order to allow adequate resources for pre-', 'and post-intervention testing with a wave study design, entry into MG and SG arms', 'will be staggered across a month if needed. Slightly staggering group intervention', 'entry (and therefore intervention completion) will prevent a situation where follow-up', 'testing might be delayed due to limitations on scanner time or coordinator effort.

Improvisational dance classes are grounded in', '4 principles that shape the tone of the class and result in a sense of social belonging:', 'non-judgment, non-competitiveness, curiosity, and playfulness. The following', 'training strategies are used to maintain: active imagination, variability, and pacing.', 'Active imagination. Working with imagery is crucial in improvisatory practice.', 'Verbal auditory cues are used to create movement scenarios that cue or activate the', 'motor imagination. Verbal auditory cueing takes primacy over rhythmic entrainment', 'to music, although the music itself may be used as an improvisatory cue. The teacher', 'calls the cue, may demonstrate an optional response, and asks participants to join in', 'with their own gestural inventions. As an example, students might be prompted', 'during the seated warm-up to recreate a beach scene. Verbal auditory cues direct', 'motor imagination by using rich language to act out a beach scenario - laying down', 'beach blankets, putting on sunscreen, opening a picnic basket, setting out lunch on a', 'blanket, running into the ocean, avoiding the shark swimming towards them, etc.', 'Variability. The improvisational method does not aim to learn a specific movement', 'pattern and habituate to it. Cues are delivered quickly, one after another. [64] Within', 'an average of two minutes, tasks requiring quicker decision-making are introduced.', 'Physical challenges are advanced by dual- and multi-tasking, such as being asked to', 'direct traffic with the right side of the body while picking apples with the left.', 'Pacing. This is the rate at which new movement prompts are presented. Quick', 'changes in pace avoid defaulting to habitual responses, thereby facilitating new', 'movement options. Participants cannot rely on copying another, memory, or', 'anticipation to address the motor problem. Verbal cues might be delivered in a rapid-', 'fire manner, for example, to keep participants from reflecting on movement choices,', 'changing their minds, or becoming embarrassed or dissatisfied with the choice made.', 'Use of music. Music is used in different ways in the class. The playlist is random and', 'variable; it may be unrelated to movement instruction and merely ambient. At other', 'times, the music may be an improvisational cue. As examples, students may be asked', 'to dance what comes to their minds listening to Otis Redding\\'s \"(Sittin\\' on) The Dock', 'of the Bay\" and then variations are cued from that initial movement, or \"play\" an', 'instrument they can hear in a complex piece of classical or jazz music. Sometimes,', 'participants themselves create movement through vocalizing or body-based', 'percussive actions. Portions of the class also happen in silence. Unpublished video', 'analysis of previous studies shows that participants are more likely to improvise than', 'follow (entrain to) the beat of any music played.', 'Overall class structure. The general class structure has four phases. These include:', '(1) group warm-up in chairs positioned in a circle, (2) standing barre with solo- and', 'partnering exercises, (3) moving as a group through free space (with and without a', 'partner), and (4) recuperation and rest. If participants are unable for any reason to', 'perform exercises at the barre or move through free space, all exercises can be', 'adapted for sitting The choice to stand or walk is always self-selected by the', 'participant. In fact, this adaptation is common in the weekly community class that', 'Ms. Soriano has taught for 5 years.
