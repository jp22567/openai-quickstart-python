It is critical to develop a better understanding of the costs of delivering mental health', 'care in order to enable efficient and effective allocation of resources, including staff and medications,', 'and to facilitate the integration of mental health care services into other primary care settings', 'throughout Colombia, Latin America, and elsewhere. Measuring the costs of delivering the integrated', 'model of mental health care in the current project will also be important for supporting the long-term', 'sustainability of this model across diverse settings by allowing provider organizations to make', 'informed decisions about staffing and budgeting.', 'It is important to note that measurement of the costs and resources used for delivering the proposed', 'model of care are distinct from the price or fees for providing services or the reimbursement rates for', 'different services. The costs of implementing the model of care are also distinct from the potential cost-', 'benefit of providing mental health care integrated within primary care settings from the individual,', 'payer, or societal level perspective.', 'The Time-driven Activity-based Costing (TDABC) Approach. The costs of implementing the', 'proposed model of care for depression and alcohol use disorders will be measured using the time-', 'driven activity based costing (TDABC) approach. 91,92 The TDABC method of cost measurement', 'involves creating a detailed process map to illustrate every administrative and clinical process activated', 'during the treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders over a complete care cycle. The care cycle', 'refers to the standard treatment course for patients seen at each clinic and typically begins with the', 'moment that patients enter the clinic and continues through to the moment when they leave, and', 'includes any necessary follow-up visits. The TDABC method will be used to determine the costs of the', 'specific human, equipment, and facility resources used for delivering mental health care to patients as', 'part of the model of care.', 'The TDABC approach will involve the following four steps:', \"STEP 1 ('Activities'): First, it is necessary to identify all of the activities, and the personnel who\", 'perform these activities, involved in providing treatment for depression and alcohol use disorders at', '39']['5U19MH109988-02', 'Implementation Research Protocol', 'Scaling Up Science-based Mental Health Interventions in Latin America', 'Version 15.4', 'April 14, 2021', 'each of the clinic sites. This step will require shadowing patients and meeting clinical and', 'administrative staff involved in the care process to determine how much time they spend on each of', 'these activities. Process maps will be created to illustrate the flow of patients, to identify all activities', 'involved in providing care, and to facilitate the remaining steps in the TDABC approach. Separate', 'process maps will be generated for each of the participating clinical sites. A combination of shadowing,', 'surveys of clinic staff, and interviews with staff and administrators will be used to determine the time in', 'minutes required for each activity outlined in the care process.', \"STEP 2 ('People'): This step involves calculating the cost per unit of time for each of the personnel\", 'and equipment used throughout the various activities identified in Step 1. By determining the costs per', 'unit of time, this step generates capacity cost rates. For example, to estimate the cost per minute for all', \"the clinical and administrative staff involved in the care process, an individual's annual compensation\", 'will be divided by the total number of minutes per year that the person is available to work with', 'patients. A combination of surveys and interviews will be used to gather these details.', \"STEP 3 ('Materials'): This step involves measuring the amount of materials, supplies, and\", 'medications that are consumed during the care processes identified in Step 1 and assigning costs to', 'each of these items. Consumables can refer to any type of items that are used during the delivery of', 'care, including latex gloves, test strips, or medications.', \"STEP 4 (Facilities'): This final step involves determining the costs of things that are not directly\", 'consumed during the care process. For example, indirect costs such as the facility costs, electricity,', 'building maintenance and cleaning, administrative costs, and health IT costs.', 'The TDABC approach enables providers to determine the costs of specific care pathways at the', 'individual patient-level. This makes it possible to assess how costs potentially change based on the', \"increasing complexity of patients' conditions (e.g., increasing age, multiple comorbidities, co-occurring\", 'substance use disorder), or as revisions are made to the delivery of care.', 'The TDABC approach can also make it possible to identify inefficiencies in the provision of care, and', 'can inform efforts to move staff to higher value activities in order to improve outcomes for patients. For', 'example, the TDABC approach can illustrate activities in the care process that could be performed by', 'lower-paid staff instead of highly trained and expensive nurses or physicians, thereby enabling the', 'more costly personnel to perform more complex clinical duties. This is especially important in settings', 'where highly trained personnel such as nurses and physicians are in limited supply. Though efforts are', 'necessary to ensure that any tasks that are shifted to different personnel will be performed at the same', 'or higher level of quality.', 'The TDABC approach has been used in several clinical settings in the United States and in Europe, and', 'has contributed to significant improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of care delivery for', 'patients with diverse medical conditions. Through improved resource allocation, the TDABC approach', 'can identify opportunities in the delivery of care to improve value for patients by providing more', 'effective care for each unit of cost. For example, in the current study, the TDABC approach may', 'demonstrate that the proposed model of integrated care for depression and alcohol use disorders', \"contributes to increases in costs. However, by linking cost measurement to patients' clinical outcomes,\", 'it may be possible to demonstrate that the added costs contribute to better outcomes and improved', 'value for patients.', '40']\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "END"}
