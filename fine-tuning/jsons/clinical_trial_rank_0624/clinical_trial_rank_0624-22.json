We intend to ask participants to complete consent forms electronically within', 'REDcap (with appropriate electronic backups).', 'Research assistants will routinely move between study sites to aid in the oversight of participant', 'recruitment, study implementation, and participant assessments. However, because we do not expect', 'that research assistants will necessarily be at a given site every time a patient may be identified as', 'eligible to join the study, and because the ultimate goal of this project is to create sustainable models', 'of', 'implementation, our partnering clinical staff at each study site will be trained on providing the', 'electronic informed consent form to eligible patients and discussing with the patient both the', 'interventions being offered to patients as well as the study expectations. Each site will identify one or', 'more staff to function in this capacity. Clinician training on these procedures will be included in the', 'planned staff training activities on this model of mental health care described in Section 8.0. As part of', 'this training, clinicians will be required to demonstrate mastery of the consent process via role-playing.', 'And they will be observed periodically by research staff to ensure procedures are being implemented', 'with fidelity. Specifically, clinicians will screen patients, identify eligible patients, discuss treatment', 'options for the patient and offer the consent form to patients who express interest in accessing the', \"study's therapeutic resources (e.g., the web/mobile intervention) and willingness to complete study\", 'assessments in accordance with the assessment timeline (every 3 months, as described in Section 12.0).', 'Clinicians will offer to read aloud the content of the consent form to the patient.

As part of the consent process, the clinician describing the consent process will', 'discuss potential risks and benefits of participation. Risks to patients are minimal but include talking', 'about/answering questions about sensitive topics (such as depression and alcohol use) that may be', 'difficult or emotionally upsetting to patients. The clinician providing consent will also discuss how the', 'staff are trained to handle/manage these risks. S/he will also provide information about confidentiality', 'and the voluntariness of participation. The clinical site will document if patients sign consent to join', 'this study (in their medical record or a case note).', 'Information on confidentiality will emphasize that no personal information will be associated with the', 'data; all data will be assigned with a study identification number (ID), and only this ID will be used for', 'the study assessments. The list of study IDs (along with all research data) will be kept in a password', 'protected, encrypted database, which is only accessible to approved research staff. Individual identifying', 'information will only be maintained in a separate encrypted database with passwords known only to the', 'PIs and specific members of the research team. No identifying personal characteristics will be used in', 'any publication or presentation. Information on voluntariness will emphasize that participation in the', 'study is completely voluntary. It will be highlighted that patients retain the right to refuse answers to any', 'questions that they do not feel comfortable with. Patients retain the right to withdraw from the study any', 'point in time, and refusal to participate will have no negative effect on the health care the patient receives', 'through the study sites or at any other health care institution. Patients will have the opportunity to', 'carefully review the written consent form and ask questions regarding the study prior to signing the', 'informed consent form. The consent forms will need to be electronically signed by the patient and the', 'individual who will oversee the informed consent process.

In addition to this, the', 'individual providing consent at a study site will reiterate confidentiality to family members if any family', 'member would be present at screening or at any other outcome assessment. Note that adult patients in', 'Colombia typically visit their primary care provider alone. However, in cases where patients may wish', 'to have a family member present, it is typical to discuss medical matters in the presence of family', 'members. In these circumstances where patients may wish to have a family member present during the', 'visit, their primary care provider will make an effort to confirm with the patient in private that their wish', \"is to have their family member present. This approach is intended to ensure that the patient's wishes are\", 'respected, and is standard practice within primary care settings in Colombia.', 'While obtaining the consent, the patient will be explicitly informed that any incidence of violence (e.g.,', 'expressed intent to physically harm another person; see consent) required by law to be reported to', 'authorities may be reported to the authorities without the consent of the patient. Furthermore, any', 'clinical worsening (e.g. imminent risk of suicidal ideation) may result in referral for additional', 'treatment and the research staff or clinicians could potentially disclose this information to treatment', 'providers of the study or to family members. If a research staff member thinks a patient is at risk of', 'harm to herself or to someone else, the research staff will report this to a physician/clinician at the', 'study site without the consent of the patient. This information is also reflected in the informed consent', 'form.', 'In addition to the above noted consent procedures, if an illiterate patient is eligible and wants to enter', 'the study, the research assistant will read the informed consent form verbatim to the eligible participant.', 'One impartial witness will be present during the reading and signing of the informed consent form to', 'attest to the apparent understanding of the participant and their willingness to participate.
