The mechanism by which PD-1 down', 'modulates T-cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA-4, as both molecules', 'regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [34] [42]. The PD-1 receptor was shown to', 'be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-', 'cells, regulatory T cells, and natural killer cells [43] [44]. The ligands for PD-1 (PD-L1 and', 'PD-L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including', 'non hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [42] [45] [46] [47].
