Introduction', 'A. Purpose', 'Merkk, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our', 'products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in', 'compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of subject safety is the overriding concern in', 'the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merk clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or', 'national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.', 'B. Scope', 'Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merk irrespective of the', 'party (parties) employed for their execution (e.g., contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This', 'Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code', 'does not apply to investigator-initiated trials which are not under the control of Merkk.', 'II. Scientific Issues', 'A. Trial Conduct', '1. Trial Design', 'Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis-driven to assess safety, efficacy', 'and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of Merk or comparator products. Alternatively, Merk may', 'conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine', 'subject preferences, etc.', 'The design (i.e., subject population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose', 'of the trial. Research subjects must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial.', '2.
