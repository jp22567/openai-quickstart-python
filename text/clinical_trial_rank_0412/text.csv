Introduction', 'Although the risk of cancer increases with age, and the number of older cancer patients is expected to', 'rise in the coming years (1-4), research on older cancer patients and survivors has been limited (3,5). In', 'Denmark, approximately 65% of all cancers are diagnosed among patients > 65 years of age, and the', 'number of incident cancers is expected to increase with 30% towards 2030 solely because of the', 'increasing elderly population (6). Before discussing the impact of cancer disease in older individuals, it', 'is necessary to describe the normal aging process and psychosocial factors related to aging.', '1.1 The aging process', ""The age at which a person is considered being 'elderly' or 'older' varies in the literature and currently"", ""no definitive consensus exists. Age above 65 years has traditionally been chosen as the 'cut-off' as it"", 'represents the age of retirement in many Western countries. Aging involves a continuum of changes in', 'function, biological, psychological and social structures that vary depending on individual differences', 'in genetic factors. It must be empathized that older people represent a widely heterogeneous group and', 'that chronological age does not accurately describe the capacity, resources and functioning of an older', 'person. In a biological view, aging involves physiological changes in the organisms that lead to a decline', 'of biological functions and the ability to adapt to metabolic stress. The biological changes involve a', 'decrease in cardiac function and capacity due to reduced muscle strength, vascular stiffness, increased', 'ventricular wall thickness, atherosclerosis, and loss of elasticity of the vessel walls (7). The respiratory', 'tract undergoes structural and functional changes which are often associated with a decrease in lung', 'function, limited regeneration and an enhanced susceptibility to infections and pulmonary diseases (8).', 'Despite large variation among individuals, aging is also associated with a decline in kidney function,', 'including a decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which makes drug excretion', 'more problematic (9). In the gastrointestinal tract, age-related physiological changes (e.g. decrease in', 'gastric acid and functional absorption, alterations in gastric motility and gastrointestinal hormones) may', 'significantly alter the absorption and metabolisms of nutrients and medications, and thereby places older', 'persons at a major disadvantage when they are exposed to weakness or disease (10). The aging process', 'typically involves changes in the body composition with an increase in fat mass and a decrease in muscle', 'mass. Evidence suggests that age-related loss of muscle mass starts in the fifth decade with an annual', 'rate of up to 1-2%, and mainly influences the lower body skeletal muscle mass (11, 12) Loss of muscle', 'mass is accompanied by an even faster deterioration of muscle strength (13). With age, the bones', 'deteriorate in composition, structure and function. Increased bone resorption and reduction in bone', 'formation leads to a fall in bone mineral density, and increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures', '(14). Aging also has an effect on immunity, with evidence indicating that the cell-mediated immunity', 'consistently displays age-related declines in function (15).

Despite significant heterogeneity among older individuals, cognitive changes are', 'recognized as a normal part of the aging process, and some cognitive abilities such as memory,', 'processing speed, and conceptual reasoning decline over time(20).
