Peanut-allergic', 'individuals face a burden of strict peanut avoidance during everyday life, including constant', 'fear of accidental exposure and the inability to predict the severity of allergic reactions due to', 'accidental exposure, despite maintaining a peanut-avoidant diet. Food-allergic individuals', 'frequently have trouble managing their social life because of the need for strict avoidance of', 'the allergenic food, and face the disbelief of others about their condition, often resulting in', 'anxiety, social isolation, and even mental health problems (Mills, 2007). In many cases, the', 'effects of food allergy on quality of life may be greater for caregivers than for the', 'food-allergic children (Valentine, 2011), and the disruption caused by food allergy may have', 'wider implications for the productivity and livelihood of caregivers as well as repercussions', 'for siblings and other family members (Gupta, 2013; King, 2009). Studies in children', 'comparing the HRQOL burden of peanut allergy with type 1 diabetes or rheumatologic', 'disease showed that the burden was comparable to or worse for peanut-allergic children', 'compared with children with these chronic diseases (Avery, 2003; Primeau, 2000),', 'highlighting the need for safe and effective treatments for peanut allergy.', 'Peanut OIT studies have reported a significant improvement in quality of life following', 'successful desensitization (DunnGalvin, 2017; Anagnostou, 2014; Factor, 2012). In phase 2', 'studies, AR101 has been shown to produce a high rate of desensitization to a clinically', 'meaningful level of peanut protein.

However,', 'assessment of HRQOL can be complex for infrequent episodic conditions such as peanut', 'allergy. Food allergy HRQOL is unusual because it is not characterized by daily or frequent', 'symptoms that would allow patients to perceive changes in their health status; rather, it is', 'characterized by beliefs and expectations about the risk of anaphylaxis occurring due to', 'unpredictable accidental exposures and the expected benefits of interventions that reduce this', 'risk. Experiencing an HRQOL benefit from treatment is entirely dependent on patient (and', 'parent/caregiver) knowledge that they have been receiving an active treatment and have been', 'successfully desensitized to the food allergen in question.', 'An open-label study of HRQOL of patients on standard of care alone and their', 'parents/caregivers will enable a more real-world comparison of treatments than a blinded', 'study. In a blinded study setting, patients in both treatment groups would be required to', 'follow the same study site visit schedule, which is necessarily frequent during up-dosing with', 'food allergens to safely achieve the desired level of desensitization. As this visit frequency is', 'much higher than real-world standard of care practice, it could significantly affect patient and', 'parent/caregiver responses to questionnaires. In an open-label study, the visit schedule for', 'patients receiving standard of care alone can be less frequent and would more closely align', 'with real-world standard of care practice. Therefore, an open-label study design is preferred', 'when assessing the real-world impact of AR101 treatment versus standard of care on', 'HRQOL.', 'Additionally, previous studies have shown that the DBPCFC also influences HRQOL,', ""because the information it imparts helps reduce uncertainty about the status of the patient's"", 'allergy and may reduce anxiety about their ability to manage an allergic reaction arising from', 'accidental exposure (Franxman, 2015; Soller, 2014).
