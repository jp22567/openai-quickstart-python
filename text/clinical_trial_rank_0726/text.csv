Teprotumumab is a mAb with low nanomolar affinity for human', 'IGF-1R.

Moreover, inhibition of IGF-1R receptor function with an antibody may also', 'attenuate signaling through the TSHR, an autoantigen that has been implicated in TED, because', 'IGF-1R and TSHR are physically and functionally coupled.
