Traditionally, care is', 'provided in an inpatient environment, a model developed in the early days of treating children with acute', 'lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with multi-agent induction therapy and used in adults due to the need for', 'frequent transfusions and the risks for treatment-related mortality from sepsis.

The result is that the vast majority of subjects receiving', 'cytotoxic induction or reinduction therapy will be hospitalized for between three to five weeks. Subjects', 'who have relapsed and receive a salvage therapy for reinduction are often hospitalized are treated under a', 'similar practice pattern. [3]', 'In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in alternatives to care delivery models in hematologic', 'malignancies. [4,5,6] For example, there have been published studies about the safety of autologous and', 'allogeneic stem-cell transplants performed in a largely outpatient setting. [7,8] Improvements in', 'supportive care, especially effective, prophylactic oral antimicrobials, have led to a substantial reduction', 'in the risk for infection during induction. Similarly, the ability to administer red blood cell and platelet', 'transfusions in the outpatient setting has increased. [9,10] While not robust, there is some literature', 'supporting the psychological and economic benefits of outpatient treatment.
