In the United States alone, these wounds are estimated to affect between', '2.4 to 4.5 million patients. 1 Chronic wounds are typically classified as vascular ulcers', '(venous and arterial ulcers), diabetic ulcers, and pressure ulcers. As these wounds last on', 'average 12 to 13 months and recur in up to 60% to 70% of patients, they can lead not only to', 'a loss of function and a decreased quality of life, but also to an increase in morbidity.', 'Primarily a condition of the elderly, chronic wounds are becoming more prevalent as', 'populations age in developed countries and are associated with high treatment costs,', 'estimated at 2% to 3% of the healthcare budgets in these countries.²', 'The physiological process of wound healing progresses through 4 main phases: hemostasis,', 'inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.³ Immediately after an injury, vasoconstriction', 'and blood clotting occurs, preventing blood loss and providing a provisional matrix for cell', 'migration.

Although they may differ in etiology,', 'chronic wounds usually share some common features: elevated levels of proinflammatory', 'cytokines, proteases, reactive oxygen species, and senescent cells; persistent infection; and a', 'deficiency of stem cells and/or dysfunctional stem cells. Repeated tissue injury induces', 'platelet-derived factors to stimulate the constant influx of immune cells; thus, the', 'proinflammatory cytokine cascade becomes amplified and persists for a prolonged period,', 'leading to elevated levels of proteases. Eventually, protease levels exceed the levels of their', 'inhibitors, leading to the destruction of the extracellular matrix and the degradation of growth', 'factors and their receptors.
