It usually starts in the fifth or sixth', 'decade of life, although age of onset can also be earlier.', 'In most series, there has been a predominance of women. The disease presents itself with', 'one or more well-delineated scaly erythematous plaques. Within this plaque, pustules are', 'present, usually 2-5mm in diameter. Fresh pustules are yellow; older ones are yellow-brown', 'or dark brown as the pustule dries up. Eventually, the desiccated pustule is exfoliated.

A striking symmetry of the', 'lesions on the hands or feet is common, but sometimes a solitary lesion may persist for weeks', 'or months before other lesions appear. Additionally, patients are often unable to walk or to', 'work due to the pain and thus are severely affected in activities of daily life (7).', 'Palmoplantar pustulosis is a therapeutically challenging condition that can significantly impact', 'patient quality of life (8).
