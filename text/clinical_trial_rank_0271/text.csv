Although NETs may arise in most organs, more than half originate', 'from endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas [2], referred to as', 'gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs). Both GEP-NETs and lung NETs, including typical and atypical', 'carcinoid tumors and bronchial NETs, meet the criteria for orphan disease status. Despite this, the age-', 'adjusted incidence rate of NETs increased 6.4-fold from 1973 (1.09 per 100000) to 2012 (6.98 per', '100 000) [3, 4], and serves only to highlight the growing impact and burden these cancers will continue', 'to have on the health of our population.', '1.1.1.
