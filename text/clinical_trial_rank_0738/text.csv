Indicators of overweight', 'and obesity, and diabetes in both adult men and women either show no progress or are worsening', ""when looking at trends from the 80's to present [3]. Iron and zinc, whose deficiencies (acute or"", 'chronic) manifest as iron deficiency anaemia and stunting are micronutrients of public health', 'concern in Kenya [4]. Type-2 diabetes is one of the priority non-communicable diseases (NCDs)', '[5] in Kenya with a prevalence of 5.8% and 6.2% in men and women [6].', 'Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is the most common form of diabetes. It is a chronic metabolic disease', 'occurring when the pancreas is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or when the body', 'cannot effectively utilize produced insulin, or both. Insulin regulates the amount of glucose in', 'blood and T2DM is characterized by hyperglycemia [7]. Diabetes due to its nature has an', 'inflammatory disease character, with higher inflammatory processes as a result of diseases', 'duration and glycemic control [8]. Iron homeostatsis is affected by hepcidin levels.

However there is no conclusive evidence as to whether zinc deficiency', 'causes the diabetes or is merely a consequence of the disease [13]. Suggested potential beneficial', 'mechanisms of action of zinc among diabetes patients are its antioxidant role.
