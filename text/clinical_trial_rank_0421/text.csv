In the United', 'States, ACHM is estimated to affect approx. 9,700 individuals (Judd, 1943; Sharpe et al., 1990; Sharpe', 'et al., 1999), in 25%-35% of whom the condition results from mutations in the CNGA3 gene (Kohl et', 'al., 2005; Aboshiha et al., 2016); similarly, it is estimated that approximately 4,000 people are affected', 'in the EU.', 'There is currently no treatment for any form of ACHM, including forms of the disease due to', 'mutations in the CNGA3 gene. Among a variety of novel therapeutic strategies that are under', 'investigation for hereditary retinal disorders, such as ACHM, gene therapy has been shown to be', 'most promising, with notable successes in models of inherited retinal dysfunctions owing to loss-of-', 'function mutations in genes encoding proteins that mediate critical functions in photoreceptors or', 'retinal pigment epithelium cells.', 'In recent years, adeno-associated virus (AAV) has emerged as one of the most efficient viral vectors', 'for gene therapy (Daya and Berns, 2008).

Comparison of multiple AAV serotypes', 'after subretinal injection in the eyes of non-human primates (NHPs) showed AAV2/8 to be among', 'the most efficient vectors for gene transfer to the primate cones (Vandenberghe et al., 2013,', 'Vandenberghe et al., 2011).', 'Achromatopsia resulting from mutations in CNGA3 has several characteristics that make it an', 'appropriate candidate disease to demonstrate proof-of-principle in a first-in-man trial of gene therapy', 'for photoreceptor disease. Effective improvement in cone photoreceptor function, which is otherwise', 'absent (or markedly reduced) in this condition, would provide a clear, rapid and reliable measure of', 'outcome. In addition, Achromatopsia is largely non-progressive and the extended survival of cones,', 'despite their profound lack of function, presents a wide window of opportunity during which gene', 'supplementation could lead to significant benefit in cone-mediated vision.
