Important symptoms include itching and pain, and the', 'disease is often characterised by chronic relapses and a poor prognosis. According to the', 'guideline developed by the European Society of Contact Dermatitis (1), chronic hand eczema', 'refers to hand eczema, which persists for more than 3 months or relapses twice or more often', 'per year.', 'Hand eczema is usually multifactorial and there is no reliable connection between', 'morphology and aetiology of the disease. Based on aetiology, eczema is commonly divided', 'into exogenous or endogenous types. The most common aetiologies of hand eczema are found', 'to be the exogenous types irritant contact dermatitis (35%) and allergic contact dermatitis', '(19%), and the endogenous type atopic hand dermatitis (22%) (2).', 'The severity of hand eczema varies from mild to severe and may cause significant pain and', 'discomfort in daily life. General embarrassment is also associated with the disease due to its', 'visible location (3). Hand eczema can result in impaired quality of life and decreased working', 'capacity, imposing a great economic burden on patients and society. In Denmark, an 8-year', 'follow-up study in a cohort of 274 people with hand eczema found that 12.4% had been on', 'sick leave and 8.5% had changed jobs because of their hand eczema (4). Similarly, prolonged', 'sick leave due to occupational hand eczema was reported in approximately 20% of patients in', 'a study from 2005 (5). A US survey found that people with chronic hand eczema report worse', 'quality of life and impaired activity and work performance compared with those without', 'chronic hand eczema (3).', 'Treatment of chronic hand eczema involves different treatment strategies such as elimination', 'of triggers, general skin care, and anti-inflammatory therapy in a step-wise approach. General', 'skin care in terms of emollients is widely used and recommended by physicians, but evidence', 'of efficacy is sparse (1). Nonetheless, elimination of triggers such as allergens and irritants is', 'effective and a prerequisite for successful therapy on longer term but is in many', 'circumstances difficult to achieve due to the occupational character of the exposure.', 'Alitretinoin is the only therapy approved in the EU for treatment of chronic hand eczema; no', 'product is yet approved in the USA.
