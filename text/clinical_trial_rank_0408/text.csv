Despite normal hearing in one ear, these patients', 'experience reduced speech perception in noise (Welsh et al, 2004; Rothpletz,', 'Wightman & Kistler, 2012), variable abilities on localization tasks (Slattery &', 'Middlebrooks, 1994), increased reports of hearing handicap (Iwasaki et al, 2013), and', 'reduced quality of life (Wie, Pripp & Tvete, 2010).', '6 of 30']"
7,page_8,"['In the United States, the prevalence of UHL in children ranges from 0.03% to 3%,', 'depending on the age of the child (Porter & Bess, 2011). Studies have indicated that', 'of the children screened for hearing loss at birth, 0.03% have unilateral hearing loss,', 'and of the children screened at school-age, the prevalence rises to 3% (Bess, et al,', '1998). Although the premise that UHL creates educational, social and behavioral', 'challenges for children has been acknowledged for several decades (Bess, 1986; Bess,', 'et al, 1986; Lieu, 2004; Ruscetta et al, 2005; Tharpe, 2008; Borton, et al, 2010), our', 'ability to treat and provide habilitation for such children has been limited to strategic', 'interventions, such as preferential seating, or less effective technologies, such as', 'hearing aids or bone-conduction devices. For children with moderate to profound', 'hearing loss in one ear, a traditional hearing aid in the poorer ear typically provides', 'inadequate amplification and poor sound quality due to the inability to provide', 'sufficient audibility in the speech spectrum. CROS hearing aids and bone-conduction', 'devices route the signal from the affected side to the better hearing ear. A CROS', 'hearing aid uses a microphone/transmitter on the affected ear to send the acoustic', 'signal to the receiver on the better hearing ear. Studies assessing the efficacy of', 'CROS hearing aids in children have been performed. They indicate benefit for quality', 'of life and speech recognition in quiet; however, these results were for children with', 'thresholds in the mild to moderately-severe range (Kenworthy, et al, 1990; Updike,', '1994; Briggs, et al, 2011). Bone-conduction devices use vibratory stimulation to', 'transmit the signal to the cochlea on the side with better hearing. In a similar fashion', 'to CROS aids, bone conduction aids route the signal to the better hearing ear,', 'stimulating only one auditory pathway. Though listeners receive signals from both', 'sides, they are unable to use binaural cues. This inability to stimulate both auditory', 'pathway results in variable speech perception in noise (Kunst et al, 2007) and poor', 'localization (Bosman et al, 2003; Hol et al, 2010). It is hypothesized that a cochlear', 'implant, which would stimulate the auditory pathway on the affected side, may', 'benefit this population by improving speech perception in the affected ear and', 'offering binaural cues for improved localization and speech perception in noise.', 'A cochlear implant is a two-part system, including the internal receiver/electrode', 'array and external speech processor.

The acoustic signal is presented', 'through the implanted device within the cochlea via electrical pulses. Sound is then', 'perceived and interpreted by the brain. Cochlear implantation performed for children', 'with bilateral, severe to profound deafness has significant impacts on several aspects', 'of child development. First, children who are deaf and are implanted early can', 'acquire spoken language in a manner that follows the developmental trajectory', 'experienced by children with normal hearing (Nicholas & Geers, 2007).
