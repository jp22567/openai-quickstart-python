Teprotumumab is a mAb with low nanomolar affinity for human', 'IGF-1R. Binding of teprotumumab to IGF-1R blocks receptor activation by agonists, IGF1 and', 'IGF2, and also causes direct inactivation of the receptor through antibody-induced', 'internalization. Teprotumumab has no agonist activity for canonical IGF-1R signaling pathways', 'and is highly selective; in particular, it does not recognize the insulin receptor. Teprotumumab is', 'well-tolerated in humans at doses that produce > 90% IGF-1R occupancy. Systemic', 'administration of teprotumumab to subjects with moderate-to-severe active TED should,', 'therefore, attenuate all disease symptoms that are dependent on IGF-1R activation. This', 'argument holds whether IGF-1R is being activated by GD-IgG or endogenous ligands IGF-1 and', 'IGF2, or whether the receptor is expressed on fibroblasts, progenitor fibrocytes, adipocytes, or', 'lymphocytes. Moreover, inhibition of IGF-1R receptor function with an antibody may also', 'attenuate signaling through the TSHR, an autoantigen that has been implicated in TED, because', 'IGF-1R and TSHR are physically and functionally coupled. Teprotumumab, therefore, has the', 'potential to treat TED at multiple different molecular and cellular levels.', 'Administering teprotumumab early in active TED is designed to reduce the intensity and', 'duration of the active disease, minimize the sequelae that are carried over to constitute inactive', 'TED, and thereby have a beneficial effect on long-term outcome, reducing the need for', 'corrective surgeries.
