In healthy dentate subjects, the stresses from mastication are transmitted through', 'the teeth via the periodontal ligaments to mandibular and maxillary bones. For denture wearers,', 'especially full denture wearers, the primary stress bearing area under the denture is the oral', 'mucosa where cellular swelling, increased nuclear size, and intercellular oedema can occur', 'when the mucosa is under compression. The mechanical denture injury is a common occurrence', 'as result of constant denture movement and rubbing (Budtz-Jorgensen, 1981). Further, the', 'quality of life of the denture wearer may be impacted through other effects. Allen and Locker', '(Allen and Locker, 2002) reported that ill-fitting dentures produced consequences on taste, oral', 'health discomfort and self-consciousness among adults wearing new dentures.', 'Denture adhesives or fixatives have been used by edentulous patients to improve the retention', 'and stability of dentures for many years (Grasso, 1996). The primary benefit of using a denture', 'adhesive is to enhance treatment outcome by increasing retention of the prosthesis and by', 'reducing food entrapment (Zarb et al, 2013). Further benefits of a denture adhesive have also', 'been explored. Tarbet (Tarbet et al, 1980) demonstrated that the use of a denture fixative was', 'associated with improvements in the oral-mucosal health of subjects. Denture adhesives have', 'also been shown to reduce the number of denture dislodgements during eating and subsequently', 'reduce the amount of food particles that migrate under dentures (Ahmad et al, 2010; Munoz et', 'al, 2012; Tarbet et al, 1980). The oral health related quality of life (OHrQoL) associated with', 'denture adhesive use has also been evaluated in two separate studies. OHrQoL has been defined', 'as the impact of oral disease and disorders on aspects of everyday life that a subject or person', 'values, that are of sufficient magnitude, in terms of frequency, severity or duration to affect', 'their experience and perception of their life overall (Locker and Allen, 2007). Nicolas (Nicolas', ""et al, 2010) evaluated subject's OHrQoL over a 6 month period of adhesive use using the"", 'General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) (Atchison and Dolan, 1990b) demonstrating', 'that the pain/discomfort domain scores of the GOHAI statistically significantly increased', '(improved) during the course of the 6 months of the study for all subjects (all subjects in this', 'monadic study used adhesive). A further OHrQoL study (Polyzois et al, 2015) evaluated', 'OHrQoL of full denture wearers using the Oral Health Impact Profile - Edentulous (OHIP-', 'Edent) questionnaire (Allen and Locker, 2002) through use of an adhesive for 30 days. This', 'study found that most aspects (including the pain domain) were improved over the 30 days of', 'the study.', 'The above studies withstanding, the impact of using a denture adhesive on both the oral mucosal', 'health and the OHrQoL has been scarcely investigated as highlighted in the American College', 'of Prosthodontists Guideline for the Care and Maintenance of Dentures (Felton et al, 2011).', 'The test denture adhesive under evaluation here has previously been evaluated to assess the', 'effectiveness of the adhesive at increasing retention of dentures.
