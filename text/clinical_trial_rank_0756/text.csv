Additionally, EMG-EMG and', 'EEG-EMG coherence studies also support the view that the motor cortex plays a role in walking [43, 47].', 'After SCI, the integrity of the corticospinal tract is significantly reduced and this is evident through the', 'absence or decreased size of EMG responses below the lesion in response to i) voluntary effort and ii) TMS', 'stimulation as well as iii) decreased EMG coherence within the 25-40 Hz band (for review see Field-Fote et al', '2017).', 'It is clear however that the corticospinal tract reorganizes after injury and exhibits considerable plasticity.', 'This is evidenced by impaired cross-facilitation to muscles below the lesion [48-50], and increases in coherence', 'and MEP amplitudes following interventions such as locomotor training [23, 24, 47]. In fact, the strength of the', 'corticospinal tract may predict locomotor recovery following SCI [51].

Although the above studies', 'have provided strong evidence of the role of the corticospinal tract in the recovery of function after SCI there are', 'some limitations. The tibialis anterior is the frequently-studied muscle and therefore it remains unclear if these', 'findings translate to other muscles of the lower limbs. Additionally, several studies have failed to successfully', 'measure TMS MEPs below complete lesions due to mechanistic limitations.

Lastly,', 'only very recently has it been demonstrated that the reticulospinal pathway is responsible for gross finger', 'movements following human SCI [59], however, it remains to be determined whether the integrity of this pathway', 'below the level of a complete lesion can account for other types of motor recovery following human SCI, and', 'whether the excitability of this pathway can be altered with interventions.', 'Vestibulospinal Pathway', 'Vestibular information is pertinent in balance control during a variety of movements.

These irregularly firing afferents provide', 'information about angular velocity, linear acceleration and velocity of the head [31]. The role of the', 'vestibulospinal pathway in human movement control has best been elucidated through the use of galvanic', 'stimulation (GVS). GVS directly modulates the firing of vestibular afferents and produces a signal of head', 'movement that has a whole-body effect on motor responses. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that only', 'muscles engaged in a balance task are modulated by GVS and that the response is distributed in response to', 'the load placed on the limb [31].

When comparing the effects of GVS', 'during a variety of different tasks such as overground walking, treadmill walking, standing and bicycling it', 'becomes apparent that the vestibulospinal pathway likely plays a greater role in tasks where changes in the', 'centre of mass and base of support are dynamic [60-62]. Additionally, the lack of effect of GVS during cycling', 'again reiterates its role in balance control, despite similar muscle activations in ankle muscles during walking', 'and cycling [61]. Lastly, when comparing walking to standing, although there are similarities in the responses', 'to GVS there are also some notable differences. Namely, there appears to be different patterns of muscle', 'activity depending on the task (coactivation and increased involvement of muscles around the ankle joint', 'during walking) [60-62]. Finally, studies examining changes in the efficacy of transmission along the', 'vestibulospinal pathway after SCI are very few. In one study it was demonstrated that GVS-evoked responses', 'in the trunk muscles correlated well with the level of impairment of the individual [63].

Nevertheless, this study highlights that even after a severe SCI (AIS A/B)', 'there', 'may still be residual vestibulospinal pathways below the level of the lesion. Therefore, the likelihood of', 'strengthening these residual pathways with ES and training exists and perhaps underlies the recovery of such', 'tasks like independent standing and walking which require greater balance control.', 'Propriospinal Pathways', 'As one of several components that form part of the motor pathway, the propriospinal pathway includes', 'interneurons that link several segments of the spinal cord and consists of both short and long projections within', 'the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spinal cord.
