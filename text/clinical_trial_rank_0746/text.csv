Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one', 'of the types of malformation of the MD, which involves lack of coaptation of the valve leaflets, which leads to', 'a reverse flow of blood from the left ventricle to the left atrium. A pronounced progression of MR has a poor', 'prognosis and leads to left ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and death.', 'Depending on the etiology, MR is classified into 2 types: (1) primary, or degenerative, and (2) secondary, or', 'functional.', 'Degenerative MR (DMR) is caused by anatomical changes in the leaflets and chords of the mitral valve and', 'is the most common type of MR in the world. Functional FMR (FMR) is caused by remodeling and', 'dyssynchrony of the left ventricle and is usually associated with cardiomyopathy, or coronary heart disease;', 'MR is secondary to left ventricular dysfunction, the mitral valve itself is morphologically normal.

The prevalence of FMR is underestimated due to its ""secondary"" nature', '(patients present with heart failure CH is more likely due to LV dysfunction than heart disease). With this type', 'of MR, pharmacotherapy is the preferred first-line therapy. Other treatment options include surgical', 'reconstruction or surgical valve replacement. Surgical interventions of this type remain problematic, partly', 'due to the fact that patients are characterized by severe comorbidities. Moreover, these patients have a high', 'probability of postoperative relapses from moderate to severe MR, and there is no evidence that operations', 'of this kind prolong life.', 'To minimize the risks associated with surgery, or to treat inoperable patients, a new class of therapy was', 'developed based on transcatheter methods, the so-called ""edge-to-edge"" casement reconstruction.', 'Percutaneous combination procedure can be considered for both patients with symptomatic severe primary', 'MR, and secondary MR.
