6,page_6,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 7 1.0 B ACKGROUND 1.1 Rationale for Proposed Study Can surgical teams capitalize on a teachable moment regarding the harmful effects of smoking that will reduce surgical complications among lung cancer patients who smoke? This study will introduce the management of a tobacco treatment intervention to health care providers who may not know what to do in managing lung cancer patients who smoke. By helping smoking surgical patients stop smoking, we are reducing harm by reducing post -operative compli cations. Therefore, this study will address both the prevention of worsening complications post operatively and hopefully reduction of smoking in lung cancer patients. This study will support the Alliance Prevention Committee’s research priority aimed at t obacco harm reduction and cessation and will add to the NCORP research portfolio “Cancer control studies to reduce incidence and co- morbidity of cancer and its treatment and enhance quality of life”. This study will address all four essential A’s (Advise to Quit, Assess willingness to quit, Assist with quitting, and Arrange follow -up) recommended by the US Guideline model for treating tobacco use and dependence Guidelines ( http://www.rcjo urnal.com/ contents/09.08/09.08.1217.pdf ) [1]. 1.1.1 Impact of Cigarette Smoking on Oncologic Treatme nt and Outcomes Smoking is a significant risk factor for cancer, and smoking cessation efforts have been widely implemented among smokers as primary prevention of cancer development. In addition to its effects on carcinogenesis, smoking also impacts premal ignant -to-malignant progression [ 2-8] and increases the risks for perioperative morbidity and mortality. Due to its effect on small vessels and oxygenation, smokin g may also decrease the effectiveness of adjunctive treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy while at the same time increasing symptom burden. Smoking also increase s the risk of secondary cancers [2-8]. Importantly, there has been an increasing body of evidence indicating that smoking can be a barrier to successful administration and completion of multimodality oncology treatments (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery), and smoking can reduce both the quality of life (QOL) and long -term survival. Comparison of the 5- year survival of lung cancer between smokers and non -smokers has shown that only 33% of smokers survive 5 years compared to 70% of non- smokers [3-9]. Smoking causes temporary changes in the blood and tissue microenvironment (increased tissue CO2 and decreased O2 carrying capacity) [2] and in reparative cell functions, whic h can lead to delayed wound healing [2]. This can be responsible for prolonged recovery, which in turn, leads to an increase in the risks of hospital -acquired infections and other postoperative complications. [2-4] Smokers with gastrointestinal malignancies have a higher risk than non-smokers for surgical site infections (OR 1.25; 95% CI, 1.09–1.44), combined pulmonary complications (OR 1.60; 95% CI, 1.38–1.87), and reoperations (OR 1.20; 95 % CI, 1.03–1.39)[ 10]. Complications of oncologic surgery (Appendix 1) can contribute to delays in the initiation of and lower ability to tolerate adjuvant therapy, further contributing to poor long -term cancer outcomes [11]. However, cigarette smokers diagnosed with cancer have not been a foc us of smoking cessation efforts [12]. Cancer -directed treatments generally receive the bulk of attention after a cancer diagnosis, and smokers diagnosed with cancer represent a missed opportunity i n smoking cessation and prevention of second cancers or recurrence of cancer. 1.1.2. Benefits of Smoking Cessation in Cancer Patients Quitting smoking has beneficial health effects regardless of patient age. [13] Individuals who stop smoking significantly decrease their risk of lung cancer compared to current smokers. [7] For patients diagnosed with cancer, smoking cessation can improve cancer"
7,page_7,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 8 treatment tolerance and effectiveness, [14, 15] overall survival,[ 13] prevention of second primary malignan cy,[8, 16] and QOL. [17] Multimodal cancer therapy most often includes surgical procedures. Minimizing postoperative complications in oncology patients undergoing surgical procedures is of paramount importance both for minimizing treatment - related morbidities and for allowing a patient to go on to other components of the multimodal therapy. A reduction in complications has been observed within 4 weeks of smoking cessation. [18] Smoking cessation is beneficial at any time point relative to lung cancer surgery, but “current” smoking status at the time of surgery has been associated with a poor postoperative QOL.[ 19] A recent meta- analysis of 6 studies addressing smoking and surgical complications found that stopping smoking can reduce the relative risk of postoperative complicati ons by 41% (95% CI, 15% to 59%; P = 0.01); each week of cessation prior to surgery increased this effect by 19%. [20] In addition, stopping smoking prior to chemothe rapy and radiation therapy reduces the total symptom burden (sum of 12 symptoms scored on an 11- point Likert scale) of cancer treatment during treatment (smokers vs. nonsmokers: 46.3 vs. 41.2; P < 0.05) and at 6 months after treatment (27.7 vs. 21.9; P < 0.05).[ 21] Fewer than 10% of smokers actively seek treatment for tobacco dependence. Over 80% of providers in oncology practices provide brief smoking cessation counseling, but fewer than 30% ask about smoking in subsequent visits.[ 22] Barriers to smoking cessation among oncology patients include provider lack of confidence and patient lack of motivation. [22] Adjunctive use of a self -help guide for stopping smoking has been associated with improved motivation and has been found to be a predictor of long- term smoking cessation in oncology patients. [23, 24] Thus, effective methods for smoking cessation exist, but they have not been tested in the setting of a multic enter clinical trial targeting cigarette-smoking oncology patients who are scheduled for surgery. 1.1.3 Potential for Smoking Cessation Opportunities in Surgical Cancer Patients Women smokers are 25.7 times more likely than women who never smoked to deve lop lung cancer. For men smokers, it’s 25 times the risk of men who never smoked. [25] Among cancer patients who smoke, 85% -87% of cancer patients want to stop smoking.[ 26, 27] In one clinical trial, of the 263 cancer participants, the retention rate was approximately 84.5%. Teachable Moment : Smokers with cancer presenting to a surgeon present a unique opportunity to intervene on smoking behavior. Opportunities in which patients have enhanced susceptibility to interventions on unhealthy behaviors are referred to as “teachable moments.” Use of teachable moments can occur at office visits (associated with 2 –10% success in smoking abstinence), notification of abnormal test results (7 –21% success), pregnancy (10–60% success), and hospitalization and disease diagnosis (15–78% success). [28] Available evidence suggests that major surgery for a smoking -related cancer provides a significant and effective teachable moment for smoking cessation. A study of 5498 individuals demonstrated that older individuals (≥50 years) were more likely to quit smoking after a major medical procedure. [29] The steps in using a teachable moment to help smokers quit smoking include simple physician advice to quit, brief behavioral interventions provided by physicians or other clinicians, and pharmacotherapy.[ 30, 31] A recent randomized controlled trial testing the clinician -delivered message versus no message has shown randomizing within a site can be successful.[32] Pharmacotherapy : Varenicline is a partial agonist/antagonist that binds with high affinity and selectivity at the α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a stop- smoking aid. Varenicline is presently the most efficacious pharmacotherapy for increasing smoking abstinence rates, with proven superiority over bupropion and suggested superiority over nicotine replacement therapy.[ 33, 34] In a head to head comparison of varenicline vs. bupropion the odds ratio (OR) at end-"
8,page_8,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 9 of-treatment (12 weeks) were 3.85 (95% CI 2.69-5.50) for varenicline and 1.90 (95% CI of 1.38- 2.62) for bupropion. The OR at end of study (6 months) was also significant with an OR of 2.83 (95% CI of 1.91 -4.19) for varenicline and an OR of 1.69 (95% CI 1.19 -2.42) for bupropion.[ 35] A recent systematic review of interventions for pre- operative smoking cessation has shown that of all the interventions tested in clinical trials, varenicline given pre-operatively was the only intervention with long term smoking cessation. [36] Although the safety and acceptability of varenicline among s urgical patients with thoracic cancer has been previously tested, [37] the efficacy of varenicline in smokers who are diagnosed with cancer and are undergoing surgery has yet to be proven. Recent studies among non- cancer patients have confirmed that varenicline has the greatest efficacy for tobacco dependence treatment when combined with behavioral therapy,[ 38, 39] and is safe as well, dispelling previous concerns. [40-46] In addition, the results from an 18 -study pooled analysis and a 5-study meta -analysis have been added to the label (currently in the process of being published in the literature). [47] Behavioral Intervention (Tobacco Quitlines) : According to the US guidelines, behavioral support is minimal intervention that all smokers should be receiving when trying to stop smoking. Behavioral support can be provided either as a stand alone or in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. Behavioral support can be provided in several different formats. Currently the two formats discussed in the US guidelines include face -to-face or by telephone. Telephone quitline s are one of the 10 key recommendations for effective tobacco dependence treatment. [1] The advantage of counseling via telephone quitline is that it can potentially provide wide -access to evidence- based cessation counseling while providing uniformity in the counseling approach, when utilizing a national quitline (vs. private or state quitline). Quitlines ca n include mailed materials, recorded messages, proactive and reactive contacts, and optional medication services. [48] A recent meta- analysis of 65 controlled studies, comprising of 73,000 participants, concluded that telephone quitlines provide an important approach in supporting smokers who are trying to stop smoking.[ 49]. The pooled odds ratio for a number of studies utilizing quitlines varies from 1.4 [50] to 1.6. [48] The US National Cancer Institute provided the very first t elephone based quitline (early 1980’s) as a component of the Cancer Information Service. A national referral service to the individual state/private quit lines is available through the use of 1 -800- QUIT -NOW. The disadvantage of utilizing state or private q uitlines in large national studies is that each state is privately funded and therefore clinical services can vary from providing medication, to only one initial consult, depending on available funding (see http://map.naquitline.org/). Utilizing a private quitline for the use of a large national research study can be expensive and many quitlines cannot support research since it would interfere with their clinical services. The NCI quitline (1-877-44U- QUIT) is a national federally funded service. They provide the smoker with counseling support, help develop a quit plan, provide follow up calls, mail quit materials (as needed), and answer questions concerning medications (medications are not provided). Using a toll free number, smokers across the United States can call in Monday through Friday 8 am to 8 pm (ET). These services are at no cost and services can be provided in both English and Spanish. 1.1.4 Genetics of Nicotine Addiction Genetic variants in nicotinic receptor genes represent the strongest known genetic risk factors for nicotine addiction. The genetic variant rs16969968, which causes an amino acid change in CHRNA5 , the gene encoding the α5 nicotinic receptor subunit, strongly contributes to nicotine addiction and heaviness of smoking.[ 51, 52] This variant also contributes to smoking- related diseases (lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).[52-54] In a genome -wide association meta -analyses including over 73,000"
9,page_9,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 10 subjects, the chromosome 15 locus that includes the nicotinic receptor subunit gene cluster (CHRNA5 , CHRNA3 , and CHRNB4 ) had a highly significant association between rs16969968 and cigarettes per day ( P = 5.57 × 10-72).[55-57] Nicotine Metabolism Genes Contribute to Heavier Smoking: Conversion of nicotine to cotinine accounts for 70 –80% of initial nicotine metabolism and is performed by cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6), which is located in the cytochrome p450 gene cluster on chromosome 19.[ 58-60] Variation in CYP2A6 and nicotine metabolism efficiency is robustly associated with smoking phenotypes, especially cigarette consumption.[ 55, 61-64] CYP2A6 is highly polymorphic, and genome -wide association meta- analyses have identified variants in the CYP2A6 region associated with the number of cigarettes per day.[ 52, 57] Individuals with reduced- function allel es have significantly slower rates of nicotine metabolism, and several studies have reported an influence of nicotine metabolic rate upon cessation, with faster metabolism associated with lower abstinence and higher withdrawal symptoms.[ 65-67] Nicotine Addiction and Smoking Cessation: The ultimate public health significance of understanding the biological underpinnings of nicotine addiction comes from translating that knowledge into improved treatment for smoking cessation. A critical step in translation is to determine whether genetic variants associated with nicotine addiction influence smoking cessation. Until recently, genetic studies of smoking cessation have be en mixed, finding little evidence of replicable associations. [ 57, 68 , 69] We found that CHRNA5 -CHRNA3 -CHRNB4 variants predict age of smoking cessation, age of lung cancer diagnosis, and response to smoking cessation treatments. In a recent meta - analysis, we found that the CHRNA5 variant rs16969968 is a marker of delay ed smoking cessation and accelerated lung cancer diagnosis. The median age of smoking cessation for those with the high- risk variants (AA) at rs16969968 is 56 years versus 52 years for those with the low -risk variants (GG). Similarly, those with the high -risk variants have a 4 -year earlier age of lung cancer diagnosis (61 years) compared to those with the low -risk variants (65 years) (Chen et al, in press, JNCI). This can be clinically significant given the high mortality following a diagnosis of lung cancer (50% die within a year of diagnosis and a 5- year survival rate of 16.6%). In clinical trials, those with high -risk genetic variants had more difficulty quitting without treatment, but this genetic risk was ameliorated by aggressive pharmacological treat ment (Fig. 1) [70] (please also add reference Bergen et al, 2013)"
10,page_10,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 11 These results reveal ed a statistically significant interaction between the genetic variants and pharmacologic treatment. The clinical impact of this genetic and treatment interaction is exemplified by the number needed to treat (NNT), the number of patients who must be treate d to prevent one additional bad outcome (e.g., relapse). For example, if a drug has an NNT of 10, it means one would need to treat 10 people with the drug to achieve smoking abstinence in one person. In this smoking cessation trial, [70] the overall NNT to prevent one relapse was 7, supporting the established effect of pharmacotherapy. However, the NNT varied widely depending on haplotype: the NNT was 4 for smokers with the high -risk haplotype (H3) versus >1000 for smokers with the low -risk haplotype (H1). This large difference in NNT was the first finding that genetic variants in the chromosome 15 region interact with treatment for smoking cessation. Given the existing evidence that this CHRNA5 variant predicts accelerated risk for lung cancer and favorable response to cessation pharmacotherapy, these findings underscore the potential clinical and public health importance of rs16969968 in CHRNA5 in relation to smoking cessation treatments. 1.2 Significance and Innovation of this Study The adverse hea lth consequences of smoking are profound,[71- 75] and capitalizing on the unique teachable moment surgeons have available for smokers after cancer diagnosis may reduce post -operative complications. Further , if post -operative complications can be reduced or ameliorated, the cost of care, length of time in the hospital, and quality of life aspects of the cancer experience can be improved. Observational evidence indicates that smoking cessation prior to cancer surgery reduces complications such as pneumonia, failure to wean from ventilator, re -intubation, and prolonged hospital stays [10]; however, the optimal approach to achieving abstinence in this population is not known. The innovation of this study is that it directly engages the surgical team in cancer control studies by taking advantage of the unique teachable moment that the surgical team has with the patient pre-operatively. Controlling for the definition of abs tinence, the duration of abstinence relative Figure 1: Response to Pharmacotherapy Varies by Haplotypes*  CHRNA5 haplotypes were associated with failed smoking cessation in the placebo group (Wald χ2 = 7.02, df = 2, P = 0.03)  CHRNA5 haplotypes were not associated with smoking cessation outcomes in the treatment group ( P = 0.48)  The interaction of haplotypes and treatment on abstinence is significant (Wald χ2 = 8.97, df = 2, P = 0.01) * CHRNA5 haplotypes based on rs16969968 and rs680244 (N = 1073); H1 = G- C (21%); H2 = G- T; (44%) H3 = A- C (35%) From Chen et al., 2012 [70]"
11,page_11,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 12 to surgery, the surgical team’s message, and the smoking cessation intervention in a large population, will help us identify the parameters that will yield both the highest success rates for quitting and the bes t perioperative outcomes with respect to morbidity and QOL. The correlative genetic component of this trial may differentiate patients who are likely to respond strongly to pharmacologic treatment from those who receive little benefit. This will allow us to better target treatments and will contribute to our goal of using genetic information to develop personalized medicine. 1.3 Study Overview This will be a randomized clinical trial. The primary goal is to assess the effect of smoking cessation treatment on surgical complications . We will also report the impact of alternative treatments on QOL and post -operative care. According to the US Guidelines[ 1], although counseling and medication are effective when used alone, the combination of both is more effective than either alone. Thus clinicians should encourage smokers who want to quit, to use both counseling and medication in trying to quit smoking (#7 of the 10 key guideline recommendations). In this study, 626 cancer surgery patients will be randomized 1:1 to a “protocolized” smoking cessation program (varenicline plus a brief no -smoking message from the surgical team and behavioral support provided by a telephone smoking quitline [NCI’s 1-877-44U- QUIT]), or to placebo plus a brief no- smoking message from the surgical team and behavioral support provided by the telephone smoking quitline ). Surgery must occu r after the target quit date (TQD) defined at baseline and can be performed no sooner than 10 days after randomization and no more than twelve weeks after randomization. The study will remain open to accrual until 626 patients have had surgery and are foll owed for 24 weeks after surgery for surgical complications. The primary outcome will be the rate of surgical complications, as identified from an investigation of the American College of Surgeons -National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS -NSQIP). Secondary outcomes include QOL, post -operative care (length of hospital and high dependency unit stay), and rates of smoking abstinence. All study participants will have the option of enrolling in the correlative genetic study. This correlative study will look at important genetic variants in nicotinic receptor gene cluster ( CHRNA5 - CHRNA3 -CHRNB4 ) and nicotine metabolism (CYP2A6 ) that have been shown to impact successful smoking abstinence. This will include a blood draw at baseline, and tobacco use outcome will be determined by salivary cotinine at baseline and every six weeks after surgery for 12 weeks, with a final measurement at 24 weeks. 1.4 Feasibility, Accrual Time, and Study Duration A survey of legacy ACOSOG thoracic surgeons and the Alliance Community Oncology Committee members has shown that the vast majority of sites that see these patients would be interested in accruing patients for this study. From accrual estimates provided by sites in this survey, we anticipate accruing 150 evaluable patients p er year. In the opinion of these surgeons, this study is highly feasible to accrue quickly. We conducted a follow -up survey asking surgical practices to describe in detail the manner in which the workflow for the study would be carried out. This survey provides us with example templates to guide potential participating sites. Given these data and our past experience with accruing patients to smoking cessation studies, we anticipate that our accrual estimate is conservative. In previous NCCTG trials accrual rates of as high as 25 patients per week were achieved, albeit in mixed treatment practices. As already indicated, however, we have done multiple surveys of Alliance surgical practices who indicate strong support for the study, with specific accrual expectations and workflow details. Hence the sites are unusually well prepared and aware of the needs to accrue to this study and are eagerly awaiting the trial opening. That likelihood of rapid accrual, plus the involvement of surgeons in the prevention aim, i s a major selling point for the trial. This study accrual will close when"
12,page_12,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 13 626 study patients have undergone surgery; therefore, we anticipate patient accrual to be completed in approximately 4 years and 2 months. 2.0 O BJECTIVES Because of the considerabl e discussion surrounding the goals of this study, we include the following declarative and definitive statements: I. The goal of this study is to examine the impact of alternative interventions for smoking cessation on the reduction of surgical complications. II. Smoking cessation is an intermediate and concomitant secondary outcome that is not the focus of this study, because it already is well known that smoking cessation interventions reduce smoking incidence in cancer patients. 2.1 Primary objective To determine if varenicline plus a behavioral intervention consisting of a brief clinician - delivered intervention and tobacco quitline follow -up, decreases postsurgical complications through 24 weeks after surgery when compared to placebo plus the behaviora l intervention in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking. 2.2 Secondary objective s 2.2.1 To compare changes from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient quality of life (LASA -12) domains between the inte rvention (varenicline) and control group (placebo). 2.2.2 To compare changes from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient quality of life related domains (LASA) for the PHQ -9 and SEQ12 between the intervention and control groups. 2.2.3 To compare the proportion of patients 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery who endorse (“Was It Worth It ”) each treatment (intervention vs. control groups). 2.2.4 To compare post -operative care (as measured by length of hospital and high dependency unit sta y) between the intervention and control groups. 2.2.5 To compare treatment adherence between the intervention and control groups. 2.2.6 To compare rates of smoking abstinence between the intervention and control groups as a covariate of the primary outcome only. 2.3 Correlative science objectives 2.3.1 To evaluate the predictive role of the nicotinic receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5 -CHRNA3 - CHRNB4 ) and CYP2A6 genotypes in smoking cessation among lung cancer patients undergoing surgery. 2.3.2 To evaluate the potential moderating effect of these cessation -relevant genotypes on smoking cessation treatment between the intervention and control groups."
13,page_13,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 14 3.0 P ATIENT SELECTION For questions regarding eligibility criteria, see the Study Resources page. Please note that the Study Chair cannot grant waivers to eligibility requirements. 3.1 On-Study Guidelines This clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if patients appropriate for this trial are enrolled. All relevant medical and other considerations should be taken into account when deciding whether this protocol is appropriate for a particular patient. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of any therapy, and therefore only enroll patients for whom this treatment is appropriate. Although they will not be considered formal eligibility (exclusion) criteria, physicians should recognize that the following may seriously increase the risk to the patient entering this protocol: • Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consen t. • Medical condition such as uncontrolled infection (including HIV), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or cardiac disease which, in the opinion of the treating physician, would make this protocol unreasonably hazardous for the patient. • Patients with a “currently active” second malignancy other than non -melanoma skin cancers or cervical carcinoma in situ. Patients are not considered to have a “currently active” malignancy if they have completed therapy and are free of disease for ≥ 3 years. • Patients who c annot swallow o ral formulations of the agent . In addition: • Women and men of reproductive potential should agree to use an appropriate method of birth control throughout their participation in this study due to the teratogenic potential of the therapy utilized in this trial.

The following outline of study procedures has been provided to guide participating institutions with respect to the order of events for this trial. Screening : It is expected that at the time patients are referred to the surgical clinic (e.g., from pulmonary or interventional radiology service, primary care physicians), they will be screened for this study. Alternatively, site staff may review internal medical records to identify pa tients eligible for the study who have not yet completed the surgical consult. Time permitting, pre - registration tests, observations, and questionnaires may be completed on the same day as registration/randomization and the Baseline Visit. Surgical Consul t: The surgical consult may be done as part of the screening process. It must be completed prior to registration/randomization. PLEASE NOTE: The No- Smoking Message can only be delivered AFTER registration/randomization , as this is part of the study inter vention Registration/Randomization: Patients must be registered/randomized following informed consent and prior to the Baseline Visit (see below). Baseline Visit: The Baseline Visit will include the delivery of the No-Smoking Message by the Surgical Team Member, collection of saliva for cotinine measurement, baseline assessments per Section 5.1, and the completion of the baseline questionnaires. 7.2 Behavioral Intervention (Baseline visit) Teachable Moment – No-Smoking Message from Surgical Team Member: This message will be given to all patients on study during the Baseline Visit, and can be delivered by the surgeon or by a designated surgical team member. This message contains the following key sections: (1) There is no better time to quit than when you are having cancer surgery; (2) Unique detriments of smoking in patients facing cancer surgery: a) tobacco- related carcinogenesis/pre- malignant to malignant progression; b) increased risks of perioperative morbidity or mortality; c) increased risk for surgica l complications and wound healing time; d) possible decrease in the effectiveness of adjunctive cancer treatments and increased side effects of these treatments; e) increased risk of secondary cancers; (3) The best time to stop smoking is now; (4) We kno w it is difficult and many other health care professionals are ready to help you do this; and (5) The study team will be in contact with you periodically throughout the course of the study. QUITLINE : Quitlines are an approved and cost- effective smoking cessation behavioral intervention[ 76] Quitlines are recommended by the US Smoking Cessation Guidelines [1] for their wide r each in large populations. The q uitline selected to be used in this study can continue to be used by each study site long after the study is complete as it is free of charge to all. Support will be provided by the National Cancer Institute Telephone Smoking Quitline, 1-877-44U- QUIT, ( 1-877-448- 7848). This is a toll free telephone line within the United States and provides smoking cessation counseling Monday through Friday 8 am to 8 pm Eastern time. After randomization, the study staff will assist the patient in mak ing th e first contact with the q uitline. HANDOUT : All patients will also receive a handout with reminders of why they should stop smok ing (message from surgeon) and q uitline information."

The target quit date (TQD) is to be determined during the baseline visit and should occur prior to the planned date of surgery. It must be at least 10 days after randomization. While it is understood that is rare for surge ry in this patient population to be delayed, in order to allow for flexibility in exigent circumstances, the maximum time from randomization to the TQD will be 12 weeks. 7.4 Pharmacologic Intervention (Varenicline) The initiation of the o ne-week dose escalati on period of varenicline/placebo treatment will be considered Day 1 and the target quit date (one week later ) will thus be Day 8 of therapy. Patients will be provided with instructions on the proper use of the medication (i.e., time of day to take the med ication). During Week 1 , the dosing will be one of the 0.5 mg varenicline/placebo pills per day fo r the first 3 days followed by two 0.5 mg pills a day (morning and evening) for the next 4 days. Weeks 2 -12: Day 8 is the target quit day and on this day the patient will take two 0.5 mg pills twice daily (morning and evening). Patients will stay on this dose for 11 weeks. Agent Dose Route Day Varenicline /Placebo 0.5 mg Oral Days 1-3 1 pill per day Varenicline/Placebo 0.5 mg Oral Days 4-7 1 pill twice per d ay – Minimum of 8 hours apart Varenicline/Placebo 0.5 mg Oral Days 8-84 2 pills twice per day – Minimum of 8 hours apart (4 pills per day total) Dosing should occur with 240 mL of water and it is recommended that patients eat prior to dosing to decrease gastric upset . It is recommended that there be at least 8 hours between the morning and evening dosing. If a dose is missed, the patient should take it as soon as s/he remember s. If it is almost time for the next dose (within 6 hours) , the patient should skip the missed dose and take the next one as scheduled . Patients should not take a double dose of varenicline/placebo .

After the treatment assignment has been ascertained in the OPEN application, the patient’s study medication code number will be displayed on the confirmation of registra tion screen. The treating institution should not have to request additional supplies after a starter supply has been sent. The pharmacy and the Alliance registration office will work together to re-supply each location. Outdated or remaining drug product should be destroyed on- site per procedures in place at each institution. IND Status IND Exempt: Varenicline is IND exempt as used in this trial. This exemption has been determined by attestation that neither the investigator nor sponsor intends to seek a new indication for use or to support any other significant change in the labeling or product advertising for varenicline ; this investigation will use an approved route of administration and dosage of varenicline and has no factors that increase the risk of the product; this investigation will be in compliance with 21CFR parts 56, 50, and 312.7; and neither the investigator nor sponsor will promote or represent that v arenicline is safe or effective for the context that is under investigation in this study . Formulation Commercial varenicline capsular, biconvex tablets contain 0.5 mg (white to off -white, debossed with “Pfizer” on one side and “CHX 0.5” on the other side). Each 0.5 mg varenicline contains 0.85 mg of varenicline tartrate equivalent to 0.5 mg of varenicline free base. The following"
34,page_34,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 35 inactive ingredients are included in the tablets: microcrystalline cellulose, anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate, croscarmellose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, Opadry® White (for 0.5 mg), Opadry® Blue (for 1 mg) and Opadry® Clear. Storage and Stability Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 –30°C (59–86°F) (see USP Controlled Room Temperature). Administration Varenicline/placebo will be administered at a dosage of 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days, increasing to 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4 to 7, and then to the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg 2 tablets twice daily for up to 12 weeks of treatment. Patients should be instructed to take medication after eating and with a full glass of water. Drug Interactions Varenicline is not known to interact with any medications and has no contraindications aside from previous allergic reactions to varenicline. Other smoking cessation therapies: Safety and efficacy in combination with other smoking cessat ion therapies has not been established. Coadministration of varenicline and transdermal nicotine resulted in a high rate of discontinuation due to adverse events. Effect of smoking cessation: Pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of certain drugs may be altered due to smoking cessation with CHANTIX, necessitating dose adjustment. Pharmacokinetics a) Absorption: Varenicline is rapidly absorbed across the gastric mucosa, reaching a peak plasma concentration (C max) in about 4 hours. After multiple oral doses, ste ady state is reached within 4 days. Bioavailability is unaffected by food or time -of-day dosing (food reduces the incidence and severity of nausea, a common side effect). b) Distribution: Varenicline exhibits linear pharmacokinetics after single or repeated doses. Plasma protein binding is low (< 20%). c) Metabolism: Varenicline undergoes minimal metabolism. d) Excretion: Elimination half -life of varenicline is approximately 24 hours. Ninety -two percent of varenicline is excreted unchanged in the urine. Renal elimination of varenicline is primarily through glomerular filtration along with active tubular secretion possibly via the organic cation transporter, OCT2. Adverse Events The most commonly reported adverse effects (>5% and twice the rate seen in placebo -treated patients) of varenicline are nausea (29.4% vs. 10% placebo), insomnia (14.3% vs. 12.4% placebo), abnormal dreams (13.1% vs. 3.5% placebo), headache (12.8% vs. 12.6% placebo), and constipation (9% vs. 1.5% placebo). Nausea is generally mild (72%) to moderate (23%) in intensity, becomes less severe with continued drug use, and causes 2.3% of the subjects to discontinue treatment. Drug Warnings: The FDA previously required a boxed warning on the varenicline label to alert physicians and subjects to beha vior change risks. The labeling warned of the risk of behavioral changes such as: depression, hostility, aggression, suicidal thoughts, suicide, and vehi cular crashes. Subjects and family members will be given clear instructions on discontinuing vareniclin e and alerting study staff in the event such behavior changes occur. This is detailed in the DSMP."
35,page_35,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 36 As a result of the black box warning for varenicline, a number of studies have recently (2010- 2015) focused on the safety of varenicline in various populations. Studies have included both individual studies with hospitalized smokers and meta -analysis of past randomized clinical trials. The common result in all these studies/reviews is that varenicline is safe and no significant increase in psychiatric conditions was observed in any of these cases. These studies include: • In 2010, Tonstad reviewed 10 clinical trials comparing varenicline to placebo in over 3091 smokers. Psychiatric disorders (excluding sleep disorders or disturbances) was 10.7% in varenicl ine and 9.7% in placebo (RR= -1.02 – ns). No cases of suicidal ideation or behavior in the varenicline arms in all 10 trials;[99] • In 2011, Park et al., conducted a study with 49 smokers who had lung cancer who met with a thoracic surgeon and were given varenicline and counseling or just counseling. The OR was 3.14 (not significant). This study did demonstrate that varenicline is safe (only nausea and abnormal dreams were higher in varenicline arm), and feasible (smokers with lung cancer did adhere to varenicline treatment);[37] • In 2012, Wong et al., conducted a study with 286 patients who were randomized to varenicline or placebo perioperatively. Relative Risk (RR) was 1.45 for varenicline to help smokers stop smoking. The only significant event was nausea (13.3 vs 3.7, p=0.004);[100] • In 2013, Nayan et al., reviewed 10 randomized clinical trials and 3 prospective clinical studies of smoking intervention in oncology patients. The interventions included NRT, bupropion and varenicline. The odds ratio (OR) of all interventions was 1.31 to 1.54 (not significant) depending on follow up period. But when the interventions were delivered perioperatively, the OR was significant at 2.31, thereby demonstrating that surgery does present the teachable moment in oncology patients;[101] • In 2014, Carson et al., conducted a study with 392 hospitalized smokers who were randomized to varenicline vs. placebo for 12 weeks. No increase in psychiatric events were noted, the only increase was nausea (16.3% in varenicline patients vs. 1.5% in counseling alone);[102] • In 2015 two studies took place, both with very large number of smokers: Thomas et al. – meta -analysis of 39 randomized trials (10,761 pts.) using varenicline vs. placebo to evaluate the incidence of neuropsychiatric events. No increase of suicide, attempted suicide, suicidal ideation, depression, irritability, aggression, or death. There was evidence of reduced anxiety and increase in sleep disorders, insomnia and abnormal dreams and fatigue.[103] Kotz et al. – A review of 753 general practices in England which identified 164,766 smokers who received prescription to stop smoking (106,759 NRT; 6557 bupropion; 51,450 varenicline). Neither bupropion nor varenicline showed any increase in cardiovascular or neuropsychiatric events (including depression and self -harm) compared to NRT (Hazard Ratio (HR)= 0.80), cerebral infarction (HR=0.62), heart failure (HR=0.61), arrhythmia (HR=0.73) or self -harm (HR=0.56).[104] Weight Gain: Varenicline does not attenuate w eight gain after stopping smoking. Abuse Potential: The manufacturer’s data, available in the package insert, suggests that varenicline is not likely to be abused. The FDA did not classify varenicline as a controlled substance."
36,page_36,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 37 Pregnancy Risk: Vareniclin e is FDA Pregnancy Class “C” drug defined as “Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic or embryocidal or other) and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs s hould be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.” Since we do not know the potential benefits, we cannot determine the risk- benefit ratio and will, therefore, exclude pregnant individuals at the beginning and during t he study. Not enough medical information exists to know what the risks might be to a breast- fed infant so we will exclude individuals who are breast-feeding. Nursing Guidelines 1. Be aware of black box warning regarding behavior changes, including depressi on, hostility, aggression, suicidal thoughts, and vehicular crashes. Warn patients of this risk and instruct patients to report any changes in mood or behavior to the study team. 2. Patients may experience nausea. Nausea may improve with time. Treat sympto matically and monitor for effectiveness. 3. Warn of difficulty sleeping and/or unusual dreams. 4. Headache may occur. Treat symptomatically and monitor for effectiveness. 5. Patients may experience mild constipation, encourage increased fluid intake and t reat symptomatically as necessary. 10.2 Placebo (Supplied) Investigators ordering and/or dispensing supplied agents at any time for study treatment must be currently registered with PMB, DCTD, NCI. A registered investigator must co -sign for other non-registered personnel prescribing the supplied agents A matching placebo will be provided. It will be identical in appearance to the varenicline. 11.0 M EASUREMENT OF EFFECT All of the following measures relate to the secondary endpoints. The primary endpoin t of surgical complication incidence rates at 24 weeks after surgery will be measured as described in Appendix X. 11.1 Patient reported measures For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated every 6 weeks. In total, the time for the patie nt to complete these forms is approximately 16 minutes at Baseline, 10 minutes at Week 6, 10 minutes at Week 12, and 13 minutes at Week 24. 11.1.1 Tobacco Use Assessment (Appendix IX) : We will record the patient’s self -reported smoking status including cur rent use, use during the past 7 days, use since time of last self- report, and use since Target Quit Date (TQD) as appropriate. This form will collect vitals, smoking status, contact made with the tobacco quitline. This will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. 11.1.2 Contemplation Ladder (Appendix I II)[77]: The Contemplation Ladder is a visual analog comprised of 11 rungs and 5 anchor statements (item 0, 2, 5, 8, 10), representing stages of change. The response options (0) to (3) correspond with pre-contemplation, (4) to (6) represent contemplation , (7) and (8) refer to preparation, (9) and (10) represent action and maintenance , respectively. It is a brief measure of motivation or readiness to change, where (0) is the least motivated and (10) is the most motivated. This measure will be used to screen out those who are not motivated to change (scoring a 5 or below) and therefore lower likelihood of responding to the intervention and completing the study. Two recent studi es"
37,page_37,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 38 of smokers with co -morbid conditions showed the average hospitalized smoker enrolled scored a 6 and above and they found that 70- 80% of the enrolled subjects scored an “8” or above.[ 78, 79 ] This will take approximately 1 minute to complete. 11.1.3 Smoking Self -Efficacy Que stionnaire (SEQ -12; Appendix IV)[ 80]: Two six -item subscales measuring confidence of smokers in their ability to remain tobacco abstinent in the face of internal stimuli (e.g., feeling depressed) and external stimuli (e.g., in company of smokers). This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. 11.1.4 Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND; Appendix V)[81]: Predicts smoking abstinence and is correlated with biochemical measures of tobacco dependence. This will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. 11.1.5 Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9; Appendix V I)[82]: A valid diagnostic and severity measure for depression, with scores ≥10 indicating moderately severe depression. The PHQ9 is used to help guide the investigator during the study enrollment process and to help the investigator monitor the patient with resp ect to depression after randomization. The study investigator will determine if the person is still eligible for study enrollment. This will take approximately 2 minutes to complete. 11.1.6 Linear Analogue Self -Assessment (LASA; Appendix VI I)[83]: Single -item LASA items have become the most widely -used assessment in all NCI -sponsored cancer control studies. [84] Normative data have been obtained from various clinical populations enrolled in NCCTG clinical trials and from healthy participants. [85, 86] This will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. 11.1.7 “Was it Worth It?” Survey (Appe ndix V III)[87]: This is an end -of-study survey to ask the patient if the entire experience was worth it for them. This will take approximately 2 minutes to complete. 11.1.8 Drug and Behavioral Support Adherence Logs (Appendix X): Each patient will be provided with an adherence log which is specific to his/her treatment phase. In this log, they will provide details of their daily pharmacotherapy intake, contacts made to/fr om the telephone quitline, amount of cigarettes smoked (if any), and any other comments the patient feels is pertinent. This will take approximately 5 minutes to complete. 11.2 Biochemical confi rmation using salivary cotinine Biochemical confirmation will be used in the cotinine analysis in saliva. Cotinine analyses are two of five validated methods to analyze and verify smoking in patients during smoking cessation. [93-95] S alivary cotinine will be analyzed using the commercially available quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),[ 96] which we have used in several prior studies. [97, 98] Using salivary cotinine will allow for testing of clinically useful measures. All saliva will be shipped to the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC per Section 6.2.2. The correl ative analyses will be performed in the laboratory of Dr. G. Warren at MUSC . 11.3 Definitions of analysis variables Formal definitions of variables used in analyses can be found in the Statistical Considerations section of the protocol."
38,page_38,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 39 12.0 E ND OF TREATMENT /INTERVENTION 12.1 Duration of Treatment Patients should be treated with varenicline/placebo for 12 weeks. If the patient discontinues varenicline/placebo before completing 12 weeks of therapy, patients should be followed for the duration of the study period (6 months ). 12.2 Definitions and Follow -up Requirements Definition of ineligible patients : A study participant who is registered to the trial but does not meet all of the eligibility criteria is deemed to be ineligible. Patients who are deemed inel igible may continue protocol treatment, provided the treating physician, study chair, and executive officer agree there are no safety concerns if the patient were to continue protocol treatment. Notification of the local IRB may be necessary per local IRB policies. Definition of clinical follow -up: The follow -up period where the study participant is no longer receiving treatment, but is still following the study calendar for tests, exams, and correlative endpoints (e.g., specimen collection, quality of life , disease assessments as required by the study). Baseline data must be submitted per Section 5.0 for patients deemed ineligible or canceled. See also the Forms Packet for full details of data submission requirements 12.2.1 Follow -up for Ineligible Patients Study participants who are registered to the trial but deemed ineligible must complete follow-up requirements. Baseline, on -study, endpoint (e.g., relapse or progression), off treatment, and survival data submission required. 12.2.2 Follow -up for Patien ts Never Receiving Protocol Intervention Study participants who receive the study intervention (varenicline/placebo and behavioral module), but never go on to have the surgery, can complete study intervention if they wish. Data on outcome and complications (adverse events) will continue to be collected , but these patients will not be included in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Study participants initiate the study intervention (varenicline/placebo and behavioral module) , go on to receive surgery, but wish to stop study intervention thereafter, will continue to have data on outc ome and complications (adverse events) collected . These data will be used in the analysis of the primary endpoint. Study participants who were registered/randomized but never received varenicline/placebo will be considered “ cancel ed” and baseline data must be submitted per Section 5.0.. 12.3 Extr aordinary Medical Circumstanc es If, at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event: • Document the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy on data forms. • Follow the patient for protocol endpoints as required by the Study Calendar."
39,page_39,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 40 13.0 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 13.1 Study Design This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, phase III trial evaluating varenicline vs. placebo for reduction in post -surgical complications through 24 weeks after surgery in lung cancer pati ents who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking. A parallel group design will be utilized for this two -arm study: varenicline vs. placebo. Both arms will also include a brief no smoking message from the surgical team and the NCI Quitline. 13.1.1 Study Populations Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population: Consists of all randomized patients who had surgery. The ITT population will be used for the efficacy evaluation at each of the planned analyses. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they were assigned at randomization. Patient with missing values will be considered to have complications. Safety Population: Consists of all patients who were randomized, had surgery, and who have at least one post -baseline safety assessment. The safety population will be used in the safety data summaries Note that a patient who had no adverse events (on the Adverse Event CRF) constitutes a safety assessment. Patients who have received at least one dose of study drug but have no post-treatment safety data of any kind would be excluded. 13.2 Study Endpoints 13.2.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the incidence for any of the following complications from surgery within 24 weeks after surgery: 30 -day mo rtality, 30 -day re -hospitalization, pulmonary complications, ICU readmission (an upgrade from any inpatient status [floor or intermediate care status] to full intensive care nursing acuity because of a serious deterioration in physical condition that warra nts closer physician monitoring or nursing care) , wound infection (NOS), anastomotic failure. These complications were identified as being sufficiently numerous from an investigation of the national surgical database (ACS - NSQIP). They will be defined using the General Thoracic Surgery Database (GTSD) for study purposes. These complications will be considered equally important in determining complication rates. Patients who have any of these individual morbidities will be considered to have a perioperative complication. Patients without any of these individual morbidities will be considered to not have a perioperative complication. Formal definitions for all complications of the primary and secondary endpoints are found in Appendix X. We have reviewed the elements of the primary endpoint with the Community Oncology Committe e and the Alliance lung cancer s urgeon working group and surveyed potential participating sites for a description of the workflow for treatment administration and data collection to ensure that all the elements can be recorded across the Alliance sites. 13.2.2 Secondary Endpoints • QOL -related domains as measured by the LASA -12, PHQ -9, SEQ -12, and Was It Worth It assessments. • Post-operative care as measured by length of hospital and high dependency unit stay. Length of stay will include only the time from surgery until the patient is released from the hospital."
40,page_40,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 41 • Expanded complication rate defined as any of the complications listed in Appendix I that are not being examined as part of the pri mary endpoint. This is included to account for the possibility that other complications, which do not occur with high frequency in the ACS-NSQIP data base, actually occur in our study. • Treatment adherence rates related to visits, medication compliance, q uitline usage, and surgeon teachable moment delivery. • Smoking abstinence rates as measured by self -report and salivary cotinine testing. 13.3 Primary analysis Surgical complication incidence rates at 24 weeks after surgery will be compared between the intervention vs. control groups using a Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression models will supplement the univariate analysis, using complication incidence as the dependent variable and will include smoking status at the time of surgery as an independent variable and also adjust for age, gender, FTND, time between randomization and surgery , and presence of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . A separate logistic model will be created including treatment arm instead of smoking status. We will al so explore the collinear relationship between arm and smoking status to see whether they can be included together in the logistic models. 13.4 Additional Analyses We will compare changes from baseline in patient quality of life related domains (LASA -12, PHQ-9, SEQ12) between the intervention and control groups using analysis of covariance and linear mixed model repeated measures analysis for each assessment domain. Specifically, we will analyze each LASA domain with a separate ANCOVA model using the change from baseline to 12 weeks post -surgery as the dependent variable, followed by a similar analysis using the change from baseline to 24 weeks post -surgery. Each LASA question corresponds to a separate domain. For the PHQ -9 and SEQ12, we will use the scale scores in a repeated measures analysis involving data from all time points (baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks). For the PHQ -9 there is one overall score and for the SEQ12 there are two scales (internal stimuli and external stimuli). The WIWI survey will be anal yzed by comparing the proportion of patients at the end of the treatment period (i.e., 12 weeks after surgery) and at 24 weeks after surgery who endorse each treatment (intervention versus control) via Fisher’s exact testing. These QOL -related domain vari ables will be included in the modeling process of the primary and other secondary analyses as potentially concomitant confounding covariates so as to produce more efficient estimates from the models. Sensitivity analysis for potential differences between groups demonstrated via the ANCOVA and repeated measures models will be assessed using Generalized Estimating Equations models to account for the correlation of repeated measures on the same patient. We will compare post -operative care (length of hospital a nd high dependency unit stay) between the intervention vs. control groups using separate logrank testing of Kaplan- Meier estimates for length of hospital stay and length of high dependency unit stay and supplemented by Cox models to control for concomitant covariates. The assumptions underlying the Cox model will be tested for veracity. For the expanded complication rate, we will utilize the same analysis approach as the primary endpoint analysis for all complications listed in Appendix I. We will also com pare the incidence rates of each specific type of complication between arms. We will also measure treatment adherence. The number of study visits completed by each patient during the treatment phase will be summarized and compared between groups using the rank"
41,page_41,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 42 sum test. Patient self -report will be used to collect adherence data on the use of the quitline and the medication adherence for the patients receiving the multi -faceted smoking cessation intervention. To assess medication compliance, patients will re port to the study staff at each visit the amount of study medication used each day. In addition, patients will return unused medication at each study visit and study staff will maintain drug accountability logs to account for dispensed and returned medication. The amount of study medication taken by each patient will be calculated weekly. Adherence data on teachable moment delivery from the surgical team will be collected by the study staff at the time of the message delivery. These data will be summarized using simple descriptive statistics to indicate the degree of treatment adherence that is achieved for the multi- faceted smoking cessation intervention. Rates of smoking abstinence will be compared between arms using Fisher’s exact test and logistic regression models. Abstinence definitions are based upon the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) Working Group recommendations.[ 88] The major advantage of point prevalence estimates is that they are widely reported in the literature and can be verified biochemically. However, point prevalence abstinence does not account for slips/lapses that might occur between follow -up periods. Prolonged abstinence is defined as smoking abstinence sustained after an initial 2 -week grace period [88] and accounts for initial lapses. However, prolonged abstinence cannot be verified biochemically short of daily biochemical confirmations and, ultimately, must rely on self -report. R esearch suggests that self -reports among smokers in general tend to be accurate, and misreporting rates are generally very low. [89] We allow for a 2-week grace period after TQD based upon the SRNT Working Group recommendations.[ 88] Prolonged smoking abstinence will be adjudicated if the following criteria are met: 1) Self - reported smoking abstinence since 2 weeks after the TQD. This will be identified by a negative response to the question, “Since xx/xx/xxxx, which was 2 weeks after your TQD, have you smoked any tobacco, even a puff, for 7 consecutive days or at least once each week on 2 consecutive weeks?” and 2) No failed biochemical confirmation of self -reported smoking abstinence at any previous outcome assessment. Point prevalence smoking abstinence will be adjudicated if both of these criteria are met: 1) Self- reported smoking abstinence for the last 7 days. T his will be identified by a negative response to the question, “Have you smoked any tobacco, even a puff, in the past 7 days?”, and 2) Salivary cotinine less than 15 ng/mL. Relapse will be defined as smoking on 7 consecutive days or smoking at least once e ach week on 2 consecutive weeks. [88] 13.5 Correlative and companion substudy analyses 13.5.1 Correlative substu dy analysis (A211401) Salivary cotinine is an evidence- based biochemical method to confirm tobacco use that significantly increases the accurate identification of current smoking. Data demonstrate that 30-40% of cancer patients who smoke do not accurately report smoking status even using structured assessments (97 -98). As a result, quantitative cotinine analyses (96) will be used to increase the accuracy of identifying current smoking, which will in parallel be used to evaluate changes in study outcomes u sing a more accurate methodology. For this study, a cutoff of 15 ng/mL will be used to define biochemically confirmed current smoking (>15) according to recommendations from the Society for Nicotine and Tobacco Research (95). 13.5.2 Pharmacogenetic compan ion substudy analysis (A211401- PP1) For the correlative analysis, we will examine whether cigarette smokers undergoing surgery for cancer who have the high -risk variants of CHRNA5 -CHRNA3 -CHRNB4 will have higher abstinence rates, as determined by the tobacco use assessment and continine levels, than those with the low -risk variants of CHRNA5 -CHRNA3 -CHRNB4. We will examine this genetic effect in the overall group and in each treatment arm. We will also examine whether"

A series of logistic regression models will be used to examine main effects of genotype and intervention before testing genotype x intervention interactions, with age, sex, and intervention arm as covariates. Similarly, we will examine whether smokers with CYP2A6 -defined fast nicotine metabolism will have lower abstinence and higher withdrawal symptoms at 12 weeks after surgery and at 24 weeks after surgery (end of study) , compared with smokers with slow metabolism. We will examine whether the effect of varenicline varies with participant’s CYP2A6 -defined nicotine metabolism status. Fisher exact tests will be used, supplemented by logistic regression models similar to what is described for the primar y analysis. We will examine if these cessation -relevant genotypes ( CHRNA5 - CHRNA3 -CHRNB5, CYP2A6) modify the effect of the intervention vs. control groups. These correlative analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons, since the magnitude of the associations is of more interest than the statistical significance for whether or not there is any association. 13.6 Power/Sample Size The primary statistical endpoint for this study is the incidence of surgical complications as described in Sections 13.1 and 13.3. Patients that have any of these individual morbidities will be considered to have a perioperative complication. Patients without any of these individual morbidities will be considered to not have a perioperative complication. In a study of 635,265 non- cardiac surgical cases treated in 200 centers throughout the United States, the incidence rate of the perioperative complications listed above from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data was in the range of 25–30%. They further found that smokers undergoing non- cardiac surgery had an estimated 40% increased odds of developing major morbidity and mortality within 30 days of surgery over never smokers, representing a modest difference of between 10% -12% in the actual percentage of patients with major morbidity.[ 90] One report focused on the limitations of NSQIP in identifying adverse events following major cancer surgery. NSQIP does not abstract the complications considered most important by many surgical subspecialists (e.g., anastomotic leak). [91] Therefore, the true impact of smoking on adverse surgical events may be greater in this trial. For the purposes of this power calcul ation then, we will assume a 30% perioperative complication incidence rate in the control group. 104 The study design is a randomized clinical trial intended to estimate the incidence rate of perioperative complications in patients who are smoking at the time of enrollment. The primary statistical analysis will be a comparison of the perioperative complication incidence rates from the time of surgery to 24 weeks after surgery between the intervention and control groups . We will hence power the study to detec t a 10% difference in perioperative complication rates between the intervention and control groups. With a sample size of 626 patients (313 patients per arm), a Fisher exact test can detect a difference in the perioperative complication rate between the tw o treatment groups of 10% ( 20% versus 3 0% in the intervention arm and control arm, respectively) with 80% power using a Type I error rate of 5% and a two -sided alternative. The prevalence of smoking among lung cancer surgical patients is roughly 42%. [91] We estimate that 90% of these patients will be motivated to quit and enroll on the study, given the relaxed eligibility requirements requiring only a desire to quit and teachable moment delivery by the surgeons. Hence we can expect to screen roughly three patients to enroll one. An adjustment is also needed for patients that enter the smoking cessation part of the study, but drop out before surgery. We expect t hat at most 20% of the patients entering the study will drop out after registering and before having surgery. To obtain a sample size of 626 smoking patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer for which surgery is indicated, we will need to screen"
43,page_43,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 44 approxi mately 1878 oncology patients undergoing surgery to enroll 783 smoking patients. Of these 783 patients, we expect 626 to undergo surgery. The study will remain open to accrual until 783 patients have been enrolled. If we take into consideration patient ref usal, we would need to approach 2000 smoking oncology patients undergoing surgery to have 626 patients enroll in the study and undergo surgery. 13.7 Accrual rate and study duration From accrual estimates provided by sites in this survey, we anticipate accr uing 150 evaluable patients per year. Multiple surveys have been conducted to obtain realistic accrual expectations as well as detailed descriptions as to how patients will be accrued, treated, and assessed at each site. This study accrual will close when 783 study patients have been enrolled ; therefore, we anticipate patient accrual to be completed in approximately 4 years and 2 months. If, after 400 patients have been enrolled to the study, the proportion of patients who fail to undergo surgery is ≤ 10%; then accrual to the study will be stopped when 700 patient s have been enrolled, as this would produce the required 626 patients for the primary analysis. 13.8 Monitoring This study will be monitored by the Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an NCI-approved functioning body. Reports containing efficacy, adverse event, and administrative information will be provided to the DSMB every six months as per NCI guidelines. This study will be monitored by the Clinical Data Update System (CDUS) version 2.0. An abbreviated report containing cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by electronic means. Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. 13.9 Adverse Event Stopping Rule The stopping rule specified below is based on the knowledge available at study development. We note that the Adverse Event Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re -opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of ne wly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below. CTCAE v4.0 will be used to determine grading for these stopping rules. Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered at least possibly related to study treatment ( varenicline ) (i.e., an adverse event with attribute speci fied as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfies the following: • If 3 or more patients in the first 15 treated patients or, if at any time after the first 15 patients are enrolled, 20% or more patients develop ≥ grade 4 non- hematologic adverse events felt to be at least possibly related to treatment, the study team will review the data to determine the proper course of action. These actions may include further adverse event monitoring, suspension of accrual, dose modification, or closure of the trial. We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment -related adverse event."

Freidlin’s[ 92] simulation studies have demonstrated that such a bound trivially impacts both the interim bounds and the final significance level. Interim analyses will be done in concert with the semi -annual Data Safet y Monitoring Board (DSMB) reports. These interim analyses will report on the primary endpoint using all patients that have been on study for at least 3 months. 13.11 Inclusion of Women and Minorities This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race or ethnic origin. There is no information currently available regarding differential effects in subsets defined by race or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences to exist. Based on prior smoking cessation studies, w e expect about 15% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and about 40% of patients will be male.

Measurement of saliva cotinine levels is a correlative substudy, which is mandatory for all patients registered to A211401. There is one pharmacogenetics companion substudy , which must be offered to all patients en rolled on Alliance A211401 (although patients may opt to not participate). The companion substudy included within Alliance A211401 is: • Pharmacogenetics of Smoking Cessation Treatment (POST), Alliance A211401 -PP1 14.1 Correlative substudy to measure sali va cotinine levels 14.1.1 Background For patients enrolled on study, saliva samples will be obtained to analyze for cotinine. Salivary cotinine is an evidence- based biochemical method to confirm tobacco use that significantly increases the accurate ident ification of current smoking. In cancer patients who are asked about tobacco use in person, approximately 30- 40% of current smokers misrepresent smoking status (97 -98, Khuri et al.). In cancer patients who participate in phone based assessments, recent d ata demonstrate that 48% of adult smokers (REF) and up to 80% of childhood cancer survivors (REF) misrepresent smoking status. For this study, a cutoff of 15 ng/mL will be used to define biochemically confirmed current smoking (>15) according to recommendations from the Society for Nicotine and Tobacco Research (95)."
45,page_45,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 46 14.1.2 Hypothesis/objective This biomarker will be used to increase the accuracy of tobacco assessment as compared with self -reported tobacco use. The hypothesis is that biochemically confirm ed tobacco use will increase the magnitude of difference in study outcomes as compared with self -reported tobacco use. This biomarker will be used for the following objectives: Primary objective: To evaluate the effect of biochemically confirmed tobacco u se on study outcomes Secondary objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of self-reported tobacco use among study participants To evaluate if biochemically confirmed tobacco use correlates with a larger magnitude of difference in study outcomes as compared with self-reported tobacco use To evaluate longitudinal accuracy of self -reporting among study participants at baseline and throughout the study 14.1.3 Methodology Saliva will be collected in patients as described in 6.2 and patients will be identified as current smokers using a salivary cotinine cutoff of >15 ng/mL (95- 96) analyzed by G. Warren at the Medical University of South Carolina. Parallel evaluations of study outcomes, behavior, and genetic linkages will be performed using self -reported tobacco use assessments and biochemically confirmed tobacco use assessments. 14.2 Pharmacogenetics of Smoking Cessation Treatment (POST), Alliance A211401- PP1 14.2.1 Background Alliance 211401- PP1 will evaluate genetic effects on cessation outcomes and treatment response. Dr. Laura Bierut and Dr. Li -Shiun Chen will identify genetic predictors for cessation ou tcomes and treatment response. (See section 1.1.4 for more background information). 14.2.2 Hypothesis /objective To evaluate if biochemically confirmation streng thens associations between genetic markers, behaviors, and study outcomes To evaluate the predictive role of the nicotinic receptor gene cluster (CHRNA5 -CHRNA3 - CHRNB4 ) and CYP2A6 genotypes in smoking cessation among lung cancer patients undergoing surgery. To evaluate the potential moderating effect of these cessation -relevant genotypes on smoking cessation treatment between the intervention and control groups. 14.2.3 Methodology Participants will provide a blood sample of 10ml (EDTA Vacutainer) for assessment of genotyping and nicotine metabolism by Washington University. Multiple genes have been shown to predict abstinence and response to cessation pharmacotherapy. The blood sample will be used to extract DNA and the plasma will be used for the biomarker, NMR (ratio of 3’hydroxycotinine/cotinine) which reflect CYP2A6 activity and nicotine clearance in smokers, and may predict smoking cessation. All blood samples will be collected, stored, and shipped to the Alliance biorepository and will subsequently be s hipped to Dr. Laura Bierut at Washington University in St. Louis for genotyping and nicotine metabolism essays."

The training will be based upon a validated approach to clinician- delivered tobacco use intervention (Warner et al, Anesthesiology 114:847- 855, 2011). Two different training modules will be required: One for the surgeon and one for the site staff (study coordinator/nurse). Modules will be on- line and asynchronous, and available on the Alliance Web site via a link on the study -specific web page. Sites will certify that the training was completed by notifying the study chair or co- chair via email. To supplement this training, there will also be a training exercise at the Fall Alliance meeting. 15.1 Surgeons The module will emphasize the importance of brief surgeon advice to quit and the compelling rationale for smoking cessation to reduce perioperative complications. The surgeon module will require approximately 5 minutes to complete 15.2 Study Staff The module will demonstrate the brief behavioral intervention to be delivered by the study coordinator/nurse, including the elements addressed in S ection 7.1. The study staff module will require approximately 30 minutes to complete."

53,page_53,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 54 17.0 M ODEL CONSENT FORM Study Title for Study Participants: Smoking Cessation Prior to Surgery to Reduce Surgical Complications Official Study Title for Internet Search on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov : Reducing Surgical Complications in Newly Diagnosed Lung Cancer Patients Who Smoke Cigarettes This study is conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, a national clinical research group supported by the National Cancer Institute. The Alliance is made up of cancer doctors, health professionals, and laboratory researchers, whose goal is to develop better treatments for cancer, to prevent cancer, to reduce side effects from cancer, and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients. What is the usual approach to quitting smoking before having lung cancer surgery ? You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a smoker who is scheduled to have surgery for your lung cancer. Many surgeons encourage patients to stop smoking before surgery in order to reduce t he chance of having medical complications after the surgery. What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study? There are many way to stop smoking. You do not have to be in this study to receive treatment for smoking cessation. You may attempt other methods to quit smoking in addition to the methods used in this study. Your other choices may include: • Nicotine replacement (for example, nicotine patches, gums, lozenges, nicotine nasal spray, or nicotine inhalers) • Taking varenicline not on this study • Taking a drug called bupropion You should talk to your doctor about each of your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study."

Days 1 -3 Days 4 -7 Weeks 2 -12 1 tablet Any time of day 1 tab let in the Morning and 1 tablet in the Evening 2 tablet s in the Morning and 2 tablet s in the Evening How long will I be in this study? You will take varenicline/plac ebo plus have access to the quitline for 12 weeks . You will be in this study until 24 weeks after your surgery. You will continue to have access to the NCI Tobacco Quitline after you have finished your participation in this study. What extra tests and procedures will I have if I take part in this study? Most of the exams, tests, and procedures you will have are part of the usual approach for your cancer. However, there are some extra tests and procedures that you will need to have if you take part in this study. Before you begin the study: You will need to have the following extra to find out if you can be in the study: • Physical exam and medical history • Vitals (height, weight, blood pressure and pulse) • Blood test to measure kidney function, if you have not had one recently • You will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about your motivation to quit smoking • If you are a female of child bearing potential, you will be asked to have a pregnancy test. On the first day of the study (“Baseline Visit”) : On the first day of the study, you will meet with your surgeon or member of the surgical team to discuss quitting smoking and to learn about the NCI Tobacco Quitline. You will be asked to set a target quit date to quit smoking. You should start taking varenicline/placebo one week before the target quit date that you set. Your surgery will be scheduled to take place after that quit date, and must be at least ten days and no more than 12 weeks after the visit with your surgeon. You will also be asked to complete questionnaires about your tobacco use history, your ability to stay smoke free, your mood/depression level and your quality of life. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. On the day of your surgery: You will be asked to complete a brief (3 minutes) questionnaire about your tobacco use and provide a sample of your saliva to measure amount of cotinine in your body. Cotinine is produced by nicotine, which is found in tobacco. 6 weeks after your surgery : You will be asked to come to the clinic for a doctor’s visit to see how you are doing physically and with your tobacco cessation efforts. You will be asked to complete"
56,page_56,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 57 questionnaires at this visit. These should take about 15 minutes to complete. Finally, you will be asked to provide some of your saliva to measure the amount of cotinine in your body. 12 and 18 weeks after your surgery : You will be asked to complete a questionnaire either by telephone or in person to see how you are doing physically (week 12 only) and with your tobacco cessation efforts (on both weeks 12 and 18). You will be asked to come to the clinic (not a doctor’s visit) to provide some of your saliva to measure the amount of cotinine in your body. 24 weeks after your surgery : You will be asked to come to the clinic for a doctor’s visit to see how you are doing physically and with your tobacco cessation efforts. You will be asked to complete questionnaires at this visit and to provide some of your saliva to measure the amount of cotinine in your body. The following table summarizes your visit schedule for this study: Before Surgery Day of Surger y Weeks after surgery Before randomiza tion On the day of the Baseline Visit 6* 12* 18* 24* Visit # 1 2 3 4** 5** 6 Pregnancy test X*** History & physical X X X X Saliva measurement X X X X X X Monitoring X X X X Tobacco use questio nnaire X X X X X X X Other q uestionnaires X X X X X Drug diary X X X * These visits may be up to 2 weeks before or after the scheduled day of the visit on the calendar. ** You will be asked to come to the clinic to provide saliva samples for cotinine measurement.

57,page_57,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 58 What possible risks can I expect from taking part in this study? If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that: • You may be asked sensitive or private questions which you normally do not discuss Here are important points about side effects: • The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side effe cts. • Some side effects may go away soon, some may last a long time, or some may never go away. • Some side effects may interfere with your ability to have children. • Some side effects may be serious and may even result in death. Here are important poin ts about how you and the study doctor can make side effects less of a problem: • Tell the study doctor if you notice or feel anything different so they can see if you are having a side effect. • The study doctor may be able to treat some side effects. • The study doctor may adjust the study drugs to try to reduce side effects. The tables below show the most common and the most serious side effects that researchers know about. There might be other side effects that researchers do not yet know about. If important new side effects are found, the study doctor will discuss these with you. COMMON, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS In 100 people receiving varenicline, more than 20 and up to 100 may have: • Nausea OCCASIONAL, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS In 100 people receiving vare nicline, from 4 to 20 may have: • Trouble getting to sleep or staying asleep (insomnia) • Having vivid, unusual, or strange dreams, nightmares • Headache • Constipation • Stomach pain, swelling, belching, passing gas • Vomiting • Upper respiratory problems such as bronchitis, coughing, sinus congestion • Dry mouth • Anxiety • Depression • New or worse heart or blood vessel (cardiovascular) problems"
58,page_58,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 59 RARE, AND SERIOUS In 100 people receiving varenicline, 3 or fewer may have: • Nervousness, agitation, anger, suicidal or thoughts of hurting someone else— If you, your family, or your caregivers notice agitation, hostility, depression, suicidal thoughts or changes in your behavior or thinking that are not typical for you, you should call your doctor right away. • Sleepwalking —If you or your family notice that this has happened you should call your doctor. • Heart attack • Stroke • Severe allergic reaction • Very bad skin reaction (Stevens-Johnson syndrome – red, swollen, blistered or peeling skin with or without fever) • Seizures –(this is most likely to occur in first month of treatment) Alcohol consumption: You should decrease the amount of alcoholic beverages that you drink during treatment with varenicline until you know if the drug affects your ability to t olerate alcohol. You should use caution when driving or operating machinery until you know how varenicline affects you. Varenicline may make you fell sleepy, dizzy, or have trouble concentrating, making it hard to drive or perform other activities safely. If you successfully stop smoking, you may experience nicotine withdrawal . Effects of nicotine withdrawal include: • Feeling angry, irritable, anxious, • Having difficulty concentrating, sleep problems (insomnia or abnormal dreams) • Feeling agitated or depressed, sometimes with thoughts of suicide. The topics discussed in interviews or in questionnaires may cause you to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. If this happens to you, please let your study doctor, nurse or other study staff know about your discomfort. Let your study doctor know of any questions you have about possible side effects. You can ask the study doctor questions about side effects at any time. Reproductive risks: You should not get pregnant, breastfeed, or father a baby while in this study. The varenicline used in this study could be damaging to an unborn baby. Check with the study doctor about what types of birth control, or pregnancy prevention, to use while in this study. What possible benefits can I expect from taking part in this study? The usual approach to performing surgery on people who smoke is to recommend that they quit prior to surgery. Quitting smoking has been shown to decrease surgical complications in other types of surgery. Although it is not possible to know if participation in this study will result in less surgical complications, it may help you quit smoking. Quitting smoking at any time has"
59,page_59,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 60 numerous health benefits. This study will also help researchers learn things that will help people in the future with lu ng cancer who smoke or quit smoking. Can I stop taking part in this study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. If you decide to stop for any reason, it is important to let the study doctor know as soon as possible so you can stop safely. If you stop, you can decide whether or not to let the study doctor continue to provide your medical information to the organization running the study. The study doctor will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study. The study doctor may take you out of the study: • If your health changes and the study is no longer in your best interest • If new information becomes available • If you do not follow the study rules • If the study is stopped by the sponsor, IRB or FDA. What are my rights in this study? Taking part in this study is your choice. No matter what decision you make, and even if your decision changes, there will be no penalty to you. You will not lose medical care or any legal rights . For questions about your rights while in this study, call the ________________________ (insert name of center) Institutional Review Board at __________________ (insert telephone number). (Note to Local Investigator: Contact information for patient representatives or other individuals at a local institution who are not on the IRB or research team but take calls regarding clinical trial questions can also be listed here.) What are the costs of taking part in this study? Varenicline/placebo will be supplied at no charge while you take part in this study. The cost of getting varenicline/placebo ready and giving it to you is not paid by the study, so you or your insurance company may have to pay for this.. It is possible that the varenicline/placebo may not continue to be supplied while you are on the study. Although not likely, if this occurs, your study doctor will talk to you about your options. You and/or your health plan/insurance company will need to pay for all of the other costs of treating your cancer while in this study, including the cost of tests, procedures, or medicines to manage any side effects, unless you are told that certain tests are supplied at no charge. Before you decide to be in the study, you should check with your health plan or insurance company to find out exactly what they will pay for."
60,page_60,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 61 You will not be paid for taking part in this study. What happens if I am injured or hurt because I took part in this study? If you are injured or hurt as a result of taking part in this study and need medical treatment, please tell your study doctor. The study sponsors will not offer to pay for medical treatment for injury. Your insurance company may not be willing to pay for study-related injury. If you have no insurance, you would be responsible for any costs. If you feel this injury was a result of medical error, you keep all your legal rights to receive payment for this even though you are in a study. Who will see my medical information? Your privacy is very important to us and the researche rs will make every effort to protect it. Your information may be given out if required by law. For example, certain states require doctors to report to health boards if they find a disease like tuberculosis. However, the researchers will do their best to make sure that any information that is released will not identify you. Some of your health information, and/or information about your specimen, from this study will be kept in a central database for research. Your name or contact information will not be put in the database. There are organizations that may inspect your records. These organizations are required to make sure your information is kept private, unless required by law to provide information. Some of these organizations are: • The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology • Pfizer™, the pharmaceutical company supplying varenicline/placebo • The Institutional Review Board, IRB, is a group of people who review the research with the goal of protecting the people who take part in the study. • The Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute in the U.S., and similar ones if other countries are involved in the study. The Alliance has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, which will help us to protect your privacy . The Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information about you collected during the course of the study. The researchers involved in this project may not be forced to identify you in any legal proceedings (criminal, civil, administrative, or legislative) at the federal, state or local level. However, some information may be required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or for purposes of program review or audit. Also, you may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected information under certain circumstances. For example, if you or your guardian requests the release of information about you in writing (through, for example, a written request to release medical records to an insurance company), the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary disclosure."

62,page_62,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 63 ADDITIONAL STUDIES SECTION: This section is about optional studies you can choose to take part in This part of the consent form is about optional studies that you can choose to take part in. You will not get health benefits from any of these studies. The researchers leading this optional study hope the results will help other people with cancer in the future. The results will not be added to your medical records and you or your study doctor will not know the results. You will not be billed for these optional studies. You can still take part in the main study even if you say “no” to any or all of these studies. If you sign up for but cannot complete any of the studies for any reason, you can still take part in the main study. Circle your choice of “yes” or “no” for each of the following studies. Optional Sample Collections for Laboratory Studies and Biobanking for Possible Future Studies Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer, diabetes, and other health problems. Much of this research is done using samples from your tissue, blood, urine, or other fluids. Through t hese studies, researchers hope to find new ways to prevent, detect, treat, or cure health problems. Some of these studies may be about genes. Genes carry information about features that are found in you and in people who are related to you. Researchers ar e interested in the way that genes affect how your body responds to treatment. If you choose to take part in this study, the study doctor for the main study would like to collect blood for research on determining who will react better to the intervention in helping them stop smoking. In addition, the researchers ask your permission to store and use your samples and related health information (for example, your response to cancer treatment, results of study tests and medicines you are given) for medical re search. The additional research that may be done is unknown at this time. Storing samples for future studies is called “biobanking”. The Biobank is being run by the Alliance and supported by the National Cancer Institute. WHAT IS INVOLVED? If you agree to take part, here is what will happen next: 1) About 2 tablespoons of blood will be collected from a vein in your arm at the baseline visit. 2) Your baseline blood sample and some related health information will be sent to a researcher for use in the study described above. Remaining baseline blood samples may be stored in the Biobank, along with samples from other people who take part. The samples will be kept until they are used up."
63,page_63,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 64 3) Qualified researchers can submit a request to use the materials stored in the Biobanks. A science committee at the Alliance, and/or the National Cancer Institute, will review each request. There will also be an ethics review to ensure that the request is necessary and proper. Researchers will not be given your name or any other information that could directly identify you. 4) Neither you nor your study doctor will be notified when research will be conducted or given reports or other information about any research that is done using your baseline blood samples. 5) Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in central databases that may be public, along with information from many other people. Information that could directly identify you will not be included. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS? 1) The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and possibly a bruise. 2) There is a risk that someone could get access to the personal information in your medical records or other information researchers have stored about you. 3) There is a risk t hat someone could trace the information in a central database back to you. Even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. The researchers believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small, but the risk may change in the future as people come up with new ways of tracing information. 4) In some cases, this information could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job or insurance. There are laws against the misuse of genetic information, but they may not give full protection. There can also be a risk in knowing genetic information. New health information about inherited traits that might affect you or your blood relatives could be found during a study. The researchers believe the chance these th ings will happen is very small, but cannot promise that they will not occur. HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE? Your privacy is very important to the researchers and they will make every effort to protect it. Here are just a few of the steps they will take: 1) When your samples are sent to the researchers, no information identifying you (such as your name) will be sent. Samples will be identified by a unique code only. 2) The list that links the unique code to your name will be kept separate from yo ur sample and health information. Any Biobank and Alliance staff with access to the list must sign an agreement to keep your identity confidential. 3) Researchers to whom the Alliance sends your sample and information will not know who you are. They must also sign an agreement that they will not try to find out who you are. 4) Information that identifies you will not be given to anyone, unless required by law. 5) If research results are published, your name and other personal information will not be used."
64,page_64,"Alliance A211401 Version Date: 04/27/18 Update 2 65 WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS? You will not benefit from taking part. The researchers, using the samples from you and others, might make discoveries that could help people in the future. ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS? There are no costs to you or your insurance. You will not be paid for taking part. If any of the research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not share in any profits. WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND?

For dose modification instructions for patients participating in this study, refer to Section 8.2 of the protocol. Psychiatric Symptom Management 1. Suicidal Ideation Assessment: Any study participant reporting suicidal ideation to a study coordinator or nurse will be psychiatrically evaluated immediately thereafter by either the site principal inv estigator or the on- call clinical investigator. Procedures in place to deal with suicidal ideation: If the participant is unwilling to seek help, the individual will be advised that the Site Research Team is required to report that the subject is threatening to harm him/herself and the patient will be escorted to the Emergency Department of the local hospital by ambulance for an evaluation by the psychiatrist on call. How and when study medication might be discontinued: At that time, the study medication will be stopped until further notice from the treating physician. If the medication is stopped permanently, the subject will be given the option of continuing in the study without the medication. 2. Depression Assessment: To diagnose depression, most of the following signs and symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks: sleep disturbances, impaired thinking or concentration, significant weight loss or gain, agitation or slowing of body movements, fatigue, low self -esteem, less interest in sex, thoughts of death (suicidal ideation – see above). Accordingly, any study participant reporting depression or severe change in mood to a study coordinator or nurse will be psychiatrically evaluated immediately thereafter by eithe r the principal investigator or the on -call clinical investigator. Procedures in place to deal with depression: • If it is determined that the current level of depression is likely to lead to self -harm or harm to others, the individual will be advised tha t the Site Research Team is required to report that the subject is threatening to harm him/herself and the patient will be escorted to the Emergency Department of the local hospital by ambulance for an evaluation by the psychiatrist on call. • If it is determined that the emerging depression requires treatment, the subject will be referred to one of the following: - Primary provider (the physician will call the provider) - Local mental health facility - Community psychiatric services How and when the study medication would be discontinued: If the site investigator notes new depression or an exacerbation of existing depression, the subject may be advised to modify the dose of the study drug. Based on the clinical assessment by the site investigator or one of the co-investigators the study medication may be stopped temporarily and then re -challenged at the target dose, reduced permanently, or discontinued permanently. If the study drug is permanently discontinued, the subject would still receive follow -up counseling according to the study protocol."

Quitting smoking may change levels of a specific liver enzyme called CYP1A2 , and may change how certain medications are metabolized by your body.  After you stop smoking, your study doctor will work with your regular prescriber to adjust m edicines that are considered “substrates” of CYP1A2 such as the blood thinner warfarin.  Before prescribing new medicines, your regular prescribers should go to http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx for a list of drugs to avoid, or contact your study doctor.  Your study doctor’s name is ____________________________ and can be contacted at ______________________________ ."
