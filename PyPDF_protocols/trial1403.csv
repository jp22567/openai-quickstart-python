E Page 10 of 132 1 INTRODUCTION This document is a clinical investigational plan (CIP) for a prospective, multi -center, single- arm investigational study intended to support CE Mark of the latest design iteration of the St Jude Medical Portico Delivery System (“ second -generation FlexNav ™ Delivery System”) . The investigational device is intended for use with the CE Marked Portico ™ Transcatheter Aortic Heart Valve (Portico ™ valve) for the treatment of symptomatic, s evere aortic stenosis in high and extreme surgical risk patients. The primary focus of the clinical investigation is to c haracteriz e the safety profile of the FlexNav™ Delivery System with respect to rate of major vascular complications, which is expected to be directly impacted by the recent design modifications to the FlexNav™ Delivery S ystem. This clinical study is sponsored by Abbott. This clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with this CIP . All investigators involved in the conduct of the clinical investigation will be qualified by education, training, or experience to perform their tasks and this training will be documented appropriately. 1.1 Background and Rationale Background TAVR in the Treatment of Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis (AS) is a clinically important degenerative valvular heart disease that is associated with poor prognosis following the onset of cardiac symptoms. In the elderly patient population, the prevalence of AS and severe AS is estimated at 12.4%, and 3.4%, respectively .1 Historically, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the primary treatment option for severe AS until seminal findings from the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) Cohort A and B Trials revealed transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), a less invasive treatment option, to be non- inferior to SAVR2 and superior to conventional medical therapy3 with respect to survival rates at 1 year. Investment in the TAVR platform has seen the technology emerge as the new standard of care for symptomatic patients with advanced disease at extreme surgical risk for whom no effective definitive therapy is available. In 2017, the AHA/ACC revised their guidelines in a focused update to make TAVR a class I indication (previously a class IIa indicat ion) for the treatment of AS in patients at both high and prohibitive surgical risk.4 Most recently, TAVR has been shown to be a safe alternative to SAVR in patients in whom surgery is feasible but who are considered to be intermediate risk5 with new trials in low surgical risk patient s currently underway . 1 Osnabrugge RLJ, Mylotte D, Head SJ et al.

E Page 11 of 132 TAVR and Major Vascular Complications Transfemoral access is recognized as the safest and thus preferred approach for TAVR with proven superiority over a transapical approach and conventional surgery in high and intermediate risk patients .6,7 Vascular access (defined by vessel calcification, tortuosity and vessel narrowing) continues to be the main limiting factor for transfemoral TAVR with a minimum vessel access diameter of ≥ 6mm required. As the use of TAV R expands to lower risk populations, minimizing vascular complications which are amongst the most frequen t and serious complications of transfemoral TAVR is of paramount importance as studies show vascular and bleeding complications during the procedure are associated with increas ed morbidity and mortality risk. 8,3 The incidence of major vascular complications via transfemoral access has reduced with the introduction of next -generation TAVR systems. In a meta -analysis of 1,232 match -controlled patients, the rate of major vascular complications was shown to de cline from 7.2% with early -generation TAVR systems to 2.5% with next-generation TAVR systems.9 Studies show arterial sheath size is an important determinant of major vascular complications and life -threatening/disabling bleeding during TAVR .10 Vascular complications occur when the minimal artery diameter is smaller than the sheath external diameter.i Specifically, a sheath to femoral artery ratio (SFAR) > 1.05 is shown to be associated with increased risk of major vascular complications and mortality at 30 days.11 Competitor TAVR Delivery Systems Edwards LifeSciences and Medtronic are the current TAVR market leaders accounting for 95% of the global TAVI market share. Two key design elements of the latest -generation, commercially -available balloon- expandable Edwards Sapi en 3™ valve and self -expandi ng Medtronic CoreValve™ Evolut ™ PRO valve systems that help mitigate the frequency of vascular and bleeding complications are: 1) a low insertion profile due to the use of a custom expandable sheath (Sapien 3™) and integrated sheath (Evolut ™ P RO™); and 2) the ability to achieve precise valve placement without repositioning or with minimal need to re- sheath and reposition. The Medtronic Evolut ™ PRO transcatheter heart valve is delivered through the EnVeo™ R Delivery Catheter System without the use of a separate arterial sheath and is indicated for vessels down to 5.0 mm. The EnVeo R system features a dedicated InLine Sheath that retains the outer diameter size as the system enters the vessel and advances to the annulus. The addition of the InLine sheath makes the EnVeo™ R Delivery Catheter System the lowest delivery platform currently on the market and provides a greater opportunity to treat patients with smaller vessels through the preferred transfemoral access route. The Edwards Commander ™ Delivery System is used for transfemoral delivery of the Edwards Sapien 3™ transcatheter heart valve . The delivery system uses a low -profile 14F expandable sheath (eSheath) that is intended to reduce the potential for arterial injury during introduction of the delivery system and valve. The expandable sheath transiently expands to accommodate safe passage of the compressed valve and 6 Arnold SV, Reynolds MR, Lei Y et al.

E Page 12 of 132 subsequently recoils to its lower profile diameter as the Sapien 3™ valve passes. The transient expansion of the eSheath minimizes the force required to inser t and pass the delivery system and valve through the sheath, while maintaining a reduced profile compared to other standard arterial sheaths. The reduced profile of these next -generation devices has increased the proportion of patients who are now eligible for transfemoral TAVR in Europe without compromising the risk of vascular injuries and access site complications. Commercial Portico Experience in Europe Abbott’s ( formerly St Jude Medical) first -generation, self -expanding Portico™ transcatheter aortic heart valve (THV) system has been in commercial use in Europe since 2012 when the 23mm Portico™ valve and transfemoral Portico ™ Delivery S ystem first received Conformité Européenne (CE) mark approval. Data from the P ORTICO TAVI System CE Mark study (PORTICO CE Mark study ) was used to support device approval. The PORTICO CE Mark study was the first prospective, European, non -randomized, multi- center clinical study to assess safety and performance of the full family of Portico™ valve sizes at 30 days and through 1 year . As part of the study, 222 patients with symptomatic, severe AS at high surgical risk were recruited between December 2011 and September 2015 across 12 centers in Europe (n=11) and Australia (n=1). Due to the sequential release of valve sizes in Europe, subjects were enrolled in three separate cohorts commencing with the Portico™ 23mm valve cohort on 6 December 2011; 25mm valve cohort on 14 January 2013; and 27/29mm valve cohort on 13 February 2014.). A minimum of 50 patients were implanted with each available Portico™ THV size (23, 25, 27, 29 mm) in the study. Initial 30-day results of patients implanted with the 23mm and 25mm valves (n=100) were published in 201612; with 30- day and 1- year outcomes data for all 220 patients successfully implanted with the full -family of Portico™ valve published shortly thereafter13, 14. Overall, results through to12 months demonstrated the full family of Portico™ valves are safe when implanted via transfemoral access and have good clinical, functional and hemodynamic outcomes. One of the key anatomical requirements for transfemoral valve implantation in the PORTICO CE Mark study was a minimum vessel access diameter of ≥6mm t o safety accommodate the use of a separate arterial sheath with the first -generation Portico™ Delivery System. Since CE Mark of the Portico ™ THV system in Europe, approximately 8000 commercial procedures have been performed using the full family of THV sizes (23, 25, 27 and 29mm) via a transfemoral access approach. Despite growing adoption of the Portico THV system in Europe, the introduction of optimized delivery catheter systems with low er profile sheaths has prompted some physicians to begin implant ing the Portico™ valve via a ‘sheathless ’ approach (insertion of the delivery system without a separate introducer) . Results from single -center experiences that have implanted the Portico™ valve without the use of a separate introducer suggest the reduced insertion profile of the delivery system associated with a “sheathless” approach leads to improved r ates of major vascular complications, life -threatening or disabling bleeding and major bleeding events15,16. In support of the data, the Portico™ Delivery System received CE Mark in May 2018 to be used ‘sheathless ’. 12 Manoharan G, Linke A, Moellmann H, et al.

E Page 13 of 132 Customer Need for Second- Generation Portico Delivery System Based on customer feedback , the first -generation Portico Delivery System used in the PORTICO CE Mark study has undergone several design modifications to better compete against the current market -leading TAVR devices and to allow for future movement into expanded patient indications (i.e. intermediate risk, low risk, valve -in-valve, alternate access) . The second- generation FlexNav™ Delivery System (“FlexN av™ Delivery System”) builds on the strength of the existing Portico platform and technology (i .e. maintains the ‘best in class’ trackability of the first - generation Portico™ Delivery System) while incorporating design features that improve overall performance and provide one of the lowest insertion profiles. Specifically, the FlexNav™ Delivery System features a redesigned handle with improved ergonomic design to provide a more intuitive operation during valve deployment, a hydrophilic stability layer to minimize system manipulations and support precise valve placement and an integrated sheath to reduce the delivery profile diameter to minimize vessel trauma at the access site . While these new design modifications do not alter the procedure to load or deploy the Portico™ valve, the safety profile of the FlexNav™ Delivery System is expected to be comparatively better to the first - generation Portico™ Delivery System with respect to access -site complications and vascular injury . It is also anticipated to allow physicians the ability to treat more patients via the preferred transfemoral access approach. Abbott is proposing to undertake a prospective, single- arm study (“FlexNav EU study”) to collect safety outcomes data on the FlexNav™ Delivery System, which will be submitted as part of the CE Mark submission to support commercial use of the Portico™ Transcatheter Heart Valve with the FlexNav™ Delivery System in Europe . The proposed FlexNav EU study will include a minimum of 73 analysis patients. To achieve the minimum required sample size, prospective data from subjects enrolled in the FlexNav study of the Portico US IDE pivotal trial (“US IDE FlexNav study”) may be combined with FlexNav EU study subjects. The US IDE FlexNav study is a prospective, multicenter single- arm study of high or extreme risk subjects with severe symptomatic AS who undergo Portico™ valve implantation with the FlexNav™ Delivery System in the Portico US IDE pivotal trial. Abbott plans to submit safety results when a total of 73 subjects from this clinical investigation and the US FlexNav IDE study have reached 30 days of follow -up in the CE Mark submission. Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation The rationale for conducting the FlexNav EU study is to collect safety data in a high or extreme surgical risk patient population to support CE Mark of the second- generation FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System in Europe. A minimum of 73 high or extreme risk patients with symptomatic, severe native AS who meet eligibility criteria for transfemoral implantation of the Portico™ valve will be enrolled in the clinical investigation study to ensure sufficient precision to assess the clinical impact of the FlexNav™ Delivery System on rate of major vascular complications at 30 days. It is expected the rate of major vascular complications at 30 days will be numerically lower than the rate reported in published literature using the first -generation Portico™ Delivery System due to design modifications that (1) enhance valve deliverability, (2) reduce the system’s profile and (3) minimize vessel trauma at the vascular -access site."

E Page 18 of 132 As with the first -generation Portico™ Delivery system, the FlexNav™ Delivery Systems deploys the annulus end of the valve first to allow gradual deployment of the valve. The position of a partially deployed valve can be evaluated, and if needed, the valve can be re- sheathed and re- deployed, provided the valve has not been fully deployed from the delivery system. The partially deployed valve may be re- sheathed a maximum of two times. Summary of key design improvements to the FlexNav™ Delivery System: • Integrated sheath to allow sheathless ins ertion • Hydrophilic coating for smoother insertion and tracking to the target area • Stability Layer to improve valve handling and improve placement accuracy during deployment • Improved handle design to provide easier user operation FlexNav Loading System The Portico FlexNav ™ Loading S ystem, like the current (first -generation) Portico™ Loading System is an accessory used to compress and load the Portico™ valve onto the FlexNav ™ Delivery System. The FlexNav ™ Loading System is identical in design and operation to the current Portico ™ Loading System with changes to the loading base (integrated guide tube), and modified loading base insert (modified for inner ring diameter to fit the integrated guide tube). The integrated guide tube of the FlexNav ™ Loading System eliminates the potential for the tip of the delivery system to interact with the valve leaflets during loading of the valve onto the delivery system. All other FlexNav ™ Loading S ystem components (loading funnel, loading tube, leaflet tester) are the same as the current system. The method of loading the Portico ™ valve onto the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem is also unchanged . Figure 5 shows the individual components of FlexNav ™ Loading S ystem . The materials of construction for the FlexNav ™ Loading System are identical to the current loading system components. The 18F FlexNav ™ Loading System is used for loading the 23 or 25mm Portico ™ valves on the 18F FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem; the 19F FlexNav ™ loading system is used for loading the 27 or 29mm Portico ™ valves on the 19F FlexNav ™ Delivery System.

Safety data collected as part of the study will be used to support CE M ark of the FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System in Europe. 3.2 Design Overview This CE Mark study is a prospective, multi- center, singl e-arm investigationa l study to support commercialization of the FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System in Europe. The design of this clinical investigation is in compliance to ISO standards 14155:2011 and 5840- 3:2013. A maximum of 200 patients with symptomatic, severe AS considered by both a local Heart Team and independent Subject Selection Committee to be high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve implantation will be enrolled from up to eight (8) experienced, high -volume TAVI implant centers in Europe . Experienced implant centers are defined as those sites that have completed the commercial Portico implant training program and have at least one primary implanting physician that has performed 50 or more Portico implants within the previous 12 months. No investigational site may enroll more than 20% of the maximum study sample (n=40). To support CE Mark of the FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System, data from a minimum of 73 subjects who undergo a Portico™ valve implant attempt will be included in a pre -specified primary safety endpoint analysis at 30 days. To achieve the minimum required sample size, prospective data from subjects enrolled in the FlexNav study of the Portico US IDE pivotal trial (“US IDE FlexNav study”) may be combined with FlexNav EU study subj ects. Subject selection and key data collection in the FlexNav EU study will follow the US IDE FlexNav study to facilitate pooling of safety outcomes data at 30 days. An independent Subject Selection Committee will be responsible for final approval of the subject’s eligibility and risk classification. Upon provision of informed consent, subjects will undergo Portico™ valve implantation via a transfemoral access approach according to the site’s anesthesia protocol for TAVR procedures (conscious sedation or general anesthesia). Subject enrollment in the FlexNav EU study will continue up to a maximum of 200 subjects, in order to allow implanters continued access to the FlexNav™ Delivery System while the results for the primary endpoint are collected, assessed and CE Mark submission is under BSI review (expected review duration of 9 months)."

E Page 20 of 132 The total enrollment duration of the study is expected to be 10 months. Subject case report forms (CRFs) will be collected for screening, baseline, procedure, at discharge, and at 30 days, 6 months and 12-months post-index procedure. Assessments required at each visit in the FlexNav EU study are outlined in section 3.3. 3.3 Clinical Investigation Procedures and Follow -up Schedule The Flow Chart and the Follow -up requirements of this clinical investigation are described below. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility by the Investigator as well as the local Heart Team per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. S ubjects will then be reviewed by an independent Subject S election Committee to confirm anatomical suitability and appropriateness of surgical risk classi fication assigned by the local Heart T eam. If the Subject Selection C ommittee determine the subject’s anatomy precludes transfemoral implantation of the Portico ™ valve using the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem the subject will be exited from the study as a screen failure. Additionally, if the Subject Selection C ommittee assign a surgical risk classification that the local Heart Team does not agree with, the subject will be exited from the study as a screen failure. For subjects approved by the Subject Selection Committee, c linical investigation visits will occu r at baseline, implant procedure, d ischarge, 30 days, 6 months and 12 months post -implant ation (Figure 6). It is strongly recommended the baseline visit be scheduled within 14 days of receiving Subject Selection Committee approval. Follow -up visits will be conducted in-person at the investigati onal site a nd will include a combination of standard of care and study -specific testing. If an in -office visit is not possible for a patient, medical records from another care facility and a phone visit may be conducted. All enrolled s ubjects will be foll owed to their 12-month visit. At the conclusion of the 12-month follow -up visit, participation in the clinical investigation will end and subjects will be followed as part of standard of care."

E Page 22 of 132 Screening by an inter -disciplinary local Heart Team At each investigational site, a local heart team consisting of at least of one cardiac surgeon and one interventional cardiologist will be responsible for screening patients for anatomical suitability and surgical risk classification for participation in the clinical investigation. The Primary Investigator may serve the role of the cardiac surgeon or interventional cardiologist on the local heart team . Assessment of Anatomical Suitability by a Computed Tomography (CT) sizing Core Laboratory An independent Computed Tomography (CT) Core Laboratory will be used for anatomical assessments of each patient prior to enrollment in the study (Refer to section 5.4 for definition of Subject Enrollment) . Assessment results will be provided to the Subject Selection Committee for consideration o f a subject’s eligibility to participate in the study, primary arterial access side (left or right) and valve size selection. Each investigational site is responsible for performing the CT scan according to the core laborato ry imaging protocol. If the CT C ore Laboratory determines that the data is unreadable, the site will be responsible for having the subject return for another assessment. Use of an Independent Subject Selection Committee An independent Subject Selection Committee (SSC) , consisting of cardiologists and surgeons considered experts in the field of aortic valve replacement with a focus on TAVR will be responsible for ensuring all subjects’ c linical eligibility (i.e. risk classification ) and technical suitability (i.e. anato mical criteria) for implant in conjunction to the protocol and sizing recommendations provided in the IFU. SSC review and approval is required prior to scheduling a subject for a baseline visit . The same independent SSC responsible for reviewing patients in the Portico US IDE trial will be utilized for the current clinical investigation. The composition, guiding policies and operating procedures governing the SSC in this clinical investigation is further defined in a separate SSC Charter . Adjudication of Adverse Events by an Independent Clinical Events Committee An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC), consisting of, at a minimum, an interventional cardiologist, cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and a neurologist will review and adjudicate pre- specified events reported by investigators or identified by Safety personnel in the clinical investigation as defined in the CEC Manual of Operations Charter. E vents related to primary and descriptive endpoint criteria will be adjudicated according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC -2) definitions. The CEC will have final adjudication responsibilities for subject outcomes related to primary and descriptive outcome measures . The same CEC used in the Portico US IDE pivotal trial will be utilized for this clinical investigation. Review of Echocardiographic Images by an Independent Echocardiographic Core Laboratory An independent Echocardiographic Core Laboratory will be utilized for the analysis of the screening and all study visit echocardiograms according to the echocardiographic protocol. The screening echocardiogram will be assessed for aortic stenosis severity (including valve hemodynamic performance parameters; aortic valve area, mean transvalvular gradi ent, peak velocity). Echocardiograms"

Each site is responsible for performing the echocardiogram according to the core laboratory imaging protocol , forwarding the exam to the core laboratory for analysis and providing local interpretation of the echocardiogram for clinical assessment. The echo cardiographic core laboratory will not be responsible for notifying the site of any abnormal findings that are identified in the study. The responsibility of the cor e laboratory is to complete the data collection forms and submit these to the Sponsor. Monitoring Follow -Up Compliance The Sponsor will work with investigational sites to maintain a high follow -up compliance as follows: 1. Sponsor will emphasize to the site the importance of subject follow -up during site initiation visits and subsequent communications. Site should communicate the importance of follow -up visits to each subject. 2. Sites will be informed to promptly reschedule any missed subject visits, and t o reinforce the necessity of a follow -up visit to the subject . 3. Site is advised to involve Sponsor when needed. Example: Arrange alternate transportation if a scheduled visit is missed due transportation/travel issues, or due to subject illness 4. Sites should document reasons for any subject withdrawals from the trial, and request agreement for a follow -up call from the investigator when the last subject has completed the 12-month visit. 5. Sites should monitor follow -up rates closely to promptly identify and address any issues. Additionally, investigational sites will be educated on the importance of maintaining low rates of withdrawals, and will be expected to make all effort to maintain low withdrawals during trial conduct. Withdrawals from the trial will require discussion between I nvestigator and the Sponsor. Standardized Administration of Patient -Reported Outcome Measures and Stroke Assessment Scales (mRS and NIHSS) A standardized script will be used when administering patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures to minimize bias and undue influence. All PRO measures must be completed by the subject or his/her legal representative (where allowed per local regulations). In the latter case, a note to file must be completed to document the inability of the subject to complete the measures (s). The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and National Institute of Heath Stroke Scale(NIHSS) must be completed by an assessor who has a current certificate that demonstrates completion of an accredited training program for these strok e scales. 3.5 Suspension or Early Termination of the Clinical Investigation No formal statistical rule for early termination of the clinical investigation for insufficient safety or performance of the device under investigation is defined."

Subjects must sign and date the informed consent prior to conducting any study- specific procedures not considered standard of care. Any patient data transmitted to the independent CT and Echocardiographic core labor atories, SSC or Sponsor for screening pu rposes must have prior signed and dated Informed Consent. The operative risk determination of study candidates will be based on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Calculator score and the EuroSCORE II score . Subject case review will be conducted by the SSC to determine the patient’s anatomical eligibility to receive a Portico valve using the FlexNav ™ Delivery Syste m and final risk classification. Refer to the SSC charter for a full description of the review process. Subjec ts will be assigned as high or extreme risk according to criteria below: High R isk Classification: High risk classification will be assigned to subjects with severe aortic stenosis symptoms for whom conventional aortic valve replacement surgery is associated with high risk equivalent to an STS risk score that is ≥8%. Patients with an STS risk score that is <8% will be assigned high risk if frailty indices and/or existing co- morbidities not captured by STS are also present . Specifically, assessments of patient’s physical performance including a 15-foot (5m) g ait speed test, grip strength testing and Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living will be considered along with surgical comorbidities not addressed in the STS score (including porcelain aorta, pulmonary hypertension, severe mitral regurgitation, moderate -severe tricuspid regurgitation, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic and oxygen dependent lung disease). Extreme risk classification Extreme risk classification will be assigned to subjects with severe aortic stenosis symptoms who are deemed unsuitable for conventional aortic valve replacement because of predicted probability of ≥50% mortality, or at risk for a serious irreversible complication by 30 days. Subjects with an STS risk score that is >8%, aged > 90 years and with a frailty index ≥2 will automatically qualify for extreme risk classification."

E Page 27 of 132 5.2 Subject Screening and Informed Consent Subject Screening Potential patients presenting at the study sites will be fully informed about the clinical investigation, following the established Informed Consent process (described in S ection 5.2.2 ). Once a duly dated and signed Informed Consent f orm is obtained, the clinical investigation -specific screening procedures may begin. All cardiac medications and all medications given for cardiovascular effect may be continued at their prescribed dosages for the screening assessments . The following assessments are performed as part of the screening process: 1. Demographics (age on consent date, gender, height) 2. Medical History (including previous cardiovascular operations and events, coexisting cardiovascular diseases , clinically significant peripheral vascular disease, previous peripheral vascular operations, other coexisting medical conditions e.g., diabetes, hypertension, kidney and lung disease, endocarditis) 3. Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Scale Assessment 4. Surgical Risk As sessment tools (STS Risk Score and EuroSCORE II) 5. Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) Test, if clinically indicated 6. Physical Exam (including weight, heart rate, blood pressure) 7. Echocardiography to include comprehensive transthoracic or transesophageal 2D echocardiogram, including assessment of aortic valve gradients (mean and peak), areas, indices, degree of regurgitation, cardiac output and cardiac index, left ventricle systolic function (global and segmental) 8. Lab Measurements ( including CBC and Platelet count, BUN and creatinine, BNP or ProBNP, and Albumin ) 9. 12 Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) 10. Computed Tomography Scan with Angiography for chest, abdomen and pelvis: aortic root and valve annulus sizing, assessment of suitability of iliofemoral access, and determination of appropriate coaxial angles for optimizing the valve implantation procedure. CT scan performed up to 12 months prior to consent will be acceptable. 11. 3D Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) if CT is contraindicated 12. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification 13. Frailty Index A ssessment ( Katz index of Activates of Daily Living, Grip Strength, 5 meter walk test) 14. Coronary and aortic angiogram (arteriograms of the lower abdominal aorta to the femoral arteries), with runoff if clinically indicated. Coronary and aortic angio gram performed up to 12 months prior to consent will be acceptable. 15. Adverse Event Assessment Subjects must be screened for clinical investigation eligibility by a member of the study site’s clinical investigation team ( Principal Investigator and/or Research Coordi nator) previously trained to the CIP , and if applica ble will be entered into a site -specific screening log."

E Page 28 of 132 In case the subject does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets any of the exclusion criteria, the subject will be considered a screening failure. The Principal Investigator or the delegated clinical investigation personnel will record the screening failure in the hospital records and on a screening log as applicable. Patients meeting general inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be asked to sign an I nformed Consent form if they wish to participate in the clinical investigation . These patients will also be entered into the screening log. Providing Informed Consent is the first step in the enrollment process however the subject is not fully enrolled in the study until all enrollment steps are complete per protocol (see section 5.4 ). However, once the patient has provided Informed Consent , study -specific subject data will be collected in the clinical investigation. Screening tests that are specifically study -related and would generally not be considered standard of care in Europe include: • Frailty Index Assessment (Katz index of Activates of Daily Living, Grip Strength, 5 meter walk test) • Forced Expiratory Volume Test (if clinically required) • New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification • Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Scale Assessment Refer to APPENDIX VII for a description of the tests involved in the Frailty Index Assessment . Data available in the patient’s medical record may be utilized to fulfill screening requirements and testing does not need to be repeated if performed within 60 days prior to Informed Consent . Computed Tomography (CT) scan with angiography and coronary and aortic angiogram (with runoff if clinically indicated) may be performed within 12 months prior to Informed C onsent. Upon initial screening of eligibility of patients by the local Heart Team, subject case reviews will be conducted by an independent SSC to confirm a patient’s eligibility to transfemorally receive a Portico™ valve. The SSC will also provide final determination of a subject’s risk classification for the study . If a site disagr ees with the committee’s final decision regarding risk classification the subject will not be eligible for enrollment in the study. If the SSC does not approve the patient, they will be exited from the study as a screen failure. Informed Consent The Investigator or his/her authorized designee will conduct the Informed Consent process, as required by applicable regulations and the center’s EC. This process will include a verbal discussion with the subject on all aspects of the clinical investigation that are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate, such as details of clinical investigation procedures, anticipated benefits, and potential risks of clinical investigation particip ation. Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the clinical investigation at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Withdrawal from the clinical investigation will not jeopardize their future medical care or relationship with the investigator. During the discussion, the Principal Investigator or his/her authorized designee will avoid any improper influence on the subject and will respect subject’s legal rights. The subject shall be provided with the Informed Consent form written in a language that is understandable to the subject and has been approved by the center’s EC. The subject shall have adequate time to review, ask questions and consider participation. The Principal Investigator or his/her authorized designee will make efforts to ensure that the"

If the subject agrees to participate, the Informed Consent form must be signed and dated by the subject and thereafter by the person obtaining the consent prior to any clinical investigation -specific procedures. The signed original will be filed in the subject’s hospital or research charts, and a copy will be provided to the subject. Failure to obtain informed consent from a subject prior to clinical investigation enrollment should be reported to Sponsor within 5 working days and to the reviewing center’s E C according to the EC’s reporting requirements. If, during the clinical investigation, new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, the Principal Investigator or his/her authorized designee wil l provide this information to the subject. If relevant, the subject will be asked to confirm their continuing informed consent in writing. Vulnerable Populations Vulnerable patients are defined as patients whose willingness to volunteer in a clinical inve stigation could be unduly influenced by the expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. Examples of populations which may contain vulnerable patients include: Individuals with lack of or loss of autonomy due to immaturity or through mental disability, persons in nursing homes, children, impoverished persons, subjects in emergency situations, ethnic minority groups, homeless persons, nomads, refugees, and those incapable of giving informed consent. Other vulnerable patients include, for example, members of a group with a hierarchical structure such as university students, subordinate hospital and laboratory personnel, employees of the sponsor, members of the armed forces, and persons kept in detention. This clinical investigation will not permit enrollment o f patients from vulnerable populations identified in ISO Standards 14155. 5.3 Eligibility Criteria General Eligibility Crit eria Assessment for general eligibility criteria is based on medical records of the site and interview with a candidate patient . If some of the clinical and laboratory tests are not included in site standard tests, they must be done but after written Informed Consent is obtained. Patients must meet ALL of the inclusion criteria to be considered for the clinical investigation. If A NY of the exclusion criteria are met, the patient is excluded from the clinical investigation and cannot be enrolled. Inclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria - High Risk Cohort Candidates for High Risk classification must meet all the following inclusion cr iteria: 1. Subjects must have co‐ morbidities such that the local heart team concur the predicted risk of operative mortality is ≥15% or a minimum STS score of 8%."

All Investigators must read and understand the IFU and Investigator Brochure. Anticoagulation Therapy Anticoagulation use during the procedure is left to the physician’s discretion or should be established as with any other biological valve implantation, considering risks and benefits for the patient. The activated clotting time (ACT) should be monitored and recorded on source documentation during the procedure and medications should be adjusted to attempt to keep the subject’s ACT>250 seconds. Treatment Procedures The local heart team's interventional cardiologist(s) and cardiac surgeon(s) must jointly participate in the intra-operative technical aspects of the TAVR procedure. It is strongly encouraged that the index procedure occur w ithin 1 4 calendar days following SSC approval . At least one transcatheter aortic valve may be implanted in a subject who has signed the Informed Consent Form, and Data Protection Form (if applicable). Although not recommended, if a physician determines it is in the best interest of the subject to have a second transcatheter aortic valve placed, a subject may receive an additional transcatheter aortic valve (Valve -in-Valve) . Standardized imaging techniques will be used during the index procedure to implant t he valve and to assess valve performance and coronary patency. The following data will be collected during the implant procedure: 1. Device access, deployment and final valve placement data collection 2. Aortic systolic/diastolic pressure, mean aortic pressure, m ean aortic valve gradient, peak aortic valve gradient and aortic regurgitation (post -implant only) immediately pre- and post implant , 3.

Refer to APPENDIX XVIII for a description of standardized methods for measuring aortic regurgitation according to VAR C II criteria and instructions for assessing implant depth in the LVOT. During the procedure, the implanting physician may determine implantation of the Portico™ valve is either not feasible or not in the best interest of the patient. Reasons may include, but are not limited to, anatomy that is not suitable for implantation, inability to gain access, ventricular arrhythmia, or any other contraindication. If the implant procedure was not attempted (i.e. the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem was never introduced int o the subject’s vasculature), the subject will not be considered enrolled. Refer to Section 5. 4 Subject Enrollment. If the implant procedure was attempted (i.e. the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem was introduced into subject’s vasculature) but the Portico™ valve could not be implanted (e.g. Portico attempted but other valve ultimately placed in the annulus), the subject will be withdrawn from the study after a 30 -day adverse event collection period. All the required information must be recorded on the applicable CRF. Sponsor Representatives will be involved in providing support during the implant procedure. Following the procedure, the FlexNav ™ Delivery and Loading S ystems should be securely disposed as per hospital requirements for hazardous materials.

Follow -up for All Enrolled Subjects Required clinical follow -up will be performed at the following intervals for all subjects who underwent a Portico implant attempt and were implanted with a Portico ™ valve: • 30 days ( -7 days/ +21 days) follow -up site visit (visit must be conducted even if subject is in hospital) • 6 months (180 days ± 30 days) follow up site visit • 12 months (365 days - 30 days , +45 days ) follow up site visit Subject s with a Portico implant attempt that did not have a Portico™ valve implant ed will only be required to complete the 30 day follow up v isit. Follow -up visits will be calculated from the date of the implant p rocedure. Follow -up assessments can be performed at any point within the pre- specified follow -up visit window, and should be conducted, whenever possible, by the same individual who performed the baseline tests. Every effort should be made by the study site to have the subject return to the investigational site for all follow -up visits. If, despite all efforts, the subject is unable to return to the study site during a follow -up window, subjects may undergo a remote follow -up assessment to collect applicable data. Remote assessments should include telephone contact with the subject and/or a visit to a medical facility with all data that can be reasonably and legally collected remotely on the study subject. Follow -up visits occurring at non -study sites will be limited to standard of care data collection only. Authorization for the release of medical records from non- study facility is the responsibility of the investigational site. Protocol deviations will be required for all missed testing. An enrolled subject may only be followed at another investigational site with prior agreement from that site’s Investigator and from the Sponsor. Each site will be responsible for performing and interpreting the follow -up echocardiogram s using the VARC-2 definitions. Echocardiograms will be sent to an independent Echocardiographic Core Laboratory for further analysis. Exams should be recorded in DICOM format and should be de- identified pr ior to sending to the Sponsor. 30 Day Follow -Up The 30-d ay follow -up visit will take p lace 30 days ( -7/+21 days) post -index procedure, and will include the following assessments : 1. Physical exam (weight, heart rate, blood pressure) 2. Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Scale Assessment 3. Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)"

Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Measures The following PRO measures will be collected according to the CIP requirements to assess whether the health of subjects has improved since enrollment in the clinical investigation: • EuroQoL (EQ) 5D -3L Questionnaire • SF-36 • KCCQ • Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE -2) • Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Scale Assess ment • New York Heart Association Functional Classification • Barthel Index Refer to APPENDIX VIII-XIV for copies of the exact format and version of PRO measures that will be administered as part of the clinical investigation The Principal Investigator, research coordinator or study designee will administer the patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures . It is important the subject understands the meaning of all words and instructions in the measures. The subject should be instructed to ask any questions about the measures if further explanation is needed. Once the PRO measures are completed, the research coordinator or study designee will review for completeness to verify that all questions have been answered according to the directio ns provided. EQ-5D-3L questionnaire The EuroQol 5D 3 level version (EQ -5D-3L) questionnaire is a standardized i nstrument used as a measure of health outcome and quality of life. The self -administered questionnaire consists of two pages: the EQ - 5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The questionnaire is cognitively simple and takes only a few minutes to complete. The EQ -5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a 20cm vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled ‘100 = Best imaginable health state’ and ‘ 0=Worst imaginable health state’. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. An EQ -5D health state may be converted to a single summary index by applying a formula that attaches weights to each of the levels in each dimension. Refer to APPENDIX X for the sample questionnaire. SF-36 The Medical Outcomes Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36 v2 ) is a widely used, validated questionnaire that provides an indicator of overall health status. The self -administered questionnaire consists of 10 items across eight separate domains (Vitality, Physical functioning, Bodily pain, General health perceptions, Physical role functioning, Emotional role functioning, Social role functioning, Mental health) . The questionnaire takes approximately five to 10 minutes to complete; elderly subjects may require 15 minutes."

[A] Study Name: FlexNav EU CE Mark Study Clinical Investigation Plan This confidential document is the property of Abbott and shall not be reproduced, distributed, disclosed or used without the express written consent of Abbott Template: 86357 Rev. E Page 42 of 132 Two sets of scores are derived from the SF- 36; eight individual domain scores, and two summary scores, one for the physical component (PCS) and one for the mental component (MCS) summary scores. For each set of scores, two alternative approaches may be used in calculating scores: a normal, additive approach that produces 0- to-100 scores for the eight scales (with a lower score indicating more disability and higher scores less disability), and a norm -based approach that adjusts these raw scores to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Refer to APPENDIX XI for the sample questionnaire. Kanas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23- item, validated, self-administered instrument that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self -efficacy and knowledge, and quality of life in patients with congestive heart failure or weakened heart muscle due to prior heart attacks, heart valve problems, viral infections, or other causes. The KCCQ evaluates eight (8) clinically relevant domains including: physical limitations, symptoms (frequency and severity), change over time, self -efficacy and knowledge, social function and quality of life. The questionnaire requires, on average, 4– 6 minutes to com plete. The KCCQ is scored by assigning each response an ordinal value, beginning with 1 for the response that implies the lowest level of functioning and summing items within each domain. Missing values within each domain are assigned the average of the answered items within that same domain. Scale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing by the range of the scale and multiplying by 100. To facilitate interpretability, two summary scores were developed; functional status score and a clinical summary score where higher scores reflect better health status . Refer to APPENDIX XII for the sample questionnaire. Mini-Mental State Examination The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a validated, 11-question tool used to assess mental status. The MMSE tests five areas o f cognitive function: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language. It takes 5- 10 minutes to complete and must be administered using a script to the study subject . The MMSE begins with a graded assessment of orientation to place and time, followed by testing two aspects of memory (immediate recall for three objects presented orally, followed by a serial sevens task which is interposed to assess attention, concentration, calculation, and to prevent the individual from rehearsing the three objects previously learned). The third and final section surveys aphasia by testing functions of naming, repetition, understanding a three -stage command, reading, writing and copying a drawing. A maximum score of 30 is possible with a score of 23 or lower indicative of cognitive impairment. Refer to APPENDIX XIII for the sample questionnaire. Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Scale Assessment The C anadian Cardiovascular Society a ngina grading scale (CCS Angina Scale) is a widely used, self - administered four-point ordinal scale that classifies angina pectoris from mild (class I: angina occurring only during strenuous or prolonged physical activity) to severe (class IV: inability to perform any activity without angina, or angina at rest) and includes the full spectrum of angina from chronic stable to unstable. The assessment takes approximately 1-2 minutes to complete. Refer to APPENDIX IX for the sampl e questionnaire. New York Heart Association Functional Classification The New York Heart Association (NY HA) Functional Classification is a validated tool used to classify the extent of heart failure in patients . It places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are"

The NHYA function classification remains the most important prognostic marker for heart failure in routine clinical use. The current version includes two sections: functional capacity NYHA Classification based on patient symptoms and an objective assessment based on physical exam and diagnostic tools. Refer to APPENDIX VIII for the sample questionnaire. Barthel Index The Barthel Index for Activities of Daily Living ( Barthel Index ) is used to measure functional independence in activities of daily living (ADL). The validated tool takes 5 minutes to complete and assesses 10 performance items describing ADL and mobility including: feeding, bathing, grooming, dressing, bowel control, bladder control, toilet use, transfers (bed to chair to back), mobility on level surfaces, stai r use). Eac h performance item is rated on a scale with a given number of points assigned to each level or ranking with a higher number associated with a greater likelihood of being able to live at home with a degree of independence following discharge from the hospital. Total possible scores range from 0 – 100, with lower scores indicating increased disability. If used to measure improvement after treatment , changes of more than two points in the total score reflect a probable genuine change, and change on one item from fully dependent to independent is also likely to be reliable.

E Page 46 of 132 6.6 Requirement for C ore Laboratories Independent core laboratories used in the Portico US IDE pivotal trial will be utilized for evaluating CT images and echocardiograms in th e clinical investigation. Contact details for the CT and e chocardiographic core laboratories are included in APPENDIX XXII . CT scan and echo exams will be forwarded to the respective core laboratories for interpretation by each investigational site. The core laboratories will not be responsible for notifying the site of any abnormal findings that are identified in the study. The core laboratories will provide the study required interpretation and documentation of each data submission according to Standard Operating Procedures . Data obtained from the core laboratory readings will be used for study purposes only and not for clinical treatment of the subject. The Sponsor will use only the measurements provided by the core laboratories in data analyses. If the core laboratory determines that the data are unreadable, the site will be responsible for having the subject return for another assessment. 7 ADVERSE EVENTS To comply with worldwide standards and guidelines on clinical investigation adverse event reporting, the Sponsor has adopted uniform and worldwide applicable standard definitions and reporting timelines to be used and adhered to by the investigators. 7.1 Definition s Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the medical device under investigation. Note 1: This definition includes events related to the medical device under investigat ion. Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved. Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to medical devices under investigation. Serious Adverse Event If the AE meets any of the criteria below, it is regarded as a serious adverse event (SAE). a) Led to a death b) Led to a serious deterioration in health of the subject, that either resulted in 1. a life -threatening illness or injury, or 2. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or 3. in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or"

Note : A planned hospitalization for pre- existing condition, or a procedure required by the CIP , without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be an SAE. Device Deficiency Device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and inadequate labeling. This includes the failure of the device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended. Note: Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling of the device. 7.2 Device Relationship Determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that an investigational product or device under investigation caused or contributed to an AE is to be determined by the Investigator and recorded on the appropriate CRF form. Determination should be based on assessment of temporal relationships, evidence of alternative etiology, medical/biologic plausibility, and patient condition (pre- existing condition). Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (USADE) Unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE) refers to any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 7.3 Adverse Event and Device Deficiency Reporting Adverse Event Reporting Safety surveillance and reporting starts as soon as the patient is consented into the clinical investigation . Safety surveillance and reporting will continue until the last 12-month follow -up visit has been performed, the subject is deceased, the subject concludes participation in the clinical investigation or the subject withdr aws from the clinical investigation. A ll adverse event data , including deaths and device deficiency data, will be collected throughout the time period defined above and will be reported to the Sponsor on a CRF. Additional inf ormation with regard to an adverse event should be updated within the appropriate CRF. Unchanged, chronic, non -worsening or pre- existi ng conditions are not AEs and should not be reported. Adver se event reporting will include:"

Contact details are provided in APPENDIX XVII ]. 8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS The following section describes the statistical methods for the clinical investigation. Additional details on statistical analyses, including justification of clinical investigation design, poolability analyses, handling of missing data and analysis of descriptive endpoints will be maintained in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 8.1 Analysis Populations The analysis population will include all subjects in whom a Portico implant is attempted. A Portico implant attempt is defined as insertion of the FlexNav™ Delivery System into the subjec t’s vasculature . 8.2 Statistical Analyses Primary Safety Endpoint Analyses The primary safety endpoint of the FlexNav EU study is VARC II defined major vascular complications at 30 days post index procedure. Analysis Methodology The proportion of subjects experiencing a primary endpoint will be estimated from the binomial model. The 95% upper confidence bound will be calculated using the exact binomial method. The estimate will be descriptively compared with published data for the Portico valve us ing the first -generation Portico delivery system and commercially -available valves. Analysis Population for Primary Safety Endpoint The analysis population will include subjects who undergo an implant attempt that is described in Section 8.1"

E Page 50 of 132 8.3 Sample Size Calculation and Assumptions The minimum sample size of 73 subjects is based on the desire to estimate the rate of major vascular complications at 30- days with a sufficient degree of precision so that the 95% upper confidence limit will be within the range of rates reported in other Portico studies and for commercially -available transcatheter valves. As reported in the Portico CE Mark study (NCT01493284) and the Portico I Post -Market Clinical Follow - Up study (NCT01802788), the rate of major vascular complications at 30 days for subjects undergoing transfemoral Portico valve implantation using the first -generation Delivery System was 7.2%13 and 5.5%17 respectively. In the CoreValve Evolut R US pivotal study (NCT02207569), access -site related major vascular complications at 30 days was reported to be 7.5% (includes transfemoral and alternative access).18 Assuming an event rate of 7% at 30 days with the FlexNav™ Delivery System, a sample size of 69 subjects will produce a two- sided 95% confidence interval with a width equal to 13.5% (i.e. upper confidence limit of 15.8%). Accounting for an attrition rate of 5%, a minimum of 73 subjects will be required to undergo a Portico implant attempt with the FlexNav™ Delivery System. The expected upper confidence limit of 15.8% falls within the reported range for major vascular complications at 30 days (5% to 23.3%) in a weighted meta -analysis of 3519 patients from 16 T AVI studies.19 8.4 Timing of Analysis The analysis to support CE Mark approval of the FlexNav™ Delivery System and Loading System in Europe will be conducted on a dataset locked after 73 attempted subjects have had 30- day study visit excepting deaths, withdrawals and loss -to-follow -up before 30 days or crossed the 30- day visit window without a visit (missed visit). 8.5 Subgroup Analysis No subgroup analyses are planned for this clinical investigation. 8.6 Multiplicity There is one primary endpoint with no hypothesis testing. Therefore, there are no multiplicity issues associated with multiple primary endpoints and multiple treatment comparisons. 8.7 Pooling Strategy Additional information regarding the planned pooling strategy in this clinical investigation will be maintained in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . 17 Maisano F.

The Sponsor shall have the right to access and use all data and results generated during the clinical investigatio n. The Investigators will not use this clinical investigation -related data without the written consent of the Sponsor for any purpose other than for clinical investigation completion or for generation of publication materials, as referenced in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Single- center results are not allowed to be published or presented before the multi -center results. Any proposals for publications or presentations by the investigators must be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor in a timely manner to enable Sponsor review in compliance with the Sponsor’s publication policy set forth in the Clinical Trial Agreement. The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether to reg ister the clinical investigation on www.clinicaltrials.gov or a ny other clinical trials , in accordance with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines, or any other applicable guidelines. In the event S ponsor determines that the clinical investigation should be registered, Sponsor shall be responsible for any s uch registration and results posting as required by the ClinicalTrials.gov website. Institution and/or Principal Investigator(s) shall not take any action to register the clinical investigation . 15 RISK ANALYSIS 15.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits There are no guaranteed clinical benefits associated with participation in this clinical investigation. It is expected that patients implanted with a Portico™ valve using the FlexNav™ delivery system will experience the same improvements in symptoms related to severe aort ic stenosis as patients implanted with other commercially available transcatheter valves. This includes improvements in chest pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting. While the FlexNav Delivery System is not anticipated to add new clini cal benefits, the new design modifications may result in a reduced risk of major vascular complications , specifically access- site complications (e.g. bleeding, unplanned surgical closure, infection, hematoma) and vascular injury such as vessel dissection during the implant procedure .

C). The risk analysis utilizes Hazard Analysis ( on file; internal ref: 90163681) and Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) ( on file; internal r ef: 90163679, and 90163680) tool s to systematically identify potential hazards associated with the design, and use of the devices. Based upon the preclinical, clinical and bench -testing data, all risks have been identified and determined to be within acceptable levels. No additional residual risk has been identified with the use of the FlexNav ™ Delivery System and Loading System. 15.4 Risks Associated with Participation in this Clinical Investigation Protocol -required assessments are summarized in Table 3 of Section 6.5.5 . Possible risks and discomforts associated with participation in the study will be similar to those associated with any routine transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure (and related follow -up). Study -specific assessments that are not considered standard of care and are associated with additional risk include the six -minute walk test, blood collection for laboratory tests and echocardiogram exam during scheduled follow -up visits (excluding at discharge). Table 6 summarizes known risk s associated with these study -specific assessments and measures taken in the clinical investigation to mitigate risk to subjects. Table 6: Known Risks Associated with Study -Specific Assessments and Mitigation Measures Study Assessment Known risks Mitigation measures Six-minute walk test Experience of fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pain and/or leg cramps. This test will be performed under the supervision of a trained professional in a testing area where medical care is immediately available. The test will be immediately stopped if subjects experience chest pain, intolerable shortness of breath, leg cramps or pale appearance. Blood sample The risk of inserting a needle into a vein in the arm may include temporary discomfort from the needle stick. There is also a small risk of infection, bruising, swelling, bleeding or fainting. These risks are minimized by cleansing the site carefully prior to obtaining the blood sample and applying pr essure to the site after the blood sample is obtained. Echocardiogram For a Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE), a lubricant (gel) is used on the skin to improve picture quality and this may feel The procedure will be explained to subjects by a trained professional prior to starting to the procedure.

T here may be discomfort from the pressure of the transducer as the images are taken . 15.5 Steps Taken to Control or Mitigate Risks In-depth recommendations, special precautions and instructions regarding patient selection, vessel sizing, device handling, device placement and system removal are included in the IFU that will be provided with all devices to be used in the clinical invest igation . It is also stated in the IFU that the devices can only be used by physicians who have received appropriate training on how to use the device. This statement is interpreted to mean that the physician users are expected to be aware of the known and foreseeable safety risks associated with the use of the devices. Risks associated with the use of the device under investigation are minimized through device design, investigator selection and training, pre-specified patient eligibility requirements, and study monitoring to ensure adherence to the protocol. These risk management aspects are detailed below: Device Design: The design of the for FlexNav™ Delivery System(s) and FlexNav™ Loading System(s) include multiple features to minimize potential risk to subjects which are described below: Delivery System: • The delivery system features an integrated sheath with hydrophilic coating on the exterior, which serves as an introducer sheath to decrease the insertion profile into the vasculature. • Added s tability layer on outer membrane shaft acts as a stabilizing layer during deployment by isolating motion between the introducer/vasculatu re and delivery system to minimiz e the number of manipulations required during valve deployment • Stainless steel multifilar shaft increases delivery system tensile strength and flexibility to aid in valve alignment and improve re- sheath closure • Proximal end of nose cone tip has been modified to be more tapered to minimize potential dislodging of the valve during removal of the delivery syst em. • Nose cone profile has been lengthened to facilitate sheathless introduction. • Delivery system construction utilizes common catheter materials and manufacturing technologies. • Handle features an automatically engaged partial deployment release button to retra ct the outer sheath and prevent full deployment when releasing the valve. To fully deploy the valve, the deployment lock button is depres sed and the deployment/resheath wheel is turned in a downwards direction. Loading System: • The FlexNav Loading System facilitates valve preparation/loading onto the FlexNav Delivery System."

E Page 63 of 132 • The Loading System includes a loading base, loading funnel, loading tube, base insert, and leaflet tester. • The loading base has been modified to include an integrated guide tub e to elim inate the potential for the ti p of the delivery system to interact with valve leaflets during loading of the val ve onto the delivery system. Investigator Selection and Training: The following risk control measures will be implemented at the investigational site level to minimize potential clinical risks to subjects participating in this clinical investigation: • Investigators will be carefully selected based on their knowledge of, and experience implanting and managing, TAVR devices, including Portico TAVI system. The protocol requires investigational sites to have completed the commercial Portico implant training program and have at least one primary implanting physician that has performed 50 or more Portico im plants within the previous 12 months. • Investigators will be trained with regards to implantation technique of the Portico val ve using the FlexNav ™ Delivery System. • Investigators in the clinical investigation will be provided with a Clinical Instructions for Use (IFU) as a reference. • The local Heart Team's interventional cardiologist(s) and cardiac surgeon(s) must jointly participate in the intra- operative technical aspects of TAVR. • Interventional cardiologists must be experienced and skill ed in percutaneous, structural heart interventions (such as BAV). • Cardiovascular surgeons performing procedures must be board certified (or equivalent). • Procedure setting to include either a hybrid catheterization/operating room suite and/or a fixed C - arm angiography imaging capability in the operative suite for quality imaging. Ensuring Strict Adherence to the Clinical Investigational Protocol : The clinical investigation will be monitored by the Sponso r to ensure adherence to the CIP . Subjects will be carefully selected through rigorous screening by both a local Heart Team and independent SSC using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria as stated in section 5.3. Adverse events and device deficiencies will be reported to Abbott and will be monitored internally for safety surveillance purposes and reported to regulatory authorities as applicable. 15.6 Risk to Be nefit Rationale Current medical management guidelines have established TAVR as first-line treatment (Class I indication) for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in patients considered to be high or extreme risk for surgical aortic valve replacement4. As subjects participating in this study are indicated for a TAVI procedure as part of their standard medical management and no additional risks have been identified with the use of the FlexNav ™ Delivery System compared to the first -generation Portico™ Delivery System , we do not anticipate the ris ks to a subject undergoing transfemoral implantation of a Por tico™ valve using the FlexNav™ D elivery System to be any"

E Page 64 of 132 different to that reported for a standard TAVI procedure using a commercially -available transcatheter delivery system . Protocol -required clinical assessments are primar ily standard of care assessments for cardiac/structural heart interventional procedures, and will be administered per Hospital guidelines . Risks to the subject undergoing study -specific assessments (not considered standard of car e) have been addressed in the CIP with appropriate mitigation for each risk to the lowest level possible. Clinical evaluation of the Portico™ TAVI System in the PORTICO TAVI System CE Mark study13 and the post-market PORTICO I PMCF study20 have established the early safety of the first-generation Portico™ Delivery System to transfemorally implant the Portico™ valve in a high or extreme surgical risk patient cohort . While the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem is not expected to add any new clinical benefits , recent design modifications to the delivery system may potentially improve patient safety compared to the first - generation Portico Delivery System, despite t he procedure to load or deploy the Portico™ valve remaining unchanged. Specifically, the FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem has been modified to improve device performance related to valve placement accuracy, trackability, reduced profile, and user experience with the device handle and general ergonomics. The delivery system will also feature an integrated sheath to enable a sheathless delivery option. Given the FlexNav™ Delivery S ystem is not intended to introduce any new risks or new benefits beyond that observed for the current (first -generation) Portico™ delivery system t he risk -to-benefit analysis for the current (first-generation) Portico ™ delivery system is also applicable for the second -generation FlexNav ™ Delivery S ystem. All aspects utilized in the design and development of the FlexNav ™ Delivery System support that the benefits outweigh the risks associated with the evaluation of this device in a clinical investigation. 20 Maisano F, Worthley S, Rodés -Cabau J, et al.

If cardiac biomarkers are increased at baseline (>99 th percentile), a further increase of at least 50% post -procedure is required AND the peak value must exceed the previously stated limit. Spontaneous MI (greater than (>) 72 h after the index procedure) Any one of the following criteria: • Detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers (preferably troponin) with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL, together with evidence of myocardial is chemia with at least one of the following: o Symptoms of ischemia o ECG changes indicative of new ischemia [new ST -T changes or new Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB)] o New pathological Q waves in at least two contiguous leads o Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new wall motion abnormality • Sudden, unexpected cardiac death, involving cardiac arrest, often with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, and accompanied by presumably new ST -segment elevation, or new LBBB, and/or evidence of fres h thrombus by coronary angiography and/ or at autopsy, but death occurring before blood samples could be obtained, or at a time before the appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood. • Pathological findings of an acute myocardial infarction. Stroke (FDA/ VARC 2) This study is following the FDA’s definition of Stroke per FDA’s Current Thinking Regarding Neurological Assessments for Transcatheter Valve Trials (Revised: 25 Aug 2011) and VARC 2 (2012) 1. Definitions: a. Stroke : Stroke is an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by the brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction. Sub classifications of stroke: i. Ischemic Stroke is defined as an acute symptomatic episode of focal cerebral, spinal, or retinal dysfunction caused by an infarction of central nervous system tissue."

Hemorrhagic Stroke is defined as an acute symptomatic episode of focal or global cerebral or spinal dysfunction caused by a nontraumatic intraparenchymal, intraventricular, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Stroke Disability (consistent with VARC 2 Definitions): i. Disabling: a n mRS score of 2 or more at 90 days and an increase of at least one mRS category from an individual’s pre- stroke baseline ii. Non -disabling: an mRS score of < 2 at 90 days or one that does not result in an increase of at least one mRS category from an ind ividual’s pre -stroke baseline b. Cerebral Infarction: Evidence of brain cell death from imaging studies or pathological examination. If there are clinical symptoms, then it is a stroke; otherwise, it is an asymptomatic cerebral infarction. c. Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA): A transient (less than (<) 24 hrs ) episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. No evidence of infarction if imaging performed. d. Encephalopathy: Altered mental state (e.g., seizures, delirium, confusion, hallucinations, dementia, coma, psychiatric episode, etc.). e. Intracranial Hemorrhage: Collection of blood between the brain and skull. Subcategorized as epidural, subdural, and subarachnoid bleeds.

E Page 99 of 132 APPENDIX XV: STRUCTURED INTERVIEW FOR THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCORE (mRS) After the NIHSS has been completed, the mRS (by a certified rater) is to be determined and graded by the same certified rater. The determination of the scale should be made from 5 to 0. The purpose of the mRS is to record whether the subject is severely, moderately, or slightly disabled and whether the subject is performing all usual activities without symptoms or not. Because subject s and family members may understate the severity of disability, it is important for the rating clinician to understand that the mRS is a clinical scale and not a patient -reported outcome. The assessor may ask questions but must assess the disability whether or not in agreement with the subject or family. “Improving the assessment of outcomes in stroke: use of a structured interview to assign grades on the Modified Rankin Scale” ( Stroke ; 33:2243- 2246) Score Description 5 • Severe disability • Someone needs to be available at all times; • Care may be provided by either a trained or an untrained caregiver Question: Does the person require constant care ? 4 • Moderately severe disability • Need for assistance with some basic activities of daily living, but does not require constant care Question: Is assistance essential for eating, using the toilet, daily hygiene, or walking? 3 • Moderate disability • Need for assistance with some instrumental activities of daily living but not basic activities of daily living. Question: Is assistance essential for preparing a simple meal, doing household chores, looking after money, shopping, or traveling locally? 2 • Slight disability; • Limitations in participation in usual social roles • Independent for activities of daily living. Questions: Has there been a change in the person’s ability to work or look after others if these were roles before stroke? Has there been a change in the person’s ability to participate in previous social and le isure activities? Has the person had problems with relationships or become isolated? 1 • No significant disability • Symptoms present but no other limitations. Question: Does the person have difficulty reading or writing, difficulty speaking or finding the right word, problems with balance or coordination, visual problems, numbness (face, arms, legs, hands, feet), loss of movement (face, arms, legs, hands, feet), difficulty with swallowing, or other symptom resulting from stroke ? 0 • No symptoms at all • No limitations and no symptoms"

E Page 108 of 132 APPENDIX XVII: SIX MINUTE WALK TEST This Six Minute Walk (6MWT) Test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes. It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, b lood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism. It does not provide specific information on the function of each of the different organs and systems involved in exercise or the mechanism of exercise limitation, as is possible with maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing. SAFETY ISSUES 1. Testing should be performed in a location where a rapid, appropriate response to an emergency is possible. The appropriate location of a crash cart should be determined by the physician supervising the facility. 2. Supplies that must be available include oxygen, sublingual nitroglycerine, aspirin, and albuterol (metered dose inhaler or nebulizer). A telephone or other means should be in place to enable a call for help. 3. The technician should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a minimum of Basic Life Support by an American Health Association –approved cardiopulmonary resuscitation course. Advanced cardiac life support certification is desirable. Training, experience, and certification in related health care fields (registered nurse, registered respiratory therapist, certified pulmonary function technician, etc.) are also desirable. A certified individual should be readily available to respond if needed. 4. Physicians are not required to be present during all te sts. The physician ordering the test or a supervising laboratory physician may decide whether physician attendance at a specific test is required. 5. If a patient is on chronic oxygen therapy, oxygen should be given at their standard rate or as directed by a physician or a protocol. Reasons for immediately stopping a 6MWT include the following: (1) chest pain, ( 2) intolerable dyspnea, (3) leg cramps, ( 4) staggering, ( 5) diaphoresis, and ( 6) pale or ashen appearance. Technicians must be trained to recognize t hese problems and the appropriate responses. If a test is stopped for any of these reasons, the patient should sit or lie supine as appropriate depending on the severity or the event and the technician's assessment of the severity of the event and the risk of syncope. The following should be obtained based on the judgment of the technician: blood pressure, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and a physician evaluation. Oxygen should be administered as appropriate. CONTRAINDICATIONS Absolute contraindications for the 6MWT include the following: unstable angina during the previous month and myocardial infarction during the previous month. Relative contraindications include a resting heart rate of more than 120, a systolic blood pressure of more than 180 mm Hg, and a diastolic blood pressure of more than 100 mm Hg."

E Page 109 of 132 Patients with any of these findings should be referred to the physician ordering or supervising the test for individual clinical assessment and a decision about the conduct of the tes t. The results from a resting electrocardiogram done during the previous 6 months should also be reviewed before testing. Stable exertional angina is not an absolute contraindication for a 6MWT, but patients with these symptoms should perform the test afte r using their antiangina medication, and rescue nitrate medication should be readily available. A deviation from the Clinical Investigation Plan will need to be collected if the subject is unable to complete this test. LOCATION The 6MWT should be performed indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed corridor with a hard surface that is seldom traveled. If the weather is comfortable, the test may be performed outdoors. The walking course must be 30 m in length. A 100 -ft hallway is, therefore, required. T he length of the corridor should be marked every 3 m. The turnaround points should be marked with a cone (such as an orange traffic cone). A starting line, which marks the beginning and end of each 60 -m lap, should be marked on the floor using brightly col ored tape. PROCEDURE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT • Countdown timer (or stopwatch) • Mechanical lap counter • Two small cones to mark the turnaround points • A chair that can be easily moved along the walking course • Worksheets on a clipboard • A source of oxygen • Sphygmomanometer • Telephone • Automated electronic defibrillator PATIENT PREPARATION • Comfortable clothing should be worn. • Appropriate shoes for walking should be worn. • Patients should use their usual walking aids during the test (cane, walker, etc.). • The patient's usual medical regimen should be continued. • A light meal is acceptable before early morning or early afternoon tests. • Patients should not have exercised vigorously within 2 hours of beginning the test. • This test should be performed about the same time of day for each interval to minimize intraday variability. • A ""warm- up"" period before the test should not be performed. • The patient should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at least 10 minutes before the t est starts. During this time, check for contraindications, measure pulse and blood pressure, and make sure that clothing and shoes are appropriate. Complete the first portion of the worksheet."

E Page 110 of 132 Baseline Measurements 1. Set the lap counter to zero and the timer to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary equipment (lap counter, timer, clipboard, Borg Scale, worksheet) and move to the starting point. Instruct the patient as follows: “The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for 6 minutes. You will walk back and forth in this hallway. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You are permitted to slow down, to stop, and to rest as necessary. You may lean against the wall while resting, but resume walking as soon as you are able. You will be walking back and forth around the cones. You should pivot briskly around the cones and continue back the other way without hesitation. Now I'm going to show you. Please watch the way I turn without hesitation."" Demonstrate by walking one lap yourself. Walk and pivot around a cone briskly. ""Are you ready to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number of laps you complete. I will click it each time you turn around at this starting line. Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but don't run or jog. Start now, or whenever you are ready."" Position the patient at the starting line. You should also stand near the starting line during the test. Do not walk with the patient. As soon as the patient starts to walk, start the timer. Do not talk to anyone during the walk. Use an even tone of voice when using the standard phrases of encouragement. Watch the patient. Do not get distracted and lose count of the laps. Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap counter once (or mark the lap on the worksheet). Let the participant see you do it. Exaggerate the click using body language, like using a stopwatch at a race. After the first minute, tell the patient the following (in even tones): ""You are doing well. You have 5 minutes to go."" When the timer shows 4 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""Keep up the good work. You have 4 m inutes to go."" When the timer shows 3 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""You are doing well. You are halfway done."" When the timer shows 2 minutes remaining, tell the patient the following: ""Keep up the good work. You have only 2 minutes left."" When the timer shows only 1 minute remaining, tell the patient: ""You are doing well. You have only 1 minute to go."""

E Page 111 of 132 Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up). If the patient stops walking during the test and needs a rest, say this: ""You can lean against the wall if you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel able."" Do not stop the timer. If the patient stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to co ntinue (or you decide that they should not continue), wheel the chair over for the patient to sit on, discontinue the walk, and note on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and the reason for stopping prematurely. When the timer is 15 seconds fr om completion, say this: ""In a moment I'm going to tell you to stop. When I do, just stop right where you are and I will come to you."" When the timer rings (or buzzes), say this: ""Stop!"" Walk over to the patient. Consider taking the chair if they look exhausted. Mark the spot where they stopped."

E Page 112 of 132 APPENDIX XVIII : PERI -PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES Assessment of aortic regurgitation Angiography will be performed >5 minutes after valve deployment. Use projection where the valve frame is aligned / in -plane - often shallow LAO or RAO and some cranial tilt. Left ventricular (LV) apex must be included in the imaging field. The pigtail catheter should be located in the upper third part of the frame, give 20- 30 mL non- diluted contrast at 10 mL/sec, 15 frames/sec and at least 5 heart cycles. Echocardiography: Use color -Doppler in the short -axis view of the ventricular part of the valve frame. The circumferential extent of the regurgitant jet determine the degree of paravalvular leak ( PVL); <10% = mild (I), 10 -29% = moderate (II), >30% = severe (III -IV). The pressure in the left ventricle and in the ascending aorta should be determined simult aneously after the procedure (within 5 to 10 min after valve deployment). The gradient between diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the aorta and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) should be calculated over several cardiac cycles to evaluate the severity of paraprosthetic aortic regurgitation (PAR). To adjust the gradient for the respective systolic blood pressure (SBP) of the patient, the dimensionless AR index should be calculated according to the following formula: [(DBP - LVEDP)/SBP] x100. Assessment of implant depth For implantation depth, use the angiography with the valve frame aligned with the imaging plane and measure both the distance from the non- coronary cusp (NCC) and left coronary cusp (LCC) to the ventricular end of the frame (tw o measurements)."

Currently no clinical data is available for the second- generat ion FlexNav ™ Delivery System. The rati onale for basing rates from clinical studies that used the first -generation Portico ™ Delivery System is the procedure to load and deploy the valve is the same for the FlexNav ™ Delivery System and no additional risks have been identified for the FlexNav ™ Delivery System compared to the first -generation Portico™ Delivery System . Potential Adverse Events Very common (≥10%) Common or frequent (≥1.0% to <10%) Uncommon or infrequent (≥0.1% to <1.0%) Rare (≥0.01% to<0.1%) Very rare (< 0.01%) access site complications (e.g., pain, bleeding, infection, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, etc.) X acute coronary obstruction X acute myocardial infarction X allergic reaction to antiplatelet agents, contrast medium, or valve components X aortic rupture X ascending aorta trauma X atrio-ventricular node block X cardiac arrhythmias X embolism X endocarditis X heart failure X hemodynamic compromise X hemolysis X hemolytic anemia X hemorrhage (Bleeding) X hypotension or hypertension X infection X myocardial ischemia X mitral valve insufficiency X multi -organ failure X non-structural dysfunction (i.e., entrapment by pannus, paravalvular leak, inappropriate sizing or positioning) X pericardial effusion X perforation of the myocardium or a blood vessel X pannus X renal insufficiency or renal failure (Acute kidney injury) X sepsis X stroke X structural deterioration (i.e., calcification, leaflet tear) X thrombosis X tamponade X valve migration X vessel dissection or spasm.

Device Under Investigation Devices under investigation in thi s clinical investigation include the FlexNav™ Delivery System(s) (18 F and 19 F) and FlexNav™ Loading System(s) (Small and Large), which are both approved for investigational use only. Other devices to be used in the clinical investigation include all four (4) market released St. Jude Medical (SJM) Portico™ valve sizes (23mm, 25mm, 27mm and 29mm) . Number of Subjects Required for Inclusion in Clinical Investigation Up to 200 subjects will be enrolled in the clinical investigation, with a predefined minimum of 73 subjects required to analyze the primary safety endpoint. No site may enroll more than 20% of the maximum number of enrolled subjects (n=40) . Clinical Investigation Design Prospective, single -arm, non -randomized, multi -center, CE Mark investigational study Primary Endpoint(s) The primary safety endpoint of the FlexNav EU CE Mark study is VARC II defined major vascular complications at 30 days post index procedure. Major (Powered) Secondary Endpoints Not applicable Subject Follow -up Subject data will be collected in-person at the investigational site at baseline, pre- procedure, peri -procedure, post-procedure, discharge, 30 days, 6 months and one-year from the index procedure. Echocardiographic data will be collected at screening , peri-procedure (optional) , and discharge as well as 30 days, 6 months and 12-months post implantation Inclusion Criteria Candidates for High Risk classification must meet all the following inclusion criteria: 1. Subjects must have co‐ morbidities such that the local heart team concur the predicted risk of operative mortality is ≥15% or a minimum STS score of 8%. a) A candidate who does not meet the STS score criteria of ≥ 8% may be included in the study if at least one surgeon in the loc al heart team concludes and documents the patient’s predicted risk of operative"

E Page 130 of 132 mortality is ≥15%. The surgeon's assessment of operative comorbidities (including frailty indices) not captured by the STS score must be documented in the study case report for m as well as in the patient medical record. 2. Subject is of legal age or older for consent in the host country. 3. Subject has senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis with echo- derived criteria: mean gradient >40 mmHg or jet velocity greater than 4.0 m/s or doppler velocity index (DVI) <0.25 and an initial aortic valve area (AVA) of ≤ 1.0 cm2 (indexed EOA ≤ 0.6 cm2/m2). (Qualifying AVA baseline measurement must be within 60 days prior to informed consent). 4. Subject has symptomatic aortic stenosis as demonstr ated by NYHA Functional Classification of II, III, or IV. 5. The subject has been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the respective cl inical site. 6. The subject and the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required post ‐procedure follow ‐up visits. 7. Subject’s aortic annulus is 19‐ 27mm diameter as measured by CT conducted within 12 months prior to informed consent. If a CT is contraindicated and/or not possible to be obtained for certain subjects, a 3D echo and non‐ contrast CT of chest and abdomen/pelvis may be accepted. All candidates for Extreme Risk classification must meet # 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of the above criteria, and 8. After formal consultation with the local heart team (including at least one surgeon) it is agreed that medical factors preclude the subject from underg oing operation, based on a conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds the probability of meaningful improvement. Specifically, the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity should exceed 50%. The local heart teams' consult notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion and include a printout of the calculation of the STS score to additionally identify the risks in these patients. Exclusion Criteria Candidates will be ex cluded if any of the following conditions are present: 1. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction (defined as: ST Segment Elevation as evidenced on 12 Lead ECG) within 30 days prior to index procedure. 2. Aortic valve is a congenital unicuspid or congenital bicuspid valve, or is non- calcified as verified by echocardiography. 3. Mixed aortic valve disease (aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation with predominant aortic regurgitation 3- 4+)."
