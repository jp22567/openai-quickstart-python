15,page_15,"1. BACKGROUND Venous insufficiency, a serious health condition, is most commonl y caused by incompetent valves in the affected veins which prevent blood from returning to the heart, causing blood to pool in the legs and, as a result, venous hypertension. Valve failure can be spontaneous in patients with congenitally weak valves ; or c ongenitally normal valves can fail as a result of trauma, thrombosis, hormonal changes, or long- term environmental effects. In the United States (US), varicose veins affect approximately 25% of the adult population (Criqui et al 2003). The prevalence and severity increase with age; however, the severity and extent of varicosities vary greatly among individuals and do not necessarily correspond to the severity of a patient’s symptoms that result from venous hypertension. Venous hypertension may lead to progressive damage to the skin (e.g., edema, discoloration, hyperpigmentation, eczema, and ulceration), with symptoms that motivate patients to seek treatment; and in the US alone more than 400,000 patients are treated annually ( Millennium Research Group 2009). Over time this condition often develops into a progressive chronic disease. Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is among the most frequently diagnosed diseases in Western populations that cause symptoms such as heaviness of the legs, pain, and swelling. While CVD encompasses the full spectrum of the disease (described by Clinical- Etiology -Anatomy -Pathophysiology [CEAP] classes C1 to C6), the term chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is generally restricted to the more severe forms of the disease. The ClariVein , a unique proprietary mechanical action infusion catheter, has been cleared by the FDA since 2008 as a Class 2 medical device for the infusion of physician-specified agents in the peripheral vasculature [510(k) K071468 and K153502] ; and commercialized as the ClariVein IC. The Clar iVein has been approved since 2010 in certain countries/regions outside the USA as the “ClariVein OC”; e.g., Europe (CE marked), Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Middle East countries, with an additional specific indication “for infusion of physician- specified agents in the peripheral vasculature, including for the occlusion of incompetent veins due to superficial venous reflux”. The ClariVein IC and the ClariVein OC are physically identical products. Globally, physicians have found great utility with the ClariVein® for the administration of sclerosing agents such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate and polidocanol for treatment of incompetent saphenous veins. More than 90,000 ClariVein devices have been distributed worldwide; and a significant body of clinical experience inclusive of published data, clinical studies and case reports, describes use of the ClariVein to mechanically deliver chemical scleorsant in over 1200 venous disease patients. Much of these data present ClariVein® administering sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) for the treatment of venous insufficiency attributed to incompetent saphenous veins due to superficial venous reflux. The STS solution 1% and 3%, a chemical sclerosing agent, has been approved by the FDA since 1946 as a drug for the intravenous delivery and treatment of small uncomplicated varicose veins of the lower extremities that show simple dilation with competent valves. [ NDA 05970, ANDA 40541]. Vascular Insights, LLC is investigating the ClariVein RES , i.e., the endovenous administration of STS ( 1% and 3%) mechanically delivered intravenously via the ClariVein infusion catheter Page 17 of 101"
16,page_16,"for the treatment of venous insufficiency associated with incompetent saphenous veins due to superficial venous reflux. 1.1. Ratio nale CVI is a leading cause of chronic debilitating disease in the US (White 1993, Van den 1998) ; between 10 % and 35% of the US adult population has some form of CVI (Criqui 2003, Simka 2003). In industrialized nations, 0.2% - 1% of people suffer from veno us ulceration . This percentage increases to 4% in patients 65 years of age and older ( White 1993; Reporting standards in venous disease 1988). Venous leg ulcers are extremely common in the United States and affect between 500,000 to 2 million people annual ly (Margolis 2002). Ineffective therapies and the progressive nature of the disease place a heavy burden on the US healthcare system . The population- based costs in the US for treatment of CVI and venous ulcer care have been estimated to exceed one billion dollars per year (Hume 1992; US Department of Health and Welfare 1935-1936) and as high as $14.9 billion ( Rice 2014). The high incidence and increasing cost of CVI care have garnered renewed interest in this disease process, which has led to interesting f indings in the past decade. For example, the incidence of CVD correlates with a reduced quality of life, particularly in relation to pain, physical function, and mobility. It is also associated with depression and social isolation ( Van Korlaar et al 2003 ). Impairment associated with CEAP classes C5 and C6 has been likened to that of impairment associated with congestive heart failur e (Kistner et al 1996 ). The majority (60–70%) of varicose vein patients have incompetent saphenofemoral junctions (SFJ) and GSV reflux ( Labropoulos et al 1994). Typically, the first objective in the treatment of varicose veins is elimination of saphenous vein reflux by removing the offending vein from circulation. Thermal ablation in the form of radiofrequency (RF) and endovenous laser (EVL) techniques are currently the most common methods used for saphenous vein ablation to treat superficial venous reflux. However, use of either of these thermal technologies for saphenous vein treatment requires tumescent anesthesia, which is both time -consuming and painful for the patient . Further more , the edema, pain , and bruising that are secondary to thermal injury of surrounding structures are fr equent post- operative patient complaints. For many years, sclerotherapy was used clinically for telangiectasia and to close varicose veins. However, early studies using sclerotherapy for the treatm ent of saphenous vein reflux did not generate promising results. In recent years, another approach involving the creation of a “foam” from liquid sclerosant using the double- syringe “ Tessari ” method prior to injection has been used. This approach has led to the publication of multiple studies utilizing foam sclerotherapy to treat veins such as the GSV ( Cavezzi et al 2002; Frullini 2003; Hamel-Desnos 2003). Results of foam sclerotherapy for treatment of the saphenous vein are inferior compared to thermal ablation (Rasmussen 2011). The FDA has approved foam sclerosant for the treatment of incompetent veins; indicated for treatment of incompetent great saphenous veins, accessory saphenous veins, and visible varicosities of the great saphenous vein system above and below the knee ( NDA 205098, Approval date November 25, 2013 for Varithena ®, polidocanol foam ). Other approved therapies for the treatment of venous insufficiency including incompetent veins include thermal technologies (i.e., laser and RF) ; and permanent implant devices (i.e., VenaS eal Closure System , PMA P140018, Approval date 15 Feb 2015). Page 18 of 101"
17,page_17,"Unlike the previously discussed therapies, ClariVein RES is not a foam, is not an implant, is not a thermal modality , and does not require tumescent anesthesia. ClariVein RES is the endovenous administration of liquid chemical sclerosant (STS) mechanically delivered intravenously via the ClariVein infusion catheter to the physician determined treatment section of the incompetent saphenous vein to effect engagement of the sclerosant to the vessel wall to achieve sclerosis to eliminate venous insufficiency.

Study Product The investiga tional study product, ClariVein RES, consists of two primary components: the study drug, STS (1% and 3%) and the study drug delivery system, ClariVein . • Study Drug : The study drug (STS) has been commercially available outside of the USA since 1967 for trea tment of venous insufficiency • Delivery System : The delivery system (ClariVein) has been commercially available in the USA since 2008 marketed as the ClariVein IC for infusion of physician specified agents in the peripheral vasculature; and has been commer cially available outside the USA since 2010 as the ClariVein OC for infusion of agents to treat saphenous veins with incompetent valves (superficial venous reflux). STS, marketed in the USA under the brand name Sotradecol, was approved by the USA FDA in 1946 for treatment of small uncomplicated veins, such as spider veins, with competent valves. 2.1.1. Study Drug - Sodium Tetradecyl Sulfate (STS) STS is provided as sterile 2 mL solution within a labeled glass ampule for single use ; five 2 mL ampule s are provided within a labeled shelf carton . Two concentrations will be evaluated : • 1%, 20 mg/2 mL (10 mg/mL) • 3%, 60 mg/2 mL (30 mg/mL) Recom mended storage for STS is 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) in a secure dry place. Do Not Freeze. 2.1.2. Delivery System - ClariVein® The ClariVein is provided as a sterile disposable device for single patient use. The ClariVein is packaged in a tray within a sealed labeled pouch; five pouches are placed within a labeled shelf box, five ( 5) boxes are provided within a labeled shipping carton. The ClariVein is available in 3 models, 45, 65 and 85 cm lengths for p hysician select ion based on patient anatomy. The disposable ClariVein consist s of two primary components: a catheter assembly and integrated battery powered motor drive unit (MDU) .

Study Treatment ClariVein RES is the endovenous administration of STS i njection (1% and 3%) mechanically delivered as intravenous infusion via the C lariVein for the treatment of venous insufficiency associated with incompetent saphenous vein due to superficial venous reflux. This study is limited to the treatment of one incompetent saphenous vein per treatment procedure. Refer to Appendix C VICARES Clinical Study Procedure Manual for detailed on the treatment procedure including ultrasound measurements and calculation of the STS volume required for administration. 6.2. Study Duration This study is limited to the treatment of one incompetent saphenous vein in one leg per treatment procedure. STS (1% or 3%) will be delivered as a single dose treatment. The ClariVein RES treatment procedure will be completed on each eligible patient on the Treatment Day (noted as Day 1 ), unless the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity and/or treatment is discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or the patient. Overall duration of the study from first patient enrolled to last patient completion of Week 12 follow-up is anticipated to be approximately 6 months. Study duration for individual study patients , including follow-up visits , is anticipated to be approximately 16 weeks (Visit 1 Screening , up to 30 days prior to treatment through Week 12 post- treatment .) 6.3. Potential Drug Interactions/Allergies No well -controlled studies of the study drug (STS Injection 1% and 3%) have been performed on patients taking anti-ovulatory agents. The Investigator must use medical judgment and evaluate any patient taking anti -ovulatory drugs prior to initiating treatment with the study drug (STS) (Sotradecol Package Insert 2013 ). Heparin should not be included in the same syringe as STS solution, since the two are labeled to be incompatible . (Sotradecol Package Insert 2013). Patient should be observed for at least 30 minutes following treat ment . The Investigator must be prepared to treat any allergic reaction to substances utilized during treatment procedure, including anaphylaxis reactions. Emergency resuscitation equipment must be immediately available in the event of anaphylactic reaction s. 6.4. Prior and Concomitant Treatment(s)/Therapy All prior and concomitant medications taken within 30 days prior to the Screening (Visit 1) through completion of the last planned follow-up visit at Week 12 post- treatment (Visit 6) must be recorded in the eCR F. At every visit, patients will be asked to confirm if there has been any change in medications taken since the last visit. Changes will be recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF and Page 28 of 101"

32,page_32,"7.7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment/Procedure Patients may voluntarily discontinue from the study for any reason at any time. If a patient decides to discontinue from the study, the Investigator will make every effort (e.g. telephone, e- mail, letter) to determine the primary reason for this decision and record this information in the patient’s chart and on the appropriate CRF pages. A patient may be considered withdrawn if the patient state s an intention to withdraw, fails to return for study visits, or becomes lost to follow - up for any other reason. The Investigator should discontinue the study procedure for a given patient if, he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well- being. Study treatment may be discontinued if any of the following occur: • Adverse event • Physician’s decision • Patient/guardian decision • Protocol deviation • Technical problems Patients must be discontinued if any of the following occur: • At the time, a patient discontinues from the study, a visit should be scheduled as soon as possible, or no later than within 14 days of the decision to permanently discontinue from the study. • If the decision to withdraw the patient occurs on Day of Treatment ( Visit 3) following the initiation of the treatment procedure and the patient is determined to be evaluable as defined in Section 6.1, the patient should be followed up for safety and efficacy at Week 1, Week 6 and Week 12. • If the decision to withdraw the patient occurs on Day of Treatment (Visit 3) following the initiation of the treatment procedure and the patient is determined to not be evaluable as defined in Section 6.1, that patient should be followed up for safety at Week 1 . 7.7.2. Withdrawal of C onsent Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a patient does not want to participate in the study any longer, does not want to have any further visits or assessments and does not want any further study related contact. The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all re search results that have already been collected for the study evaluation. If a patient withdraws consent, the Investigator will make every reasonable effort (telephone, e--mail, letter) to determine the primary reason for this decision and record this inf ormation. No further assessments will be conducted. Page 34 of 101"

Assessment of Symptoms Efficacy assessment of patient improvement as compared to th e baseline using the following scales at the post treatment follow up per Table 3: • VEINES -QOL/Sym Questionnaire ( subset of Q1; i.e. five symptoms referred to as HASTI [Heaviness, Achiness, Swelling, Throbbing, Itchi ng]) • Clinical-Etiology- Anatomy -Pathophysiology (CEAP) Classification • European Quality of Life scale (EQ -5D- 5L) • Revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS) • Wong Baker Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) 8.2.2. Elimination of Saphenous Vein Reflux Elimination of saphenous vein reflux at Week 12 post treatment, as demonstrated by duplex ultrasound based on vein closure and/or vein competency. Vein Closure is defined as no discrete open segment of vein > 5cm in length within the treatment section of the selected sap henous vein as assessed by duplex ultrasound. Vein Competency is defined as absence of retrograde flow >500 ms (0.5 sec) within the treatment section of the selected saphenous vein as assessed by duplex ultrasound. The endpoint is achieved when ultrasound images demonstrate vein closure and/or vein competency as read by an independent vascular core lab. Refer to the Appendix C VICARES Clinical Study Procedure Manual for details. 8.2.3. Improvement in Patient Symptoms Improvement in patient reported symptoms will be assesse d at Week 12 post- treatment based on the responses to a subset of questions from VEINES -QOL/Sym questionnaire (an instrument of Varicose Vein Symptom Burden in patients with Superficial Venous ); i.e. , the 7- day average of five symptoms from Question 1 of the questionnaire referred to as HASTI symptoms (Heaviness, Achiness, Swelling, Throbbing, Itching ). The patient will record responses to HASTI symptom questions for 7 consecutive days at specific time points during the study as follows: • For 7 days prior to the Day of Treatment • For 7 days post Day of Treatment • For 7 days, prior to Week 6 follow-up • For 7 days, prior to Week 12 follow-up , Page 36 of 101"

Prior to Randomization and Treatment Individuals who withdraw from the study prior to randomization and treatment are not considered to be enrolled patients in the study, will not be used for assessment, and no follow up is necessary. Therefore, these individuals may be replaced. 9.2. Post Randomization and Treatment Individuals who sign the Informed Consent and are randomized are considered enrolled patients and will be included in the Intent- To-Treat (ITT) analysis. Possible reasons for withdrawal ( discontinuation) of a patient from the study include: Adverse Event (AE ). An adverse event, which in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that discontinuation from study would be in the best interest of the patient . Patient will be followed and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabi lized. The reason for termination will be documented by the Investigator on the patient’s source documents. Patient withdrawal of consent (or assent). P atient may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the patient, the Investigator, or the Sponsor fee ls that it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue. If the patient withdraws prior to completing the Week 12 Post Treatment Follow up Visit, patient is considered Lost- to-Follow up. In this event the Investigator should make at least two documented attempts to contact the patient and to have an early discontinuation visit. The reasons for patient withdrawal should be documented on the patient’s source documents, if known. Patient non compliant with study procedures . If a patient is withdrawn prior to treatment due to lack of compliance with study procedures, the reason for withdrawal will be documented by the Investigator on the patient’s source documents. Sponsor request s early termination of study. If patient discontinuation (post randomization and treatment) is due to early termination of the study by the Sponsor, patient will be followed per the follow-up schedule to completion of the post- treatment Week 12 visit. The reason for termination will be documented by the Investigator on the patient’s source documents. Page 37 of 101"

The occurrence, which may or may not have a causal relationship with the investigational treatment, may include any clinical or laboratory change that does not commonly occur in that patient and is considered clinically significant. A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a “reasonable possibility” that the drug caused the AE. For reporting under this protocol, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Pre-existing conditions , illnesses present prior to the p signing the Informed Consent Form, are documented on the medical history eCRF. Pre -existing conditions that worsen during the study are entered on the AE eCRF. All out-of- range laboratory values will be de emed as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the Investigator. Clinically significant values will be considered AEs and recorded as such on the eCRFs. Pregnancy is not considered an AE ; however, a patient who becomes pregnant after Treatment should be followed as described in Section 10.12. If the patient experiences a worsening or complication of a concurrent condition that was present before exposure to the study drug, the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., worsening of “…”). Pre-planned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to the start of study drug exposure are not considered AEs. However, if a pre-planned procedure is performed earlier than anticipated (e.g., as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, the worsening of the condition should be captured as an AE. Elective procedures performed where there is no change in the patient’s medical condition should not be recorded as AEs, but should be documented as concomitant procedures. 10.7.2. Medical Device A Medical D evice Report, “MDR reportable events” are events that manufacturers become aware of that reasonably suggest that one of their marketed devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device or a similar device that they market would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfun ction were to recur. Page 39 of 101"
38,page_38,"Serious Injury - An injury must meet the definition of “serious injury” in 21 CFR 803.3 for an event to be reportable as a serious injury. A “serious injury” is an injury or illness that [21 CFR 803.3]: • Is life threatening; or • Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure; or • Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. “Permanent” means irreversible impairment or damage to a body structure or function, excluding trivial impairment or damage [21 CFR 803.3]. Note that not all cosmetic damage will be considered trivial. Furthermore, a life- threate ning injury meets the definition of serious injury, regardless of whether the threat was “temporary.” It should also be noted that a device does not have to malfunction for it to cause or contribute to a serious injury. Even though a device may function properly, it can still cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. “Malfunction” means the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or otherwise perform as intended [21 CFR 803.3]. Performance specifications include all claims made in the labeling for the device. A malfunction is reportable if any one of the following is true: • The chance of a death or serious injury occurring as a result of a recurrence of the malfunction is not remote; • The consequences of the malfunction affect the device in a catastrophic manner that may lead to a death or serious injury; • The malfunction results in the failure of the device to perform its essential function and compromises the device’s therapeutic, monitoring or diagnostic effectiveness, which could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury or other significant adverse device experiences required by regulation. (The essential function of a device refers not only to the device’s labeled use, but also to any use widely prescribed within the pr actice of medicine.); • The malfunction involves: − a long- term implant or − a device that is considered to be life-supporting or life-sustaining and thus is essential to maintaining human life; or • The manufacturer takes, or would be required to take, an action under section 518 or 519(g)10 of the FD&C Act as a result of the malfunction of the device or other similar devices (see explanation of “similar device” below, and see section 2.21 of this guidance for an explanation of “remedial action”). 10.8. Definition of Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that: Page 40 of 101"
39,page_39,"• Results in death • Is life -threatening. The patient is at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurs. This does not include reaction that, had it oc curred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Hospital admission for elective surgery scheduled prior to study entry is not considered an SAE. • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions) • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Important Medical Events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious AEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 10.9. Follow -up Information on a Serious Adverse Event Appropriate diagnos tic tests should be performed and therapeutic measures, as medically indicated, should be instituted. Appropriate consultation and follow-up evaluations should be carried out until the event has resolved or is otherwise explained by the Investigator . For a ll SAEs, the Investigator will make at least two documented efforts for a follow up, when necessary and provide information to Vascular Insights. In addition, an Investigator may be requested by Vascular Insights to obtain specific information in an expedited manner. This information may be more detailed than that captured on the AE form. In general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possibl e causality. Information on other possible causes such as concomitant medication and illnesses must be provided. Event will be followed up until resolved. 10.10. Abnormal Test Findings The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows: • Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms that are considered clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator. • Test result requires additional diagnostic testing (other than merely repeating an abnormal test) or medical/surgical intervention. • Test result leads to discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy. • Test result is considered an AE by the Investigator or Sponsor.

Relationship to Study Tr eatment The assessment of study drug relationship to each AE will be reported on the appropriate source document (and SAE form, in the event of an SAE) by the Investigator (or designated sub- Investigator ) per his/her best clinical judgment. The criteria listed in Table 4 should be used to guide this assessment. Please note that not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a particular drug relationship. All study drugs are considered “test drugs” for the purposes of the definitions listed in Table 4 . Table 4: Adverse Event Causality Guidelines Relationship Criteria for Assessment Definitely related There is evidence of exposure to the test drug ; and - The temporal sequence of the AE on set relative to administration of the test drug is reasonable. - The AE is more likely explained by the test drug than by another cause. - Dechallenge (if performed) is positive. - Rechallenge (if feasible) is positive. - The AE shows a pattern consistent with previous knowledge of the test drug or test drug class. Probably related There is evidence of exposure to the test drug ; and - The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the test drug is reasonable. - The AE is more likely explained by the test drug than by another cause. - Dechallenge (if performed) is positive. Possibly related There is evidence of exposure to the test drug ; and - the temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the test drug is reasonable; and - the AE could have been due to another equally likely cause. Not related There is evidence of exposure to the test drug ; and - there is another more likely cause of the AE, - dechallenge (if performed) is negative or ambiguous , - rechallenge (if performed) is negati ve or ambiguous . The patient did not receive the test drug; or Temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the test drug is not reasonable; or There is another obvious cause of the AE.

Pregnanc y At Screening, pre- menopausal females of childbearing potential will be informed that active pregnancy and breast feeding are exclusion criteria for participation in this study. As such, the se individuals must agree to pregnancy testing a t Screening , Baseline, and (prior to treatment) at Day o f Treatment visits ; agree to use effective medical means of preventing contraception from Screening to completion of the Week12 post- treatment follow-up visit; and must not breast feed until completion of the Week 12 post- treatment follow-up visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be conducted at Screening (Visit 1) and prior to treatment on Day of Treatment (Visit 3). A s erum pregnancy test will be performed at the Baseline (Visit 2) . If a patient is confirmed pregnant post Treatment and prior to c ompleting the study, (completion of the Week 12 post treatment visit), the Investigator must immediately notify the Study Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy form. Initial information regarding a pregnancy must be immediately forwarded by the study monitor or designee to Sponsor’s Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance contact or its designated representative. The Investigator should follow the patient to the end of the pregnancy and must immediately report follow-up information to the Sponsor regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, regardless of whether the patient has discontinued participation in the study. 10.13. Monitoring and Recording of Adverse Events AE data collection will begin after a patient signs the ICF and will continue until completion of their Week 12 post- treatment follow-up visit (Visit 6). Any AE or SAE having an onset after the completion of Visit 6 (end of the study visit) will not be collected or reported unless the Investigator feels that the event may be related to the study drug. Patient s will be instructed by the Investigator or designee to report the occurrence of any AE. All volunteered, elicited, and observed AEs are to be recorded on the AE eCRFs. The Investigat or will assess all AEs regarding any causal relationship to the study drug (Section 10.11), the intensity (severity) of the event, action taken, and patient outcome. The following criteria will be used to guide t he assessment of intensity (severity): • Mild : An adverse event that is asymptomatic or barely noticeable to the patient; not interfering with patient’s daily activity performance or functioning; generally, not requiring alteration or cessation of study drug administration; and/or ordinarily not needing therapeutic intervention • Moderate: An adverse event of sufficient severity as to possibly make the patient moderately uncomfortable; some interference with the patient’s daily activity performance or functioni ng; generally, not impairing the patient’s ability to continue in the study; and/or possibly needing therapeutic intervention. • Severe: An adverse event generally causing severe discomfort; major interference with the patient’s daily activity performance or functioning; generally requiring alteration or cessation of study drug administration; life -threatening; resulting in Page 43 of 101"
42,page_42,"significant disability or incapacity; and/or generally requiring therapeutic intervention. All AEs will be followed until resolution, unt il deemed stable by the Investigator , or until the patient is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up. For clinical study safety reporting purposes, the most recent version of the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) will be used as the reference document to designate event expectedness. An AE is considered unexpected if the AE is not listed in the current IB or is not listed in the IB at the specificity or severity observed. Withdrawal from the study because of an AE and any therapeutic measures that are taken shall be at the discretion of the Investigator . If a patient withdraws from the study for any reason, any ongoing AEs will be followed until resolution, until deemed stable by the Investigator, or until the patient is deemed by the Investigator to be lost to follow-up. 10.14. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Serious AEs (SAE) which occur from the time the patient provides informed consent to the end of the study, require immediate notification to VI’s Compliance Department or its designated representat ive. All SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery, by faxing or emailing the report. The written report should be submitted on the SAE form provided for this purpose. The report must include the Investigator’s opinion as to whether the event is study drug- related. If this relationship is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug, evidence to support this assessment must also be provided. Documentation regarding the adverse event should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, and relationship to the investigational product, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or symptom observed by the Investigator or reported by the patient upon direct questioning. Expected outcomes related to the procedure should not be recorded as adverse events. 10.15. Sponsor Responsibility for Expedited Safety Reports Vascular Insights or designee will notify Investigator s of all reportable SAEs. This notification will be in the form of an expedited safety report. Upon receiving such notices, the Investigator must review and retain the notice with other study-related documentation. The Investigator and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) will determine if the informed consent form requires revisi on. The Investigator should also comply with the IRB/EC procedures for reporting any other safety information. Suspected serious adverse reactions and other significant safety issues reported from the investigational product development program shall be reported to the relevant competent health authorities in all concerned countries per local regulations (either as expedited safety reports and/or in aggregate reports), by the Sponsor or its designated representative.

General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. All statistical tests will be performed at the 0.05 significance level (p - value ≤ 0.050) unless otherwise indicated. For efficacy analyses, missing post- treatment data will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) . Missing safety data will not be imputed. 11.2. Analysis Populations 11.2.1. Safety Population The safety population will include all patients who are treated with ClariVein RES. Patient s will be analyzed per the treatment they received. 11.2.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat (MITT) Population The MITT population will include all randomized and treated patient s in the safety population who have baseline and at least one post- treatment assessment for the primary efficacy variable. Patient s will be analyzed per their randomized dose of STS . 11.3. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Improvement in patient reported symptoms at Week 12 post- treatment as compared to Baseline using the weekly avera ge HASTI (Heaviness, Achiness, Swelling, Throbbing, Itching) symptom score from the VEINES -QOL/Sym , an instrument of Varicose Vein Symptom Burden in patients with Superficial Venous . 11.3.1. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Elimination of saphenous vein reflux at Week 12 post- treatment as demonstrated by duplex ultrasound. 11.4. Tertiary Endpoints Assessment of patient improvement as compared to the B aseline assessment using the following scales at post treatment Week 12 on the following Quality of Life or patient improvement assessment: • Clinical-Etiology- Anatomy -Pathophysiology (CEAP) Classification • European Quality of Life scale (EQ -5D- 5L) • Revised Venous Clinical Severity Score (rVCSS) • Wong Baker Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) Page 46 of 101"

Week 6 Assessment of change in VEINES -QOL/Sym (Question s 1 through 8) at Week 6 post treatment follow-up visit as compared to Baseline 11.5.3. Week 1 2 Assessment of change in VEINES -QOL/Sym (Question 1 , excluding HASTI, through Question 8) at Week 12 post treatment follow-up visit as compared to Baseline 11.6. Determination of Sample Size The sample size of 50 patients (25 patients per treatment group) is based on both efficacy and safety considerations. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in the weekly average symptom score of a subset of the VEINES-QOL/Sym questionnaire (based on HASTI symptoms from Question 1: Heaviness, Achiness, Swelling, Throbbing, Itching) at Week 12 for both treatment groups combined. Assuming a true mean change from baseline to 12 weeks of -5.44 and a standard deviation of 3.52 for the change from baseline, a sample size of 50 would provide at least 99% power to reject the n ull hypothesis that the mean change from baseline equals 0 , based on a one- sample t-test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level. A sample size of 25 (that is, by treatment group) would also provide at least 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the mean change from baseline equals 0 . 11.7. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint The null hypothesis is that the mean change from baseline for the primary efficacy endpoint equals 0. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean change does not equal 0. The pr imary analysis will be a one- sample t -test for both treatment groups combined, to test the null hypothesis that the mean change from baseline equals 0. To evaluate a dose-response relationship, two analyses will be performed. First, the primary analysis w ill be performed for each treatment group separately. Second, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be performed to compare the change from baseline for STS 1% versus STS 3% with treatment as a class variable and with the baseline weekly average HASTI symptom score as a covariate in the model. Missing data for the Week 12 weekly average HASTI symptom score will be imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Page 47 of 101"
46,page_46,"11.8. Analysis of Other Efficacy Endpoints The primary analysis for each endpoint w ill use LOCF methodology for the imputation of missing data. Continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and will be analyzed using a one- sample t -test to test the null hypothesis that the mean change from baseline equals 0. The s econdary efficacy endpoint, the elimination of saphenous vein reflux at Week 12 post- treatment , will be summarized for both treatments combined using the count and percentage, together with a 95% Wilson ( score ) confidence interval for the proportion. To evaluate a dose-response relationship, two analyses will be performed for each endpoint. First, the analyses performed for both treatments combined will be repeated for each treatment group separately. Secondly, for continuous endpoints, an ANCOVA will be performed to compare the change from baseline for STS 1% versus STS 3% with treatment as the class variable and with baseline score as the covariate. For vein closure rate, the treatment difference for STS 1% versus STS 3% for the proportion will be asses sed by a chi -square test together with a 95% Wilson (score) confidence interval for the treatment difference. For each continuous endpoint, the change from baseline to each scheduled visit will be analyzed in the same manner as the Week 12 assessment. Both LOCF and observed cases analyses will be perform ed. The correlation between Week 12 efficacy endpoints will be explored using a Spearman correlation coefficient for pairs of quantitative variables, and Kendal’s tau for the correlation of the elimination o f saphenous vein reflux (yes, no) with quantitative variables. 11.9. Analysis of the Safety Endpoints Safety will be assessed based on adverse events (including selected events of interest), clinical laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs, and conc omitant medications. Safety data will be summarized by treatment group and overall. No statistical testing will be performed for safety data. AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment- emergent events are those adverse events that begin or worsen after initiation of the treatment procedure. The number and percentage of patients reporting treatment- emergent adverse events will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term. Treatment - emergent adverse events will be further summarized by severity and relationship to the treatment procedure. Physical examination data will be listed per patient. No summaries will be provided. Vitals signs data will be summarized by descriptive statistics for base line, each post- treatment visit, and the change from baseline to each post- treatment visit. All prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary. Concomitant medications are medications taken on or after t he treatment day, regardless of when they were started. Prior medications are medications taken before the treatment day, regardless of when they ended. The number and percentage of patients using Page 48 of 101"
47,page_47,"concomitant medications will be summarized by Anatomical Th erapeutic Chemical ( ATC ) 3 classification and preferred name. Overall safety assessment will include evaluation of the following specific events: • Neurological events including: stroke, TIA, visual symptoms, migraines • Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE) in t he treated leg • Post- treatment local effects including hyperpigmentation, granuloma formation, ulceration in the treated leg • Thrombus formation in deep veins (e.g., femoral vein) in the treated leg • Post-ablation superficial thrombus extension (PASTE) in the treated leg • Local and systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylax is 11.10. Protocol Deviations/Violations Protocol deviations will be identified prior to database lock and will be listed by treatment group in the clinical study report. A protocol violation occurs when the patient, Investigator, or Sponsor fails to adhere to significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion /exclusion criteria , patient safety, or primary endpoint criteria. Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, the following: • Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria • Use of a prohibited concomitant medication • Failure to attend two post treatment visits: of which one is Week 12 Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will result in a protocol violation . Sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a patient from the study. When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the Investigator and a Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files. Page 49 of 101"

To ensure ethical conduct of this clinical study, Investigators will be expected to adhere to the basic principles in recognized guidelines such the Belmont Report and the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects. To maintain confidentiality at the Investigational site , all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports , and other records will be identified by a coded number and patient’s initials only. All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet. Coded sheets linking a patient ’s name to a patient identification number will be stored in a separately locked file cabinet. Clinical information will not be released without written permiss ion of the patient, except as necessary for monitoring by the FDA. The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regulations ( e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC). 12.1. Institu tional Review Board or Ethics Committee Approval The protocol and the informed consent document must have the initial and at least annual (when required) approval of an IRB/EC. The signed IRB/EC approval letter must identify the documents approved ( i.e., list the Investigator’s name, the protocol number and title, the date of the protocol and informed consent document, and the date of approval of the protocol and the informed consent document). Any advertisements used to recruit patients should also be reviewed by the IRB/EC. The Sponsor will not ship clinical supplies until a signed approval letter from the IRB/EC has been received and a Clinical Trial Agreement has been signed by the Sponsor and the clinical site. 12.2. Informed Consent Informed consent form (IC F) will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations. A master ICF template will be provided by VI or its representative to each investigational study site. The Investigator will review and modify this document, if necessary. If any modifications are made, they must be approved by VI or its representative. The Investigator will provide the final informed consent form, assent, and HIPAA authorization to the Sponsor or designee for approval prior to submission to the IRB/EC. The consent form generated by the Invest igator must be acceptable to the Sponsor and be approved by the IRB/EC. The written consent document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the International Conference on Harmonization and will also comply with local regulations. The Investigator will send an IRB/EC-approved copy of the Informed Consent Form to the Sponsor (or designee) for Page 50 of 101"

Quality Control and Quality Assurance The Sponsor (Vascular Insights, LLC) performs quality control and assurance checks on all clinical studies that it sponsors. Prior to enrolling any patients into this study, the Sponsor personnel or its designee and the Investigator will review the protocol, the Clinical Investigator's Brochure, the eCRFs and instructions for their completion, the procedure for obtaining informed consent, and the procedure for reporting A Es. A qualified representative of the Sponsor will monitor the conduct of the study by visiting the site and by contacting the site by telephone. During the visits, information recorded in the eCRFs will be verified against source documents. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor will review the data for safety information. The Sponsor’s clinical data associates or designees will review the data for legibility, completeness, and logical consistency. Additionally, the Sponsor’s clinical data associates will use auto mated validation programs to help identify missing data, selected protocol violations, out-of- range data, and other data inconsistencies. Requests for data clarification or correction will be added to the electronic database and reviewed by the investigational site for resolution. The Sponsor may visit the investigational site and perform a quality check of the eCRFs against source documents. 13.2. Investigator s and Study Administrative Structure The Investigator must provide the Sponsor with the following documents BEFORE enrolling any patients: • An executed Clinical Trial Agreement • FDA Form 1572 • Documentation of financial disclosure • Principal Investigator ’s Curriculum Vitae • IRB/EC approval of the protocol • IRB/EC approved consent form • And any other documentation required by US rules and regulations and/or good clinical practice If any Investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting the study, the responsibility for maintaining records may be transferred to another person (Sponsor, IRB/EC, or other Investigators) who accepts the responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing and must agree to the change. An updated FDA Form 1572 will be filed with the Sponsor and the FDA for any changes in the study personnel reported in the current FDA Form 1572. 13.3.

The Investigator and study personnel will cooperate with the Sponsor, provide all appropriate documentation, and be available to discuss the study. The purpose of site visits is to verify: • Adherence to the protoc ol (the Investigator should document and explain any deviation from the approved protocol) • Completeness and accuracy of the eCRFs and the dispensing and inventory record (adequate time and space for these visits should be allocated by the Investigator) • Compliance with regulations (the verification will require comparison of the source documents to the eCRFs) 13.4. Data Collection and Electronic Case Report Forms Study- specific eCRFs will be made available to the Investigative site. Study data contained in source documentation will be entered in the eCRFs for all patients enrolled in the study. All pertinent data records are to be submitted to the Sponsor during and/or at completion or termination of the study. 13.5. Access to Source Documentation The Investigator agrees that qualified representatives of the Sponsor and regulatory agencies will have the right, both during and after this study, to conduct inspections and to audit and review medical records pertinent to the clinical study as permitted by the regulations. Patients will not be identified by name in any reports stemming from the study, and confidentiality of information in medical records will be preserved. The confidentiality of the patient will be maintained unless disclosure is required by regulations. Accor dingly, the following statement (or similar statement) that permits the release of the patient’s medical records will be included in the informed consent document: Representatives of regulatory agencies, IRB/EC, the Sponsor, and the patient’s personal Investigator may review the patient medical records and all information related to this study as permitted by law. Patient identity will remain confidential unless disclosure is required by law. 13.6. Study Documentation and Retention of Records Trial documents (including correspondence related to this clinical study, patient records, source documents, eCRFs, study drug inventory records, and IRB/EC and Sponsor correspondence pertaining to the study, original patient, laboratory, and study drug inventory records rela ting to the study) should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or planned marketing applications in an ICH region (that is at least 15 years or at least 2 year s have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the product). Trial documents should be retained for a longer period if required by applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the Sponsor. Thereafter, records will not be destroyed without giving the Sponsor prior written notice and the opportunity to further store such records, at the Sponsor’s cost and expense. Page 53 of 101"

Table 5: Description of Selected Scales for Efficacy Assessment Scale Relevance for its Selection for Study Assessment VEINES QOL The VEINES -QOL/SYM is a commonly used instrument to assess the effects of venous disease on patient quality of life and is well- accepted tools for the assessment of quality of life for patient s with venous disease. VEINES QOL - SYM has been found to be a reliable and valid patient outcome measures. VAS The pain VAS is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult populations. The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line 100 mm in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, “no pain” (score of 0) and “worst imaginable pain” (score of 100). The patient indicates the level of pain intensity by the position of a mark on the line. EQ-5D- 5L The EuroQOL-5 Dimensions 5-Level questionnaire (EQ- 5D-5L) is a standardized instrument for measuring generic health status. It is one of the most commonly used generic health status measurements, and its validity and reliability have been reported in vario us health conditions. In the description part of the EQ-5D, health status is measured in terms of five dimensions (5D): mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Mobility dimension asks about the person's walking ability. Self -care dimension asks about the ability to wash or dress by oneself, and usual activities dimension measures performance in ""work, study, housework, family or leisure activities"". In pain/discomfort dimension, it asks how much pain or discomfort they have, and in anxiety/depression dimension, it asks how much anxious or depressed they are. The respondents self- rate their level of severity for each dimension using the five- level (EQ -5D- 5L) scale. In the evaluation part, the respondents evaluate their overall health status using the visual analog scale (VAS) rVCSS Chronic venous disease (CVD) has benefited from the institution of several assessment instruments designed to clarify elements of the disease process. Among these is the revised Venous Clinic al Severity Score (rVCSS), which has proven to be a valuable tool for evaluating changes in condition over time with or without intervention. This revision increased the sensitivity and value of the VCSS in interpreting the language of venous disease. VCSS was originally designed and validated as an objective measure of disease severity in patients with CVD. The recent revision resolved ambiguity in the clinical descriptors and improved clarity and ease of use. The rVCSS consists of 10 items with scores ran ging from 0 = Absent to 3 = Severe. The Page 57 of 101"
56,page_56,"rVCSS is calculated by the sum of the scores for the 10 items with a max score of 30. CEAP The CEAP classification is a method for evaluating venous disease of the leg based on c linical, etiologic, anatomic, and p athophysiologic data. Page 58 of 101"

Imaging Format Ultrasound imaging to be recorded in Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format and labeled to the location. 3.1.2. Ultrasound Equipment Required Color flow Doppler ultrasound equipment with high frequency linear array transducer. 3.2. Visit 1 - Screening The Screening (Visit 1) ultrasound exam is to be performed to determine patient eligibility per the study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. The Superficial Venous System and the Deep Venous System of both legs will be assessed for reflux and obstruction. To obtain optimal assessment of a patient’s venous system, prior to arriving at the clinic the patient should be hydrated and be mobile for at least 2 to 3 hours. At the clinic, the patient will be asked to stand or walk for 10-15 minutes prior to the ultrasound imaging examination. 3.2.1. Superficial Venous System Reflux Assessment - Perform with patient in the standing position. Perform and record assessment using color flow Doppler ultrasound with pulse wave tracing in the longitudinal view, after a manual calf compression and relaxation (or after Valsalva’s maneuver at the SFJ). Reflux in Superficial System - defined as retrograde flow >500ms (0.5s). Reflux - identify location using a pulse wave tracing on the target vein in the longitudinal view and measure duration Refluxing Section Length - measure length in centimeters in the longitudinal view : 2 cm below the SFJ for the GSV or ASV, or at the fascial curve for the SSV ; i.e., from the deep vein junction, or highest point of reflux, to the end of the refluxing pathway of the saphenous vein. Refluxing Section Diameter - measure diameter in millimeters in cross -section view. Calculate average Treatment Section Diameter. Refer to Table 1 for measurement locations. Page 69 of 101"

If a treatment section extends below the knee, take an additional measurement. Measure the diameter at the knee and carry out a three-point proximal GSV average TSD and a three- point distal GSV average TSD. Use the corresponding TSL to determine STS volume. Obstruction Assessment - Perform with patient in the standing or supine position. Perform and record assessment in longitudinal and cross-section view. If obstruction or evidence of post- thrombotic changes in the superficial veins are found, document the location. 3.2.2. Deep Venous System Reflux and Obstruction of the Deep Venous System including the common femoral, deep femoral, femoral, popliteal and calf veins will be evaluated and documented. Reflux Assessment – Perform with patient in the standing position. Perform and record assessment using color flow Doppler ultrasound with pulse wave tracing in the longitudinal view, after a manual calf compression and relaxation (or after Valsalva’s maneuver at the SFJ). Reflux – identify location and determine if segmental, i.e., if reflux is located near the saphenofemoral and/or saphenopopliteal junctions alone. Reflux is defined as: • retrograde flow lasting >1.0s: common femoral, femoral and popliteal veins • retrograde flow lasting >0.5s: deep femoral and calf veins Page 70 of 101"
69,page_69,"Obstruction Assessment - Perform with patient in the standing or supine position. Perform and record assessment using longitudinal and cross-section view and record if obstruction is present. 3.3. Visit 2 - Baseline The Baseline (Visit 2) ultrasound exam is to be performed to confirm patient’s eligibility per the study Inclusion/Exclusion criteria and collect baseline data. The ultrasound a ssessment will be limited to the target saphenous vein. To obtain optimal assessment, prior to arriving at the clinic, the patient should be hydrated and be mobile for at least 2 to 3 hours. At the clinic, the patient and will be asked to stand or walk for 10-15 minutes prior to the ultrasound imaging examination. The p hysician will refer to vein mapping completed at the Screening (Visit 1) ; and per form focused ultrasound evaluation of the target saphenous vein. Reflux Assessment – Perform with patient in the standing position. Perform and record assessment using c olor flow Doppler ultrasound with pulse wave tracing in the longitudinal view, after a manual calf compression and relaxation (or after Valsalva’s maneuver at the SFJ).

Obstruction Assessment – Perform with patient in the standing or supine position. Assess using longitudinal and cross-section view and record if obstruction is present . Page 71 of 101"
70,page_70,"4. TREATMENT PERIOD 4.1. Visit 3 - DAY OF TREATMENT Refer to Schedule of Events as provided in the Study Protocol (CL-001). On the Day of Treatment (Visit 3) the physician is to perform a limited u ltrasound scan of the target saphenous vein. To obtain optimal assessment, prior to arriving at the clinic, the patient should be well hydrated and be mobile for at least 2 to 3 hours. At the clinic, the patient and will be asked to stand or walk for 10-15 minutes prior to the ultrasound imaging examination. Pr ior to treatment , physician will reference Screening and Baseline vein mapping. Using B-mode Duplex ultrasound in cross-section view with patient in the standing position, physician will perform a n ultrasound scan to confirm precise treatment section length and treatment section diameter . These measurements will be used to determine STS volume for treatment procedure. Prior to treatment obtain a cross section image of the target access site. Note vein diameter and location of access site relative to the knee. Include the name of the vein. The target access point is the lowest point of reflux. Record actual access point. Confirm Treatment Section Length and Treatment Section Diameter. These measurements will be used to determine STS volume for infusion. 4.1.1. Patient Preparation Typical patient position during the treatment will depend on the vein treated; i.e., for GSV (Great Saphenous Vein) or ASV (Accessory Saphenous Vein) patient is supine, for SSV (Small Saphenous Vein) patient is prone. 1. Use ster ile technique per institutional protocol for endovenous procedures. 2. Medicate the patient as appropriate. 3. Prepare and drape the puncture site. 4. Administer local anesthetic (1% lidocaine) at the access site as needed per medical protocol. 5. A 5 F Introducer is provided in the accessory product supplies. 4.1.2. Preparation of Investigational Product 4.1.2.1. STS Solution Preparation The study drug, sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) is supplied in 2 mL ampules for single use. Each 1% and 3% ampule contains: • 1% ampules, 20 mg/2 mL (10 mg/mL) Page 72 of 101"
71,page_71,"• 3% ampules, 60 mg/2 mL (30 mg/mL) The STS will be blinded and will be dispensed using a randomization procedure provided to each investigational site. Concentrations of 1% and 3% will be issued at a ratio of 1:1. Each ampule and carton carries a specific code for inventory accounting of the investigational drug at the ampule and carton level. The Investigator, Site Staff, and P atient will be blinded to the STS concentration. 4.1.2.2. Use of Aseptic Technique Strict aseptic technique must be maintained while handling the study drug. STS is a single-use, sterile, non-pyrogenic solution for parenteral use. STS ready -to-use solution is intended for intravenous infusion via ClariVein catheter. The STS solution does not require any additional preparation. The solution must NOT be diluted for use. Once an ampule is opened, it must be used only for that procedure; after the procedure, any unused portion of the ampule must be discarded. 4.1.2.3. Withdrawal of STS from Ampules All parenteral d rug products, including the study drug should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to use and administration. The STS is supplied as clear colorless solution. • Do not use if particulates, precipitation or discoloration is observed in the clinical drug supplies. Solutions that are discarded must be for accounted for during the disposition of the material. • STS inventory will be replenished as needed. • Site will report any product complaints to the study Sponsor or designee. • Maintain sterility of the STS sclerosant. • The outside surface of the glass ampule is non- sterile. • The sclerosant must be accessed with a sterile needle and syringe across the sterile field. • An assistant must hold the ampule while the sterile -gloved physician extracts the sclerosant with sterile needle and syringe. 4.1.2.4. STS Volume per Treatment Procedure STS volume for administration has been calculated based on Treatment Section Length ( TSL) and average Treatment Section Diameter ( TSD ) as presented in Tab le 2. The Investigator should consult this table for the target volume of STS solution, but may use his/her own discretion on volume per treatment procedure, provided that STS volume is not less than the minimum volume; and does not exceed a maximum of 10 mL for the single treatment procedure.

ClariVein® Device Preparation The ClariVein is introduced through a micro introducer. Utilizing ultrasound vascular imaging, the Catheter Sheath with Dispersion Wire is navigated through the vasculature to the treatment site. Fluid delivered through the Catheter Assembly’s Check Valve and Injection Port surrounds the Dispersion Wire and exits via an opening at the distal end of the catheter. The ClariVein catheter assembly, check valve, and motor drive unit must be connected prior to use; do not attempt to disassemble the ClariVein after use. It is fully disposable as a unit upon completion of the treatment procedure. Physician will select the ClariVein model based on patient anatomy; either a 45, 65 or 85 cm length model. Inspect the ClariVein package prior to opening. Do not use if package is opened or damaged. 1. Use sterile technique to carefully remove the tray from the pouch and the contents from the try. 2. Inspect all components of the ClariVein ® to be certain there are no visible signs of damage (Figure 1 ). Do not use if contents are damaged. 3. Remove Battery Terminal Insulator Tab from the Motor Drive Unit ( Figure 2, Item 12 ). Check to see that the MDU has power by confirming the Green Indicator Light is illuminated (Figure 2, Item 13) and by engaging the Trigger momentarily (Figure 2, Item 10). 4. Set the Dispersion Wire Tip speed to “H” using the Speed Selector ( Figure 2, Item 8 ) on the MDU. The four speed positions are labeled as follows: L – low, 2,000 RPM M1 – medium 2,500 RPM M2 – medium high, 3,000 RPM H – high, 3,500 RPM Note : The Dispersion W ire will not rotate if Green Indicator Light (LED) does not illuminate.

73,page_73,"5. Attach the Check Valve ( Figure 3, Item 14) to the Injection Port ( Figure 1, Item 2 ) on the Catheter Assembly by turning the Check Valve clockwise onto the Injection Port. 6. Using a 10 mL sterile syringe, prime the Catheter Assembly with sterile normal saline USP 0.9%, through the Check Valve and Injection Port checking to co nfirm con nection is secure. Caution: If leak is detected, reconfirm connection s of Syring e/Check Valve/Injection Port. Do not use product if leak continues. 7. Use the 5 mL s yringe provided within the ClariVein tray to infuse ST S. Refer to Table 2 and determine the volume of STS for administration per patient. a. Portion the dose by halves or third s of the total STS volume for administration , load the syringe with ≤ 4 mL at a time , and slowly administer small aliquots in sequence throughout the treatment section to facilitate even distribution of the STS.

74,page_74,"Figure 2: Motor Drive Unit Figure 3: Catheter Assembly with Check Valve and Syringe 4.1.4. Catheter Assembly Positioning 1. Prior to joining the catheter assembly with the Motor D rive Unit (MDU), thread the ClariVein® Catheter Assembly through the access device and use ultrasound imaging guidance to confirm that the Catheter Tip (with the Dispersion Wire still within the sheath) is in the approximate desired location in the Treatment Section . Page 76 of 101"
75,page_75,"2. Once the Catheter Tip is in the approximate desired position ( Table 3) , join the Catheter Assembly and Motor Drive Unit. Table 3: Initial Positioning of The ClariVein Catheter and Dispersion Wire Target Vein Position within the Treatment Section Great Saphenous ( GSV ) and Accessory Saphenous Vein (ASV ) Position dispersion wire ball tip 2 cm below the saphnofemoral junction (SFJ) and the superficial epigastric vein (SEV) . Small Saphenous Vein ( SSV) Position dispersion wire ball tip at the top of the fascial curve . This is usually 2.5 to 3 cm from the saphenopopliteal (SPJ) junction if the SPJ exists. Saphenous Vein Segment ( SVS) Position dispersion wire ball tip at the highest poi nt of reflux within the segment. NOTE : If using a second access point to complete infusion through the entire Treatment Section , move the C atheter A ssembly only after resheathing the dispersion wire, i.e., move the C atheter Assembly to Position 1. 4.1.4.1. Catheter Sheath Marking The ClariVein® has markings on the catheter to aid in location. A single black ‘hash’ mark denotes 1 cm increments. A double black ‘hash’ mark denotes 10 cm increments. A single white ‘hash’ mark denotes approximately 8 cm from the Dispersion Wire Tip when the Dispersion Wire is unsheathed. 4.1.4.2. Joining Catheter As sembly t o The Motor Drive Unit 1. While carefully maintaining position of the Dispersion Wire Tip within the Treatment Section , hold the Guide Wing ( Figure 1, Item 3) and advance the MDU onto the Catheter Assembly ’s Cartridge for initial mating in the Alignment Channel Position 1 ( Figure 2, Item 7 ). Ensure the orientation of the MDU is in straight alignment with the Catheter Assembly . Exercise care not to bend or kink the proximal end of the Catheter Sheath. NOTE: Once joined, the Catheter Assembly is not removable from the MDU. 2. To expose the Dispersion Wire Tip, advance the MDU to secure the Guide Wing into the Matin g Alignment Channel Position 2, by holding the Guide Wing and rotating the MDU slightly to the left. ( Figure 4). NOTE: The electrical circuit is now activated and the Dispersion Wire Tip is now unsheathed. 1. Connect the Syringe to the check valve connected t o the Injection Port. 2. Snap the s yringe into the s yringe locking support. ( Figure 2, item 9 ). Page 77 of 101"
76,page_76,"3. Ensure the s yringe is fully engaged in the s yringe locking support. 4.1.4.3. Immediately Prior to Treatment 1. Using ultrasound imaging guidance, confirm that the dispersion wire tip is in the desired position. Adjust as needed and reposition if necessary as described in Table 3 above. Figure 4: Connected catheter Assembly with MDU 4.1.4.4. Activating the Rotatable Dispersion Wire 1. Prior to activating rotation of the dispersion wire confirm the: a. position of the dispersion wire tip within the Treatment Section utilizing ultrasound imaging guidance b. dispersion tip is not within the vascular access device c. speed selection is at 3500 RPM d. patient is informed they will feel a slight vibration along the treated vein . 2. Activate rotation of the dispersion wire by depressing the trigger. Caution: Only activate rotation of the dispersion wire wh ile simultaneously slowly withdrawing (pulling back) the catheter assembly . 3. During the first 1 cm of pull back, activate the dispersion wire rotation, but do not infuse any fluid . For the remainder of the procedure, pull back with simultaneous dispersion wire rotation and infusion of fluid . 4. After the first 1 cm of pull back with wire rotation alone (without infusion of any fluid), slowly withdraw the device through the treatment area while simultaneously infusing the STS. a. The procedure is carried out using both hands moving simultaneously. Page 78 of 101"
77,page_77,"b. Depress the syringe plunger with the thumb of the same hand that is holding the MDU (Figure 6 ). c. Perform a controlled pull back ( withdrawal ) of approximately 6 – 7 sec / cm. d. While the Dispersion Wire is r otating, hold the MDU with one hand while using the other hand to gently grasp the catheter sheath between your thumb and index finger proximal to the access site; pull back slowly and smoothly with 2 hands ensuring the ClariVein ® catheter sheath does not kink or become damaged. e. Ensure the orientation of the MDU is in straight alignment and pointed towards the Catheter Assembly. The catheter must be kept straight between the Access Site and the point being grasped by the physician. Note: For veins with diameters ≥1 0 mm, slight compression with the ultrasound probe is recommended. If the patient feels any discomfort , compression should be abandoned. Caution : Do not forcefully compress the vei n at the location of the rotating (spinning) dispersion wire tip either manually or with an ultrasound probe during the procedure. It is not recommended to continuously follow the rotating ( spinning) dispersion wire tip with the ultrasound probe. Doing so may result in the dispersion wire beco ming ensnared with the vein, damage to the device, and/or cause patient discomfort. After approximately 10 cm of the Treatment Section has been infused with STS, stop wire rotation by releasing Trigger and stop STS infusion. U tilizing ultrasound , asses s the 10 cm portion. • If venous spasm is present, continue with the procedure as planned by reactivating the dispersion wire rotation and resume infusing STS. • If the treated vein has not gone into spasm, resheath the dispersion wire into the catheter sheath by placing the Catheter Assembly in Position 1, then slowly advance the catheter to the proximal position in the Treatment Section and retreat that segment as appropriate. If the target volume of STS was less than 10 mL, the physician should deliver additional STS but not exceed the maximum dose of 10 mL. (See Table 2 ) Caution: To minimize potential damage to the device and/or patient injury: • Never advance the catheter when the Catheter Assembly is in Position 2; the Catheter Assembly must be in Position 1during advancement in the vein. • Never advance the dispersion wire when it is rotating – it must NOT be activated during advancement in the vein. • Do not create a bend with tension between the Catheter Assembly and the MDU. Note: If patient experiences discomfort during pull back, temporarily reduce speed of dispersion wire rotation. A fter pulling dispersion wire tip through sensitive area , resume High speed wire rotation . 1. Evenly deliver sclerosant along the Treatment Section . Page 79 of 101"
78,page_78,"2. If resistance is encountered during pull back, see Pull back Resistance below. 3. When approximately half of the treatment has been completed, slide the access sheath back over the catheter to the most proximal end of the Catheter Assembly. 4. After emptying the syringe which contains the final amount of STS, flush the catheter with 1 mL of sterile normal saline. ( This accounts for the dead space within the catheter system and thus ensures delivery of the full target volume of STS.) 5. When the single white hash mark on the cathet er is visible, the dispersion wire tip is 8 cm from the access point. Be prepared to end fluid infusion after approximately 2 to 3 cm more pull back. 6. When the procedure is finished and prior to catheter removal from the patient, re -sheath the Dispersion Tip and disable the MDU by the following: a. Unsnap the Syringe from the Syringe Locking Support on the MDU ( Figure 5, Step 1). b. Rotate the Catheter Assembly away from the Syringe Locking Support ( Figure 5, Step 2 ). c. Push Guide Wing to its most distal position until it stops in Mating Alignment Channel Position 1 ( Figure 5, Step 3 ). d. Continue to push to the most distal position until it stops ( Figure 5, Step 4) Note: Placing Catheter Assembly in Mating Alignment Channel Position 1 so that the Dispersion Wire will not rotate when removing device from patient . The Catheter Assembly cannot be separated from the MDU. Remove the Catheter Assembly and access device as one unit from patient . Hold pressure at the access site as in any e ndovenous procedure. Then , apply a bandage to the Access Site. 4.1.4.5. Pull-back Resistance During pull back, venous anatomy may interfere with the free rotation of the Dispersion Wire Tip . The user may detect one or more of the following: • a change in the tone of the Motor Drive Unit indicating a reduction in Dispersion Wire rotation, • the patient may complain of discomfort, or • resistance to pull back . If any of the se occur, i mmediately release the trigger to stop the Dispersion W ire rotat ion. While maintaining straight alignment of the catheter assembly, determine remedial action to be taken, including: • Hold the catheter with a thumb and index finger at the Access Site; then pull the catheter past the area of resistance. Page 80 of 101"
79,page_79,"• Move the Catheter Assembly to Position 1; then move back to Position 2 and repeat. • Move the Catheter Assembly to Position 1; then slowly rotate entire assembly clockwise up to 3 full rotations. After taking remedial action, confirm the Dispersion Wire can rotate freely by gently sliding the catheter about 2 to 3 mm back and forth within the vein. When the user is certain that the Dispersion Wire is free within the vein, ensure the Catheter Assembly is in Position 2; then resume the procedure.

Measure “stump length”, i.e., the distance from the junction to the first point of venous closure. Record image in long view of the junction indicating the “stump length”. 2. Record cross section images including junction with deep vein (split screen view with and without compression of the vein). 3. The study will use a two -point technique for assessing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. 4. The study will also evaluate and record PASTE into the deep venous system. If PASTE is present categorize per Table 4 . Deep Venous System - The deep venous system will be evaluated to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT) using a two-point technique for assessing Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in the common femoral, superficial femoral, and popliteal veins. The treated vein junction will also be evaluated for PASTE. Evaluation for the presence of DVT and PASTE will be performed (in supine position) and images stored using the following protocol while scanning from the CFV to the calf veins: • Evaluate above veins in B-mode; and in presence of PASTE in color flow mode • Compress proximal, mid, and distal part of each vein segment. Record images in cross -section view using B-mode (split screen) with and without compression • Evaluate above vein segments with color flow with distal augmentation 6.2. Post Ablation Superficial Thromboembolic Events (PASTE) With patient in the supine position, clinician will carefully evaluate the SFJ and SPJ to look for post-ablation superficial thrombus extension from the GSV, ASV and SSV into the deep venous system. • If post-ablation superficial thrombus extension is present, measurement and evaluation will be done with patient in the reverse Trendelenburg or standing position; and images stored. • Characterization of the length of any post-ablation superficial thrombus extending into the deep venous system and the percentage of deep vein diameter that is affected will be assessed utilizing Table 4.
