The study consists of the following periods: screening period, double -blind on-treatment period, and safety follow -up period. Screening Period (2 Weeks) Potential patients will be evaluated during a screening period lasting up to 2 weeks to ensure sufficient washout of restricted medications. Extension to the screening period may be approved by the Sponsor or representative in extenuating circumstances related to the patient or caregiver. After obtaining written informed consent, diagnostic interviews and physical examinations will be conducted, vital signs and ECGs will be assessed, and blood samples for laboratory assessments will be collected. Patients considered potentially eligible for participation will be required to discontinue their current antidepressant treatment and/or other psychotropic drugs. At baseline (Visit 2), patients who continue to meet all eligibility criteria wil l be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the 2 treatment arms (60 mg ITI -007 or placebo) for a 6 -week, double -blind treatment period.

Confidential 2 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 2 INTRODUCTION : BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 2.1 Background Information Bipolar Disorder is a serious psychiatric disorder associated with shifts in mood including manic or hypomanic episodes, depressed episodes, or mixed episodes. Bipolar I Disorder is defined by the presence of m anic or mixed episodes, whereas Bipolar II Disorder is defined by hypomania, but both are often associated with major depressive episodes. Bipolar Disorder affects approximately 5.7 million adult Americans, or about 2.6% of the U.S. population age 18 and older, every year according to the National Institute of Mental Health with similar prevalence worldwide . Depressive episodes associated with Bipolar Disorder tend to last longer, recur more often, and are associated with worse prognosis than manic/hypomanic episodes. Bipolar Depression , the predominant presentation of Bipolar Disorder , remains a significantly underserved medical need, with only a few regulato ry-approved treatment options available. Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITI) is developing lumateperone ( ITI-007), a new chemical entity, for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, major depressive episodes (MDEs) associated with Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder (Bipolar Depression ) and for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease. ITI-007 is a novel small molecule therapeutic agent designed specifically to combine serotonergic, dopaminergic and glutamatergic modulation in a dose -dependent manner . ITI-007 is a potent serotonin 5 -HT2A receptor antagonis t with mesolimbic/mesocortical selective modulation of phosphoprotein pathways downstream of dopamine receptors , serotonin reuptake inhibition , and indirect gluta matergic modulation (Snyder et al 2015). As a dopamine receptor protein phosphorylation modulator, ITI -007 has dual properties, acting as post -synaptic antagonist and as a pre -synaptic partial agonist at dopamine 2 (D2) receptors in vivo, with mesolimbic/ mesocortical selectivity. ITI -007 also increas es the phosphorylation of the NR2B, or GluN2B, subunit of N -methyl -D-aspartate channels in extrastriatal dopamine -rich brain regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens) and indirectly modulates glutamatergic (NDMA and A MPA) activity downstream from dopamine 1 receptor activation. Evidence supports the use of D 2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of Bipolar Disorder , including Bipolar Depression (Young et al 2013; Loebel et al 2014a, 2014b), as both monotherapy and ad junctive therapy to mood stabilizers. The pharmacologic profile of ITI -007 includes both the post -synaptic D 2 antagonism that appears efficacious in Bipolar Disorder and other pharmacological properties that may confer better safety"
21,page_21,"________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________ Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. Confidential 3 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 and tolerability than other D 2 antagonists. As a 5 -HT2A receptor antagonist and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, ITI -007 is predicted to have antidepressant efficacy with fewer side effects than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Meltzer et al 1989). ITI- 007’s indirect glutamatergic modulation in combination with serotonin reuptake inhibition predicts rapid -acting antidepressant response. Importantly, ITI -007 lacks potent off - target in teractions that have been associated with side effects for other antipsychotics drugs approved for the treatment of Bipolar Depression . For example, ITI -007 shows relatively weak affinity for 5 -HT2C and no measurable affinity for H 1 or muscarinic choliner gic receptors, which predict favorable body weight and metabolic profile responses to the extent that these receptors mediate such effects. Additional details on the pharmacologic profile of ITI -007 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. Nonclinical data suggest that ITI -007 may have the potential to treat depression (Snyder et al 2015). Antidepressant -like activity of ITI -007 was measured using the social defeat (resident -intruder) mouse model. Mice exposed to repeated social defeat con ditions display a reduced amount of time in contact with unfamiliar non -aggressive mice than normal controls. Such defeat behavior is reversed by chronic (but not acute) treatment with clinically effective antidepressant drugs. In this model, 1 m/kg ITI -007, administered once daily intraperitoneally for 28 days, reversed the defeat behavior, consistent with antidepressant efficacy. Brain receptor target engagement was confirmed in healthy male volunteers in the ITI -007-003 positron emission tomography (PET) Phase 1 clinical trial (Davis et al 2015). Positron emission tomography was used to determine dopamine D 2 receptor, serotonin transporter (SERT), and serotonin 5 -HT2A receptor occupancy in the brain at various times following single dose oral ITI -007 administration. ITI -007 rapidly penetrated the brain, showed long -lasting and dose - related occupancy, and was generally safe and well -tolerated. Cortical 5 -HT2A receptors were shown to be fully occupied at 10 mg ITI -007 (>85% occupancy). A dose of 40 mg ITI-007 achieved up to 39% striatal D 2 occupancy (average of 29%) and up to 31% striatal SERT occupancy (average of 22%). Together, these data confirm a central mechanism for ITI -007 at dopaminergic and serotonergic brain targets. An additional PET study in patients with schizophrenia (ITI -007-008) demonstrated an average of approximately 40% striatal D 2 receptor occupancy at 60 mg, at plasma steady state , lower than that observed with most antipsychotic drugs. Relatively low striatal D 2 receptor occupanc y likely contributes to a relatively low liability for extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia compared to most antipsychotic drugs. Clinical data from three well -controlled studies in patient with schizophrenia (ITI -007- 005, ITI -007-301, and I TI-007-302) are consistent with respect to the pharmacological profile and prediction for antidepressant effects with favorable safety and tolerability. In these three studies ITI -007 has been safely administered once daily for up to 42 days at"

Confidential 4 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 doses rang ing from 20 mg to 140 mg. Furthermore, the ITI -007 60 mg dose had a similar trajectory and magnitude of improvement in psychosis as demonstrated a reduction from baseline in the Positive and Negative Synd rome Scale (PANSS) Total Score in all three studies , which was statistically significant at Day 28 compared to placebo in two of these studies (ITI -007-005 and ITI -007-301). In addition to improving psychotic symptoms, ITI -007 also improved symptoms of depression in patients with schizophrenia and comorbi d depression at baseline . Safety data from these and other trials with ITI -007 have shown that ITI -007, which has been administered to more than 1500 individuals , is well tolerated across a dose range from 1 mg to 140 mg and administered once daily for up to 42 days with a safety profile similar to placebo . These clinical data together with the nonclinical data and the pharmacological profile support the development of ITI -007 for the treatment of Bipolar Depression. Details on the profile of ITI -007 can be found in the ITI -007 I nvestigator’s Brochure. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ITI -007 as a monotherapy for the treatment of Bipolar Depression . 2.2 Rationale The screening phase permits evaluation of diagnosis as well as the laboratory and ECG assessments and enables confirmation of eligibility for inclusion into the study. The screening phase will be no longer than 14 days, unless confirmed by the Medical Monitor that a longer screening phase, not to exceed 28 days, is a ppropriate to ensure washout of excluded medication with long half -life (e.g., fluoxetine), under the supervision of the investigator before baseline . Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups at the baseline visit and w ill receive treatment for up to 6 weeks. In order to ensure patient safety, a mandatory 14 -day follow -up visit will be performed after administration of the last dose of study medication. Any ongoing AEs at the follow -up visit must be followed until reso lution, until the AE stabilizes, until it is determined to be non -clinically significant, or until the patient is lost to follow -up. ITI-007 60 mg was selected to deliver full occupancy of the cortical 5 -HT2A receptors (>85% occupancy) with modest striatal D 2 receptor occupancy and SERT occupancy. Data from human PE T brain receptor occupancy studies with ITI -007 indicates that a dose as low as 10 mg is associated with >85% occupancy of cortical 5 -HT2A recepto rs, while the 60-mg dose demonstrates approximately 4 0% striatal D 2 receptor occupancy . SERT occupancy has been demonstrated to be comparable to D 2 receptor occupancy . Moreover, once daily oral administration ITI -007 60 mg has been shown to be well tolera ted with no dose titration needed and with a safety profile similar to placebo with up to 6 weeks’ treatment duration in patients with schizophrenia."

Confidential 5 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 Therefore, a fixed dose design will be employed in this study with once daily oral administration of ITI -007 60 mg (or placebo). The placebo control group is needed to establish the efficacy of a new compound. The treatment duration of 6 weeks has been chosen because this is considered an acceptable period to demonstrate efficacy in this patient population. The hypothesis is that ITI -007 60 mg will demonstrate efficacy for the treatment of Bipolar Depression with statistically significant superiority versus placebo on the primary outcome measure, mean change from baseline to Day 43 in the total score on the MAD RS in patients with Bipolar Depression . 2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits 2.3.1 Potential Risks There are several potential risks associated with taking part in this research study. A patient’s Bipolar Depression may not improve and could even worsen by taking part in this study. Each of these risks are discussed below. Patients should ask their study doctor if they have any questions or concerns about these risks. During this study, patients will take either 60 m g ITI-007 or placebo. Neither the patient nor the study doctor will know which drug the patient is taking. ITI-007 is an experimental drug which is not approved by the FDA or any regulatory authority . In research studies already conducted with ITI -007, over 1500 people have received ITI -007. The most frequent side effect observed with ITI -007 60 mg and that has been reported at a rate twice that of placebo is: * Tiredness or sleepiness Additional side effects that have been observed with ITI -007 include: * Headache * Dizziness or lightheadedness * Low blood pressure or fast heartbeat when standing up suddenly * Tachycardia (fast heartbeat) without standing * Nausea and/or vomiting"
24,page_24,"________________________________ ________________________________ ____________________________ Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. Confidential 6 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 * Abdominal pain/cramps * Feeling “drunk” * Diarrhea * Dry mouth * Weakness * Anxiety * Insomnia * Changes in levels of liver enzymes (which could indicate liver damage) * Hot and/or cold sensations * Stuffy nose * Sweating In test tube studies, ITI -007 showed potential to be toxic to genetic material (genes or DNA). Whe n tested in two different animal studies, ITI -007 did not cause toxicity to genes. Only in dogs, long -term dosing of ITI -007 was associated with adverse findings that may not be relevant to humans given the striking differences in metabolism (the way the body breaks down the drug) between dogs and humans. Dogs are exposed to drug metabolites that are not detected in humans. Short -term exposure (6 weeks or less) of ITI-007 has been shown to be well -tolerated with a sa fety profile similar to placebo in over 1500 people. There may be other side effects of ITI -007 that have not yet been observed or reported. ITI-007 is an experimental drug that is still being tested and may not be effective in the treatment of Bipolar Depression . The placebo is not an active drug. Throughout the study, patients will not be taking any other medication to treat Bipolar Depression . Therefore, it is possible that patients may experience an increase in Bipolar Depression symptoms. ECG: Some areas where the electrodes (sticky patches) will be placed may need to be shaved. The test is painless, but the electrodes may irritate skin. Blood Draw: Drawing blood may cause discomfort, bruising and very rarely infection at the site where the skin is punctured by the needle. Patients may also experience dizziness, nausea or fainting during blood taking. Patients will have to fast for 10 hours (overnight) before blood draws. Harm to the Unborn Child : Currently we are not fully aware of the effects of ITI-007 on unborn babies, or pregnant or breastfeeding women. In women who are pregnant, or may become pregnant, treatment with the ITI-007 may lead to new, previously"

Because of this, women who can have children will be asked to take a pregnancy test, at the start of the study. Men and women taking study treatment must be using an effective form of birth control before start ing the study trea tment and while taking part in the study. Any patient who is confirmed to be pregnant during the study will be immediately discontinued from study treatment. 2.3.2 Potential Benefits Patients will be monitored carefully for their mental health status and general health. Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Depression ) may improve during participation in this study, although half the people in the study will receive placebo and may not improve . However, the information obtained from this study may help to treat people with Bipolar Depression better in the future ."

Confidential 11 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 4 STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lumateperone monotherapy in the treatment of patients with major depressive episodes associated with Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder (Bipolar Depression ). The study consists of the following periods: Screening Period, double -blind On-treatment Period, and Safety Follow -up Period. Screening Period (2 Weeks) Potential patients will be evaluated during a Screening Period lasting up to 2 weeks, to ensure sufficient washout of restricted medications. Extension to the screening period may be approved by the Sponsor or representative in extenuating circumstances related to the patient or caregiver. After obtaining written informed consent, diagnostic interviews and physical examinations will be conducted, vital signs and ECGs will be assessed, and blood samples for laboratory assessment s will be collected. Patients considered potentially eligible for participation will be required to discontinue their current antidepressant treatment and/or other psychotropic drugs. At baseline (Visit 2), patients who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment arms for a 6 -week, double -blind treatment period. Patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following groups: 60 m g ITI-007 or matching placebo. Double -Blind On-Treatment Period (6 Weeks) Patients will take their first dose of study medication the evening of their baseline visit. A single dose will be taken each day in the evening , with or without food, for the duration of the 6-week O n-treatment Period. Following randomization, patients will attend the clinic on Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36 and 43. Safety Follow -up Period (2 Weeks) A return to the clinic for a safety follow -up visit will occur at Week 8, approximately 2 weeks following the last dose of study medication. If possible, patients who withdraw prematurely will be seen for an early termination visit (within 1 week of early termination) and will be asked to return to the clinic for a safety follo w-up visit 2 weeks following withdrawal."

Patients will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to 1 of the following groups: 60 -mg ITI-007 or matching placebo. The double -blind on -treatment period will be a total of 6 weeks. 5.4.1 Randomization Procedures An interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) (English only) will be used to administer the r andomization schedule. Unblinded biostatistics personnel not participating in the conduct of the study will generate a permuted block randomization schedule using SAS software Version 9.2 or later for IVRS/IWRS, w hich will link sequential patient randomization numbers to treatment codes. In the event that the blind needs to be broken because of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual patient’s treatment allocation (Section 5.4.3 ). The rand omization schedule will be stratified by Bipolar I or Bipolar II diagnoses at screening. Each patient will be assigned a randomization number, at the time of randomization, which will be separate from the patient identification number. Once a randomizatio n number has been allocated to a patient, it may not be assigned to another patient. The IVRS/IWRS will send visit notifications to the study site personnel , confirming the patient data that were entered. The IVRS/IWRS notifications should be filed secu rely at the study site."

Confidential 19 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 5.4.2 Masking Procedures The study will be performed in a double -blind manner. All study treatment will be supplied in identical treatment cards and packaging, and will be similar in color, smell, taste, and appearance, thereby enabling double -blind conditions. 5.4.3 Breaking the Blind A patient’s treatment assignment will not be broken until the end of the study unless medical treatment of the patient depends on knowing the study treatment the patient received. In the event t hat the blind needs to be broken because of a medical emergency, the investigator may unblind an individual patient’s treatment allocation. As soon as possible, the investi gator should first contact the Medical M onitor to discuss the medical emergency and the reason for revealing the actual treatment received by that patient. The treatment assignment will be unblinded through IVRS/IWRS. Reasons for treatment unblinding must be clearly explained and justified in the eCRF. The date on which the code was b roken together with the identity of the person responsible must also be documented. Any patients whose treatments become unblinded will continue in the study as planned, but will be excluded from the per -protocol set (Section 12). The overall randomization code will be broken only for study reporting purposes. This will occur once all final clinical data have been entered into the database and all data queries have been resolved. 5.5 Patient Withdrawal The planned overall duration of the study f or each patient is up to 10 -12 weeks (9 visits): i.e. a screening phase of up to 2 weeks (to ensure sufficient washout of restricted medication) , a double -blind on-treatment period of 6 weeks, and a follow -up phase of 2 weeks. The duration of the study is defined for each patient as the date signed written informed consent is obtained through the last follow -up visit on Day 5 7. Patients may withdraw voluntarily from the study or the investigator or sponsor may terminate a patient’s participation .

In all cases, a new informed consent must be obtained for a rescreen. A patient may not be screened more than 2 times. 5.5.1 Reasons for Withd rawal Patients may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the investigator or at the study site. Every effort should be made to keep patients in the study. The reasons for patients not com pleting the study will be recorded. A patient may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: 1. Does not meet the protocol inclusion criteria or meets the protocol exclusion criteria. 2. Noncompliance with the protocol. 3. A serious or intolerab le AE that, in the investigator’s opinion, requires withdrawal from the study. 4. Laboratory safety assessments that reveal clinically significant hematological or biochemical changes from baseline values, or baseline laboratory safety assessments that are returned after randomization but reveal clinically significant hematological or biochemical changes from screening. 5. Symptoms or an intercurrent illness not consistent with the protocol requirements or that justify wi thdrawal. 6. Lost to follow -up. 7. Other (e.g., pregnancy, development of contraindications of use of study drug). 8. The investigator or sponsor decide to discontinue the patient’s participation in the study. 9. The patient withdraws consent. If consent is withdrawn, the patient must be questioned by the investigator or study site staff whether the withdrawal is due to an AE, lack of efficacy, personal or family reasons, or whether the patient withdrew consent and refused all end -of-study procedures, including refusin g to give a reason; these reasons must be documented in the case report form. The investigator will also withdraw a patient if ITI terminates the study. Upon occurrence of a serious or intolerable AE, the investigator will confer with the sponsor or Medic al Monitor as the sponsor’s designee. If a patient is discontinued because of an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved, stabilizes, is determined to be non -"

Patient participation in the study may be stopped at any time a t the discretion of the investigator or at the request of the sponsor. Patients who discontinue study treatment or active participation in the study will no longer receive study treatment . When a patient withdraws from the study, the reason(s) for withdra wal shall be recorded by the investigator on the relevant screen of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Whenever possible, all patients who discontinue study treatment or withdraw from the study prematurely will undergo all end -of-study assessments. Patients who fail to return for final assessments will be contacted by the study site (2 documented telephone calls followed by 1 registered letter or similar procedures depending on regional differences ) in an attempt to have them comply with the protocol . It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any patient withdrawn as a result of an AE or serious AE (SAE). In every case, efforts must be made to undertake protocol -specified, safety, follow -up procedures. All data collected from all patients, including early withdrawals, will be used in the reporting and analysis of the study. 5.6 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated by the sponsor . Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to the investigator, and regulatory authorities . If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principa l investigator will promptly inform the IRB /IEC and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients . • Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements. • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable. • Determination of futility ."

There are no modifications of dosing allowed except withdrawal. See Section 5.5 for details regarding patient withdrawal. An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a patient or taken by a patient that exceeds the dose described in the protocol . Any overdose, with or witho ut associated AEs, must be promptly reported to the Medical Monitor . Overdoses without signs or symptoms do not need to be recorded as AEs; in case of any AEs associated with the overdose, these should be reported on relevant AE/SAE sections in the eCRF. Previous clinical trials have evaluated ITI -007 in healthy volunteers with single dose s up to and including 40 mg, multiple doses up to and including 20 mg administered once daily for 5 days, and multiple doses up to and including 30 mg administered once d aily for 7 days in healthy geriatric volunteers. Previous clinical trials have evaluated ITI -007 in patients with schizophrenia with multiple dose s up to and including 140 mg administered once daily for 5 days, multiple doses up to and including 120 mg administered once daily for 4 weeks, and multiple doses up to and including 60 mg administered once daily for 6 weeks. In case of an overdose that exceeds the previously studied doses, the patient should be closely monitored (in a hospital setting as needed) with sufficient attention to the symptoms and the clinical course. Supportive measures may include gastric lavage and respiratory and cardiovascular support as needed."

In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much test article is dispensed and us ed by each patient in the study. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all study treatment will be reconciled an d retained or destroyed according to applicable regulations. 6.5 Assessment of Patient Compliance with Study Product Administration Patient compliance will be assessed by capsule counts of unused study medication at each visit during the double -blind treatment phase. Any irregularities in medication adherence should be discussed with the patient. Any patient who misses 2 doses of study medication per week in any 2 weeks of the study treatment period or who misses 3 or more doses of study medication in any sin gle week should be considered for early discontinuation. Any exceptions due to unusual circumstances should be discussed on a case -by-case basis with the Medical Monitor to determine whether a patient may continue despite apparent treatment compliance iss ues. Dispensing study treatment to be taken by patients in an outpatient study increases risk for medication errors. All errors in medication dispensing or administration must be carefully documented. These errors may include but are not limited to provi ding the wrong dose (not taking 1 capsule per dose or taking too many capsules per dose), losing medication, or administration at the wrong time of day. Medication adherence will be emphasized at every visit. Written instructions will be provided to the patients with the weekly medication card in order to minimize medication error. Additional adherence procedures may be implemented. 6.6 Concomitant Medications/Treatments Patients are required not to use the following during the study: alcohol, cannabis, any known 5 -HT2A receptor antagonist or inverse agonist, any strong or moderate cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor or inducer, any short -acting anxiolytic, or any drugs with known psychotropic properties or any non -psychotropic drugs with potential ce ntral nervous system effects. The only exception is zolpidem, which may be taken no more than 3 times per week, allowed only during the screening period and taken within the first 2 weeks of the treatment period (Section 5.2, Exclusion 13). Patients cons idered potentially eligible for participation will be required to discontinue their current antidepressant treatment and/or other psychotropic drugs for the duration of the study."

The format and content of the ICF must have been agreed upon by the investigator, the appropriate IRB /IEC, and ITI. 8.1.2 Medical History and Other Information Medical history information will be collected at screening and should include (but not be limited to) de mographic information, current and past medical conditions, and current and past medications. The medical history must be documented in the patient’s study chart prior to study treatment administration and also recorded in the appropriate eCRF. In additi on to conventional medical history, information pertaining to the patient’s average alcohol and caffeine consumption and average tobacco and cannabis usage should be recorded in the eCRF. Demographic information will also be collected. Patients will be checked for previous participation in an ITI -007 clinical study and for duplicate enrollment by study site staff using any methods available for identifying duplicate patients. 8.1.3 Modified Physical Examination A modified physical examination , including neurological and excluding genital/rectal examinations, will be performed. The examination should include evaluation of height (at screening only [m]); body weight (kg); waist circumference (cm); appearance and skin; head and neck; eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lungs; heart; abdomen; and extremities. Neurological findings will also be recorded. All physical examination findings must be documented in the patient’s study chart and also recorded in the eCRF."

Subsequent ECGs will be single 10 -second epochs from 12 -lead ECGs. Electrocardiogram parameters to be measured include heart rate , QRS, PR, QT, QTcB, QTcF, and RR intervals. The ECG recordings will be made on ECG machines supplied by a central ECG laboratory. Electrocardiogram data will be transferred to the central ECG laboratory on the same day as collected and interpretation wi ll be provided to the study site within approximately 48 hours. If any 12 -lead ECG recording shows an arrhythmia other than a sinus arrhythmia, sinus tachycardia, or sinus bradycardia, an additional 12 -lead ECG will be recorded to confirm the original tra cing. Any other clinically significant treatment - emergent cardiac conduction abnormalities will be followed until no longer deemed necessary by the investigator. Central interpretations of ECG recordings obtained at screening will be the basis for determi nation that a patient is eligible for inclusion in the study. Similarly, central interpretations of ECG recordings at baseline and other visits will be included in the final study data. However, given that interpretations of recordings will not be availa ble for up to 48 hours, investigators are to use machine generated parameters and clinical judgment to assess cardiac function for the purposes of immediate safety concerns. 8.1.5 Vital Sign Measurements Vital signs include: respiratory rate, oral temperature, 60 -second pulse readings, blood pressure, body weight and height (height only at V1, screening) , waist circumference and BMI . Vital signs are always taken after conducting the ECGs, as applicable, and prior to any other assessments, including needle sticks for laboratory or pharmacokinetic samples, scheduled for the same visit. At V1, V2, V8, and V9 vital signs include 3 -positional blood pressure readings (after at least 10 minutes in the supine position, after approximately 1 minute sitting, immediately upon standing, and after approximately 3 minutes standing). Pulse will be measured by counting pulse over 60 seconds. Height will be measured only at screening. Body weight will be measured at all scheduled visits through Visit 9 (Day 5 7). Each patient’s BMI will be calculated before Day 1 to ensure that the patient meets the BMI inclusion criterion. Vitals sign measurements should also be collected, if feasible, at the time of an AE such as vertigo, dizziness, fall, or any sign or symptom that might indicate a fall in blood pressure."

Confidential 35 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 8.1.6 Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview The major clinical criterion for inclusion in the study is that the patient be diagnosed with Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder , meeting the DSM -5 criteria. The methodology for confirming this diagnosis is the M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview 7.0 .2 (8/8/16 version) by Dr. David V. Sheehan . The M.I.N.I. is a well -validated clinical tool (Sheehan et al., 1998). It will be used in this study at screening only to confirm the diagnosis of Bipolar Depression in patients evaluated for inclusion in the study. It will be completed by the investigato r or an expert site -based rater approved by the sponsor. 8.1.7 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS is a questionnaire developed and validated by Kelly Posner and colleagues (2011) for the assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior. Several versions have been developed including the “ baseline ” and “ screening” versions and a combined “ baseline /screening” version of the scale which assesses suicidal ideation and behavior in a patient’s lifetime and during a predefined time period. This version can assess a patient’s lifetime suicidality as well as eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. A separate “Since Last Visit” version of the scale has been developed which is used to assess suicidality since the patient’s last visit. This version is meant to assess patients who have completed at least 1 initial C -SSRS assessment, and should be used in every subsequent visit. The “Since Last Visit” version of the C - SSRS addresses any suicidal thoughts or b ehaviors the patient may have had since th e last time the C -SSRS was administered. The C -SSRS will be administered by the investigator or an expert site -based rater , as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A) . At screenin g, a patient will not be eligible if he or she reports suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS within 6 months prior to screening or any suicidal behavior in the last 2 years prior to screening, as indicated by any “yes” answers on the suicidal behavior section of the C -SSRS. 8.1.8 Young Mania Rating Scale The YMRS is an 11 -item, clinician -administered mania rating scale with established reliability, validity, and sensitivity that was designed to assess the severity of manic symptoms (Young et al 1978). Four of the Y MRS items are rated on a 0 to 8 scale, with the remaining 7 items rated on a 0 to 4 scale. The total score is appropriate both for assessing baseline severity of manic symptoms and for assessing treatment -emergent manic symptoms in patients with Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorder with Depression . It will"

The CGI -BP-S is a standardized assessment tool that a clinician can use to rate the severity of illness, change over time, a nd efficacy of medication, taking into account the patient’s clinical condition and the severity of side effects. The CGI-BP-S is used to document the clinician’s impression of the patient’s current illness state; it will be used in this study at screenin g (as a criterion for inclusion or exclusion) and throughout the study as a measure of efficacy . Scores on the CGI -BP-S range from 1 (not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill). A CGI -BP-S assessment will be completed at screening by the investi gator or another ITI -approved expert site -based rater according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) . 8.2 Efficacy Assessments and Procedures 8.2.1 MADRS The MADRS is a 10-item checklist designed to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms (Montgomery and Åsberg, 1979) . Individual items are rated by the investigator (or another ITI -approved expert site -based rater) according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) on a scale of 0 to 6 in which a score of 6 represents the most severe symptoms for each item assessed. The total score ranges from 0 to 60. Remission of Depression based on the MADRS is generally defined as a patient with a MADRS total score of ≤12 at end point. A “responder” on the MADRS is defined as a ≥50% reduction from Baseline in total MADRS score at endpoint. The total score on the MADRS at screening is a major criterion for inclusion in the study, as well as the primary outcome measure for the st udy."

The items assessed include physical health, mood, work, household activities, social relationships, family relati onships, leisure time activities, ability to function in daily life, sexual drive/interest/performance, economic status, living/housing situation, ability to get around physically without feeling dizzy or unsteady or falling, vision in terms of ability to do work or hobbies, and overall sense of well -being that are summed to provide a raw total score ranging from 14 to 70. There are an additional 2 stand -alone items (1 for medication satisfaction and the other for overall life satisfaction). The total raw score is converted to a percent score. The Q -LES-Q-SF will be administered according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) . 8.3 Patient Placebo Questionnaire and Training : A brief placebo response questionnaire will be administered to assess the patient’s perception of likelihood their symptoms will improve as well as their perception at the end of the study whether they received placebo or active investigational drug. A brief training module will be provided describing placebo response at baseli ne. 8.4 Safety and Tolerability Assessments All patients who receive study treatment will be evaluated for safety. Safety assessments will include incidence of AEs, suicidality assessment by the C-SSRS, mania assessment by the YMRS, movement disorder assessme nt by the AIMS, BARS and SAS, clinical laboratory evaluations, ECG evaluations, vital sign measurements, and physical examination and neurological findings according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) . 8.5 Laboratory Procedures/Evaluations 8.5.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Blood and urine samples collected from patients will be forwarded to a central laboratory for analysis.

Details of the YMRS are presented in Section 8.1.8 . 9.1.3 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale The AIMS (Guy 1976) m easures facial and oral movements, extremity movements, and trunk movements. Seven items are rated on a scale from none (0) to severe (4). A score of “mild” (2) in 2 or more categories or a score of “moderate” or “severe” in any 1 category results in a p ositive AIMS score (i.e., the scores are not averaged). Additionally, overall severity is scored on the basis of severity of abnormal movements and incapacitation due to abnormal movements. The patient’s awareness of and distress caused by the abnormal m ovements are also noted. The AIMS is to be completed at baseline and periodically throughout the study according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) . 9.1.4 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale The BARS is a rating scale for drug -induced akathisia developed by Barnes ( 1989). It includes the rating of observable restless movements, the subjective awareness of restlessness, and the distress associated with the akathisia. There is also a global rating for severity. The scale is completed by the investigator or an expert site-based rater after a standard examination. Objective akathisia, subjective awareness and subjective distress are rated on a 4 -point scale from 0 to 3, yielding a total score from 0 to 9. The Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia is rated separatel y, on a 5 -point scale from 0 to 4. The BARS is to be completed at baseline and periodically throughout the study according to Appendix A (Schedule of Events) . 9.1.5 Simpson -Angus Scale The SAS is a measure of extrapyramidal side effects (Simpson and Angus 197 0). Ten items including rating gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head rotation, glabella tap, tremor, and salivation are rated on a scale from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme in severity). The SAS should be conducted by the"

This can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , without any judgment of causality. The AE may be: • A new illness; • A worsening sign or symptom of the condition under treatment, or of a concomitant illness; • An effect of the study medication, including comparator; or • A combination of 2 or more of these factors. No causal relationship with the study med ication or with the clinical study itself is implied by the use of the term AE. Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE. Planned surgical measures, if permitted by the clinical study protocol and the conditions leading to those measures are not AEs. All AEs fall into the categories of “nonserious” or “serious ” (Section 9.1.4)."

Confidential 46 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 9.1.11 Serious Adverse Events 9.1.11.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death; • Is life threatening; • Requires hospitalization or prolongation in existing hospitalization; • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the patient is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused de ath if it were more severe. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious. Some important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered SAEs when they may jeopardize the patient such that medical or surgical intervention is needed to prevent 1 of the outcomes previously listed. Examples of such medical events include intensive emergency treatment for an allergic reaction, blood dyscrasias or convul sions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Visits to urgent care or emergency room facilities may not warrant reporting as SAEs unless the patient is admitted to the hospital or the event m eets other “serious” criteria. Events that are not clearly meeting “serious” criteria can be discussed on a case by case basis with the Medical Monitor to help the investigator determine whether the event meets “serious” criteria. If either the sponsor or principal investigator believes that any event is serious, the event must be considered and evaluated by the sponsor for possible expedited reporting. Clarification of the difference between ""serious"" and ""severe"" : The term “severe” is often used to desc ribe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually"

Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 9.2 Time P eriod and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up For the purposes of this study, the period of observation extends from the time the patient gives his study -specific informed consent until the end of study procedures are completed. If the investigator detects an SAE in a study patient after the end of the period of observation and considers the event possibly related to prior study treatment, he or she should contact the sponsor to determine how the AE should be documented and reported. All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed to satisfactory resolution, until the investigator deems the event to be chronic or not clinically significant, or until the patient is considered to be stable. A follow -up telephone call will be performed for those patients with an ongoing AE which the investigator believes to be not related to study treatment administration. A follow -up visit to the study site may occur for those patients with an ongoing AE which the investigator believes to be possibly related to study treatment administration. All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page in the eCRF and followed until they are resolved or stable, or judged by the investigator to be not clinically significant. 9.3 Characteristics of a n Adverse Even t 9.3.1 Relationship to Study Intervention By definition, any AE that starts before the first dose of study treatment administration is considered to be “unrelated.” The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study treatment and the AE according to Appendix A (Schedule of E vents) . One of the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the following definitions and all contributing factors."

Confidential 48 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 Table 9-1 Causality Categories Category Definition Definitely related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment (dechallenge1) should be clinically plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory rechallenge2 procedure if necessary. Probably related A clinic al event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdraw al (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. Possibly related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the treatment . Information on treatment withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Unlikely to be related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in w hich other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. Unrelated A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship with treatment administration. May have negative dechallenge and rechallenge information. Typically, explained by extraneous factors (e.g., concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or chemicals). 1 Dechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an adverse event (AE) is discontinued. If the symptoms of the AE disappear partially or completely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation, this is termed a positive dechallenge. If the symptoms continue despite withdrawal of the drug, this is termed a negative dechallenge. Note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug -relatedness clearly exists (e.g., bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, tardive dyskinesia). 2 Rechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past is readministered to that patient. If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a positive rechallenge. If the AE does not recur, this is termed a negative rechallenge. 9.3.2 Expectedness of SAEs The sponsor or designee will be responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected or unexpected. An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature,"

Life threatening Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical i ntervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable. When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensity for the event should be noted for that day. Any change in intensity of signs and symptoms over a number of days will be captured by recording a new AE, with the amended intensity grade and the date (and time, if known) of the change. 9.4 Reporting Procedures All AEs reported or observed during the study will be collected and recorded on the AE page of the eCRF for each patient from the date the ICF was signed u ntil the end of their participation in the study, i.e., the patient has discontinued or completed the study. Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the patient, or discovered by the study staff during physical examinations or by asking an open, non-leading question such as, “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?” All AEs and any required remedial action will be recorded. The nature of the AE, date (and time, if known) of the AE onset, date (and time, if known) of the AE outcome to date, severity, and action taken for the AE will be documented together with the investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship to study treatment and/or study procedure."

In the latter case, the condition, disease or syn drome should be named rather than each individual symptom. The AEs will subsequently be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 9.4.1 Unanticipated Problem Reporting to IRB /IEC Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. OHRP recommends that investigators include the following information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB /IEC: • appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name, and the IRB /IEC project number; • a detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome; • an explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem; • a description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are pr oposed in response to the unanticipated problem. To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB/IEC according to institutional policy.

Confidential 62 ITI-007-404 Protocol Amendment v 1.3 November 5, 2018 will be flagged in data listings and tabulated. Shift tables will be prepared for pre-specified safety measures, such as laboratory parameters , ECG and weight . Parameters collected in duplicate or triplicate will be analyzed as an average of the measures for the relevant time point, including baseline. Reported AE terms will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be defined as any AEs, r egardless of the relationship to study drug, that occur or worsen in intensity after the first dose of study drug and on or before the date of last dose of study drug plus one day . Treatment -related TEAEs will be defined as any TEAEs that are considered by the investigator to be either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug. If relationship to study drug is missing, the TEAE will be considered as treatment - related. Severity of TEAEs will also be determined by the Investigator . All TEAEs, treatment -related TEAEs, and serious TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, primary system organ class categories, and preferred terms. If a patient reports the same TEAE more than once within the same system organ class a nd preferred term, the event with the worst -case relationship to study drug will be used in the corresponding relationship summaries. Similarly, if a patient reports a TEAE more than once within the same system organ class and preferred term, the event wi th the worst case severity will be used in the corresponding severity summaries . Patients who discontinue study or study drug d ue to AEs will be listed and summarized by system organ class and preferred term . TEAEs will be categorized to monitor signals o f potential abuse of ITI -007 and the number and percentage of patients with at least one abuse -related TEAE will be summarized by the pre -specified categories. Additional summaries of TEAEs will be presented as deemed necessary and will be specified in the SAP. Laboratory assessments, including hematology and chemistry, vital signs and ECGs, will be listed and summarized by treatment group and visit. Summaries may include actual and change from baseline, incidence of abnormal values accordi ng to normal range criteria, shift from baseline to each visit according to markedly abnormal criteria, and listing of patients meeting certain abnormal criteria. Pre -specified chemistry results, including but not limited to blood levels of fasting gluco se, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin will be evaluated for whether there is a difference between ITI - 007 and placebo. Any comparison between the treatment groups will be considered exploratory."
