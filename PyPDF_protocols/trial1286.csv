It is characterized by sharply demarcated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red, and scaly. The scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, hands, and feet are commonly affected sites. About 80% of affected patients complain of pruritus ( Gottlieb, 1998) . The psoriatic appearance of the skin is initiated by an antigen presenting cell (APC) – T-cell interaction leading to the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines (Nestle, 2009). In time, this leads to an increased rate of epidermal proliferation with impaired differentiation of keratinocytes, resulting in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum. Dermal capillaries become tortuous and dilated, and there is infiltration of both epidermis and dermis with immunologically active cells (Lowes, 2007). Psoriasis is a disease that requires long -term treatment, ideally with effective agents that offer convenient dosing a nd a low incidence of adverse events. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends use of topical treatments for patients with localized disease; however, their effectiveness is limited by the inconvenience associated with application and low adherence r ates (Menter, 2008 ). Moderate psoriasis is often inadequately treated and there remains an unmet medical need for an effective convenient agent that is well tolerated and less immunosuppressive than the currently available treatment options (Armstrong, 2013). While the Japanese Phase 2b study (PSOR -011) with apremilast in psoriasis was conducted in subjects with moderate to severe disease, the mean Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) was 22 and the mean body surface area ( BSA ) was 30%. Over 30% of subjects had a static Physician ’s Global Assessment ( sPGA) of ≥ 4 or a PASI > 20 in PSOR-011, with 60% or more of the subjects having a BSA involvement of > 20%. In addition, 32.3% of subjects were treated with previous conventional systemic therapy and 3.5% were treated with prior biologics. This would suggest that there was a high proportion of subjects with severe disease in this study (Ohtsuki, 2017) . This Phase 3B study is designed to focus on the efficacy and safety of apremilast added to topicals in subjects with plaque psoriasis who have not responded adequately to topical therapies. A significant proportion of patients with mild or moderate plaque psoriasis still have active disease despite treatment with topical therapies. Topical treatments, although safe and effectiv e, are limited by inconvenience and poor adherence. This study would generate data to help understand the impact of apremilast when added to background topical therapy, which is an important scientific data gap in Japan. In addition, the usage of topical therapies would also be collected to help understand if the addition of apremilast to the therapeutic regimen for plaque psoriasis could reduce the usage of topical therapies."

Secondary Objective(s) The secondary objectives of the study are: • To assess the efficacy of the combination of apremilast plus topical therapies for the treatment of subjects with scalp psoriasis who have not achieved an adequate response with topicals alone. • To assess the impact on quality of life for the combination of apremilast plus topical therapies for the treatment of subjects with plaque psoriasis who have not achieved an adequate response with topicals alone. Study Design This is a Phase 3B , multi- center, open- label, single arm study of the efficacy and safety of the combination of apremilast and topical therapy in subjects with plaque psoriasis that have not responded adequately to topical treatments alone. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in Japan. After a 5 -day titration, subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily (BID) for 32 weeks in addition to their existing topical therapy. Beginning at Week 16, subjects will be permitted to decrease the use of topical therapy at their discretion. The study will consist of four phases : • Screening Phase – Week -4 ± 1 week • Open -label Combination Therapy Phase – Weeks 0 to 16 Subje cts will receive treatment with − apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID, AND − existing topical therapy • Open -label Combination Therapy Phase with Optional Topical Reduction – Weeks 16 to 32 − All subjects will continue to receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID AND existing topical therapy − Subjects will be permitted to decrease the use of topical therapy at their own discretion • Post- treatment Observational Follow -up Phase – Week 36"

Confidential and Proprietary 7 Protocol CC -10004 -PSOR -023 Amendment1 Final: 28 Apr 2020 − Four-week post- treatment observational follow-up phase for all subjects who complete the study or discontinue from the study early . Subjects who transition to commercial supply of apremilast after the week 32 visit are not required to attend the post- treatment observational follo w-up visit. The study will be conducted in compliance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) . Study Population Approximately 150 subjects with plaque psoriasis who have not achieved an adequate response from top ical treatment alone (according to Investigator’ s discretion) will be enrolled in the study across multiple centers in Japan. Length of Study The study is designed as a 32- week study. Visits will be scheduled at Screening (Week -4 ± 1), Week 0 (Baseline), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32. The End of Trial is defined as either the date of the last visit of the last subject to complete the study, or the date of receipt of the last data point from the last subject that is required for primary, secondary, and/or exploratory a nalysis, as pre-specified in the protocol, whichever is the later date. Study Treatmen ts During Week 0 (Days 1 to 7), subjects will be dispensed blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets for the dose titration. The treatment schema for dose titration at Baseline is shown in Table 4. All subjects will maintain this dosing through Week 32. Apremilast tablets will be taken orally twice daily (BID) , approximately 12 hours apart, through the last treatment visit. Overview of Key Efficacy Assessments Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects that achieve static Physicians Global Assessment score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at week 16 . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints • Scalp Physicians Global Assessment (ScPGA) • Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) • Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) Version II Exploratory Endpoints"

It will support a 95% confidence interval with at least 80% probability that the length of the interval is within 13%, assuming the expected response rate of 15% [8.5% -21.5%] at Week 16 and allows for a 10% discontinuation rate prior to week 16. The sample size calculation is based on nQuery software version 7.0, and the 80% probability supporting the margin of error is based on simulation results. The primar y analysis for the primary endpoint will be analyzed using descriptive statistics which involve the sample size, the number of responders, point estimate of proportion of responders along with the associated two -sided 95% confidence intervals. All reasonable attempts will be made to prevent missing data from occurring in this study, especially through Week 16. However, in the case of missing data at Week 16, multiple imputation (MI) method will be incorporated into the primary analysis. The aim of the multiple imputation approach is to incorporate a representative random sample in place of the missing data such that unbiased estimation can be made."

Disease Background Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory immunologic disorder which manifests primarily in the skin. It is characterized by sharply demarcated areas of affected skin which appear thickened, red, and scaly. The scalp, elbows, knees, lower back, hands, a nd feet are commonly affected sites. About 80% of affected subjects complain of pruritus ( Gottlieb, 1998) . The psoriatic appearance of the skin is initiated by an antigen presenting cell (APC) – T-cell interaction leadin g to the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines (Nestle, 2009) . In time, this leads to an increased rate of epidermal proliferation with impaired differentiation of keratinocytes, resulting in a thickened epidermis covered by a thickened, parakeratotic stratum corneum. Dermal capillaries become tortuous and dilated, and there is infiltration of both epidermis and dermis with immunologically active cells (Lowes, 2007). Psoriasis is a chr onic disease that requires long -term treatment, ideally with effective agents that offer convenient dosing and a low incidence of adverse events. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends use of t opical treatments for subjects with localized disease and recognizes that the systemic options for subjects with more severe psoriasis are limited by potential risks of organ toxicities and immunosuppression ( Menter, 2008 ). Mild or m oderate psoriasis is often treated with topical therapy only. However, a significant proportion of subjects with mild or moderate plaque psoriasis still have active disease despite treatment with topical therapies. Topical treatments, although safe and effective, are limited by inconvenience and poor adherence. Therefore, there remains an unmet medical need for an effective convenient agent that is well tolerated and less immunosuppressive than the currently available treatment options (Armstrong, 2013) . 1.2. Study Drug Apremilast ( CC-10004) is a specific phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor ( Schafer, 2010) under development for use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. PDE4 is one of the major phosphodiesterases expressed in leukocytes. PDE4 inhibition by apremilast elevates cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in immune cells, which in turn down- regulates the inflammatory response by reducing the expression of pro- inflammatory mediators such as TNF -α, IL -23, IL -17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the production of anti- inflammatory mediators. In completed Phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis, treatment with apremilast wa s associated w ith statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies , apremilast ( OTEZLA ) is approved in the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, and Latin America for both moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis . A Phase 2B study (PSOR-011) was conducted in Japan in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis , and also included subjects with active psoriatic arthritis, which supported the approval of apremilast for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in Japan."

Further studies within the approved indications of plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are also ongoing. Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information concerning the available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event profile of the investigational product ( IP). 1.3. Rationale 1.3.1. Study Rationale and P urpose While the Japanese Phas e 2b study (PSOR-011) with apremilast in psoriasis was conducted in subjects with moderate to severe disease, the mean Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) was 22 and the mean BSA was 30%. Over 30% of subjects had a static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) of ≥ 4 or a PASI > 20 in PSOR-011, with 60% or more of the subjects having a BSA involvement of > 20%. In addition, 32.3% of subjects were treated with previous conventional systemic therapy and 3.5% were treated with prior biologics. This would suggest that there was a high proportion of subjects with severe disease in this study. This Phase 3B study is desig ned with a specific focus on the efficacy and safety of apremilast added to to picals in subjects with plaque psoriasis who have not responded adequately to topical therapies. A significant proportion of subjects with mild or moderate plaque psoriasis still have active disease despite treatment with topical therapies. Topical treatments, although safe and effective, are limited by inconvenience and poor adherence. This study would generate data to help understand the impact of apremilast when added to background topical therapy, which is an important scientific data gap in J apan. In addition, the usage of topical therapies would also be collected to help understand if the addition of apremilast to the therapeutic regimen for plaque psoriasis could reduce the usage of topical therapies. 1.3.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design This will be a multi- center, open -label, single- arm study o f the efficacy and safety of apremilast in combination with existing topical therapy in subjects who have not achieved an adequate response to topical therapy alone. A placebo control is not necessary because apremilast will be added to a therapy which is not adequately controlling the disease. In addition, the proportion of subjects that achieve sPGA 0 or 1 with placebo is historically low (~5%), reducing the need for a placebo control. Finally, a 32 week study is sufficient to assess the efficacy and s afety of apremilast in combination with topical therapy and the impact of apremilast on the use of topical therapy. 1.3.3. Rationale for C hoice of Combination Compounds Subjects will be required to remain on their existing topical therapy through the Open -label C ombination Therapy Phase (W eeks 0 to 16). After Week 16, subject s may decrease or discontinue the use of topical therapies at their discretion."

Study Design This is a Phase 3B multi- center, open -label, single -arm study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast, in subjects with plaque psoriasis that is not adequately controlled by topical therapy. Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 30 sites in Japan. After a 5 -day titration, subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily (BID) for 32 weeks in addition to their existing topical therapy. Beginning at Week 16, subjects will be permitted to decrease the use of topical therapy at their discretion. The study will consist of four phases: • Screening Phase – Week -4 ± 1 week • Open -label Combination Therapy Phase – Weeks 0 to 16 Subjects will receive treatment with : − apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID, AND − existing topical therapy • Open -label Combination Therapy Phase with Optional Topical Reduction – Weeks 16 to 32 − All subjects will continue to receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally BID AND existing topical therapy − Subjects will be permitted to decrease the use of topical therapy at their own discretion • Post- treatment Observational Follow -up Phase − Four- week Post- treatment Observational F ollow-up Phase for all subjects who complete the study or discontinue from the s tudy early. Subjects who transition to commercial supply of apremilast after the week 32 visit are not required to attend the post- treatment observational follow -up visit. The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/ Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements."

Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) The sPGA is the assessment by the Investigator of the overall disease severity at the time of evaluation. The National Psoriasis Foundation Psoriasis Score version of a static PGA is calculated by averaging the total body erythema, induration, and desquamation scores. Erythema (E), induration (I), and desquamation (D) are scored on a 5- point scale, ranging from 0 (clear ) to 4 (severe). See Appendix B for grading criteria. 6.4.2. Body Surface Area (BSA) BSA is a measurement of involved skin. The overall BSA affected by psoriasis is estimated based on the palm area of the subject ’s hand, which equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area. 6.4.3. Scalp Physicians Global Assessment The ScPGA will assess sc alp involvement, if present at Baseline. See Appendix C for grading criteria. The 5 -point ScPGA scale ranges from 0 (clear), 1 ( almost clear ), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), to 4 (severe). 6.4.4. Pruritus VAS The Pruritus V AS assessment will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events. The subject will be asked to place a vertical stroke on a 100 mm V AS on which the left -hand boundary represents no itch, and the right -hand boundary represents itch as severe as can be imagined. The distance from the mark to the left -hand boundary will be recorded. See Appendix D for grading criteria. 6.4.5. Nail Assessments/Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) The number of fingers with psoriasis nail involvement will be counted, if present at Baseline. The NAPSI will assess one target thu mb nail or fingernail representing the worst nail psoriasis involvem ent at Baseline. See Appendix E for grading criteria. 6.4.6. Psori asis Area Severity Index (PASI) The PASI is a measure of psoriatic disease severity taking into account qualitative lesion characteristics (erythema, thickness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined anatomical regions. The PASI is a validated instrument that has become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. The PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity (Frederiksson, 1978). Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of erythema, thickness, and scaling scores) is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then multiplied by a constant. These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. See Appendix F for grading criteria."

DLQI The DLQI (Finlay, 1994 ) will be assessed by the subject upon arrival at the site before any other procedures or assessments are performed. The instrument contains 10 items pertaining to the subject’s skin. With the exception of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four-point scale, ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at All.” Item Number 7 is a multi- part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the subject’s skin prevented them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternatives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all.” The DLQI total score has a possible range from 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst quality of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score. The developers suggest that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work/school, personal relationships, and treatment. Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, and personal relationships) range from 0 to 6; scores for two of the subscales (work/school and treatment) range from 0 to 3. Higher scores correspond to poorer quali ty of life. See Appendix G for grading criteria. 6.4.8. Shiratori’s Pruritus Severity Score Shiratori’s Pruritus Severity Score is a pruritus severity assessment tool used in Japan. Symptom severity is assessed for daytime and n ighttime symptoms, separately, on a 5 -point scale (0, No Symptoms; 1, Minimal; 2, Mild; 3, Moderate; 4, Severe). See Appendix H for grading criteria. 6.4.9. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication Version II The TSQM version II is a n 11-question self -administrated instrument to understand a subject ’s satisfaction on the current therapy (Atkinson, 2005). See Appendix I for questionnaire. 6.4.10. Patient Benefit Index (PBI) The PBI is a validated patient -reported instrument to assess patient-relevant benefits of psoriasis treatment (Feuerhahn, 2012) . Prior to starting therapy, subjects are asked to assess their treatment expectations by completing the Patient Needs Questionnaire (PNQ) (See Appendix J ). After a period of treatment, subjects are then asked to assess the benefits of treatment by completing the Patient Be nefit Questionnaire (PBQ) (See Appendix K ). The Patient Benefit Index represents the subject benefits realized as a function of most important subject needs. The PBI score ranges from 0 (no benefit) to 4 (maximum benefit). 6.4.11. Photographs Photographs will be collected only in subjects who consent, and will be considered as supportive evidence of efficacy, but these will not be addressed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) or included in the clinical study report. Photographs will be taken of a ffected locations of plaque psoriasis at Weeks 0, 16, and 32. Appropriate protective mechanisms shall be implemented to ensure that the photographs do not contain any subject -specific identifiers (such as tattoos, scars, etc) when shared with the Sponsor."

Subjects will record the quantity of topical medication u sed compared to the previous day as “Decreased”, “No change”, or “Increased”. The subject diary will be provided to subjects at the baseline visit and subjects will be instructed to bring the diary to visits 3 through 8 (or Early Termination visit). 6.5. Safety Assessments In addition to daily safety monitoring conducted by Investigators and individual study personnel, AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations and laboratory findings will be reviewed by the study team. The review follows the Council for International Organizations for Medical Sciences, Working Group VI (CIOMS VI) recommendations. The study will be conducted in compliance with the ICH of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/GCP and applicable regulator y requirements. The following assessments will be conducted as outlined in Table 3, Table of Events. 6.5.1. Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential A serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity o f ≤ 15 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP subjects at Screening and the Week 32 Visit (or at the Early Termination Visit for subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study). Urine pregnancy test will be performed on all FCBP subjects at the Baseline Vis it, prior to enrollment. A urine pregnancy test kit will be provided by the central laboratory. Pregnancy tests should be performed if the FCBP subject has missed a menstrual period or the contraception method has changed. 6.5.2. Vital Signs, Height and Weight Vital signs, including temperature, pulse, and seated blood pressure, will be taken during the visits indicated in Table 3 , Table of Events. Height will be measured and recorded at Screening;"

Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed as indicated in Table 3 , Table of Events. These include complete blood count with differential, including red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, RBC morphology, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count (with differential), platelet count and serum chemistries including sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin (total and direct), aspartate aminotransferase/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alanine aminotransferase/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase, gamma -glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase. A lipid panel will be included in the standard chemistry panel. 6.5.4. Adverse Events All subjects will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, physical examination findings, or other appropriate tests and procedures. All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent to 28 days after the last dose of IP. Adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be recorded on the AE page of the electronic case report form (eCRF) and in the subject ’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigator’ s knowledge of the event) by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form. Details of AE reporting can be found in Section 10 of the protocol. It should be noted that worsening of a subject’ s psoriasis should be considered as worsening of disease under study and should not be captured as an adverse event."

Method of Treatment Assignment After the informed consent is signed, subjects will be assigned a subject identification number using a centralized interactive web response system (IWRS ). Designated study personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, coded identification numbers, which give them authorization to call into the IWRS . The system will present a menu of questions by which the study personnel will identify the subject and confirm eligibility. When all questions have been answered, the IWRS will assign an enrollment number. Confirmation of the enrollment will be sent electronically to the investigational site, Amgen and/or its representative. 7.4. Packaging and Labeling The label(s) for IP will include S ponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medicatio n identification/kit number, dosing instructions, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory statements as applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulations. All IP tablets will b e supplied by Amgen .

Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal The I nvestigator, or designee, is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of oral IP received, and comparing it with the accompanying IP shipping order/packing list. The I nvestigator, or designee, will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date it, retain a copy in the study file, and record the information in the IRT. Investigational product will be stored per the storage conditions identified on drug label. At the study site, all IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access. Amgen (or designee) will review with the Investigator and relevant site personnel the process for investigational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilities for the site versus Amgen (or designee). 7.6. Investigational Product Compliance Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects prior to dispensing the IP in tablet form. Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events, Table 3. The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused medication, to the study site at each visit for tablet counts and reconciliation. At each study visit, subjects will be asked whether they have taken their IP as instructed. Any problems with IP compliance will be reviewed with the subject. If a subject misses 4 or more consecutive days of dosing, Amgen should be contacted to decide whether dosing should resume or whether the subject should be terminated from the Treatment Phase of the study, and enter into the Post- treatment Observational Follow -up Phase. Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days of dosing or taking less than 75% of the doses between study visits) should be discussed with Amgen . Compliance is defined as taking between 75% and 120% of dispensed IP. 7.7. Overdose Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of 4 or more 30 mg apremilast tablets in any 24 -hour period, whether by accident or intentionally. On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 times during any 24-hour period. Adverse Events associated with an overdose must be collected on the Adverse Events page of the electronic cas e report form (eCRF ) (see Section 10.1) for all overdosed subjects, but the overdose itself is not considered an AE."

CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ONS AND PROCEDURES 8.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures Subjects must remain on their existing topical therapy from at least 4 weeks prior to baseline through week 16 of the study. Principal Investigator or Sub- investigator will instruct subjects to continue to apply their existing topical therapy w ithout a change in quantity or frequency through week 16. After week 16, subjects are permitted to decrease the use of their existing topical therapy, in consultation with the principal Investig ator or S ub-investigator. Subjects may take any medication th at is not restricted by the protocol and would not be expected to interfere with the conduct of the study or affect assessments. Chronic medication should be dosed on a stable regimen. All medications (prescription and non-prescription), treatments, and t herapies taken by the subject from signing the informed consent throughout their entire participation in the study, including those initiated prior to signing the informed consent and continued through the start of the study, must be recorded on the subject’s source document and on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The dose, unit, frequency, route, indication, the date the medication was started, and the date the medication was stopped (if not ongoing) must be recorded. The recording of any permitted topical medications taken for psoriasis should also include the area of the body to which they are applied. During the study, the initiation of new concomitant medications or a change of existing concomitant medications may potentially indicate the presence of a new adverse event or the worsening of an existing condition. If appropriate, such events should be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Procedures The following psoriasis medications cannot be administered for the duration of the study. • Systemic therapy − Systemic therapy including but not limited to cyclosporine, corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids, mycophenolate, thioguanine, hydroxyurea, sirolimus, sulfasalazine, azathioprine, fumaric acid esters • Phototherapy − Ultraviolet light B or psoralens and long- wave ultraviolet radiation • Biologic agents, including: − Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, or certolizumab pegol − Ustekinumab − Secukinumab, ixekizumab, or brodalumab − Guselkumab, risankizumab, or tildrakizumab • Use of any investigational drug or device"

Overview The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of apremilast plus topical therapies for the treatment of subjects with plaque psoriasis who have not achieved an adequate response with topicals alone. 9.2. Study Population Definitions The safety p opulation will consist of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication (IP). The Enrolled population will consist of all subjects who receive a IWRS identification number and are enrolled into the study. This will be the population for a ll efficacy analyses. The per protocol (PP) population will consist of all subjects included in the enrolled population who have both baseline sPGA and at least one post-baseline sPGA evaluation and no important protocol deviations. 9.3. Sample Size and Power C onsiderations The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects who achieve a static Physicians Global Assessment (sPGA) score of 0 or 1 at Week 16, in subjects on combined therapy of apremilast and topicals. Because there is no control arm for the study, if the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval ( CI) of the observed response rate is above 8% ( ie, the upper bound of 95% CI of the response rate from the placebo group in pooled Phase III studies, namely, PSOR- 008 and PSOR-009), one can safely conclude that the treatment effect from the combined therapy is real. A sample size of 150 subjects will support a 95% confidence interval (CI) with at least 80% probability that the length of the interval is within 13%, assuming the expected response rate of 15% [8.5% to 21.5%] (conservatively estimated based on data of Phase III clinical trials ). This sample size allows for a 10% discontinuation rate prior to week 16. The sample size calculation is based on nQuery software version 7.0, and the 80% probability supporting the margin of error is based on simulation results. 9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics Subjects’ age, height, weight, waist circumference, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics, while gender, race, and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabulations. The disease characteristics at baseline will also be summarized using appropria te descriptive statistics. Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulations by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. 9.5. Subject Disposition The distribution of enrollment by site will be provided. Subject disposition (analysis population allocation, entered, completed, discontinued, along with primary reason for discontinuation) will be summarized using frequency and pe rcent for the Open -label Combination Therapy Phase (Week 0 to 16) and for the Open -label Combination Therapy Phase with Optional Topical"

Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations. 9.6. Efficacy Analysis No statistical comparisons will be made for this single -arm study. 9.6.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects that achieve sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16. It will be analyzed using the E nrolled population. In addition, a supplemental analysis will be performed using the PP population. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using descriptive statistics which involve the sample size, the number of responders, point estimate of proportion of responders along with the associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI) . All reasonable attempts will be made to prevent missin g data from occurring in this study, especially through Week 16. However, in the case of missing data at Week 16, multiple imputation method will be incorporated into the primary analysis. The aim of the multiple imputation approach is to incorporate a representative random sample in place of the missing data such that an unbiased estimation can be made. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method and the non-responder imputation method. 9.6.2. Secondary and Exploratory E fficacy Endpoints The secondary and explorator y efficacy endpoints w ill be anal yzed based on the Enrolled population. The continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) as the primary method . The MMRM model will use the change from baseline as the response variable and include visit time as a fixed effect, and the baseline value as a covariate. Within -group least-squares means and the associated standard errors and two-sided 95% CIs will be derived from the MMRM model. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted using LOCF method to impute the missing data. For discrete endpoints, similar analysis conducted for the primary endpoint will be performed for the secondary and exploratory endpoints. 9.7. Safety Analysis The safety analyses will be performed using the Safety populations as defined in Section 9.2. Adverse events will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) classification system. Adverse events will be tabulated by study phase (Open -label Combination Therapy Phase [ Week 0 to 16] and for the Open -label Combination Therapy Phase with Optional Topical Reduction Phase [ Week 16 to 32]) . All treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to IP. Adverse events leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment and serious AEs will also be summarized and listed separately."

Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including laboratory test value s (as specified by the criteria in Section 10.3), regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a pre- existing condition) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose e CRF (see Section 7.7 for definition of overdose). Any sequela of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on the paper SAE report form and on the AE e CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the cause of the event on the paper SAE report form and AE CRF but should not be reported as an SAE itself. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for apremilast overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, pathological, radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. All AEs (non-serious and serious) will be recorded by the Investigator from the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP as well as t hose SAEs made known to the I nvestigator at any time following the protocol- required reporting period or after end of study . Subjects who transition to commercial supply of apremilast after the week 32 visit are not required to attend the post- treatment observati onal follow-up visit. All adverse events (serious/non-serious) will be recorded on the CRF and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form (refer to Appendix O) by facsimile/email of the paper SAER Form directly to Amgen Global Patient Safety . 10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 10.2.1. Seriousnes s An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that:"

Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for: • a standard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of therapy administration will be reported as an SAE. • routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associ ated with any deterioration in condition. • the administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication. However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE. • a procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling). However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportabl e SAE. • hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical, practical, or social reasons, in absence of an AE. • a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be documented in the source document and the CRF. Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SAE. • an elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre -existing condition, unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. • emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above. If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form in English language (refer to Appendix O) must be completed and"

For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome. 10.2.2. Severity/Intensity For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity/ intensity of the event. Mild • Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only • Intervention not indicated • Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected • No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required Moderate • Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort • Local or noninvasive intervention indicated • More than minimal interference with ADLs but able to carry out daily social and functional activities. • Drug therapy may be required Severe (could be non -serious or serious) • Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain • Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention • Interference with ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest) • Drug therapy is required The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is not the same as “serious” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations."

Causality The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of the IP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is unlikely or remote, or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. Suspected: there is a reasonable poss ibility that the administration of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and the adverse event. Causality should be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available information. Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available. If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Amgen , please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, discontinuation, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant and/or additional treat ments were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE ). 10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality: • results in discontinuation from the study; • requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervention; or"

Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be document ed as a serious adverse event. If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an abnormal laboratory result ( eg, record thrombocytopenia rather than decreased platelets). 10.4. Pregnancy All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in either a female subject of childbearing potential or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events . 10.4.1. Females of Childb earing Potential – Collection of Pregnancy Information Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 28 days of the subject ’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events. IP is to be discontinued immediately. A female subject with suspected pregnancy may resume IP after a confirmed negative pregnancy test and consultation with the S ponsor. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Amgen Global Patient Safety , or designee, immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Notification Form, or approved equivalent form in English language (refer to Appendix O). The Pregnancy Notification Form in English language must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of learning of a subject ’s pregnancy. (Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws). After obtaining the female subject ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who becomes pregnant while taking IP through 28 days of IP. This information will be forwarded to Amgen Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow-up will be conducted 12 months after the birth of the child (if applicable). The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist or another appropriate healthcare professional for further evaluation. The I nvestigator will monitor the progress of the pregnancy of a female subject, and must notify Amgen Global Patient Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal ( eg, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Amgen Global Patient Safety via the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form in English language within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form in English language. All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Inve stigator suspects is related to the in-utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Amgen Global Patient safety"

Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 28 days after discontinuing IP, the information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form in English language. The form must be submitted to Amgen Global Patient Safety with 24 hours of the site ’s awareness of the pregnancy ( Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws). The investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional pregnancy information. After obtaining the female partner ’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant health information the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby and complete the pregnancy questionnaires. This information will be forwarded to Amgen Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child (if applicable).

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by Amgen or its authorized repr esentative for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to current GCP and SOPs . 15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification Amgen ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study. All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an I nvestigator s’ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a Amgen representative will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator. Monitoring will include on- site visits with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communications by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During monitoring visits, the facilities, investigational product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be inspected/reviewed by the Amgen representative in accordance with the Study Monitoring Plan. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verification that is a direct comparison of the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any resulting discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any nec essary corrections will be made directly to the eCRFs or via queries by the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study -specific monitoring plan. 15.2. Audits and Inspections In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Quality, Compliance & Audit, Learning & Performance exists within Amgen . Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with Amgen SOPs to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by IRB/IECs, regulatory authorities ( eg, PMDA, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and company authorized represen tatives.
