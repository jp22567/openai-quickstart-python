Placebo (placebo q3W for all 8 infusions). 2. Visit windows are ± 1 day for Weeks 1 and 4, ± 3 days for Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21, and ± 7 days for Week 24. 3. Subjects who are proptosis responders or non -responders who do not elect to participate in the open- label extension study will enter a 48 -week Follow -Up Period. Subjects who are responders at Week 24 but relapse during the Follow -Up Period may enter the open- label study and receive up to 8 infusions if they meet specified criteria. 4. Visit windows of ± 7 days. 5. Subjects who complete the Week 72 Visit will be contacted via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study conta ct. 65. Subjects will be contacted by phone/email the day following the first and second infusions for safety and tolerability assessments; phone/email contacts will also occur the day after any clinic visit where a subject experiences an infusion- related adverse event . 76. Subjects who are proptosis non-responders at Week 24 of the double- masked Treatment Period will be offered the option to enter an open -label extension study and receive up to 8 additional infusions of teprotumumab 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions all subsequent doses ). Inclusion Criteria : 10. Women of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause <2 years prior to Screening, non-therapy-induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to Screening, or not surgically sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and negative urine pregnancy tests at all protocol- specified timepoints (i.e., prior to each dose and through Week 48 of the Follow- Up Period); subjects who are sexually active with a non- vasectomized male partner must agree to use 2 reliable forms of contraception during the trial, one of which is recommended to be hormonal, such as an oral contraceptive. Hormonal contraception must be started at least one full cycle prior to Baseline and continue for 180 days after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective contraceptive methods (with a failure rate less than 1% per year), when used consistently and correctly, includes implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized partner. 11. Male subjects must be surgically sterile or , if sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential, must agree to use a barrier contraceptive method from Screening through 180 days after the last dose of study drug. Dose Regimen/Route of Administration: The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details). The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes). Subsequent infusions will be"

Duration of Treatment and Follow- up: Subjects who complete the Week 72 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instru ment provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement), CAS (7 -item scale), diplopia (measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity), and C linical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments). Statistical Analyses Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (analyzed hierarchically): 4. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the diplopia responder rate (percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > 0 in study eye who have a reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 5.4. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the GO- QoL questionnaire overall score. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Parameters : The primary analyses will be conducted in the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population. The analysis of the primary proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The analysis will use Cochran- Mant el-Haenszel (CMH) weighting to estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference . be a logistic regression with treatment group as the model effect . Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation wi ll be considered to be treatment failures (non -responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment Period will be considered to be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify randomization, tobacco use (non- user, user). Since tobacco use status (non user vs. user) is used to stratify the r andomization, it will be included as a categorical covariate . The difference in response rates , comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated Odds ratio comparing teprotumumab to placebo will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value. An analysis of risk difference with stratification by tobacco use (non- user vs. user) Logistic regression will also be used to analyze the 32 secondary categorical endpoints (overall responder rate, CAS [value of 0 or 1] and diplopia responder rate) . For the analysis of proptosis as a continuous secondary endpoint and GO-QoL, a Mixed- Model Repeated -Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the individual change fro m baseline"

The main focus of the analysis will be to test the treatment differences at Week 24, with the main results consisting of the Week 24 estimated Least Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CI s and p -value s. To control the overall Type 1 error rate of the study, taking into consideration the one primary and 54 secondary outcome measures, the outcome measures will be tested in a hierarchical stepwise fashion. For each outcome measure, teprotumumab will be teste d against placebo at the 0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically significant for the outcome measure preceding it in the hierarchical order."

The criteria to determine relapse is the following: • Increase in proptosis of ≥ 2 mm in the study eye since Week 24, or • An increase in CAS of ≥ 2 points since Week 24 with an absolute CAS of ≥ 4 in the study eye following the Week 24 Visit. • In addition to one of the bullet points above, the Investigator should also consider the subject’s symptomology to ensure a relapse has occurred (e.g., new onset of double vision). 9.4.1 Treatments Administered The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability. The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes). Subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 60 minute s (but not less than 50 minutes), period providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. 9.4.6.2 Determination of Dose Volume The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by the interactive web response system (IWRS) and will be based on the subject’s weight. The first dose will be 10 mg/kg, and subsequent doses will be 20 mg/kg. Weight will be measured at Screening and Weeks 12 and 24 during the Treatment Period.

All subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minute s (but not less than 80 minutes) period with vital signs monitored every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion. 9.5.1 Efficacy Variables Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measur ed as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement), CAS (7-item scale), diplopia (measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity) and Clinical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments). 9.5.5.4 Vital Signs Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature) will be measured at all clinic visits. Vital signs will be measured pre - and post -infusion on Day 1 and Week 3, and predose on all other infusion days. In addition, if immediate infusion- associated events are noted during the infusion, vital signs will be monitored every 5 minutes until stable and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional determinations. Also, vital signs will be monitored every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion for any subsequent infusions after the previous occurrence of immediate or delayed infusion- associated events. Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be obtained with the subject’s arm unconstrained by clothing or other material and while the subject is sitting up. When possible, the same arm will be used for measurements in all study visits. Temperature will be obtained oral ly or via the ear. 9.5.5.5 Physical and Ophthalmic Examinations, Height, and Weight Weight will be measured at Screening and every 12 weeks throughout the study (Weeks 12 and 24 [or PW] during the Treatment Period and Weeks 36, 48, 60, and 72 [or PW] of the Follow- Up Period). The dose on Day 1 of the double- masked Treatment Period will be based on the Screening wei ght.

The analysis of the primary proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The analysis will use Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference . be a logistic regression with treatment group as the model effect. Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation will be considered to be treatment failures (non- responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment Period will be considered to be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify randomization, tobacco use (non- user, user). Since tobacco use status (non user vs. user) is used to stratify the randomization, it will be included as a categorical covariate . The difference in response rates , comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated Odds ratio comparing teprotumumab to placebo will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value. An analysis of risk difference with stratification by tobacco use (non- user vs. user) Logistic regression will also be used to analyze the 32 secondary categorical endpoints. For the analysis of proptosis and GO- QoL (see Section 9.6.4.4 for details) as continuous secondary endpoints, a Mixed -Model Repeated- Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fit to the individual change from baseline scores for the study eye , with terms in the model being the baseline score, tobacco use status, treatment group, visit, and the visit-by- treatment an d visit-by-baseline -score interactions. The main focus of the analysis will be to test the treatment differences at Week 24, with the main results consisting of the Week 24 estimated Least Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CI s and p-value s. To control the overall Type 1 error rate of the study, taking into consideration the one primary and 54 secondary outcome measures, the outcome measures will be tested in a hierarchical stepwise fashion. For each outcome measure, teprotumumab will be tested against placebo at the 0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically significant for the outcome measure preceding it in the hierarchical order. 9.6.4.2 Clinical Measures of Severity The C linical Measures of Severity results (see Table 9.3) for each item will be summarized at each designated visit for each eye with the number and percentage of subjects being classified as responders on each individual criterion. The proportions of responders will be analyzed using the same risk difference method described for the primary endpoint a Chi square test in Section 9.6.3 ."

Secondary Objectives (analyzed hierarchically ) 1. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall responder rate (percentage of subjects with ≥ 2-point reduction in Clinical Activity Score [CAS ] AND ≥ 2 mm reduction in proptosis from Baseline , provided there is no corresponding deterioration [≥ 2-point/mm increase] in CAS or proptosis in the fellow eye ) at Week 24 . 2. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the percentage of subjects with a CAS value of 0 or 1 at Week 24 in the study eye . 3. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in proptosis measurement in the study eye. 4. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the d iplopia responder rate (i.e., the percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > 0 in study eye who have a reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 5. Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus pla cebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the Graves ’ Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life (GO -QoL) questionnaire overall score .

Subjects will b e screened for the study within 2 to 6 weeks prior to the Baseline (Day 1) Visit. A pproximately 76 subjects (38/group) who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by tobacco use status ) to receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions ) or placebo q3W . All s ubjects will enter a 24-week double -masked Treatment Period, during which study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline ), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24) . All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff , and at any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or the dose may be interr upted or held based on decreased tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details) . On each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for adverse event [AE] and concomitant medication use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions, subjects will be contacted by phone/email the following day and will return to the clinic 1 week after the infusion (Weeks 1 and 4) for safety and tolerability assessments; additional phone/email contacts and clinic visits may also be conducted for any subject experiencing an infusion -associated event. At the end of the double -masked Treatment Period (Week 24), subjects who are proptosis non-responders (study eye has < 2 mm decrease in proptosis) will be eligible to enter an open -label extension study (HZNP -TEP-302) in which subjects may receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open -label fashion. At Week 24, proptosis responders , as well as non -responders who choose not to enroll in the open -label extension study (HZNP -TEP-302), will enter a 48-week Follow -Up Period , during which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for Weeks 28, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (Months 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18 ). Subjects who are considered responders at Week 24 but who meet criteria for re- treatment due to relapse during the Follow -Up Period may enroll in the open- label extension study, HZNP -TEP- 302 (see Secti on 9.3.4 ). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the Treatment Period will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Week 24 assessments and will be encouraged to participate in the Follow - Up Period unless they initiated another intervention due to lack of efficacy . Subjects who enter the Follow -Up Period but prematurely discontinue study participation prior to 48 weeks following the double -masked Treatment Period will return for a final visit and undergo the scheduled Week 72 assessments prior to study discharge. Subjects who complete the Week 72 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or e mail by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. If yes, subject will be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response.

Dose Regimen/Route of Administration: All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. On Day 1 of the double -masked Treatment Period, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by tobacco use status) to receive infusions of either: 1. Teprotumumab 20 mg/kg (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining 7 infusions) , or 2. Placebo (q3W for all 8 infusions). The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details) . The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes). Subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 60 minute s (but not less than 50 minutes), providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. Dosage Form and Strength Formulation: Teprotumumab 500 mg will be provided in single -dose 20 mL glass vials as a freeze- dried powder . Each vial of teprotumu mab will be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution will have an approximate concentration of 50 mg/mL teprotumumab. Reconstituted teprotumumab solution will be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution prior to administration. Doses up to 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 100 mL, and those above 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 250 mL. To maintain a constant volume in the infusion bags, a volume equal to the volume of teprotumumab to be placed into the infusion bag will be first removed from the infusion bag using a sterile syringe and needle. The appropriate volume of reconstituted drug product solution based on the subject`s dose and body weight will be withdrawn and the teprotumumab reconstituted drug product solution will be diluted with normal saline ( 0.9% NaCl) in the infusion bag. Placebo will consist of a normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and will be administered in 100 mL or 250 mL infusion bags, as appropriate , per weight -based dosing volumes . Duration of Treatment and Follow -Up: The planned duration of the double -masked Treatment Period is 24 weeks (6 months) . Subjects who are considered proptosis non-responders at Week 24 or subjects who were responders at Week 24 but who meet criteria for re -treatment due to relapse during the Follow -Up Period may enroll in the open- label extension study , HZNP -TEP- 302 (see Section 9.3.4 ). At Week 24, proptosis responders , as well as non -responders who choose not to enroll in the open -label extension study, will enter a 48-week Follow -Up Period. Subjects who complete the Week 72 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. Criteria for Evaluation: The most sever ely affected eye will be defined as the ""study eye"" at the Baseline ( Day 1) Visit. If there is a discrepancy between CAS and proptosis in determining the study eye, this will be adjudicated always to the eye"

If both eye s are affected equally, the Investigator will choose the “study eye”. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study eye will be used to assess the primary outcome measure. Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement ), CAS (7-item scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity), and Clinical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments ). Quality of life will be assessed using the GO-QoL questionnaire. Blood samples for teprotumumab PK assessment will be collected prior to , and at the end of, the infusion on Day 1 and W eeks 3 and 9 during the Treatment Pe riod; in addition, single sample s will be collected at Weeks 1, 4, and 24.

Serum samples may be analyzed for biomarkers (IL -4, IL -6, IL -10, IL -12, IL -13, IL -17, IL -23, IL -1β, sIL-1RA, INFγ, TGFβ, TNF α, and micRNA) and possibly functional thyroid stimulating hormone r eceptor stimulating, blocking, and binding antibody (TSH -R-Ab) during the Treatment Period. Based on the results of the above assays, other similar serum biomarkers may be assayed to further explore drug and disease mechanisms. Safety will be assessed via AE and concomitant medication use monitoring, immunogenicity testing, physical and oph thalmic examinations, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, chemistry (including thyroid panel and HbA1 c), and urinalysis), pregnancy testing (if applicable), and electrocardiograms (ECG) . The study will also be monitored by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Statistical Analyses : Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary outcome measure is the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the proptosis responder rate (percentage of subjects with a ≥ 2 mm reduction from Baseline in proptosis in the study eye, without deterioration [≥ 2 mm increase] of proptosis in the fellow eye) at Week 24 . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (analyzed hierarchically ) 1. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall responder rate (percentage of subjects with ≥ 2-point reduction in CAS AND ≥ 2 mm reduction in proptosis from Baseli ne, provided there is no corresponding deterioration [≥ 2-point/mm increase] in CAS or proptosis in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 2. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the percentage of subjects with a CAS value of 0 or 1 at Week 24 in the study eye . 3. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in proptosis measurement in the study eye. 4. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the diplopia responder rate (percentage of subjects with baseline diplopia > 0 in study eye who have a reduction of ≥ 1 grade with no corresponding deterioration [≥ 1 grade worsening] in the fellow eye) at Week 24. 5. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the GO-QoL questionnaire overall score. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 1. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the Clinical Measures of Severity individual response status frequencies and percentage of responders for each component of clinical severity from Baseline to Week 24. 2. The ef fect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the CAS. 3. The effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the overall responder rate at Week 24 stratified by the level of response (high responders, responders, low responders, and non- responders). 4. To evaluate the PK parameters of teprotumumab to estimate exposure and understand the PK- PD relationships."

Evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the GO- QoL questionnaire VF a nd A subscale scores. 6. To evaluate the effect of teprotumumab on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in blood and serum markers. 7. To evaluate the effect of teprotumumab versus placebo on the mean change from Baseline to Week 24 on the motility component of the C linical Measures of Severity . Statistical Analysis on Efficacy Parameters The primary analyses will be conducted in the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population. The analysis of the primary proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (differe nce in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The analysis will use Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference. Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation will be considered to be treatment failures (non-respo nders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double -masked Treatment Period will be considered to be treatme nt failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify randomization, tobacco use (non -user, user). The difference in response rate s, comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p- value. An analysis of risk difference with stratification by tobacco use (non- user vs. user) will also be used to analyze the 3 secondar y categorical endpoints (overall responder rate , CAS [value of 0 or 1] and diplopia responder rate). For the analysis of proptosis as a continuous secondary endpoint and GO- QoL, a Mixed -Model Repeated - Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) model w ill be fit to the individual change from baseline scores for the study eye , with terms in the model being the baseline score, tobacco use status, treatment group, visit, and the visit- by-treatment and visit -by-baseline -score interactions. The main focus of the analysis will be to test the treatment differences at Week 24, with the main results consisting of the Week 24 estimated Least Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CI s and p- value s. To control the overall Type 1 error rate of the study, taking into consideration the one primary and 5 secondary outcome measures, the outcome measures will be tested in a hierarchical stepwise fashion. For each outcome measure, teprotumumab will be tested against placebo at the 0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically significant for the outcome measure preceding it in the hierarchical order. Sample Size Estimate : In the prior TED01RV study, a 51% difference (71% vs 20%) in proptosis reduction of 2 mm or more between teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) and placebo was observed at Week 24 in favor of teprotumumab. A sample size of 38 subject s per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided alpha 0.05 level to detect a difference of 39% between teprotumumab and placebo; the sample size has been adjusted to allow for a 1 6% discontinuation rate ."

Active TED typically lasts 1 to 3 years, and then the inflammation spontaneously subsides to leave the permanent pathology of inactive TED [ Burch et al, 1993]. The annual incidence rate of TED in the US has been estimated to be 16 cases per 100,000 people for women and 2.9 cases per 100,000 people for men [ Bartley, 1994]. The incidence appears to be comparable in Europe [ Abraham-Nordling et al, 2011; Mostbeck et al, 1998; Noth et al, 2001 ; Tanda et al, 2013]. Patients aged between 30 and 50 years are most frequently affected, with severe cases more frequent in those older than 50 years [Dickinson, 2010]. The occurrence and severity of TED is associated with smoking [ Prummel et al, 1993]. A mounting body of evidence in the scientific literature indicates that the pathophysiology of active TED involves the autoimmune activation and proliferation of orbital fibroblasts [Bahn, 2010; Boschi et al, 2005; Smith, 2010] . The activation of fibroblasts triggers release of inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of immune cells into orbital soft tissues (muscle, interstitial and adipose), excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix, and tissue expansion and remodeling (ibid). Clinical features of moderate -to-severe TED include orbital pain, swelling, dry eye, redness and discomfort of the lids and ocular surface, thickening and retraction of the eyelids, and proptosis (exophthalmos) due to the expansion of tissue behind the eye [ Bahn, 2010; Burch et al, 1993 ; Dickinson, 2010; Mallika et al, 2009 ]. In its moderate -to-severe form, TED has high morbidity [ Bartalena et al, 2008 ; Bartley, 1994; Dickinson, 2010; Gerding et al, 1997 ]. Morbidity takes the form of orbital pain, together with a number of serious, sight- threatening conditions, including diplopia (due to inability to correctly align the eyes), corneal ulceration (due to inability to close lids), and dysthyroid optic neuropathy (due to proptosis, tissue crowding, and stress on the optic nerve). These combine to produce marked reductions in quality of life (QoL) (e.g., physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain) [ Gerding et al, 1997; C. Terwee et al, 2002]. TED can also produce profound psychosocial problems, in particular anxiety and depression, due to the alarming and disfiguring changes in appearance [ Bartley et al, 1996; Coulter et al, 2007; G. J. Kahaly et al, 2005]. Taken toget her, these data show that moderate- to- severe active TED is a physically and emotionally debilitating condition ( Figure 7.1)."

The primary molecular mechanism through which GD- IgGs produce hyperthyroidism is believed to be activation of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (TSHR) in thyroid follicular cells [Akamizu, 2001]. TED also has an autoimmune basis, but in this case, the primary cellular target appears to be orbital fibroblasts. GD -IgGs stimulate orbital fibroblasts to proliferate, release cytokines, initiate an inflammatory response, differentiate into adipocytes and myofibroblasts, and to secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (e.g., hyaluronan), which in turn results in fibrosis and edema [ Smith, 2010] . It was initially assumed that, as with Graves’ hyperthyroidism, GD-IgGs produced TED through activation of TSHR. However, the data for this has never been definitive and a number of lines of evidence argue against there being a single, common molecular target for the 2 conditions. For example, it is not uncommon for there to be longitudin al misalignments in the time courses of Graves’ hyperthyroidism and TED ; approximately 10% of TED patients never become hyperthyroid and some TED patients experience unilateral eye symptoms. Moreover, there is disagreement in the literature about whether the levels of TSHR expressed in orbital tissues are alone sufficient to trigger and drive TED (e.g., [Bahn, 2010; Boschi et al, 2005 ; Smith et al, 2004]). There are no well -established animal models for TED , and this has hampered both the study of mechanism and the discovery of novel therapeutics. Neve rtheless, evidence is now accumulating that TSHR may not be the only autoantigen that is involved in regulating TED pathology. Specifically, a substantial body of data has been generated arguing that the insulin- like growth factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) plays an important role in regulating the pathophysiological responses produced in orbital an immune cells by GD-IgGs. Key nonclinical data supporting the involvement of IGF -1R in the mechanism of active TED are: 1. IGF-1R is localized on orbital fibroblasts and binding of IGF to fibroblasts can be displaced by GD- IgGs [Weightman et al, 1993]. 2. IGF-1R is up- regulated in cultured orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED, while TSHR is only expressed at low levels [Tsui et al, 2008]. 3. Stimulation of IGF -1R by GD- IgGs in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED causes increased release of the T -cell attracting cytokines IL -16 and RANTES [Pritchard et al, 2003] . Importantly, this effect of GD -IgGs is fully reversed by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) antagonist specific for IGF -1R. 4. IGF-1 and GD-IgGs increase hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED, but not in orbital fibroblasts from control subjects or dermal fibroblasts [Smith et al, 2004]. Again, this effect of GD- IgGs is blocked by a selective IGF -1R antagonist antibody. Interestingly, in these studies thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) failed to stimulate hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED."

Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including sarcoma. Development for this indication was discontinued based on insufficient clinical efficacy and was not based on any observed safety issues in the more than 700 subjects treated in the oncology program. Teprotumumab is currently being developed by Horizon for subjects with moderate- to-severe active TED (also known as Graves’ Ophthalmopathy or Orbitopathy [GO] and Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy [TAO]). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of teprotumumab were characterized by Roche. A biomarker to assess target interaction – increases in serum IGF -1 – was also identified. PK/PD m odeling indicated that co ncentrations of 20 μg/mL re sulted in > 90% IGF-1R receptor occupancy, and that d oses that produced teprotumumab trough blood concentrations of 20 μg/mL were well tolerated. The clinical safety database of teprotumumab in oncology was likely confounded by the comorbidity of late stage cancer and concomitant administration of other treatment s. The oncology studies, however, did identify a number of potential AEs of special interest (AESIs: infusion-associated events, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia) and these events were monitored carefully in the initial study in TED subject s, TED01RV. TED01RV was the first study in which non-oncology subject s received teprotumumab. This study enrolled 87 subject s (43 teprotumumab; 44 placebo) between the ages of 18 and 75 years with recent onset (≤ 9 months from diagnosis) moderate- to-severe active TED . The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall responder rate ( decreases from Baseline of ≥ 2 points in overall Clinical Activity Score [ CAS ] and ≥ 2 mm in proptosis, provided that there was no deterioration [i.e., increase s of ≥ 2 points in CAS o r ≥ 2 mm in proptosis] in the non-study eye) at the end of the 24- week treatment phase. In this study, the responder rate was significant ly greater with teprotum umab treatment compared to placebo ( 69% versus 20%; p < 0.001) at Week 24 . Therapeutic effects were rapid, with increased responder rates in the teprotumumab group relative to placebo detected at Weeks 6, 12, and 18 (all p < 0.001). The secondary endpoints (QoL, proptosis, and CAS as continuous variables) all supported the primary analysis conclusion that teprotumumab was superior to placebo in the treatment of TED . Population PK modeling in TED01RV confirmed that trough concentrations were consistently above the 20 μg /mL threshold, which had been previously determined by Roche PK/PD modeling as result ing in > 90% IGF -1R occupancy in the tissues. Results of the TED01RV study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine [ Smith et al, 2017]. Of the AESIs identified in the oncology studies (i.e., infusion- associated events, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia), the only one that emerged in the initial trial in subjects with TED was hyperglycemia. Among subjects treated with teprotumumab, hyperglycemia was uniformly mild in non-diabetic subjects and adequately controlled by"

Prior to all future infusions of teprotu mumab, these subject s should be pre- medicated wi th IV diphenhydramine 1 to 1.25 mg/kg (maximum: 50 mg), IV ranitidine 50 mg, IV dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg (maximum: 20 mg), and/or acetaminophen 500 mg. In addition, all future infusions should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) . Vital signs should be taken every 15 minutes during the infusion. Subject s who experience delayed -type hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., skin rash) may remain in the study at the discretion of the Investigator, and prior to all future infusions of teprotumumab, should be pre-medicated with the above medications (diphenhydramine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, and/or acetaminophen). Subjects who experience a worsening delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction following repeated infusions of teprotumumab or who have other signs of serum- sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias, arthralgias) may be removed from the study after discussion with the Investigator and Sponsor. Hyperglycemia In preclinical studies, there was no in vitro cross-reactivity of teprotumumab with the insulin receptor. During TED01RV, among non- diabetic subjects, hyperglycemia occurred at comparable rates in both treatment groups and was uniformly Grade 1 and intermittent. Among diabetic subject s, Grade 2 or 3 hyperglycemia occurred in some teprotumumab -treated subject s; this was well -controlled after diabetes medication adjustment. Glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1 c, was at baseline levels following the treatment phase for all subject s in the teprotumumab group. Subject s with known controlled diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate in studies with teprotumumab. HbA1c levels should be monitored regularly in these subjects. Investigators are strongly encouraged to adjust their subjects’ diabetes management to maintain subject s’ HbA1c levels at ≤ 7%. In the event a subject ’s HbA1c level rises to > 7% while in the study, the Investigator must determine the risk versus benefit for each subject to remain in the study. Fasting glucose leve ls (after at least an 8 -hour fast) should be tested at B aseline. Hyperglycemia should be promptly investigated and managed. Subjects with recurrent hyperglycemia, defined as a fasting glucose level of moderate intensity (glucose >160 – 250 mg/dL), will require evaluation for diabetes mellitus (e .g., fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, and HbA1c tests) and appropriate medical management at the discretion of the Investigator. Muscle Spasms During the TED01RV study, muscle spasms were identified in 19% of the subjects receiving teprotumumab versus 5% of those receiving placebo. In the teprotumumab group, 8 subjects had muscle spasms ( 6 had Grade 1 and 2 had Grade 2 ); only 2 subjects experienced the event for longer than one week and were treated with muscle rel axants. If possible, avoid medications known to cause muscle spasms or muscle toxicity such as diuretics or statins and evaluate for other causes of muscle spasm such as electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration."

In the teprotumumab group, 8 subjects had diarrhea (5 had Grade 1, 2 had Grade 2, and 1 had a Grade 3 [ severe]), with 2 subjects requiring treatment . The severe diarrhea (Grade 3) occurred in a subject with a history of colitis and was considered possibly related to study drug. This subject was subsequently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and required colectomy leading to discontinuation from the study. Additionally, ano ther subject was diagnosed with IBD during the course of the study. Both subjects likely had IBD as a pre-existing condition, prior to study start. However, given the temporal sequence, exacerbation of underlying IBD by teprotumumab cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, diarrhea that is progressive and persistent, or has features of IBD such as bloody stools or abdominal pain , should undergo prompt evaluation to exclude IBD or other serious conditions. If possible, avoid medications known to cause di arrhea such as laxatives and magnesium. 7.2 Rationale for th is Study Multiple lines of evidence indicate that IGF -1R plays a critical role in regulating the autoimmune response that underlies TED. Teprotumumab is a mAb with low nanomolar affinity for human IGF-1R. Binding of teprotumumab to IGF -1R blocks receptor activation by agonists, IGF1 and IGF2, and also causes direct inactivation of the receptor through antibody-induced internalization. Teprotumumab has no agonist acti vity for canonical IGF-1R signaling pathways and is highly selective; in particular, it does not recognize the insulin receptor. Teprotumumab is well-tolerated in humans at doses that produce > 90% IGF-1R occupancy. Systemic administration of teprotumumab to subjects with moderate- to-severe active TED should, therefore , attenuate all disease symptoms that are dependent on IGF -1R activation . This argument holds whether IGF-1R is being activated by GD-IgG or endogenous ligands IGF-1 and IGF2, or whether the receptor is expressed on fibroblasts, progenitor fibrocytes, adipocytes, or lymphocytes. Moreover, inhibition of IGF-1R receptor function with an antibody may also attenuate signaling through the TSHR, an autoantigen that has been implicated in TED, be cause IGF-1R and TSHR are physically and functionally coupled. Teprotumumab, therefore , has the potential to treat TED at multiple different molecular and cellular levels. Administering teprotumumab early in active TED is designed to reduce the intensity and duration of the active disease, minimize the sequelae that are carried over to constitute inactive TED , and thereby have a beneficial effect on long- term outcome , reducing the need for corrective surgeries. Previous preclinical and clinical experience indicates that, at doses that are pharmacologically relevant for blocking IGF-1R, teprotumumab has an acceptable safety profile following IV infusion and is, therefore , a suitable drug candidate to be investigated in the TED indication."

All subjects will enter a 24 -week double- masked Treatment Period, during which study drug will be infused on Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24). A ll study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff, and at any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or the dose may be interrupted or held based on decreased tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details). On each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for AE and concomitant medication use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions, subjects will be contacted by phone/email the following day and will return to the clinic 1 week after the infusion (Weeks 1 and 4) for safety and tolerability assessments; additional phone/email contacts and clinic visits may also be conducted for any subject experiencing an infusion- associated event. At the end of the double- masked Treatment Period (Week 24), subjects who are proptosis non-responders (study eye has < 2 mm decrease in proptosis) will be eligible to enter an open- label ex tension study (HZNP -TEP-302) in which subjects may receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion and 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open- label fashion. Discussion of this option with the subject and informed consent presentation for HZNP -TEP-302 should be discussed at the Week 24 Visit given enrollment in HZNP- TEP- 302 must occur within 2 weeks of the Week 24 Visit. At Week 24, proptosis responders, as wel l as non-responders who choose not to enroll in the open-label extension study (HZNP -TEP-302), will enter a 48-week Follow-Up Period, during which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for Weeks 28, 36, 48, 60, and 72 (Months 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18). Subjects who are responders at Week 24 but who meet the criteria for re -treatment due to a relapse during the F ollow -Up Period may enroll in the open-label extension study , HZNP -TEP-302 (see Section 9.3.4 for details) . Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the Treatment Period will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Week 24 assessments and will be encouraged to participate in the Follow-Up Period unless they initiated another intervention due to lack of efficacy . Subjects who enter the Follow-Up Period but prematurely discontinue study participation prior to 48 weeks following the double- masked Treatment Period will return for a final visit and undergo the scheduled Week 72 assessments prior to study discharge."

The study population is well- defined and is consistent with the expected target population for whom teprotumumab will be indicated (adult subjects with Graves ’ disease and moderate- to-severe active TED ). The measurements used in this study for the primary and secondary endpoints ( proptosis , CAS , and GO-QoL questionnaire) are established and well -validated endpoints that have been shown to correlate significantly with TED . The sample size for this study was based on the data from the TED01RV study. A sample size of 38 subjects per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided alpha 0.05 level to detect a difference of 39% between teprotumumab and placebo in the proptosis responder rate ; this sample size has been adjusted for a 16% dropout rate."

Removal of a subject from the study is at the discretion of the Inves tigator and may occur if the Investigator determines that study drug administration is not benefitting the subject and eye symptoms linked to progressing disease worsen posing an unacceptable risk to the subject. The specific care of the subject is best determined by the Investigator and managing physician(s) involved in the subject’s care and may require removal from the study. All subjects are free to withdraw from study participation at any time, for any reason, allowing them to receive any specific treatment for TED that is considered necessary per their treating physician and local standard of care. • Non-Compliance with Study Drug/Other /Protocol Deviations . The subject has a significant protocol deviation, does not comply with study drug administration schedule, or fails to adhere to other study requirements as stated in the protocol. • Lost to F ollow -Up. The subject does not return to the clinic for scheduled assessments, and does not respond to the site’s attempts to contact the subject. • Withdrawal by Subject/Guardian . The subject wishes to withdraw from the study. The clinical site should attempt to determine the underlying reason for the voluntary withdrawal and document it on the eCRF; if the underlying reason is documented as an AE or lack of efficacy , the category of withdrawal should be marked in the corresponding category and not as voluntary withdrawal. • Study Terminated by Sponsor. The Sponsor, IRB/IEC, or regulatory agency terminates the study. • Pregnancy. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 of the Treatment Period will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Week 24 assessments and will be encouraged to participate in the Follow-Up Period unless they initiated another intervention due to lack of efficacy .

The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes). Subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 60 minute s (but not less than 50 minutes), providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. 9.4.2 Identity of Investigational Products 9.4.2.1 Teprotumumab Teprotumumab ( HZN -001) is a fully human anti- IGF-1R mAb . The physiochemical properties were previously presented in Section 7.1.3.1. Teprotumumab will be provided in single-dose 20 mL glass vials as a freeze-dried powder containing, in addition to the drug substance, 20 mmol/L histidine -histidine chloride, 250 mmol/L trehalose, and 0.01% polysorbate 20 (w/w). Prior to administration, each vial containing 500 mg teprotumumab freeze- dried powder will be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution has an approximate concentration of 50 mg/ mL teprotumumab. The r econstituted teprotumumab solution must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution prior to a dministration (see Section 9.4.6.3 for details) . 9.4.2.2 Placebo Placebo will consist of a normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and will be administered in 100 mL or 250 mL infusion bags, as appropriate, per weight- based dosing volumes. 9.4.3 Labeling Study drug packaging will be in compliance with Sponsor/CRO standard procedures and will meet all local requirements. Upon arrival of investigational products at the s ite, the investigational pharmacist or site personnel not assigned to the study should check them for damage and verify proper identity, quantity, integrity of seals, and temperature conditions, and report any deviations or product complaints to the monitor/Sponsor upon discovery. 9.4.4 Storage Recommended storage conditions for the freeze-dried teprotumumab drug product are between 2°C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46°F), protected from light. Storage at ambient temperature of the reconstituted teprotumumab solution should be limited to 4 hours. For batch- specific information on shelf- life, see the packaging. The IV infusion should be administered at room temperature (20°C to 24°C [68°F to 75 °F]). The diluted product should be used within 4 hours of preparation. However, if not used within 4 hours, and if dilution has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F). An Investigational Pharmacy Manual will be provided to all sites and further describe these processes in detail."

Records will include re ceipt dates , condition at time of receipt, quantities received, quantities dispensed, quantities returned or destroyed, and the identification numbers of the subjects who received study medication. As permitted by site policy, a ll empty, partially empty, and full vials of study drug must be retained by the study center under locked storage until drug accountability has been completed. Periodically throughout the study and at the conclusion of the study, inventory checks and accountability of study materials will be conducted by an un masked representative of the Sponsor. Once accountability is completed, the Sponsor’s representative will authorize the return of study medication (all used, partially used, and unused vials) to the 3 rd party vendor (see Table 6.1). The completed Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) will be returned to the unmasked CRO manager . The I nvestigator’s copy of the Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) must document accurately the return of all study drug supplies and be maintained by the un masked pharmacist or designee until the study is complete and the database is locked. Records will also include disposition dates and quantities returned to the designated facility. 9.4.6 Study Drug Administration and Timing of Dose for each Subject 9.4.6.1 Description of Clinical Supplies will supply study drug to clinical sites. Ancillary su pplies for dosing will be provided by the study site (i.e ., infusion bags containing normal saline, infusion administration sets, syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, gauze pads, bandages, and biohazard containers for safe storage of used needles and syringes). 9.4.6.2 Determination of Dose Volume The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by the interactive web response system (IWRS) and will be based on the subject’s weight. The first dose will be 10 mg/kg, and subsequent doses will be 20 mg/kg. W eight will be measured at Screening and Weeks 12 and 24 during the Treatment Period. The dose on Day 1 of the double- masked Treatment Period will be based on the Screening weight. The weight obtained at Week 12 can be used to adjust the dose beginning at Week 12 or Week 15, as appropriate."

Each vial of teprotumumab will be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution will have an approximate concentration of 50 mg/mL teprotumumab antibody. Reconstituted teprotumumab solution will be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride ( NaCl ) solution prior to administration by the site pharmacist or designee . Doses up to 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 100 mL, and those above 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 250 mL. To maintain a constant volume in the infusion bags, a volume equal to the volume of teprotumumab to be placed into the infusion bag will be first removed from the infusion bag using a sterile syringe and needle. The appropriate volume of reconstituted drug product solution based on the subject`s dose and body weight will be withdrawn and the teprotumumab drug product solution will be diluted with normal saline (0.9% NaCl) in the infusion bag. The IV infusion is to be administered at room temperature (20°C to 24°C [68°F to 75°F]). The diluted product should be used within 4 hours. However, if not used within 4 hours, and if dilution has taken place under controlled and aseptic conditions, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). No incompatibilities have been observed with: • administration sets with product contact surface of polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyurethane • inline filters with product contact surf ace of polyether sulphone • IV bags (0.9% sodium chloride) with product contact surface of polyolefin or PVC. In-line filters are not required, but if a hospital is routinely using them, in- line filters with a 0.2 μm pore size should be utilized. Exposure of the solution to direct sunlight should be avoided. All parenteral products should be visually inspected for particulates before administration. Partially used vials should not be re- used. The first and second IV infusions on Day 1 and Week 3 will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) for all subjects; subsequent infusions may be administered over a shorter time period (approximately 60 minutes , but not less than 50 minutes ) in the absence of any infusion- associated events. All subjects will be monitored for AEs from the start of infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion for the first 3 doses; the"

Subjects will be monitored for immediate infusion -associated events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, facial flushing , warmth, dyspnea, dizziness, hypertension, hypotension, pruritus ) and delayed infusion- associated events (e.g., rash). If immediate infusion- associated events are noted , the infusion rate will be slowed or interrupted , symptomatic treatment (e .g., antipyretics, antihistamines, beta -agonists, oxygen, IV fluid) will be administered , and vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate) will be monitored every 5 minutes until stable and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional determinations. The infusion may be restarted upon complete resolution of symptoms; however, study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued if the event is an anaphylactic reaction . If delayed infusio n-associated event s are noted, subjects may continue dosing at the Investigator's discretion ; however, if a rash worsens following repeated dosing or other signs of serum sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias , arthralgias) are present, study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued. Following the appearance of either immediate or delayed infusion- associated events, subsequent doses may be pre-treated with diphenhydramine (1 to 1.25 mg/kg IV; maximum of 50 mg), ranitidine (50 mg IV), famotidine (0.5 mg /kg IV), dexamethasone (0.4 mg/kg IV; maximum of 20 mg), and/or acetaminophen (500 mg). All subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) with vital signs monitored every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion. In general, the decision to continue dosing should take into consideration the potential benefit and risk to a subject. Any severe drug- related AE must revert to mild or moderate in intensity at least 2 weeks prior to the next scheduled dose in order for the dose to be administered; if the AE remains severe in intensity within 2 weeks of the next scheduled dose, the subject will be withdrawn from treatment. Increase in blood glucose is a known AE observed in previous clinical trials with teprotumumab and other IGF -1R antagonists and is known to respond to treatment. Since a referral for treatment of hyperglycemia may take some time, if the I nvestigator considers it appropriate to continue the subje ct in the study, the next scheduled infusion visit may be skipped to allow modified anti- diabetic treatment to show its activity and hyperglycemia to return to mild/moderate level before dosing. The subject would then be dosed at the next scheduled visit (i.e., 6 weeks after the previous infusion). Fasting blood glucose levels must return to mild/moderate severity before the next scheduled infusion. The above process of withholding a scheduled infusion will be permitted only twice during the study."

On Day 1 of the double- masked Treatment Period, o nce all Baseline procedures other than administration of drug have been completed, the masked site personnel will use the IWRS to randomize the subject. The unmasked pharmacist or designee will then use the IWRS to obtain dosing information, and dispense the appropriate study drug. 9.4.8 Masking and Unmasking The pharmacists or designees responsible for preparing the teprotumumab or placebo solutions for IV administration will not be masked to the identity of the study drug. Pharmacists/designees will provide study drug in infusion bags (fully diluted for administration ) to study site personnel with appropriate masked labels. The subject, Investigator , and all other study site personnel will be masked to the treatment being administered. During the phase 2 TED01RV trial, hyperglycemia was the only laboratory finding and adverse event clearly identified by the Investigators as being related to teprotumumab. Furthermore, hyperglycemia was observed in both treatment groups, placebo and teprotumumab. Given the occurrence of this event in both treatment groups, it is not possible to determine the identity of the masked study product based on the occurrence of this particular event. The study mask should be broken only if the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan depends on which medication he or she received. Unless the subject is at immediate risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact the Sponsor or Sponsor’s des ignee before unmasking the subject’s data. If a subject’s data are unmasked without prior knowledge of the Sponsor, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business day. All circumstances surrounding the event must be clearly documented. The Sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance department or designee will unmask the identity of the study medication for an unexpected , drug- related SAE for submission to health authorities and IRB/IEC according to applicable regulatory requirements. However, the results will not be shared with other Sponsor representatives or staff at study sites. Details of subject s who are unmasked during the study will be included in the Clinical Study Report. Unmasking for independent pharmacological analysis of biological samples or SAE reporting will be performed according to procedures in place to ensure integrity of the data. All investigative site staff directly involved in this study will remain masked from Screening through analysis of the Follow-Up data and all site close-out visits. The Sponsor and its designees will be unmasked after the database lock following completion of all subjects in the double- masked treatment phase."

Delegation of this task must be clearly documented and approved by the Investigator. All infusions of study medication will be administered at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. Infusion volumes, and start and stop times of the infusions will be recorded in the eCRF . An inventory of the study medication supplies will be performed by the site or authorized study designee and recorded onto the Drug Accountability Log in the subject’s source document records or equivalent. 9.5 Efficacy, Quality -of-Life, Pharmacokinetic , and Safety Variables The Schedule of Assessments was previously provided in Section 2.1. 9.5.1 Efficacy Variables Efficacy assessments will be performed for both eyes at each assessment time point. The most severely affected eye will be defined as the ""study eye"" at the Baseline ( Day 1 ) Visit. If there is a discrepancy between CAS and proptosis in determining the study eye, this will be adjudicated always to the eye with the most significant proptosis. If both eyes are affected equally, the Investigator will choose the “study eye”. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study eye will be used to assess the primary outcome measure. Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement), CAS (7-item scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity) and Clinical Measures of Severity (inclu ding motility restriction assessments). 9.5.1.1 Proptosis (Exophthalmos) The most severely affected eye will be defined as the ""study eye"" at the Baseline (Day 1) Visit . Proptosis assessments will be performed using a Hertel exophthalmometer provided by the Spons or for consistency in measurement , and (except when strictly unavoidable) the same Hertel instrument and same observer should be used at each evaluation for the full duration of the study. Additionally , the same intercanthal distance (ICD) must be used on each occasion . Instructions for the measurement of proptosis are included in Section 17.2 . Proptosis will be measured for each eye at Screening, Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or premature withdrawal [ PW]) during the Treatment Period, and at Weeks 28 , 36, 48, 60, and 72"

The study will also be monitored by a DSMB. 9.5.5.1 Adverse Events 9.5.5.1.1 Definitions 9.5.5.1.1.1 Adverse Event Definiti on According to ICH, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. Pre-existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. New findings reported from the on-study ophthalmic examinations will not be reported as AEs if according to the Investigator the abnormalities are related to TED and not consider ed related to the investigational product. Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF unless there is a clear exacerbation of a chronic condition. Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the disease for which the study drug is being studied (i.e., TED). It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of worse ning proptosis may be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. 9.5.5.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition A TEAE , baseline event, or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study, including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accidents)."

An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, i ts occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization. • Congenital anomaly or birth defect. • Other medically important event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. Elective surgeries that require hospitalization and treatment received at an emergency room or similar facility will not be considered as SAEs unless one of the definitions of an SAE listed above is met. In addition, hospitalizations for planned procedures are not considered an AE unless they are prolonged hospitalizations, and emergency room visits less than 24 hours in duration are not considered hospitalizations. 9.5.5.1.1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Event Definition A non- serious AE includes any AE that is not described in the previous SAE category. 9.5.5.1.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event Definition An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Reference Safety Information section of the IB or is not listed with the specificity or severity that has been observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Reference Safety Information as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 9.5.5.1.1.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest Based on previous clinical experience in TED, the following AESIs are identified for this study (See Sectio n 7.1.3.4.5.5 for further information): • Infusion reactions (e.g., nausea, vomiting, facial flushing , warmth, dyspnea, dizziness, hypertension, hypotension, pruritus) • Hyperglycemia • Muscle spasms • Diarrhea"

The TEAE reporting period begins with administration of the first dose of study medication on Day 1 and continues until 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug, and the Follow-Up AE reporting period begins 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug through completion of the Follow- Up Period (Week 72 or PW). All baseline signs/symptoms, TEAE s, and AEs during the Follow-Up Period must be recorded in the sourc e documents and on the subject’s e CRF . If the Investigator observes an SAE after study completion that he/she believes was possibly caused by the study medication, the Investigator will report this SAE using the procedures described in Section 9.5.5.1.5. Detailed information regarding all SAEs must also be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form. Whenever possible, the Investigator should group together into a single term the signs and symptoms that constitute a single diagnosis. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing might be grouped together as “upper respiratory infection” if the Investigator is confident of the diagnosis. 9.5.5.1.3 Intensity of Adverse Events All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE form of the CRF. Intensity of AEs will be graded on a 5- point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life- threatening , death ) and reported in detail on the e CRF .

The details regarding frequency of meetings, members, and the safety review criteria will be outlined in a separate DSMB Charter. ACI Clinical will manage the logistics of the DSMB ( Table 6.1). 9.5.6 Appropriateness of Measurements This study, which is a randomized, double- masked , placebo-controlled, parallel -group, multi- center study, is designed according to standard principles for adequate and well- controlled studies. The study population is well- defined and is consistent with the expected target population for whom teprotumumab will be indicated (adult subjects previously diagnosed with Graves’ hyperthyroidism and with moderate -to-severe active TED ). 9.5.7 Study Procedures Subjects who provide informed consent and who meet all the entry criteria for participation in this study will be randomized to treatment. 9.5.7.1 Screening Due to the large number of screening assessments, the Screening Visit may be completed in more than one day. During the Screening Visit, potential study subjects will be informed fully regarding the nature of the study and possible AEs, and will receive a co py of the ICF for review. Potential study subjects must read the ICF and sign the document after the Investigator has answered all questions to the study candidate’s satisfaction. Further procedures can begin only after the ICF has been signed. The original signed ICF will be retained by the Investigator and a copy will be given to the study subject. Study candidates will be evaluated for study entry according to the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section 9.3). The Investigator will evaluate the results of all examinations, including clinical laboratory tests, and will determine each candidate’s suitability for the study. The Investigator must review the results of all Screening tests before determining that a candidate is eligible for study drug treatment. The ser um pregnancy test performed at S creening on all female candidates of childbearing potential mus t be negative for those subjects to be eligible for initiation of treatment. All screening procedur es must be completed within 42 to 14 days prior to Study Day 1 (i.e., the first day of administration of study drug). The following procedures will be performed during S creening to establish each candidate’s general heal th and eligibility for enrollment into the study:"

Full details of the analysis populations will be described in the SAP. 9.6.3 Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analysis The primary analyses will be conducted in the ITT population. The analysis of the primary proptosis responder endpoint will assess risk difference (difference in response rates) in a stratified analysis. The analysis will use Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weighting to estimate the common risk difference within strata and to estimate the standard error of the common risk difference. Subjects missing the Week 24 evaluation will be considered to be treatment failures (non-responders) for the primary analysis. Further, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing prior to Week 21 during the double- masked Treatment Period will be considered to be treatment failures (non -responders), unless an assessment at Week 24 is available. Stratification for the analysis will use the same factor as was used to stratify randomization, tobacco use (non-user, user). The difference in response rates, comparing teprotumumab to placebo, will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value. An analysis of risk difference with stratification by tobacco use (non- user vs. user) will also be used to analyze the 3 secondary categorical endpoints. For the analysis of proptosis and GO -QoL (see Section 9.6.4.4 for details) as continuous secondary endpoints , a Mixed -Model Repeated - Measures (MMRM) analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model will be fit to the individual change from baseline scores for the study eye, with terms in the model being the baseline score,"

The main focus of the analysis will be to test the treatment differences at We ek 24, with the main results consisting of the Week 24 estimated Least Square (LS) means and their differences with 95% CIs and p- value s. To control the overall Type 1 error rate of the study, taking into consideration the one primary and 5 secondary outcome measures, the outcome measures will be tested in a hierarchical stepwise fashion. For each outcome measure, teprotumumab will be tested against placebo at the 0.05 level only if teprotumumab was statistically significant for the outcome measure precedin g it in the hierarchical order. 9.6.4 Exploratory Analyses 9.6.4.1 Pharmacokinetic s/Pharmacodynamics All PK data and parameters will be presented descriptively, including arithmetic means, standard deviations, geometric means, CVs , medians , and ranges. The key data are C trough plasma levels at Week 9 prior to infusion and at Week 24, important to confirm that plasma concentrations were maintained above the 20 µ g/ml level through the course of the dosing period. The relationship between clinical endpoints and the plasma concentrations of teprotumumab will be explored in a descriptive manner. 9.6.4.2 Clinical Measures of Severity The C linical Measures of Severity results (see Table 9.3) for each item will be summarized at each designated visit for each eye with the number and percentage of subjects being classified as responders on each individual criterion. The proportions of responders will be analyzed using the same risk difference method described for the primary endpoint in Section 9.6.3. 9.6.4.2.1 Motility Component of the C linical Measures of Severity The monocular ductions of the study eye (degrees) will be compared between the 2 treatment groups at each evaluation period for adduction, abduction, supraduction and infraduction. For each motility measure, the analysis of the changes from baseline in the target eye will be conducted using the same MMRM ANCOVA analysis as the continuous secondary endpoint analysis in Section 9.6.3, substituting the appropriate bas eline assessments. 9.6.4.3 Clinical Activity Score (CAS) CAS will be measured as a continuous variable using the MMRM ANCOVA model described above to compare the treatment groups. 9.6.4.3.1 Stratification of Proptosis and CAS Response into Four Responses Categories To further explore the response based on both proptosis and CAS reduction, each subject will be classified into one of 4 response categories at Week 24:"

A logistic regression analysis will be used to compare the treatment groups on the basis of this ordered 4- category classification. 9.6.4.4 Quality of Life Analysis QoL assessments will be used to derive pre- specified Q oL scores according to the directions for the GO- QoL scale. These scores will be summarized by descriptive summary tables at Baseline and over time. The overall score, and the VF and A subscale scores , will be evaluated at Week 24 using the MMRM model described above. Final analysis plans will be provided in the SAP. 9.6.4.5 Blood and Serum Biomarkers Biomarker data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 9.6.4.6 Safety Analyses The safety analysis population will include all subjects who receive at least one dose and had at least one post -dose safety assessment. All safety parameters will be summarized and presented in tables based on this safety population. Details of the safety data analysis will be presented in the SAP. 9.6.4.7 Interim Analyses No interim analyses are planned. 9.6.5 Sample Size and Power Considerations In the prior study, TED01RV, a 51% difference (71% vs 20%) between teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) and placebo was observed at Week 24 in favor of teprotumumab in proptosis reduction of 2 mm or more. A sample size of 38 subject s per group provides 90% power at the 2-sided alpha 0.05 level to detect a difference of 39% between teprotumumab and placebo; the sample size has been adjusted to allow for a 1 6% discontinuation rate."

Choose a Hertel exophthalmometer provided by the Study Sponsor for consistency in measurement with a snug mechanism and preferably a square angle where it sits against the orbital rim (a). 2. Open it wider than required. 3. Sit opposite the patient and at the same level. 4. Keep the patient relaxed, avoiding breath holding and excessive eyelid retraction. 5. Position left foot of Hertel against the patient’s right lateral orbital rim, at level of lateral canthus (b). It should sit firmly as medially as possible, but outside lateral canthus and without distorting position of globe. 6. Slide right foot medially into identical position on left orbital rim (c). This will feel tight and slightly uncomfortable, but minimizes potential side slippage o f Hertel. 7. Ask patient to fix their right eye on your left eye while you occlude the patient’s left visual axis with your right thumb. In this position, align the instrument such that the vertical mark (or cone) is aligned with the manufacturer’s pre -marked position on the ruler. Once aligned, rotate the instrument slightly around the horizontal plane such as to view the apex of the cornea in the mirror. Record the position of the corneal apex on the ruler. This is Hertel value. 8. To record the left eye, hold the instrument stationary and move your head. Then use your right eye to record the patients left eye. Again, the opposite visual axis is occluded by your left thumb, while the patient is asked to fix on your right eye. Ensure that the corneal apex is measured by rotating the instrument slightly around the horizontal plane if required."
