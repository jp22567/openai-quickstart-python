Describe any gaps in current knowledge. Include relevant preliminary findings or prior research by the investigator. Response: The control of glucose homeostasis in type 1 diabetes is fragile since β-cell reserve is negligible. Traditionally, insulin has been the only treatment approach available. This approach, often leads to erratic blood sugar control given the challenge of mat ching exogenous insulin to mealtime glucose excursions in the face of a lack of any endogenous insulin to compensate for variation in requirements in response to meals and activity levels. Injected insulin boluses rarely match precise insulin requirements"
6,page_6,"Page 7 of 62 IRB Version: either in terms of dose administered or bio -availability. The result often is wide fluctuations in blood glucose readings. Based on our work to date and other published reports, previous attempts to add other glucose -lowering medications to insulin therapy yielded minimal benefits on glycemia (although metformin may have other benefits (1 - 3) We have recently shown in two preliminary retrospective studies that the addition of liraglutide, a Glucagon Like Peptide -1 receptor agonist (GLP -1RA), to insulin re sults in consistent improvements in glycemic control in type 1 diabetes as demonstrated by reductions in HbA1c, glycemic excursions, and insulin requirements accompanied by improvements in body weight and systolic blood pressure (4, 5). We have now also completed the first prospective randomized controlled trial of this drug in 72 people with type 1 diabetes. Our data not only confirmed improvements in glycemic control, HbA1c, body weight and systolic BP, but also demonstrated a reduction in appetite, carbo hydrate intake in low grade inflammation as measured by plasma CRP concentrations (6). Importantly, quality of life was also improved. Our recent studies in type 2 diabetes have revealed that systolic blood pressure reduction with GLP -1RA (exenatide) treat ment in type 2 diabetes is associated with increased plasma concentrations of ANP, cGMP and cAMP along with reduced concentrations of angiotensinogen, renin and angiotensin II (7). It is possible that these mechanisms play a role in the prevention of cardi ovascular complications in type 1 diabetes. While GLP -1RAs, therefore, have great potential as adjunct therapy for type 1 diabetes, mean HbA1c was still ≥7% after liraglutide treatment (6) and larger pharma -sponsored trials reported increased rates of hy poglycemia (8, 9). In seeking further improvement, the advent of sodium -glucose transport protein -2 (SGLT2) inhibitors is of importance since their mode of action is independent of insulinogenesis. Introduced for use in type 2 diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors ar e selective antagonists of the sodium -glucose transporter subtype expressed in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidneys. They act by inhibiting renal glucose re -absorption and therefore stimulating excretion of 60 - 100 grams per day of glucose in urin e. SGLT2 inhibitors have been studied extensively in type 2 diabetes, including the landmark cardiovascular outcome trial EMPA -REG (10), but data have only quite recently begun to accumulate in type 1(11). Short term effects on urine glucose excretion of r emogliflozin and empagliflozin are similar to those seen in type 2 diabetes and these translate into improved glycemic and other indices including HbA1c; fasting blood glucose, rates of hypoglycemia, daily insulin dose and weight (12). Weight loss accompan ying increased urinary glucose excretion could translate into reduced cardiovascular complications as in type 2 diabetes, but there are no data so far available to support this hypothesis. More recently, in the Phase 3 trial DEPICT -1 we showed that dapagli flozin improves glycemic control and HbA1c over six months by about 0.45% with no severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis (13). Similarly, sotagliflozin has been shown in a Phase 3 trial to allow a larger proportion of patients to achieve HbA1c lower than 7.0% with no severe hypoglycemia although the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was higher in the sotagliflozin group (14). Both products are now being reviewed by regulatory agencies for the type 1 diabetes indication."
7,page_7,"Page 8 of 62 IRB Version: On the basis of the above, we hypo thesize that adding an SGLT2 inhibitor to a combination of insulin and semaglutide (a weekly and potent GLP -1RA) will improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes such that HbA1c levels of ≤7% are achieved more consistently. Our protocol is designed to allo w an objective assessment of whether this triple therapy combination will work effectively and safely so that a majority of people with type 1 diabetes can reach a glycemic target HbA1c of ≤7%. In addition, since both semaglutide and dapagliflozin inhibito rs reduce blood pressure and weight, it will allow an assessment of the combined effect of GLP -1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors on these outcomes. Since there are no previous data on the effects of once weekly semaglutide or the combination of semaglutide and dap agliflozin compared to standard insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes, the design requires allocation of some participants to insulin therapy only. Preliminary data 1) Liraglutide treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes (4): We treated 8 type 1 diabete s patients; mean age (38.5 years) and duration of diabetes (20 ±4 yrs), with liraglutide in addition to insulin for 24 weeks. As shown in table 1, there was a significant reduction in fasting and mean blood glucose concentrations, insulin doses, HbA1c and a reduction in appetite and caloric intake with weight loss. In addition, there was a reduction in the excursions of blood glucose concentrations, i.e., the standard deviations of blood glucose concentrations were markedly reduced ( figure 1 ). The changes w ere observed within 48h and improved marginally thereafter with fine tuning of insulin doses and a further reduction in these doses. These observations are noteworthy in that study participants were well controlled and meticulous users of CSII and CGM. The y had all tried hard to improve their diabetic control by adjusting insulin doses but had not succeeded because of hypoglycemia. We then demonstrated that poorly controlled and obese individuals with type 1 diabetes also experienced similar benefits of lir aglutide treatment (2). 2) Liraglutide As Additional Treatment to Insulin in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Randomized Clinical Trial (6): Following the two above non -randomized studies we recently conducted a randomized clinical trial in which 72 individuals (Placebo=18; liraglutide = 54) with TYPE 1 DIABETES for at least one year, on insulin therapy and with no detectable C -peptide in plasma (mean BMI: 30±1; mean body weight: 84±2 kg ; mean HbA1c: 7.57±0.09%; mean age: 44±2 years; mean age of TYPE 1 DIABETES diagnosis: 20±1 years) were randomized to receive placebo, 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8mg of liraglutide daily for 12 weeks. In the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg groups, mean change in average blood glucose was -10±2 and -10.0±1mg/dl, respectively, (p<0.0001 vs. pl acebo). In the 1.2mg group, HbA1c fell by 0.78% from 7.84±0.17% to 7.06±0.15% (p<0.0001, p<0.01 vs. placebo) and in the 1.8mg group fell by 0.42% from 7.41±0.15 to 6.99±0.15 (p=0.001, p=0.39 vs placebo). Time spent between 70 to 160 mg/dl increased by 5±1% (p<0.05 vs placebo) and time between 160 -400 mg/dl decreased by 7±1% (p<0.01 vs placebo) in the 1.8 mg group with no additional hypoglycemia. During the 12 week period, the average total daily dose of insulin in the two groups fell by 12.4±3.9 and 10.0±2. 3 units respectively (p<0.05 vs baseline and placebo). There was a reduction in body weight (from 83±4 to 78±5 kg, p<0.0001, in the 1.8mg group, from 96±4 to 91±4 kg, p<0.001, in the 1.2 mg group and from 80±4"
8,page_8,"Page 9 of 62 IRB Version: to 77±4 kg, p<0.01 in the 0.6 mg group). A re duction in daily carbohydrate intake (171±17g vs. 127±18g; p<0.01 and 153±18g vs 115±16g, p<0.01 in the 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg groups, respectively) was also observed over 12 weeks. Systolic BP (SBP) in the 1.8 mg group fell by 3 mmHg (120±2 to 117±3 mmHg, p=0. 01). CRP fell by 15±6 and 19±8% in the 1.2 and 1.8mg groups, respectively (p<0.05). Quality of life improved significantly compared to baseline and placebo (unpublished data). 3) Dapagliflozin as an Additional Treatment to Insulin and Liraglutide in Pati ents with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (15): The objective of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate whether addition of dapagliflozin to insulin and liraglutide results in a significant reduction in glycemia and body weight. 30 participants with TY PE 1 DIABETES on liraglutide therapy for at least last 6 months were randomized (in 2:1 ratio) to receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo daily for 12 weeks. With 12 weeks of dapagliflozin HbA1c fell by 0.66±0.08% from 7.8±0.21% (p < .01 vs placebo) but did not change significantly with placebo (7.40±0.20% to 7.30±0.20%). In one patient within one week of addition of dapagliflozin average glucose fell from 170 to 122 mg/dl while standard deviation was reduced from 71 to 58 ( Figure 2 -diminished glycemi c excursions) . Body weight fell by1.9 +/ - 0.54kg (p < 0.05 vs placebo). There was no additional hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 3.88 mmol/L; p = 0.52 vs placebo). In the dapagliflozin group, there were significant increases in the plasma concentrations of glucagon by 35% +/ - 13% (p < 0.05), hormone -sensitive lipase by 29% +/ - 11% (p < 0.05), free fatty acids by 74% +/ - 32% (p < 0.05), acetoacetate by 67% +/ - 34% (p < 0.05), and beta -hydroxybutyrate by 254% +/ - 81% (p < 0.05). Urinary ketone levels also increa sed significantly (P < .05). None of these changes was observed in the placebo group. Two individuals in the dapagliflozin group developed ketoacidosis. Overall, addition of dapagliflozin to insulin and liraglutide in patients with TYPE 1 DIABETES resulted in a significant improvement in glycemia and in weight loss but tended to increase ketosis."

26,page_26,"Page 27 of 62 IRB Version: Drug Blinding: The randomizations will be performed using an Interactive Web System, hosted by University of Glasgow . One hundred and fourteen (114) patients will be randomized as follows: participants will first be randomized to semaglutide plus usual insulin therapy o r insulin therapy only (no placebo for semaglutide or other placebo injection will be provided) , in a 2:1 ratio. Those who remain on semaglutide at six months will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive dapagliflozin or matched placebo. Each randomiz ation will be stratified by study site. The randomization schedules will be generated by a statistician with no other involvement in the trial, using the method of randomized permuted blocks. Only those staff responsible for the maintenance of the randomiz ation system will have access to the randomization sequences during the trial. The first randomization (which will be revealed to the researcher at the point of randomization) will use random block sizes to reduce predictability. Researchers at study sites will have no knowledge of the next allocation to be issued. The second randomization (which will be double -blind) will use a different. At the point of randomization, the researcher will be given a medication pack ID number, but will not know whether that medication pack contains Dapagliflozin or placebo. For each randomization, a web -based randomization system (developed and maintained by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics) will be used. The system will include an emergency unblinding facility for the dapagliflozin/placebo randomization Astra Zeneca Inc. will supply dapagliflozin and matching placebo tablets in identical packaging and labeling; semaglutide pens will be obtained commercially and will be used in an open label fashion. Breaking of the study blind will be performed only: (i) for SUSARs; and, (ii) where knowledge of the treatment is considered by local health personnel absolutely necessary for further management of the patient. A central unblinding facility based at the Robertson Centre f or Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, will be available by telephone. Notification of all unbli nding will be sent to the Chief Investigator During the course of the trial there will be no attempt to identify group assignment for any participant (except for unblinding in the case of safety concerns) and the investigators will execute the protocol in the manner it was approved independent of the group assignment. Drugs will be stored in a locked cabinet or locked temperature controlled refrigerato r at 4C at the research facility of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Center of WNY. IND application for use of all drugs (dapagliflozin and semaglutide) in type 1 diabetes will be submitted to FDA and no study procedure will start before all local and federa l approvals are obtained. Clinical and Laboratory Procedures 1) CMP, CBC, HbA1c, fructosamine, glucose, glucagon, GLP -1 and FFA measurements: Blood CMP, CBC, HbA1c, fructosamine and glucose will be measured through Quest diagnostic (US site) and NHS labs ( UK site). Free fatty acid levels will be measured by a colorimetric assay (Wako, Richmond, VA). GLP -1 and"
27,page_27,"Page 28 of 62 IRB Version: glucagon will be measured from samples collected in protease and DPP -IV inhibitors by ELISA kits from Millipore. 2) Meal Challenge test: In order to ass ess the postprandial changes induced by dapagliflozin, semaglutide or the combination of both compared to insulin only, a meal challenge will be performed before starting treatments, at six months and at end of study using a 910 Calorie High fat High carbo hydrate meal (HFHC) as in several of our previous studies (HFHC meal includes an egg muffin sandwich, a sausage muffin sandwich and two hash browns which contain 88g carbohydrate, 51 g fat (33% saturated) and 34 g protein ). Participants will be asked to attend fasting prior to breakfast insulin bolus; basal insulin will continue during the duration of the meal, however patients will not bolus until the 3 hour mark unless blood glucose values reach above 400 mg/dL. Sequential blood samples will b e obtained at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min after consuming the meal. Samples at 15, 30, 45, 90 and 150 min will be 5ml while those at 0, 60, 120 and 180min will be 30 ml (total volume=145 ml). Blood will be collected from an indwelling intra venous canula in a superficial forearm vein. 3) Optional 24 hour Ambulatory BP monitoring: Participants will be instructed on the use of 24 hour ambulatory BP monitoring device. This device will measure BP and pulse every 30 minutes for 24 hours. In additi on to the scheduled measurements there will be an option for additional manual measurements if systolic blood pressure is >160 or <90 mmHg. 4) Optional Fat aspiration procedure: Abdominal subcutaneous fat tissue aspiration will be performed at a 10 cm distan ce from umbilicus. Participants will be asked not to take aspirin or NSAIDS in the previous 72 hours - if they have, the procedure will not be done. Skin will be prepared with povidone -iodine (Betadine) and alcohol. A sterile drape will be placed around th e appropriate area. 3cc of 1% lidocaine will then be administered subcutaneously (the dose will not exceed 4.5mg/kg body weight). After adequate anesthesia has been achieved, aspiration of fat tissue will then be with a 3 - holed canula (Tulip Instrumentatio n, length: 15cm, diameter: 2.1mm) fixed to a 10mL syringe. After getting adequate fat tissue (500mg -3g), the puncture site will be pressed for at least ten minutes before the patient rises up from supine position (to minimize bruising). Participants will t hen be discharged home. Adipose tissue will be centrifuged to remove blood and fluid contaminants. Upper adipose tissue will be collected into a separate sterile tube, washed twice with cold sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and centrifuged to remove the PBS. The adipose tissue sample will be weighed and approximately 500 mg transferred to a separate tube for analysis. Total RNA, nuclear extracts and total cell lysates will be prepared. 5) Questionnaires: Participants will be asked to complete the stand ard Diabetes Specific Quality of Life Scale (DSQOLS) and Problem Areas In Diabetes survey (PAID). Questionnaires attached at the end of this plan . 6) MNC isolation (for future ancillary studies): Blood samples will be collected in Na - EDTA as an anticoagulan t. Three and a half mL of anticoagulated blood sample are carefully layered over 3.5 mL of PMN medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON) and then centrifuged. At the end of this process, two bands separate out at the top of the RBC pellet. The top band consists of MNC, while the bottom consists of PMN. The"
28,page_28,"Page 29 of 62 IRB Version: MNC band is harvested and washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS). This method provides yields greater than 95% pure PMN and MNC suspensions. 7) NFB DNA binding activity (for future anci llary studies): Nuclear NFκB DNA binding activity is measured by EMSA. Nuclear extract is prepared from MNC and adipose tissue by high salt extraction as described by Andrews et al (19). The specificity of the bands is confirmed by supershifting these band s with specific antibodies against Rel-A (p65) and p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) and by competition with cold oligonucleotides. DNA binding activity of NF B will be adjusted to Oct1 DNA binding activity to correct for any variable. 8) Plasma concentrations of inflammatory mediators (for future ancillary studies): Concentrations of TNFα, IL -1β, IL-18, adiponectin, IL -1RA will be measured in plasma using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, MN). CRP and SAA concentrations will be measured using an ELISA kit from Alpha Diagnostics International Inc. (San Antonio, TX). 9) Plasma vasodilators and vasoconstrictors (for future ancillary studies): Plasma ANP, NT -proBNP, b -NP, cGMP, cAMP, angiotensinogen, renin and angiotensin II concentrations will be measured by co mmercially available ELISA kits. 10) 15-isoprostane F 2t (also known as 8 -epi-PGF2α or 8 -iso-PGF2α) (for future ancillary studies): will be measured in urine samples using an ELISA kit from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI). 11) Quantification of mRNA in M NC and adipose tissue (for future ancillary studies). Total RNA is isolated from MNC and adipose tissue using commercially available RNAqueous® -4PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The quality and quantity of the isolated RNA is determined before using the RNA. Real Time RT -PCR is performed using Cepheid Smart Cycler (Sunnyvale, CA) in which 2 µL cDNA, 10 µL Sybergreen Master mix (Qiagen, CA) along with 0.5 µL of 20 µM gene specific primers for IL-1β, IL-RA, TLR -4, TNFα, IL -12, SOCS -3 and JNK -1 (Life Technologi es, MD) are used. The specificity and the size of the PCR products are tested by adding a melt curve at the end of the amplifications and by running it on a 2% agarose gel. All values are normalized to 18S expression and β-actin. 10.2 Describe what data will be collected. NOTE: For studies with multiple data collection points or long -term follow up, consider the addition of a schedule or table in your response.

35,page_35,"Page 36 of 62 IRB Version: Data (e.g. date of diagnosis, past medical history, drug treatment) extracted from local clinical record s will be entered on to the eCRF under the study -specific coded identifier according to structured questions as stipulated in the Study Protocol. Biological samples (blood, urine and adipose tissue aspirates) will be collected from the study participants at the study visits according to the Schedule of Assessments in the Study Protocol. Measures relating to safety and routine care of the participants (e.g., biochemical measures of glycemic and lipidemic control, kidney function/ fluid balance, hepatic fu nction, hematological variables) will be analysed at local clinical laboratories in order that they are available to study nurses and physicians. The confidentiality of these data will be secure, meeting or exceeding the regulations of the relevant Ethical Review Committees/ Institutional Review Boards. Samples for measurement of key study outcomes will also be measured at the central laboratory at the University of Buffalo. Blood, urine and other samples will be aliquoted into cryovials at site for freezin g and storage. Electronic stored material (e.g., patient records, data from blood and urine samples, and data from Continuous Glucose Monitoring) will only be stored using the study specific coded identifier. Data will not be identifiable at the participan t level without additional access to the code. The code will be available only to the investigators and the personnel performing the study. Access to any data held electronically will require study specific log -in codes. These are managed and logged by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, UK Statistical plan. The primary objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the effect of addition of dapagliflozin to semaglutide on a background of insulin treatment in type 1 diabetes pa tients on HbA1c at six months following start of dapagliflozin. The similarities between the study groups, baseline values for subject’s demographics and study endpoints will be compared using appropriate parametric tests. Transformations of the data in or der to meet statistical assumptions may be considered. The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a difference in mean HbA1c change after six months of dapagliflozin or placebo addition to semaglutide and insulin treatment. Statistical analysis will be carried out using t -tests to detect difference between groups or the Wilcoxon test for paired data. Tests will be two -sided and tested at the 0.05 level. The results will be summarized as mean±SE. All randomized patients will be included in the analysis o f the primary end point based on an Intent -to-treat model. The secondary endpoints will be to compare changes in HbA1c between each of the triple therapy and dual therapy groups compared to standard of care group, mean weekly glucose concentrations, perce nt time spent in different glycemic thresholds, variability as measured by standard deviation, insulin dose, body weight, carbohydrate intake, blood pressure, and 24 -hour blood pressure and QOL changes among the groups. A reduction in the glucose and gluca gon AUC following the meal will constitute another secondary end point in this setting, ANCOVA analysis will be used."
36,page_36,"Page 37 of 62 IRB Version: 17.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis. NOTE: This may not apply to certain types of studies, including chart/records reviews, survey studies, or observational studies. This question is asked to elicit whether the investigator has an adequate sample size to achieve the study objectives and justify a conclusion. Response: Sample size determination is based in part on our current data s howing that in type 1 diabetes, treatment with a GLP -1 agonist, liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8mg doses) for 3 months leads to HbA1c suppression by an average of 0.6% (SD= 0.5%). Dapagliflozin was recently shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.45% in type 1 diabetes patient s (13). Additionally, empagliflozin treatment for 8 weeks was shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.4% in type 1 diabetics (20, 21) and our current data showing additional improvement in HbA1c by an additional 0.66% at 12 weeks when dapagliflozin was added to liraglu tide and insulin therapy. Conservatively estimating that the combination therapy will suppress HbA1c by 0.5% (SD =<0.7%) compared to semaglutide alone (t -test), a sample size of 38 (32 evaluable patients) in each group will be sufficient to provide adequat e power (β = 0.2) to detect a statistically significant difference (α = 0.05) taking in consideration a 15% dropout rate. 17.3 Describe any procedures that will be used for quality control of collected data. Response: An electronic case report form (e -CRF) will be used to collect study data at each site. The e -CRF will be developed by the study Data Centre at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow. Access to the e -CRF will be restricted, with only authorised site -specific personnel ab le to make entries or amendments to their patients’ data. It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all data captured in the e -CRF. Data will be validated at the point of entry into the e -CRF and at regular inte rvals during the study. Data discrepancies will be flagged to the study site coordinator and any data changes will be recorded in order to maintain a complete audit trail (reason for change, date change made, who made change). The Robertson Centre for Bio statistics at the University of Glasgow will be responsible for collating and cleaning the data for the study. The Robertson Centre will also be responsible for data back -up and security. This center will also manage the electronic reporting of SUSARS on b ehalf of the sponsor.

This section does not apply. NOTE: Minimal risk studies may be required to monitor subject safety if the research procedures include procedures that present unique risks to subjects that require monitoring. Some examples include: exercising to exertion, or instruments that elicit suicidality or substance abuse behav ior. In such cases, N/A is not an acceptable response. 19.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding both harms and benefits to determine whether subjects remain safe. Response: An independent Data safety and monitoring board (D SMB) will be established for this trial. The board will consist of independent faculty members from UB and other institutions with sufficient knowledge of the field of type 1 diabetes but not involved in the study. Data Management team at Robertson Centre will periodically provide the data on which to base regular reports to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The actual reports will then be generated by the unblinded statistician . The DSMB looks only at safety endpoints and not at futility . The DSMB will convene every six months to review safety end points, side-effects experienced by study subjects and any adverse events reported. The site PIs, CO -Is and study"
40,page_40,"Page 41 of 62 IRB Version: coordinator(s) will also continuously monitor the data and safety of subjects enrolled in the s tudy. The site PIs and/or the DSMB may recommend to terminate the study or specific aspects of the study if clear harm is observed with one treatment option compared to standard of care or placebo. Specific safety endpoints that will be reviewed include in creases in hypoglycemic and ketosis/DKA events . 19.2 Describe what data are reviewed, including safety data, untoward events, and efficacy data.

Procedures for eliciting reports of and for recording and reporting adverse event and inter -current illnesses. All adverse events will be reported at the time of the visit or by telephone when it occurs. Medical events that occur between the signing of the Informed Consent and the first intake of study drug will be documented in the medical history. Participants will be asked to report any adverse events in general, non -directed questioning. Fo r each AE volunteered by the subject, the investigator will obtain all the information required to complete the adverse event page of the eCRF, in"
41,page_41,"Page 42 of 62 IRB Version: accordance with the guidelines that accompany it. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study therapy, will be recorded using medical terminology in the source document. Whenever possible, diagnoses will be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as ""upper respiratory infection). Investigators will record on the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy. The principal investigators assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The investigator will report these events to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) in accordance with local regulations. All measures required for AE management wil l be recorded in the source document and reported according to the State University of New York at Buffalo instructions. Non -serious events/problems that impacted on the rights and welfare of the subjects will be reported as they occur or at the time of kn owledge or notification. 19.3 Describe any safety endpoints. Response: These specific Safety endpoints will be collected : 1- Frequency and severity of hypoglycemia : Hypoglycemia will be assessed throughout the study via multiple daily finger stick glucose measurements, CGM data collected 3 times (about 3 weeks each) during the study and from patient reports during visits and phone calls. Hyp oglycemic events will be characterized as in the experts consensus published in Diabetes Care (2017 Dec; 40(12): 1622 - 1630): • Level 1: Glucose < 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) and Glucose ≥ 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) • Level 2: Glucose < 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) • Level 3: A severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance . 2- Ketones levels: Uri nary ketones measured daily at home and logged in the ketones logbook. Blood and urinary ketones measured during each visit. Ketone levels will be characterized as normal, ketosis and severe ketosis: -Normal blood ketones <0.6mM or urinary ketones of trace to small (≥+1) -Ketosis: Blood ketones >0.6mM <2.5mM or urinary ketones of moderate to high (+2 and +3) -Severe ketosis Blood ketones >2.5mM or urinary ketones of too high (+4) 3- Diabetes ketoacidosis episodes: any confirmed DKA episode (regardless of hospitalization ) defined as: • Elevated serum or urine ketones (greater than the upper limit of the normal range), and • Serum bicarbonate < 15 mmol/L or Blood pH < 7.3 4- Low blood pressure: <90mmHg SBP and <50 mmHg DBP): Patients will be instructed to measure blood pressure daily and it will be will be assessed in each visit."
42,page_42,"Page 43 of 62 IRB Version: 5- Nausea, vomiting and other GI side effects. Data will be collected by patients’ safety reports, during visits and phone calls. 6- Genital mycotic infections or UTIs 7- Changes i n liver and kidney function: CMP and kidney and liver profiles will be assessed as indicated in table 1. 19.4 Describe how the safety information will be collected (e.g., with case report forms, at study visits, by telephone calls with participants). Response: The safety information will be collected at the time of the visit, and or during preplanned telephone calls with the participant or patient self -reporting (including glucose, food intake and ketones diaries) . Data will be entered into eCRFs 19.5 Describe the frequency of safety data collection. Response: Safety data collection will be done at all study visits and during preplanned phone calls as in table 1 . The patient, however, will be asked to report any adverse event or safety related information via phone as soon as it occurs and it will be reviewed the same day. 19.6 Describe who will review the safety data. Response: DSMB established for this study will review unblended safety data provided by the data management system every 6 months. Additionally, the PIs and coinvestigators will review safety data (listed above) at the completion of each visits by each subject and review any report of side effects or adverse events as they are presented by the patients. The investigators will also review collective blinded data every 3 months to assess the safety and any potential risks to the participants. Furthermore the investigators will assess other risks including the physical, psychological, social, legal and economic harm to these patients. The investigators will ca refully watch for any invasion of privacy and breach of confidentiality. The principal investigator will be sharing the results of safety analysis of the study and serious adverse events with the local IRB, DSMB, JDRF, A Z and the FDA . The study groups will remain blinded. If there are a serious safety concerns or an emergency, then, and based on principal investigator discretion, study randomization center in Glasgow University or the unblended statistician will provide information about group assignment of the patient(s) involved. Un -blinded data will be reviewed by the principal investigator and co -investigators and decision to complete, withdraw or adjust dose of drug(s) will be made, documented and shared with IRB and DSMB . 19.7 Describe the frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data. Response: Safety data will be reviewed every 3 months. Study endpoint data will be reviewed once after half of the recruited patients have completed the study and then at the end o f the study."
43,page_43,"Page 44 of 62 IRB Version: Response: Safety data will be reviewed every 6 months by DSMB (un -blinded), every 3 months by PIs and CO -Is (blinded) and at every visit by study team . 19.8 Describe the statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine whether harm i s occurring. Response: N/A 19.9 Describe any conditions that trigger an immediate suspension of the research. Response: No interim analysis is planned for efficacy so termination of study will be related to safety. Significant increases in severe hypoglycemic or DKA events as reviewed by DSMB are possible causes that might trigger termination of study. 20.0 Withdrawal of Subjects ☐ N/A: This study is not enrolling subjects. This section does not apply. 20.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be withdrawn from the research without their consent. 1. The site PI can stop investigational study treatment or remove participants from the trial without participants approval if for any reason he/she feels is appropriate, including: severe side effect , injury or medical condition which may place the patient at risk of further complications if he/she continue to participate, failure to take the medication as instructed, failure to keep scheduled appointments, cancellation of the study by the sponsor, IR B, FDA or other administrative reasons. 2. If any of the participants become pregnant during the period of study, they will discontinue study treatment. 3. Participants who experience persistent severe nausea or vomiting after starting semaglutide which is not managed by dose reduction will discontinue the investigational study treatment. Those with mild or moderate nausea will continue for at least one more week. If they continue to experience significant nausea (defined as interfering with normal activiti es), dose will be reduce d. If they continue to have these side effects, they will discontinue study medication(s). 4. Participants who develop a new thyroid tumor during the study will discontinue the study medication(s). Patients will be informed that they should let study investigators know if they develop any swelling in the neck. 5. Developing other conditions included in the exclusion criteria 6. Change in method of insulin delivery between insulin pumps to MDI or vice versa during the study. Also, patients wh o upgrade to the new “artificial pancreas ” pump (Medtronic’s MiniMed 670G hybrid) during the study will be withdrawn."
44,page_44,"Page 45 of 62 IRB Version: 7. Hypoglycemia: Two episodes of severe hypoglycemia (requiring others help). 8. Ketosis (with no other identifiable precipitating factors): Per sistent (1week) asymptomatic and unmanaged ketone levels >2.5 mM (+4 in urine) or persistent (1 week) symptomatic and unmanaged ketone levels >1.5 mM (+3 in urine). 9. Total insulin dose of <0.3U/Kg with persistent ketosis (>1.5mM or +3 in urine) 10. DKA: Two ep isode of DKA (with no identifiable precipitating factors) as defined by the expert consensus statement (Diabetes Care (2017 Dec; 40(12): 1622 -1630) ) 11. Two episodes of UTI. 12. Two episodes of mycotic genital infection. 13. Significant persistent change in eGFR > 15 ml/min 14. Pancreatitis: One episode of pancreatitis. 15. Other persistent side effects specific to study drugs 20.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination. NOTE: Examples may include return of study drug, exit interview with clinician. Include whether additional follow up is recommended for safety reasons for physical or emotional health. Response: Participation in this study is voluntary. Participants have the right to refuse to participate or to withdraw from participation at any time for any reason. Refusal to participate or to withdraw from the study will involve no penalty or loss of entitled benefits, nor affect ongoing medical care. The site PI can stop investigational study treatment or remove participants from the trial without participants appr oval. If a patient withdraws consent and decide not to participate in the study, she/he will be asked to undergo a final study visit for his/her safety. If a subject withdraws from the research, the data collected to that point will be used toward the rese arch finding. If applicable the subject will have to bring back any unused research drug and or device s. 20.3 Describe procedures that will be followed when subjects withdraw from the research, including retention of already collected data, and partial withdra wal from procedures with continued data collection, as applicable. Response: We will use the data collected up to the point of stopping the study. No further information will be collected. Patients who stop study treatment and are interested in continuing in the study will be followed up until the end of the study for the primary end point and select secondary endpoints based on the Intent -To- Treat (ITT) analysis model. Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. The study sample size calculation includes an additional 15% subjects to compensate for drop out. 21.0 Risks to Subjects 21.1 List the reasonably foreseeable risks, discomforts, hazards, or inconveniences to the subjects related to their participation in the research. Consider physical, psychological, social , legal, and economic risks. Include a description of the probability, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the risks. NOTE: Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data."
45,page_45,"Page 46 of 62 IRB Version: Response: • Risks associated with intravenous (IV) line: All participants will be informed of the potential complications of an intravenous (IV) line, which include mild bruising at the site of IV line, usually resolving in a few days. They will also be informed about the possibility of infiltration of th e IV line at the time of performing blood draws or during the meal challenge test in which case another IV line at a different site will be required (with risk of bruising at more than one site). • Risks associated with 24 hour Ambulatory BP monitoring devi ce: The BP cuff inflates every 15 minutes to record blood pressure over 24 -hours. Participants will experience a pressure -like sensation over the arm where 24 hour BP device is worn at the time of the BP being measured due to the inflation of the cuff and release of this pressure at the time of deflation of the BP cuff. They will be informed to remove the cuff after 24 hours. If worn for longer periods they may experience mild bruising over the arm and some swelling, usually resolving 1 - 2 days after discont inuation. • Risks associated with fat tissue aspiration: will probably lead to a bruise at the site of aspiration. The site may be mildly painful for 1 -2 weeks. Participants are advised to call their study site staff if they have more severe pain or swelli ng at the site after the procedure. Rarely there are side effects such as low BP or heart rate and/or allergic reaction to local anesthetic including swelling of the throat. • All subjects will be referred to semaglutide and dapagliflozin labeling safety information, and will be given a copy of the package insert of the medication. Discussion of the potential side effects and the different warning and precautions will take place at the time of informed consent. Patients will be informed they must not discont inue their insulin during the study. • Potential risk of insulin, GLP -1 RA and SGLT -2 inhibitors use in type 1 diabetes patients is hypoglycemia . The combination therapy can possibly increase the magnitude and frequency of this risk. • Potential side effects of GLP -1 RA and SGLT -2 inhibitors also include hypotension, nausea and other GI side effects , polydipsia, polyuria, dehydration, ketosis, and reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). • In rodents, semaglutide causes dose -dependent and treatment -duration - dependent thyroid C -cell tumors at clinically relevant exposures. However, it received FDA -approval for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2017 following large Phase 3 trials including the cardiovascular safety trial SUSTAIN -6. • On the basis of the above rodent studies, semaglutide is contraindicated in those with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and in patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). However, following review of human data with GLP -1RAs, FDA does not require or suggest routine monitoring of serum calcitonin/ thyroid ultrasound in people treated with semaglutide. • Injection -site reactions: Serious injection -site reactions, with or without bumps (nodules), have happened in som e people who use GLP -1RAs but are less frequent with semaglutide. Injection -site reactions have rarely required surgical"
46,page_46,"Page 47 of 62 IRB Version: intervention. Participants will be instructed to report any injection site reactions including nodules to study investigators. • Kidney injury: GLP -1 RA might cause acute kidney injury in patients without underlying renal disease especially in patient who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or dehydration. Dapagliflozin also has warnings and precautions against acute kidney injury and impairment in renal function. • As mentioned above, there is a risk of ketoacidosis, as shown by some studies and by our data, when SGLT2 inhibitors are used in type 1 diabetes. In our own preliminary studies on triple therapy, we observed euglycemic ke toacidosis in participants whose insulin doses had been reduced by > 20% of baseline levels . Thus, this adverse effect is largely attributable to insulinopenia as well as anti - insulin effects of SGLT2 inhibitors at the hepatic level (e.g. increased glucone ogenesis). • The following other known adverse effects of SGLT -2 inhibitors will be discussed with participants when obtaining informed consent: 1. Risk of dizziness/ symptomatic hypotension: can occur soon after initiation due to intravascular volume con traction. 2. Impaired kidney function: As SGLT -2 inhibitors increase serum creatinine and decrease eGFR, this will be monitored closely. 3. Genital mycotic infections: SGLT -2 inhibitors increase the risk of genital mycotic infections, particularly in w omen. Those with a prior history are more susceptible. Following topical treatment with anti -fungal medications they rarely re -occur. 4. Bladder Cancer - Across 22 clinical studies, newly diagnosed cases of bladder cancer were reported in 10/6045 patients (0.17%) treated with Dapagliflozin and 1/3512 patient (0.03%) treated with placebo. After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis, there were 4 cases of bladder cancer with dapagliflozin and no cas es with placebo i.e. too few cases to determine causality. 5. The dapagliflozin tablets and matching placebo contain lactose, which may cause discomfort in lactose -intolerant individuals.  Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to study drugs or placebo ing redients or other interventions may accrue in rare cases.  There might be other unforeseen risks associated with the use of these agents in type 1 diabetes and additional unforeseen risks associated with the combination therapy.  There is always the risk of breach of confidentiality where patients’ identifiable data is compromised. 21.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks, including procedures being performed to monitor subjects for safety. Response: The following are procedures to lessen the probability and magnitude of risks listed above: 1- Hypoglycemia:"
47,page_47,"Page 48 of 62 IRB Version: - Patients will be instructed to measure glucose at least 4 times a day (before meals and at bedtime) through -out the study and record all reading. - Insulin dose adjustments will be done at every visit to avoid hypoglycemia. However, there will be no preemptive insulin dose reduction at start of treatment since all patients will have HbA1c > 7.5% and the risk of hypoglycemia will be minimal when semaglutide is added . - Daily fingerstick glucose, CGM and insulin pump data will be reviewed by the investigators for optimal titration of insulin dose to target glucose levels between 90-160mg/dl. - In general, insulin dose adjustments should not be >10% from current total insulin dose (or 5% if HbA1c is <7%) or >20% from baseline total insulin dose at week 0 and then at week 26 . - Patients will be trained in CARB counting to avoid inaccurate insulin dose administration. - Patients will be trained to recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia and how to manage it at home. These symptoms include feeling shaky, being nervous or anxious, sweating, chills and clamminess, confusion, fast heartbeat, feeling lightheaded or dizzy, hunger, nausea and color draining from the ski n (pallor) among others. They will be asked to call the research office or the on call clinical services. - When patients feel symptoms of hypoglycemia they will be asked to measure blood glucose and if <70mg/dl they will be instructed to consume carbohydr ate or 4 tablets of glucose (4gm each). If after 15 min hypoglycemia continues, repeat carb intake until sugar levels are above 70 mg/dl. If sugar levels are below 55mg/dl, glucagon injection is permitted as rescue medication for severe hypoglycemia. - Patients will be instructed to inform people who they are in frequent contact with (for example, friends, family members, and coworkers) on how to give glucagon to treat severe hypoglycemia. If patient have needed glucagon previously, it should be documented during screening visit so more emphasis on ways to prevent severe hypoglycemia in the future can be discussed. - Patients/family will be instructed not to hesitate to call 911 if someone is unconscious and glucagon is not available or someone does not know how to use it and not to inject insulin (it will lower their blood glucose even more) or provide food or fluids (they can choke). They will be asked to document all details of the incident and report to research staff as soon as possible. - Study med ications dose will be reduced in patients who continue to have more than 2 measurements of glucose levels in the hypoglycemic range (<70mg/dl, regardless of symptoms) after insulin dose is reduced by the maximum allowed in this study. 2- Ketosis and Ketoacid osis: - Patients will be instructed to measure ketone bodies in urine samples daily starting at week 26 with Ketostix (Bayer) and record it in diary provided. Ketones (blood urine) will be measured at every visit. If ketone bodies in urine measure +2 or grea ter (>4mM in urine), patients are required to notify the research center."
48,page_48,"Page 49 of 62 IRB Version: - Patients will be provided training to recognize the signs and symptoms of DKA and to self -test urine ketones on a PRN basis (in addition to once daily) if they develop any symptoms c onsistent with DKA, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, confusion, or shortness of breath. This should be reported regardless of blood sugar levels since in type 1 diabetes on SGLT -2 inhibitors, DKA can occur even in normal glucose levels. - Insulin dose c hanges should not be greater than 10% (5% if HbA1c is<7%) from current levels and not changed by more than 20% from baseline levels at 0 weeks and then at 26 weeks. Also, on the basis of o ur data and clinical experience and based of DEPICT -1 study total da ily insulin dose should not be lower ed below 0.3 U/Kg body weight. - Patients requiring an insulin dose below 0.3U/Kg with blood ketones levels <1.5mM and no symptoms will be monitored closely for ketones and blood sugar. If levels are stable, patients will be allowed to continue in the study. If total insulin dose is <0.3 U/Kg and ketones levels are >1.5mM, regardless of symptoms, they will be withdrawn from study. - We shall not increase dose of dapagliflozin in patients who exhibit significant ketonuria (+3) with the lower dose. Urinary ketones (and blood ketones if patients have a dual glucose and ketone meter) will be monitored daily and reported. Dapagliflozin will be temporarily (1 week) discontinued and STICH protocol (STop SGLT -2i, give Insulin bolus, Carbohydrate, and Hydration) activated in events of DKA or if based on investigator discretion if blood ketone levels are persistently (1 week) >1.5 mM (+3 in urine) with symptoms or >2.5 mM (+4 in urine) without symptom. These cut -off levels are below the cut-off levels of DKA >7 -10mM. Dapagliflozin may also be temporarily stopped in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis (e.g. prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery). Patients will be instructed to stay hydrated and not reduce t heir caloric intake (especially carbohydrates) or start new dietary systems (especially ketogenic diets) during the study. - If a patient develops symptoms of DKA or ketone levels exceed the allowed limit in this study, STICH protocol (STop SGLT -2i, give I nsulin bolus, Carbohydrate, and Hydration) will be activated. T hey could be managed for up to a week. If symptoms and ketone levels persist over 1 week, patients will be withdrawn form study. Insulin infusions may be administered by ER or hospital if patie nts develop DKA. They will be asked to document all details of the incident and report to research staff as soon as possible. 3- Risk of acute kidney injury or renal function impairment: CBC, CMP, including kidney function test and urinary markers will be performed at screening, during and at end of the study (table 1). Additional testing will be performed in patients who suffer from sever nausea or GI symptoms or hypovolemic and during the up titration of investigation drugs. If acute kidney injury occurs dapagliflozin will be discontinued immediately. To lessen the chance of this risk, patients will eGFR< 60 ml/min/1.7 3m2 will be excluded. Patients will also discontinue study medications if eGFR falls by >15 ml/min in 2 repeated measurements. Also other patients with factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury e.g. hypovolemia, chronic renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, if patients are"
49,page_49,"Page 50 of 62 IRB Version: on AEI, ARB, NSAID will be excluded. Dapagliflozin will be temporarily discontinued in any setti ng of reduced oral intake such as acute illness or fasting or fluid losses such as gastrointestinal illnesses, or excessive heat exposure. 4- Injection site reactions, mycotic infections and complications of IV and biopsy collection will also be monitored, Physical examination will be performed at screening 26, and 52 weeks visits. Safety vital assessments will be performed at every visit. Pregnancy will be tested at screening, 0, 4 13, 26, 39, and 52 weeks. Phone calls will be made for safety and compliance at least 7 time during the study. The patients, however, will be instructed to report any adverse event or safety related information via phone as soon as it occurs. All safety data will be reviewed by the PI or sub -investigators within 1 -2 days of collec tion. 5- Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis with no absolute contraindication to its use. Our site and staff are trained and equipped to assist patients with such reactions. Severe conditions that are not satisfactory managed in site will be transferred to the hospital emergency department for further assessment and help. 21.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures may have risks to the subjects that are currently unforeseeable. Response: There might be additional adverse effects of dapagliflozin not currently known or those unique to their use in Type 1 diabetes. There is no previous studies on the use of semaglutide in type 1 diabetes; therefore, additional unforeseen risk may be encounte red in this study. Additionally, unforeseen risks might be associated with the combination therapy that might involve unknown drug -drug interactions. 21.4 If applicable, indicate which research procedures may have risks to an embryo or fetus should the subject be or become pregnant. Response: Not applicable, we will not be enrolling pregnant participants or who may become pregnant or with in child baring years without signing the consent stating they will use at least two forms of birth control. If a participant becomes pregnant they will be withdrawn from the study immediately. They will be followed until term and any effects on the newborn will be documented. 21.5 If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects. Response: We do not anticipate any addit ional risk to others not participating in this study. 22.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects"
50,page_50,"Page 51 of 62 IRB Version: 22.1 Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects may experience by taking part in the research. Include the probability, magnitude, and duration of the potential benefits. Indicate if there is no direct benefit. NOTE: Compensation cannot be stated as a benefit. Response: The investigational drugs used in this study are already approved as antidiabetic agents for treating type 2 diabetes. Both agents have demonstrated significant improvement in HbA1c, weight and blood pressure.
