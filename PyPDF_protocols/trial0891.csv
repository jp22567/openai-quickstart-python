Secti on 1.2 (Synopsis): Updated to reflect changes in the CSP text, including the study period changed due to prol onged recrui tment, and the exact aligning o f the endpo int wording with the one in Sect ion 3. Secti on 3 (OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS): Primary and key secondary object ives were combined into dual primary object ives and sample size was increased to 500, to increase the power in evaluat ing the effect of dapagliflozin on KCCQ in HFpEF subjects. Exploratory objectives were reordered and rephrased. Section 4.1 (Overall design): The target of having approximately 400 patients randomized was changed to 500. Secti on 4.2 (Sci entific rat ionale for the study ): Explanat ion of using pre-specified 5 -point threshold in KCCQ was added. Secti on 5.1 and 5.2 (Inclu sion criteria and Exclusion criteria) were clarified. Secti on 6.3.1.2 (Capping) was updated to allow it on a level lower than the who le study . Secti on 7.1.1.1 (Unexpected acute declines in eGFR): a clarificat ion note added. Secti on 7.4 (Discontinuation of the study ): Reasons for the early closure of the study site were added as per m ore recent protocol template.

Secti on 9 (STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS) revised for consistency wit h the changes introduced in the objectives and sample size. General: minor edit ing corrections for consistency in minor sect ions. Versi on 3.0 4 March 2020The m ain purpose of this amendment was to add a primary object ive to the study (ie, effect on physical limitat ion). The primary object ives arenow to determine whether dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reducing heart failure symptoms, reducing physical limitat ion, or improving exercise capacit y in patients with chronic heart failure. The family o f primary endpoints are KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD. Most amendments were consequent ial to the change in primary object ives/endpoints. The secondary objective/endpoint was swi tched with one of the exploratory object ives/endpo ints and exploratory endpo ints were revised. The remaining amendments were intended to add cl arity and correct minor errors. The following details the key changes: Secti on 1.2 (Synopsis): Updated to reflect changes in the CSP text, including the changes to the objectives/endpo ints as detailed in Secti on 3. Secti on 2: (INTRODUCT ION) Updated to reflect changes in the objectives/endpo ints as detailed in Sect ion 3. Secti on 3 (OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS): A third primary efficacy objective/endpoint was added (ie, KCCQ -PLS). The secondary object ive/endpo int (now ‘total t ime spent in lig ht to vigorous physical act ivity’) was switched wit h an exploratory objective/endpo int (now ‘movement intensit y during walking’). The exploratory KCCQ endpo ints and t he descript ion of the subset of patients to be assessed for certain exploratory measures were revised .

The result from the final randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. See footnote i for calcula tion example. bVisits 1, 2, 3 and 5 are all clinical visits that are conducted at the study site, while Visit 4 is conducted by telephone with the patient not at the study site. In exceptional cases, for the patient’s convenience, it is allowed to conduct t his visit on -site. cPatients may withdraw from participating in the study, or they may discontinue taking study medication early but remain in th e study (ie, continue attending study visits and completing study assessments). As far as possible, all assessme nts planned for Visit 5 (Final visit) should be also performed at an Early Withdrawal Visit and at an Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit. At a minimum, safety assessments, PROs, and the 6MWT (if th e patient is able) should be performed. Patients who dis continue treatment early but remain in the study may resume taking study medication again as soon as they are able to and wish to. An Unscheduled Visit may be performed at any time after randomisation, if required in the opinion of the Investigato r, with t he assessments required given in Section 8. dAll PROs will be administered using a site - based electronic tablet, except for the patient global impres sion of change in walking ability and the Borg CR10 Scale® score, which will both be administered on paper. To avoid bias in patient responses, all PRO questionnaires must be co mpleted prior to any other study procedures, following informed consent, except for the Borg CR10 Scale® score, which forms part of the 6MWT. Patients will first complete the patient global impression of change in walking ability followed by the PROs on the site -based electronic tablet, which should all be completed before the 6MWT. eThe 6MWT consists of a suite of assessments that are carried out before and after the 6MWT itself: seated pulse rate, blood p ressure, oxygen saturation and the Borg CR10 Scale® score for dyspnoea and fatigue. fThe 6MWD for each patient, determined from the 6MWT, will first be recorded on paper before being transferred to the eCRF by the Investigator or site staff later."
13,page_13,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 14of 119gA number of measures have been introduced to minimise variability in patient performance of the 6MWT. Prior to initiating tes ting, ever y effort should be made by the Investigator to establish that the patient is in their “usual” state of health: meaning that the patient has no c oncurrent medical issues (eg, upper respiratory tract infection, COPD/chronic heart failure exacerbation, exacerbatio n of musculoskeletal difficulties, etc) that might adversely affect his or her performance of the 6MWT. In the event that such conditions are present, the test should be aborted and rescheduled within a 1 4day window, to allow time for the resolution of th e acute medical issue and the patient to return to his or her “usual” state of health. hAt Visit 1 (Enrolment), if the 6MWD is outside the range of ≥100 metres and ≤425 metres the patient is NOT eligible for inclusion ORrescreening in the study, and will, thus, be considered a screen failure. iAt Visit 2a (Randomisation A), if the 6MWD is outside the range of ≥100 metres and ≤425 metres the patient is NOT eligible for inclusion ORrescreening in the study, and will, thus, be considered a screen failure. If the 6MWD at Visit 2a (Randomisation A) is within the range of ≥100 metres and ≤425 metres, but the 6MWD recorded at Visit 1 (Enrolment) is not within ±15% of the 6MWD recorded at Visit 2a (Randomisation A), the patient must stop Visit 2a (Randomisation A) immediately; if the difference is within ±15%, the patient can be randomised into the study, with remaining assessments at Visit 2a being completed and does not need to perform V isit2b (Randomisation B). (Inclusion criterion #7). Calculation: Let E be the 6MWD at Visit 1 (Enrolment), let Ra be the 6MWD at Visit 2a (Randomisation A) and let Rb be the 6MWD at Visit 2b (Randomisation B). The 15% variability criterion at Visit 2a (R andomisation A) is fulfilled if E ≥ Ra*0.85 and E ≤ Ra*1.15. The 15% variability criterion at Visit 2b (Randomisation B) is fulfilled if Ra ≥ Rb*0.85 and Ra ≤ Rb*1.15. Example 1: If a subject has 6MWD at Visit 1 (Enrolment) equal to 170 metres and 6MWD at Visit 2a (Randomisation A) equal to 200 metres, then the variability is (170-200)/200 which is within ±15% and the subject fulfils the variability requirement in inclusion criterion #7. Example 2: If a subject has 6MWD at Visit 1 (Enrolment) equal to 200 metres and 6MWD at Visit 2a (Randomisation A) equal to 170 metres, then the variability is (200-170)/170 which is not within ±15% and the subject does not fulfil the variability requirement in inclusion criterion #7. Example 3: If a subject has 6MWD at Vi sit 2a (Randomisation A) equal to 340 metres and 6MWD at Visit 2b (Randomisation B) equal to 400 metres, then the variability is (340-400)/400 which is within ±15% and the subject fulfils the variability requirement in inclusion criterion #7. jIf a patient fails the 6MWD variability, described in inclusion criterion #7, at Visit 2a (Randomisation A) he/she can repeat the 6MWT within 1 week at Visit 2b (Randomisation B). At Visit 2b (Randomisation B), if the 6MWD is outside the range of ≥100 metres and ≤425 metres the patient is NOT eligible for inclusion ORrescreening in the study, and will, thus, be considered a screen failure. If the 6MWD at Visit 2b (Randomisation B) is within the range ≥100 metres and ≤425 metres, but the 6MWD recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misation A) is not within ±15% of the 6MWD recorded at Visit 2b (Randomisation B) the patient is excluded from the study and considered a screening failure; if the difference is within ±15% the patient can be randomised into the study with the remaining as sessments at Visit 2b (Randomisation B) being completed. The result from the final randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. See the above footnote i for the calculation example. kApplicable only for the early withdrawal visit. lPatients will b e reminded not to take IP at home on the days they attend the clinic for Visit 5 (Final visit). mTwo distinct types of wearable activity monitor will be used in this study. At a subset of study sites, patients will wear an activity monito r during the 6MWT; this one is for use in the clinic only (wearable activity monitor A), and it is different to the activity monitor that will b e dispensed for use at home (wearable activity monitor B).

The family of primary efficacy endpoints (KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD) will be analysed based on a rank analysis of covariance model with rank -based change fro m baseline at Week 16 as the dependent variable. Rank -based basel ine value will be included as a covari ate al ong wi th the stratificat ion factor used in the rando misat ion. Ti es will be assigned the mean of the corresponding ranks. In this analysis, data that are missing due to death will be ranked “worse” than observed d ata and data missing for reasons other than death, and the ranking amongst the deceased pat ients will be based on the last value while alive. Missing data due to reasons other than death (eg, missing visit s, early wit hdrawal fro m the study , including lost to fo llow-up) will be replaced by multiple imputation with predictive mean matching. Rank analysis of covariance will then be applied to each imputation dataset and resul ts will be pool ed across datasets.

22,page_22,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 23of 1192 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Study rationale Chronic heart failure (HF) continues to be a major cause of mortalit y, hospitalisat ions and suboptimal qualit y of life. Even wit h the best possible treatment, the five -year survival rate for HF patients is worse than for most cancers ( Braunwald 2015 ). Moreover, the prevalence o f chronic HF cont inues to increase globally. An estimated 38 millio n people are affected worldwide ( Braunwald 2015 ), with over 1 millio n hospi talisat ions annually in both the United States and Europe ( Ambrosy et al 2014 ). The annual global economic burden in 2012 was estimated to be $108 billio n (Cook et al 2014 ); this will increase dramat ically as the popul ation ages. HF is a complex syndro me caused by structural and/or funct ional abnormalit ies. It is characterised by dyspnoea, fat igue, and pulmo nary congestion and/or peripheral oedema due to fluid retention. Patients with signs and symptoms of HF are categorised, based on measurement of left -ventri cular eject ion fraction (LVEF), as having HF wit h reduced LVEF (HFrEF) or HF with preserved LVEF (HFpEF); this study invest igates patients with the latter. For the purposes of this study , HFpEF is defined as LVEF >40% (HFrEF is usually defined as LVEF ≤40%). It shoul d be noted that HF patients with a LVEF value of 40% to 50% often represent a separate population ( Ponikowski et al 2016 ). Therefore, in this study , pati ents wi th a LVEF value above 40% and below 50% will be evaluated as a subgroup in supportive analyses. The proportion of patients in the study with a LVEF value above 40% and below 50% at baseline will be mo nitored to ensure that the majorit y of patients have an LVEF value above 50%. Approxim ately half of all HF patients have HFpEF ( Oktay et al 2 013). Risk of death for HFpEF pat ients is high, wi th annualised m ortali ty rate up to 15% in com munit y settings ( Lam et al 2011 ). Pati ents wi th HFpEF have a particularly significant unm et medical need given that outcom e studi es hitherto perform ed have not resulted in any approved pharmacotherapy specifically for this condit ion. Conversely , outcome studi es have provided evidence for treatm ents for HFrEF that can improve symptoms and haemodynamics as well as reduce hospi talisat ions for HF and mortali ty. These treatments include diuretics, angiotensin convert ing enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin II receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and beta -blockers ( Iwaz et al 2016). Recent data from cardio vascular outcome studies of sodium -glucose co -transporter - 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors (empagliflozin and canagliflozin) indicate that treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors can red uce the risk of cardio vascular death and hospitalisat ion due to HF in patients with Type 2 di abetes m ellitus (T2DM) overall , and in pat ients with T2DM and conco mitant"

In thi s study , pati ents will be treated wi th the SGLT2 inhibitor, dapagliflozin, or matching placebo and their changes in HF symptoms, physical limitat ion, and exercise capacit y over 16 weeks will be assessed. Patients’ HF symp toms and physical limitat ionwill be measured using the Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Questi onnai re Total Symptom Score (KCCQ -TSS) and Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Quest ionnaire Physical Limitat ion Score (KCCQ -PLS) , respectively . Pati ents’ exercise capacit y will be m easured using the 6 -minute walk test (6MWT; the distance a patient can walk in a 6 -minute period, the 6MWD). The 6MWT is a standard m ethod ( Holland et al 2014 , American Thoracic Societ y 2002) f or measuring the exercise response to medical interventions in pat ients with moderate to severe heart or lung disease, having already been used to give pre -treatment and post -treatm ent com parisons for patients wi th HF ( DeBock et al 1994 , O’Keeffe et al 1998 ). In addit ion, pati ent heal th-related qualit y of life will be assessed using various pat ient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. The intention is to determine whether, with once daily administration over a 16- week period, 10mg dapagliflozin is superior to placebo for reducing HF symptoms, reducing physical limitation , or im proving exercise capacit y in pat ients wi th HFpEF. 2.2 Background Dapagliflozin is a potent, hi ghly select ive and orally act ive inhibitor of human renal SGLT2. A detailed description o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of dapagliflozin is provi ded in the Invest igator’s Brochure. Observat ions from the overall dapagliflozi n clinical development programme suggest that dapagliflozin may increase exercise capacit y in HFpEF patients (as a surrogate measure of daily act ivity) irrespective of diabetes status. Dapagliflozin lowers glycated haemoglo bin (HbA1c) with a low risk of in ducing hypoglycaemia. In addition, dapagliflozin treatment has also been shown to reduce weight and systolic blood pressure, and to have favourable effect on increased blood uric acid, albuminuria, and arterial elasticity, condi tions which are associ ated w ith increased cardiovascular and renal risk (Shigiyama et al 2017 ). Dapagliflozin is believed to be nephroprotective through non-glycaemic mechanisms ( Wanner et al 2016 ). In combinat ion, the i dentified blood pressure -and body weight -lowering effects of dapagliflozin, may help to increase the exercise capaci ty in the HFpEF populat ion, a popul ation with a high prevalence of hypertensio n and obesit y. The findings fro m EMPA -REG OUTCOME study (Fitchett et al 2016 ), with a similar SGLT2 inhibitor compound, suggests that kidney function is preserved, or improved, in this diabet ic study popul ation. Furthermore, HFpEF patients are characterised by fluid retention and a change in cardi ac metabo lism favouring glucose as substrate, both of which have been hypothesised to be affected posit ively by SGLT2 inhibitor treatment. Moreover, arterial st iffness, and"
24,page_24,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC0 0001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 25of 119abnorm al ventriculo-arteri al coupling, are commo n in pat ients with HFpEF, and m ay be modified by SGLT2 inhi bitor treatments ( Borlaug and Paulus 2011 ). The clinical studies in healt hy subjects at high multiple doses also show that, due to the mechanism o f action, dapagliflozin does not induce hypoglycaemia in non- diabet ic subjects; however, pharmacodynamic effects on glucose, sodium, and urinary vo lume are observed. Therefore, the changes in these diabetes -independent mechanisms and intra -renal physio logy are expected to be similar, regardless of underlying disease. This is an international, mult i-centre, parallel -group, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase III study in HFpEF patients, evaluat ing the effect of dapagliflozin 10mg versus placebo ( given once daily in addit ion to background local standard of care therapy , including treatments to con trol co-morbidities) on change in HF symptoms as measured by KCCQ -TSS, physical limitat ionas measured by KCCQ -PLS, and exercise capacit y as measured by 6MWD. 2.3 Benefit/risk assessment Dapagliflozin has global market ing approval in mo re than 90 countries. More detailed inform ation about the known and expected benefit s and risks and reasonably expected adverse events (AEs) of dapagliflozin may be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure. The fo llowing is a summary of benefit -risk considerat ions relevant to the HFpEF target population. 2.3.1 Potential risks to patients The safet y profile of dapagliflozin is already well established fro m clinical studies for T2DM and t ype 1 diabetes m ellitus and is generally safe and well -tolerated. Dapagliflozin, as an inhibitor of SGLT2, increases urinary glucose excret ions, which is commo nly believed to i ncrease the risk of urinary tract infect ions. Urinary tract infect ions have been reported in dapagliflozin -treated pati ents in a slight ly higher proportion than in placebo -treated pati ents in so me glo bal phase III studies. Increased urinary glucose excret ion may also lead to an increased risk of developing genital infect ions. Urinary tract infections are considered a commo n side effect (in ≥1/100 to <1/10 patients). Dapagliflozin reduces blood volume and blood pressure from its diuretic effect, which could be a concern in patients with HFpEF, but also be important mechanisms of a potential treatm ent effect. However, in the dapagliflozin T2DM programme, the rate of events related to vol ume deplet ion and impaired renal funct ion have been similar between dapagliflozin and placebo. Loop -diuretics are widely used in the target patient populat ionand are al so all owed in this study . A pool ed analysis o f patients wi th T2DM and HF in the dapagliflozin development programme, showed no increase of volume depletion events, but an increase in renal events, mainly creatinine increases, in pat ients treated with dapagliflo zin (n=171)"
25,page_25,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 26of 119compared wi th patients treated with placebo (n=149). About half o f the pati ents were on l oop diuretics ( Kosiborod et al 2017 ). An increase in amputations, most ly affect ing toes, was observed in a clinical trial ( Neal et al 2017 ) with another SGLT2 inhibitor. There is no indicat ion from the clinical development programme that dapagliflozin is associated with an increased risk of amputation (further inform ation provi ded in Sect ion8.3.1.1 for the detection and capture of events leading to amputati on). Dapagliflozin has not been shown to induce hypoglycaemia in non -diabet ic pat ients. In clinical pharmaco logy studi es, heal thy subjects have been treated with single oral doses of up to 500 m g and mul tiple oral doses of 100 mg up to 14 days without any hypoglycaemic events. There have been post -marketing reports of ketoacidosis, including diabet ic ketoacidosis, in patients wi th T2DM taking dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 inhi bitors. Di abetic ketoacidosis is considered a rare (in ≥1/10000 to <1/1000 patients) adverse drug reaction for dapagliflo zin in patients wi th T2DM. Patients treated with dapagliflo zin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with ketoacidosis, includ ing nausea, vo miting, abdo minal pain, malaise, and shortness of breath, shoul d be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, interruptio n of dapagliflozin treatment should be consi dered, and the patient should be evaluated prompt ly. Predi sposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta- cell funct ion reserve result ing from pancreat ic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreat itis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin dose reduc tion, reduced cal oric intake, or increased insulin requirements caused by infect ions, illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be used with caut ion in pat ients in these circumstances. Dapagliflozin is current ly not indicated for the treat ment of patients wi th type-1 diabetes mellitus; these patients are excluded from this study . 2.3.1.1 Protection against risks This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place to monitor and minimise any potenti al risks to parti cipating pat ients. Dat a regarding amputations and AEs potentially placing the pati ent at ri sk of a l ower limb amputation will be collected (Section 8.3.1.1 ). To ensure t he safet y of all patients parti cipat ing in AstraZeneca -sponsored studies, reviews of all safet y informat ion from all ongoing clinical dapagliflo zin studi es are conducted as they beco me available. Because of the short duration of the study and the accumulat ed safet y profile of dapagliflozin, an independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee will not be used in this study ."

Dapagliflozin or matching placebo will be administered on top of these treatments. All patients participat ing in clinical studies, irrespective of whether treated with active treatm ent or not, genera lly receive closer medical attention than those in ordinary clinical practi ce which m ay be to thei r advantage. 2.3.3 Conclusion Considering the nonclinical and clinical experience with dapagliflozin and the precaut ions included in the study protocol , parti cipat ion in this study shoul d present a minimal and thus acceptable risk to eligible pat ients. Although hypothesis -generat ing data suggest beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in pat ients with T2DM with HF, no available SGLT2 inhibitor has a treatment indicat ion for pati ents wi th HFpEF. This clinical study will test the hypothesis that dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in reducing patient -reported HF symptoms, reducing physical limitat ion, or im proving exercise capacit y in pat ients with HFpEF, wi th or wi thout T2DM, in a rigorous fashion. The results could offer substant ial benefit to patients with HFpEF, a patient population wit h a large m edical need for effective treatments. 3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Table 2 Study objectives Primary Objectives: Endpoint/variable: To determine whether dapagliflozin is superior to placebo in patients with chronic HF NYHA Functional Class II-IV and preserved ejection fraction (LVEF>40%) [HFpEF] in: • reducing patient -reported HF symptoms • reducing patient -reported physical limitation • improving exercise capacityFamily of primary endpoints: • Change f rom baseline in the KCCQ -TSS at Week 16. • Change f rom baseline in the KCCQ -PLS at Week 16. • Change f rom baseline in 6MWD at Week 16.

An overview of the study design is provi ded in Figure 1, Section 1.3. Details on treatments given during the study are provi ded in Sect ion 6.1. Details on what is included in the efficacy and safety endpoints are provided in Section 3. Adult patients with chronic HFpEF (defined for the purposes of this study as LVEF >40% and evidence of structural heart disease, ie, left atrial enlargement and or left ventricular hyper trophy ) and New York Heart Associat ion (NYHA) Funct ional Class II -IV, aged ≥40years who meet the all o f the inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusio n criteria, will be rando mised 1:1 to receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg or m atching pl acebo.

The rationale for the sample size determinat ion is given in Sect ion9.2. In thi s study the recrui tment of pati ents between sites will be compet itive. Data on baseline characte ristics, endpo ints and AEs will be collected through a validated web -based data capture system. 4.2 Scientific rationale for study design This is a rando mised, mult i-centre, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase III study . Randomisat ion and doubl e-blinding will minimise potential bias. The study popul ation will include patients both with and without T2DM, as the beneficial haemodynamic effects of dapagliflo zin appear to be independent of the glycaemic effect and can therefore be expected in b oth groups. Enrolment in the study will be capped on a study level based on the proportion of pat ients with and wi thout T2DM and the proportion of patients wi th an LVEF value above 40% and belo w 50%, and atrial fibrillat ion/flutter status will be mo nitored to ensure they are representative. The control group will receive matching placebo; there are no approved pharmaco logical treatm ents for HFpEF that could be used as a comparator. All pat ients will be treated according to local guidelines on standard of ca re treatment for patients with HFpEF, focusing on treatment of HF symptoms (eg, diuret ics) and co -morbidities (incl uding treatm ent for high blood pressure, ischaemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillat ion/flutter). Each patient is to be treated with a diur etic regimen aimed at achieving optimal fluid/volume status for that individual (wit h respect to HF symptoms, renal funct ion, blood pressure, and electroly te status). The study popul ation will include patients with eGFR ≥25 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients with reduced renal funct ion usually present a clinical profile of increased intra -glomerular pressure, hypertensio n, proteinuria and fluid/sodium overload. Through metabo lic-independent mechanisms, SGLT2 inhibit ion can improve all these abnormalit ies. Thus, patien ts wi th HF and reduced renal function could be expected to benefit from treatment with dapagliflozin. The primary efficacy endpoints of the study are change from baseline in each of KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ -PLS, and 6MWD at Week 16. The KCCQ is a disease -specific PR O measure developed for patients with chronic HF. The KCCQ has shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure of HF symptoms (as measured by KCCQ -TSS) and physical limitat ion (as measured by KCCQ -PLS) (Greene et al 2018, Spertus et al 2005). Such m easures have been shown to be clinically meanin gful endpoints in patients with HF ( Ferreira et al 2016 ). Although the 5 -point thresho ld for clinically meaningful wit hin-patient change has not been demonstrated specifically for the KCCQ -TSS or KCCQ -PLS in published clinical trials, the"
30,page_30,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 31of 119use of this pre -specified threshold in the DETERMINE studies is supported by its extensive use in other KCCQ scales, including the KCCQ -OSS of which the KCCQ -TSS i s a part (Filippatos et al 2017 , Comin -Colet et al 2013 ). Furtherm ore, i ts use for KCCQ -TSS and KCCQ -PLS is supported by other studi es (Spertus et al 2005 , Drey er et al 2016 ). Appropri ate thresho lds for clinically meaningful within-patient change will be evaluated using anchor - based methods, w hich are described in the Statist ical Analysis Plan (SAP). The rati onale for assessing change in 6MWD is that the 6MWT (the test used to determine the 6MWD) can act as a surrogate of normal daily act ivity. The 6MWT is a standard method for measuring exerci se response ( Holland et al 2014 , American Thoracic Societ y 2002) to medical interventions in pat ients with moderate to severe heart or lung disease, giving clinically meaningful change ( Shoem aker et al 2012 ), having already been used to give pre-treatm ent and post -treatm ent com parisons for pati ents wi th HF ( DeBock et al 1994 , O’Keeffe et al 1998 ). Reviews of the literature for clinically relevant thresho lds for 6MWT in HF support a 30 m thresho ld for clinically important difference ( Shoemaker et al 2013 ). An o lder study of 45 patients ( O’Keeffe et al 1998 ) reported that patients who reported feeling “a bit better” had a mean wit hin-patient change in 6MWD of 24 m, and pati ents who reported “much better” had a mean wi thin-patient change of 47 m. Data from chronic respi ratory disease studies provides the most com prehensive evi dence base for clinically relevant 6MWT change thresholds. The most recent European Respiratory Soci ety/American Thoracic Societ y Technical Standard (Holland et al 2014 ) states that the minimal important difference lies between 25 and 33 metres. Thi s is also consistent with a recent review ( Ferreira et al 2016 ) by leading experts in HF. However, these are based on group -level est imates and not within- patient change. Appropriate thresho lds for clinically meaningful wi thin-patient change in the target populat ion will be evaluated using anchor -based method s, with patient global impressio n of severit y (PGIS) and patient global impressio n of change (PGIC) instruments, which are described in the SAP. Finally , pati ents will also complete a suite of PRO measures (eg, rating of dyspnoea and fatigue, and overall t reatm ent benefit [OTB]), to help support the primary endpoints. 4.3 Justification for dose The 10 m g dose of dapagliflozin has a well -characteri sed efficacy and safet y profile in the T2DM clinical development programme and is the recommended dose in the majori ty of countri es worl dwide. From a pharm acokinetic (PK) perspective, the current ly approved dapagliflozin dose of 10 mg once daily is appropri ate for use in pat ients with HFpEF. Slightly higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin is expected in HFpEF patient s when symptomat ic, based on the dual renal and"
31,page_31,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 32of 119hepat ic metabo lism of dapagliflo zin and the lower perfusio n of these organs in this pat ient group. However, the increase in systemic exposure of 10 mg dapagliflozin is not anticipated to warrant dose adjust ment in HF pat ients. Moreover, the ant icipated slight ly higher systemic exposure to dapagliflozin is likely to be beneficial in HF pat ients, by com pensating for the reduced renal perfusio n and consequent ly lower renal glucose and sodi um filtered l oads in these pati ents. Doses l ower than 10 m g are therefore unlikely to provide as much benefit to patients wi th HF as the 10 -mg dose. Lastly, no changes in dose of concomitant medicat ions in the HFpEF populat ion are needed because there is no evidence of clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions for dapagliflozin wit h current medicat ions used for treatment of patients wi th HFpEF, including standard of care medicat ions used to control co -morbidities. In the dapagliflo zin clinical programme, there are no dose -related serious adverse events (SAEs) that preclude the use of 10 mg as a preferred dose. Addit ionally, in a post -hoc analysis of data from 320 pati ents wi th a docum ented history of HF and concomitant T2DM in placebo -controlled clinical studies, dapagliflo zin 1 0 mg was f ound to be well -tolerated (Kosiborod et al 2017 ). There are mechanist ic reasons for choosing the 10 -mg dose as well. One hy pothesis of underl ying pathophysio logy in HFpEF is abnorm al pressure coupling between the left ventri cle and aorta, and drugs that reduce aortic st iffness may have beneficial effects in patients wi th HFpEF ( Borlaug and Paulus 2011). Studi es examining the highest approved dose for empagliflo zin have reported improvements in aortic elast icity (Chilton et al 2015, Cherney et al 2014 ); similar studies are ongoing wit h dapagliflo zin. In a completed placebo -controlled study , treatm ent wi th 10 m g dapaglifl ozin resul ted in improvements in parameters associated with arteri al remodelling in addi tion to lowering blood pressure in pat ients with T2DM ( Ott et al 2017 ). Thi s work suggests that select ing the 10 -mg dose of dapaglifl ozin is reasonable fro m a mechanist ic perspective to demonstrate a clinical effect. 4.4 End of study definition The end o f study is defined as the last visit/contact of the last patient participating in the study . A pat ient is considered to have completed the study when he/she has co mpleted Visit 5 (Final visit) even if the pat ient discont inues treatment during the study, but remains in the study unt il Visit5 (Final visit). By contrast, pati ents who prematurely withdraw, or who are prematurely withdrawn, fro m the study , are consi dered as non -completers. The study may be terminated at individual study sites if the study procedures are not being perform ed according to GCP, or if no patients are recruited. Patients from terminated sites will have the opportunit y to be transferred to another site to continue the study . AstraZeneca may also terminate the ent ire study prematurely if concerns for safet y arise wi thin this study or in any other study with dapagliflozin. Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data required"

Under no circumstances can there be exceptions to this rule. Patients who do not meet the entry requi rements are screen failures (Section 5.4). In thi s protocol , “enrolled” patients are defined as those who sign the informed consent form (ICF). “Rando mised” pat ients are defined as those who undergo randomisat ion and receive a rando misat ion number.

Note: Most pati ents wi th HF requi re treatment wi th a diuretic to control sodium and water retenti on leading to vol ume overl oad. It i s recognised that diuret ic dosing may be titrated to symptoms, signs, weight and other informat ion and may thus vary . Each pati ent shoul d, however, be treated with a diuret ic regimen aimed at achieving optimal fluid/vo lume status for that individual (with respect to HF symptoms, renal funct ion, blood pressure, and electroly te status). Specifically, patient vo lume status should be individually optimised on a stable dose of diuretics for at least 2 weeks pri or to screening.

Note: To further minimise testing variabilit y due to pati ent perform ance, baseline 6MWD will be co mpared at the Enrolment (Visit 1) and Randomisat ion A (Vi sit 2a). If the 6MWD (at Visit1 [Enrolment]) i s within ±1 5% of the 6MWD observed at Randomisat ion A, the patient is rando mised. If this 15% requirement is not met, the patient will undergo a third test at Randomisat ion B (Vi sit 2b), wi thin 1 week after Rando misation A. The 6MWD obtained at Randomisat ion A should be within ±15% of the value obtained at Randomisat ion B. If this requi rement i s met, the patient is randomised at Randomisat ion B. If the 15% requirement is not m et, the pati ent cannot be included in the study. The patient is not eligible for rescreening due to a failure to meet the variabilit y criteria f or 6MWD. Let E be the 6MWD at Visit 1 (Enrolment), let Ra be the 6MWD at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) and let Rb be the 6MWD at Visit 2b (Rando misation B). The 15% variabilit y criterion at Visit 2a (Randomis ation A) is fulfilled if E ≥ Ra*0.85 and E ≤ Ra*1.15. The 15% variabilit y criterion at Visi t 2b (Randomisat ion B) i s fulfilled if Ra ≥ Rb*0.85 and Ra ≤ Rb*1.15.

The AstraZeneca representative or delegate will advise on the appropriate method for destruction of unused IP. The administration of all IP should be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF. 6.3 Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. All patients will be rando mly assigned to IP centrally using an interact ive vo ice/web response system (IxRS). Rando misat ion to IP will be performed in balanced blocks to ensure approximate balance between the treatment groups (1:1). The rando misat ion codes will be computer -generated and loaded into the IxRS database. Before the study is init iated, the telephone number and call -in direct ions and/or the log -in informat ion and di rections for the IxRS will be provided to each site. If a rando mised patient withdraws fro m thestudy , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion code cannot be reused. Withdrawn rando mised patients will be included in the intent -to-treat analysis. The IxRS will provide the Invest igator with the kit identificat ion number to be allocated to the patient whe n IP is dispensed. Site personnel will do a kit verificat ion in IxRS before providing the IP bottl e to the patient. Routines for this will be described in the IxRS user manual that will be provided to each site. The blinding of treatment is ensured by usin g a double -blind technique. Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the rando mised treatment for each patient, will be available to the Invest igator(s) or pharmacists fro m the IxRS. Instructions for code breaking/unblinding will be described in the IxRS use r manual that will be provi ded to each site. The rando misat ion code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge o f the treatment rando misat ion. The study site shoul d discuss any poten tial unblinding (excluding emergency situations) wi th the AstraZeneca study Physician and pri or to init iating the unblinding process. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF as applicable. The Inv estigator i s to docum ent and report the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to the patient to the AstraZeneca staff. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an invest igational product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authori ties. Randomisat ion codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from each individual patient have been m ade and docum ented."

The bioanalyt ical laboratory will, therefore, have access to the treatment codes but will not share the codes with the sponsor or others involved in the study until the blinding is broken for the study after cl osure. 6.3.1 Stratification and capping The recrui tment will be m onitored continually in order to achieve adequate proportions of patient subpopul ations. The IxRS will be program med to automat ically send alerts at predefined levels for both stratificat ion and capping, whilst also allowing manual closure (or re-opening) as necessary. 6.3.1.1 Stratification Randomisat ion will be stratified in IxRS based on patients with and without T2DM at the time of rando misat ion to ensure approximate balance between treatment groups in the proportions of patients wi th T2DM. Stratificat ion by T2DM status at the time of randomisat ion is based on: Established diagnosis of T2DM (medical history ) OR HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmo l/mol) shown at the central laboratory test at enrolment (Visit 1). 6.3.1.2 Capping The intent ion is to enrol a typical cross -section of pati ents wi th HFpEF to the study . The numbers o f patients randomised to IP will be mo nitored to ensure the following characterist ics are appropriately represented in the study , and caps m ay be applied in IxRS: T2DM status: the number of randomised patients with and without T2DM will be monitored in order to ensure a minimum o f 30% in each subpopulat ion. Rando misat ion may be capped (ie, no more patients can be randomised in a specific subpopulat ion) if the pre-determined limit is reached. LVEF value: the proportion of patients with LVEF above 40% and below 50% will be monitored to ensure a representative proportion in the study . Atrial fibrillat ion/flutter status: the proportion of patients with atrial fibrillat ion/flutter will be mo nitored to ensure a representative proportion in the study . 6.4 Treatment compliance Dispensing of IP to the patient should be recorded in the ap propriate secti ons of the eCRF. Any change fro m the dosing schedule, dose interruptions and dose discont inuat ions should be recorded in the eCRF."
41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42of 119Patients will be asked to bring their bottle of tablets of IP to the clinic at all of their visits. At each vi sit, any pati ent found to be non -compliant will be counselled on the importance of taking his or her IP as prescribed. The Investigator or delegate will enter the number of returned tablets in the eCRF. If the patient forgets to bring his or her bottle of IP to Visit 5 (Final visit), or a Visit for early withdrawal from the study , where dosing occurs in the clinic for PK purposes, a new bottle will be dispensed in accordance with the IxRS. Site personnel are responsible for m anaging the IP fro m receipt by the study site unt il the destruction or return of all unused IP. The Invest igator(s) i s responsible for ensuring that the patient has returned all unused IP. Inform ation regarding overdose of IP is given in Section 8.4.3 . 6.5 Concomitant therapy All patients should be treated according to local standard of care of HFpEF and exist ing co-morbidities (inc luding treatment for hy pertension, i schemic heart di sease, atri al fibrillat ion/flutter, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia). Background medicat ions shoul d be part of clinical practice and will not be provided by the Sponsor. Any medicat ion or vaccine (including ove r-the-counter or prescript ion medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the patient is receiving at the time o f enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded in the eCRF at the time points listed in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1), al ong wi th: Reason for use Dates of administration, including start and end dates Dosage information, including dose, route, and frequency 6.5.1 Prohibite d medications Concomitant treatment (ie, treatment in combinat ion with IP) with open -label SGLT2- inhibitors (eg, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin, ertugliflozin, tofogliflozin, luseogliflozin, and fixed -dose combinat ions containing these drugs) during the study is prohibited for all pat ients. Also, in situat ions where the patient is not on IP, treatment with open -label SGLT2 inhibitors could interfere with the interpretation of the study . If treatm ent with a SGLT2 -inhibitor alone or in co mbinat ion is deem ed essent ial, IP m ust be discont inued before that treatment is started."

Patients’ background standard of care therapies for HFpEF should be given according to local guidelines, including diuretics when needed to control symptoms and volume overload, and adequate treatment of co -morbidities such as hypertension and ischaem ic heart disease. Each patient is to be treated with a diuretic regimen aimed at achieving optimal fluid/volume status for that individual (wit h respect to HF symptoms, renal function, blood pressure, and electroly te status). Background standard of care th erapies will be recorded in the eCRF as conco mitant medicat ion. 6.5.2.2 Anti- diabetes background treatment for patients with T2DM More than 40% of pat ients with established HF are estimated to have T2DM ( Kristensen et al 2016). Therefore, it is expected that a large proportio n of patients will have an established T2DM diagnosis when enrolled in this study and that som e pat ients will develop T2DM during the study . Treatm ent of diabetes shoul d follow established guidelines, such as the glycaemic goals reco mmended by the American Diabetes Association and the European Associ ation for the Study of Diabetes in thei r joint Posit ion Statement ( Inzucchi et al 2012 , Inzucchi et al 2015 ). Diabetes m edicat ions at baseline and during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. Patients with T2DM at randomisat ion will continue their T2DM treatment. SGLT2 -inhibitors are prohibited (Section 6.5.1 ). Patients treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues have a higher risk of experiencing hypoglycaemic events compared with those treated with other anti -diabet ic agents. If needed, T2DM treatments may be adjusted at the discret ion of the Invest igator or diabetes healt h care provider. 6.5.3 Other concomitant treatment Other medication (with the except ion of those described above), which is considered necessary for the pati ent’s safet y and wellbeing, may begiven at the discretion of the Invest igator and recorded in the appropriate sections o f the eCRF. 6.6 Dose modification (not applicable) 6.7 Treatment after the end of the study Patients will receive their last dose of IP at Vi sit5 (Final visit) for PK assessmen t. Rem aining IP will be co llected at that time. Post -study treatm ent will not be provided by the Sponsor."

If the patient temporarily or perm anent ly discont inues IP, the patient should remain in the study (ie,continue to participate in scheduled study visit s and evaluat ions) and it is important that the scheduled study visits and data collecti on cont inue according to the study protocol until study closure. Patients m ay be di scontinued from IP in the fo llowing si tuations: Contraindicat ion to further dosing with IP, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, such as AE or other safet y reasons Severe non -compliance wi th the study protocol Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Consider temporarily interrupt ing IP if DKA is suspected. If DKA is confirmed, IP should be discont inued permanent ly (Sect ion8.3.1.2 ) Positive pregnancy test (di scont inue IP and notify Sponsor representative) (Sect ion8.4.2 ) Patient deci sion: The pat ient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment Table 1outlines data to be collected at the time of treatment discont inuat ion, and any further evaluat ions that need to be completed. 7.1.1 Temporary discontinuation Every attempt should be made to maintain patients on IP during the course of the study. If IP has been interrupted, it should be re- introduced as soon as, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the pati ent’s condit ion is stable. 7.1.1.1 Unexpected acute declines in eGFR If an unexpected, acute decline in kidney function is observed (see the Note below), the patient shoul d be evaluated and temporary interrupti on of IP shoul d be consi dered. Vol ume depletion, hypotension, inter -current m edical problems and conco mitant m edicati onsmay cause increases in blood creatinine. Urinary tract infect ion and urinary obstructi on shoul d be considered (the latter especially in men). Several drugs may cause a decline in kidney funct ion, especially non -steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs and certai n ant ibiotics such as trimethoprim. If any drug is suspected of causing or contribut ing to worsening kidney funct ion, their use should be re -considered."
44,page_44,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 45of 119Note: Whether an acute decline in eGFR has occurred is based on the Invest igator's judgement. However, the following may be consi dered: eGFR value has declined ≥50% compared wi th baseline or a doubling of serum creatinine compared to the most recent measurement. 7.1.1.2 Volume depletion/hypotension Patients wi th clinically relevant symptoms/signs o f suspected volum e deplet ion and/or hypotension, should, in addit ion to considering temporary interrupti on of IP, have their regular medicat ion reviewed, and considerat ion shoul d be given to reducing the dose of, or stopping concomitant medicat ions, as assessed on an indiv idual basis, including diuretics and drugs that lower blood pressure. The need for conventional diuretics (or the dose of diuret ic used) should be re -evaluated in light of the pati ent’s symptoms and signs. 7.1.1.3 Patients at risk of volume depletion Temporary interrupti on of IP m ay be considered in patients thought to be at risk o f volume depletion/hypotension, such as pat ients with an acute m edical illness potentially causing volume depletion because of inadequate fluid intake or fluid/blood loss (eg, gastroen teritis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage), or those undergoing major surgery . 7.1.2 Rechallenge Patients who have temporarily discontinued IP can resume treatment as soon as, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the patient’s condit ion is stable and the patient wish es to resume. No minimum t ime period is necessary before treatment can resume. 7.1.3 Procedures for discontinuation of investigational product The Investigator should instruct the patient to contact the site before or at the time if IP is stopped. A patient that decides to discont inue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence o f any AEs. The date of last intake IP should be documented in the eCRF. All IP shoul d be returned by the pat ient at hi s/her next on -site study visit or unscheduled visit. Patients perm anent ly discontinuing IP should be given locally available standard of care therapy , at the di screti on of the Investi gator. Discontinuati on of IP, for any reason, does not affect the patient ´s part icipation in the study. The patient should co ntinue attending subsequent study visits and data collect ion shoul d continue according to the study protocol . If the patient does not agree to continue study visits in-person, a modified fo llow-up m ust be arranged to ensure the collect ion of endpo ints and safet y informat ion. This could be a telephone contact with the patient, a contact with a relat ive or treating physician, or informat ion from medical records. The approach taken should be recorded in the medical records."

To optimise the chance of getting in contact with the patient during the study , Invest igators should record as much contact informat ion as possible at the start of the study including hom e phone, m obile/cell phone, ho liday home phone, family member phone numbers, email address, and social media contact details. The fo llowing acti ons m ust be taken if a patient fails to r eturn to the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the pat ient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule. Before a patient is deemed potentially lost to follo w up, the Invest igator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient, or the patient’s immediate family, by eg, repeat telephone calls, certified letter to the patient ´s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods. These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record. Efforts to reach the patient should continue unt il the end of the study. Should the patient be unreachable at the end of the study the patient should be considered to be lost to fo llow up with unknown vital status at end of study and censored at l atest follow -up contact. 7.3 Withdrawal from the study A pat ient may wi thdraw from the study (eg, wi thdraw consent), at any time (IP and assessm ents) at his/her own request, without prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawal of consent should only occur if the patient has received appropriate informat ion about, and does not agree to, any kind of further assessments or contact, including modified f ollow-up opti ons. Discontinuati on of IP in i tself is not considered withdrawal of consent. A pat ient who considers withdrawing from the study must be inform ed by the Invest igator about m odified fo llow-up opti ons (eg, tel ephone contact, a contact with a rel ative or treating physician, or informat ion from medical records). If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future informat ion, the Sponsor may retain and cont inue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal o f consent. If a patient withdr aws fro m the study , he or she m ay request destructi on of any samples taken, and the Investigator must document this in the site study records. A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AE. The Invest igator will fo llow up patients as medically indicated."

Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. If applicable, the patient will return any wearable activit y monitors (accel erom eters) that were provi ded for use at home. AstraZeneca or its delegate will request Invest igators to collect informat ion on pati ents’ vital status (dead or alive; date of death when applicable) at study closure f rom publicly available sources, in accordance with local regulations. Knowledge o f the vital status at study closure in all patients is crucial for the integrit y of the study . Data to be collected at the time of withdrawal fro m the study and any further eva luations that need to be completed are listed in Table 1. All IP shoul d be returned by the patient. 7.4 Discontinuation of the study The study may be stop ped if, in the judgement of AstraZeneca, study patients are placed at undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that: Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant, Are assessed as causally related to IP, and Are not considered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study Regardless of the reasons for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the protecti on of the pati ents’ interests and wellbeing. Study sites will be cl osed upon study com pletion. A study site is considered cl osed when all requi red docum ents and study supplies have been collected a nd a study -site closure visit has been performed. The invest igator may init iate study -site closure at any time, provi ded there i s reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended terminat ion. Reasons for the early closure of a s tudy site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the invest igator to comply wit h the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authori ties, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruit ment of parti cipants by the investi gator Discontinuati on of further study intervent ion developm ent"

The web -based data capture system will be used for data collect ion and query handling. The Invest igator will ensure that data are recorded in the eCRFs as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the eCRF instructions provided. The Investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, legibilit y, and timeliness of the data recorded and ensures the provisio n of answers to data queries a ccording to the Clinical Study Agreement. The Investigator will sign the completed eCRF. A copy of the com pleted eCRFs will be archived at the study site. Immediate safet y concerns should be discussed wit h the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awarene ss to determine whether the patient should continue or discontinue IP. Adherence to the study design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities (Table 1), is essential and required for study conduct. The m aximum amount of blood scheduled to be collected from each patient over the duration of the study , excluding any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 28 mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the sam ples. Enrolment period Visit 1, Enrolment (Week -2; Day -14 ± 7) All screening evaluat ions must be com pleted and reviewed to confirm that potential pat ients meet all eligibilit y criteria.

The 6MWD will be measured at the 6MWT, conducted at the time points specified in Table 1. The 6MWD will be measured based on the American Thoracic Societ y (ATS) guidelines (American Thoracic Societ y 2002). First, pati ent pulse rate, blood pressure, and oxy gen saturati on are recorded. Then, immediately before starting the 6MWT, the patient will stand and, using the Borg CR10 Scale® (Secti on8.1.1.2 and Appendix P), ass ess his or her perceived level of dyspnoea and fatigue before exertion. At selected si tes, a subset of at least 100 patients will wear an act ivity monitor (Moni torA) during the 6MWT. The wearable act ivity monitor will be dist inct fro m the activit y monitors some patients will be given to wear at home. The activit y monitors worn during the 6MWT will be for use in the clinic only. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will be uploaded to the vendor’s server and then provided to the sponsor. Data co llected by the wearable act ivity monitors will not be shown to the patient or invest igator. The instructions for using the wearable activit y monitors will be provi ded in a separate document. After complet ing the Borg CR10 Scale®, the patient will walk as f ar as he or she can in 6minutes. The 6MWD will be assessed under standard test condit ions, in accordance with the ATS gui delines. Whenever possible, the same person will conduct the 6MWT at each visit. The distance walked (metres) will be measured manuall y and recorded on paper before being transferred to the eCRF. Immediately after complet ing the 6MWT, the patient will use the Borg CR10 Scale® again to reassess his or her perceived level o f dyspnoea and fat igue following exerti on. Finally, pati ent pulse rate, bl ood pressure, and oxy gen saturation will again be recorded. A number of measures have been introduced to minimise variabilit y in pat ient perform ance of the 6MWT. Prior to init iating testing, every effort should be made by the Investigator to establ ish that the pati ent is in their “usual” state of healt h: meaning that the patient has no"

In the event that such condit ions are present, the test should be aborted and rescheduled within a 14 day window, to allow time for the resolut ion of the acute medical issue and the patient to return to his or her “us ual” state of health. For both 6MWD and other variables measured as part of the 6MWT, the value recorded at Visit 2a (Randomisat ion A) will be the baseline value, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where it will be the Visit 2b (Rando misat ion B) value. 8.1.1.2 Patient -reported outcomes PROs are described individually in the fo llowing secti ons. The PGIC in walking abilit y and the Borg CR10 Scale® are administered and recorded on paper separately fro m the other PROs (the KCCQ, PGIS in H F symptom s, PGIC in HF symptoms, Dy spnoea and Fatigue, EQ -5D- 5L, and OTB; the results of these are recorded on a site-based electronic tablet by the pat ient and are termed ePROs). The PGIC in walking abilit y will be recorded by the patient on paper. The Bo rg CR10 Scale® forms part of the suite of assessments that are performed before and after the 6MWT (Section 8.1.1.1 ). The ePROs are administered a nd recorded as fo llows: Patients will perform the ePRO assessments using a site -based electronic tablet during clinic visits at the time points given in Table 1before the 6MWT. The ePRO assessments must be completed by the pat ient as soon as he/she arrives at the study site and will take approximately 10 minutes to com plete. Each site must allocate the responsibilit y for the administrati on of the ePROs to a specific individual and, if possible, assign a backup person to cover if that individual is absent. A key aspect of study success is to have high PRO compliance. Therefore, it is essent ial that site staff fo llow the Schedule of Act ivities (Table 1) and make sure the device is set up properly (including using the appropriate time zone), charged, and fully funct ional at all t imes in order to minimise missing data. It is important that the site staff explain the value and relevance of PRO data: to hear direct ly from patients how they feel. The foll owing best practi ce gui delines shoul d be f ollowed: Patients m ust not receive help from relat ives, friends, or site personnel to answer or clarify the PRO quest ionnaires, in order to avoid bias. The PRO questionnaires must be completed before any other study procedures are conducted at a given visit. The PRO questionnaires must be completed before being seen by the Invest igator. The PRO questionnaires must be completed by the pati ent in private."

Therefore, if the pat ient has any medical probl ems, he or she should discuss them w ith the doctor or research nurse separately from the ePRO assessment. The appointed site personnel must show patients how to use the ePRO device, in accordance with the instructions provided. The appointed site personnel should remind pat ients that there a re no right or wrong answers, and the patient should be given sufficient time to complete the PRO questionnaires at his or her own speed. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Two of the primary efficacy variables are based on the KCCQ (provided in Appendix H), used to assess HF symptoms and physical limitat ion. The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ionA) will be the baseline values, excep t for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. The KCCQ is a 23- item, self -administered disease- specific instrument and has shown to be a valid, reliable and resp onsive m easure for pati ents wi th HF ( Greene et al 2018 , Spertus et al 2005 ). The KCCQ was developed to measure the patient’s percept ion of their healt h status independent ly, which includes HF -related symptoms (frequency, severit y and recent change), impact on phy sical and social function, self -efficacy and knowl edge, and how the patients’ HF affects their qualit y of life. Summary scores and dom ain scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100. Higher scores represent a better outcome. Patient global impression of severity in heart failure symptoms The PGIS (provided in Appendix I) item assesses how a patient perceives his or her overall current severit y of HF symptom s. Pati ents will choose from 6 response opti ons ranging fro m ‘no symptoms’ to ‘very severe.’ The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values .

The values recorded at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. EQ- 5D-5L The EQ -5D- 5L (provided in Appendix N) is a self -reported questio nnaire that is used to derive a standardised measure of healt h status, also referred to as a utilit y score. EQ -5D- 5L utilit y scores are wi dely accepted by reimbursement authorit ies and will be used to support healt h econo mic evaluat ions. The values recorde d at Visit 2a (Rando misat ion A) will be the baseline values, except for patients who were successfully retested for the 6MWT, where values recorded at Visit 2b (Rando misation B) will be the baseline values. Overall treatment benefit This i tem (provi ded in Appendix O) consists of 2 questions measuring the patient’s rating of treatm ent benefit. The first question assesses the patient’s impressio n of the benefit s relative to the negat ive effects. The second question assesses whether the patient would elect to continue the treatment after the end of the study if it were an option. Borg CR10 Scale® The Borg CR10 Scale® (provided in Appendix P) is a non -linear scale, ranging from 0 (‘nothing at all’) to an un- numbered maximum (‘abso lute maximum; highest possible’), that is used to m easure a patient’s self- assessment of his or her dyspnoea and fat igue immediately before and immediately after each 6MWT. The res ults will be recorded by site staff first onto paper before transfer into the CRF ( Borg 2007 ). 8.1.2 Oxygen saturation Oxygen saturation forms part of the suite of assessments administered during the 6MWT (Secti on8.1.1.1 ) and will be recorded at the time points given in Table 1.

Pati ents will be instructed to wear their activit y monitor for as l ong as possible (ideally 24hours per day for 7 days). The purpose of wearing the monitors is to assess the total time spent in light to vigorous phy sical act ivity (secondary efficacy endpoint), and the changes in the amount, duration and intensit y of physical act ivity parameters (exploratory endpoints) from Visi t1 (Enrolment) at Visit 5 (Final visit; Week 16). Patients will return all of their act ivitymonitors to the si te staff. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will be upl oaded to the vendor’s server and will be provided to the Sponsor. Data collected by the wearable act ivity monitors will not be shown to the patients or the invest igato rs. The specific act ivity monitor endpoints and their analysis are described in the SAP.

The intent -to-treat approach is employed to reflect the effect of the init ially assigned randomised study drug, i rrespect ive of exposure to study drug, concomitant treatment as well as subsequent treatment after discontinuat ion of study drug. A com posite variable strategy approach i s empl oyed to accoun t for deaths occurring during the fo llow-up peri od. 9.4.1.1 Analysis of the primary efficacy variables The primary efficacy endpoints are change fro m baseline in each of KCCQ -TSS, KCCQ- PLS, and 6MWD at Week 16.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (eg, an abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease tem porally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deteri oration of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout periods, ev en if no Study treatment has been administered. B 2 Definitions of SAE An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, follow-up), that fulfils 1 or more of the fo llowing cri teria: Results in death Is immediately life -threaten ing Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical treatm ent to prevent 1of the outcomes listed above B 3 Life-threatening ‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would r esult in the subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure). B 4 Hospitalisation Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operati ons planned before or during a study are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study ."
86,page_86,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87of 119B 5 Important medical event or medical treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or resul t in death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the subject or may require medical treatment to prevent 1 or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. These shoul d usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatm ent Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusi on, etc.) or convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion Development of drug dependency or drug abuse B 6 Intensity rating scale 1mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 2moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) 3severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities) It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the c riteria shown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. B 7 A Guide to interpreting the causality question When making an assessment of ca usality, consider the following factors when deciding whether there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug. Time Course: Exposure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable tem poral relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?"
87,page_87,"Clinical Study Protocol -3.0 AstraZeneca Dapagliflozin -D169EC00001 4 March 2020 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 88of 119Consistency wit h known drug profile: Was the AE consistent with the previous knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same pharmaco logical cla ss? Or coul d the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical properties? De-challenge experience: Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug? No al ternative cause: The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another ae tiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. Re-challenge experi ence: Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge . Laboratory tests: A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as: Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug? Is there a known mechan ism? Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship. The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient in formation in the case, i t is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteri orated due to l ack of effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y. B 8 Medication error For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medica tion error i s not l ack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human -or process -related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or parti cipant."

Variable response to therapy may be due to geneti c determinants that affect drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion; mechanism o f action of the drug; di sease aet iology; and/or mo lecular subt ypeof the di sease being treated. Therefore, where local regulat ions and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be co llected for DNA analysis fro m consent ing subjects. AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to medicat ions. Genet ic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicat ions. In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly , to geneti cally -guided treatm ent strategi es. Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, ie, the entire geno me. The results of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . The Sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confident iality. The samples will be retained while research on HF with preserved eject ion fraction continues but no l onger than 15 y ears or other period in accordance w ith local requi rements. D 2 Genetic research plan and procedures SELECTION OF GENETIC RESEARCH POPULATION Study selection record All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participat ion is voluntary and if a subject declines to partici pate there will be no penalt y or l oss of benefit. The subject will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study ."

Exclusion criteria Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the main study or any of the fo llowing: Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collection Withdrawal of consent for genetic research Subjects m ay withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decisi on concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study . Vol untary withdrawal will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for withdrawal are outlined in Sect ion 7of the main Clinical Study Protocol . Collection of samples for genetic research The blood sample for genet ic research will be obtained fro m the subjects at Visit 2a or Visit2b (Rando misat ion A or Randomisat ion B), as applicable. Although DNA is stable, early sample collect ion is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding subjects who may withdraw due to an AE; such subjects would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any reason the sample i s not drawn at Visit 2, it may be taken at any visit until the l ast study visit. Only 1 sam ple shoul d be collected per subject for genetics during the study . Samples will be collected, l abelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to maintain subject confidentialit y. Samples will be stored for a m aximum of 15years, from the date of last subject last visit, after which they will be destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An addit ional second code will be assigned to the blood either before or at the time of DNA extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be ident ifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to ident ify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZeneca geneti cs laboratori es, or at the desi gnated organi sation. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca emplo yee or designated organisat ions working with the DNA)."

The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of g enoty pic resul ts wi th clinical data, all ow regulatory audi t, and permit tracing o f samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent. Ethical and regulatory requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requi rements for the study , incl uding this genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix A. Informed consent The genetic component of this study is opti onal and the pati entmay part icipate in other components of the m ain study without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component. To participate in the genet ic co mponent of the study the pat ient must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genet ic co mponent of the study . A copy of the si gned and dated consent form must be given to the patient and the original filed at the study centre. The Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the patient understands that th ey may freely withdrawal from the genet ic aspect of the study at any time. Subject data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any insurance com pany, any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless req uired to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identi ty of the subject. In except ional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both the genetic data and the personal ident ifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a medical emergency, an AstraZeneca Physician or an Invest igator might know a subject’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data. In addit ion, Regulatory authori ties may requi re access to the rel evant files, though the subject’s medical informat ion and the genet ic files woul d rem ain physically separate. Data management Any genoty pe data generated in this study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organizatio ns to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisat ions or health insurance companies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the resul ts of similar studi es to l earn even m ore about healt h and disease. The researchers can"

Researchers may see summary resul ts, but they will not be able to see individual subject data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a suitable secure enviro nment separate from the clinical database. Statistical methods and determination of sample size The number of subjects that will agree to participate in the genet ic research is unknown. It is therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated. A SAP may be prepared where appropriate."

The Investi gator i s responsible for determining whether a subject meets potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study . The Investigator participates, together with Astr aZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whether HL criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry other than drug induc ed liver injury caused by the IP. The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes. E 2 Definiti ons Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3× upper limit of norm al (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥2×ULN at any point during the study following the start of study medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hy’s Law (HL) AST or ALT ≥3× ULN together with TBL ≥2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the IP, can be found to explain the co mbinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicat ing cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug. For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must oc cur.
