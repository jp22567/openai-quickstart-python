Document Date DNG Number Amendment 2 30-JUN-2021 TMF -13842020 Amendment 1 13-Apr-2020 2019N416505_0 1 Original Protocol 7-Jan-2020 2019N416505_0 0 Amendment 2: 30-JUN -2021 Overall Rationale for the Amendment: A Dear Investigator Letter (DIL) dated 13 - April-2021 was issued requir ing the stopping of further screening and the discontinu ation of the administration of GSK 3359609 ( feladilimab ) or placebo for all participants on INDUCE -4, effective immediately. Further to the DIL, since all participants have the option to remain on pembrolizumab alone plus 5FU -platinum as study therapy , GSK issued a Protocol Clarification Letter (PCL) dated 28 -April -2021 to reduce any unnecessary burden of on treatment and follow up assessments (the PCL did not alter any screening assessments) . This protocol amendment is a follow up to the PCL , with a primary intent to only update the SoA ; other impacted, relevant sections were also updated accordingl y. Additionally, updates were made to management guidelines to align with pembrolizumab IB update. Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale 1.3 Schedule of Activities (SoA) Assessments related to GSK3359609 (feladilimab) were removed. These include feladilimab/placebo infusions; feladilimab PK collections, immunogenicity, IRR lab panel, plasma collections, PBMC collections, optional biopsy, Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), H ealthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU), prior protocol required disease assessments, follow -up subsequent anticancer therapy and disease assessments, and pembrolizumab second course. Minor clarifications to pembrolizumab dosing and window extension to PE, P S, and vital signs were also added. Since there will be no further screening into the study and no further dosing of GSK3359609 or placebo, there is no need to collect samples, PROs or efficacy assessments to determine the effect of GSK3359609"

Synopsis Protocol Title: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Adaptive, Phase II/III Study of GSK3359609 in Combination with Pembrolizumab and 5FU-Platinum Chemotherapy versus Placebo in combination with Pembrolizumab plus 5FU-Platinum Chemotherapy for First -Line Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Short Title: A Phase II/III study of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with pembrolizumab plus 5FU-platinum chemotherapy in participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC Rationale: KEYNOTE -048 (KN -048; NCT02358031) is a randomized, three arm study in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC who had not received prior syst emic therapy in the R/M setting. In the standard first -line treatment arm patients received chemotherapy (platinum and fluorouracil) in combination with cetuximab based on the EXTREME protocol [ Vermorken , 2008]. In the two experimental arms patients either receive pembrolizumab in combination with platinum plus fluorouracil (5FU) or alone. Pembrolizumab was given at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), for up to 35 cycles. Pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen as first -line treatment significantly improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with R/M HNSCC. The degree of survival improvement for pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy depended on the programmed cell death receptor 1 -ligand 1 (PD -L1) combined positive score ( CPS) status [Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019] . OS improvement in the total PD -L1 population requir ed pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU -platinum regimen to reach statistical significance [ Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.77; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.63, 0.93; p-value: 0.0034] ; in the PD -L1 CPS 1 population, pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in a 35% improvement in the risk of death [HR: 0.65 ; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80; p -value: <0.0001]. The results from KN -048 suppor ted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU- platinum chemotherapy as first -line treatment of patients with R/M HNSCC in the PD-L1 CPS 1 and total populations, respectively [ KEYTRUDA , 2019]. In the European Union (EU), the European Commission approved pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU -platinum chemotherapy in the PD -L1 positive (CPS 1) population [KEYTRUDA , 2019] . Despite the treatment advancements pembrolizumab has afforded patients with R/M HNSCC, there remains an unmet need due to the li mited population benefit with the aim to further improve disease control, a feature that if not addressed adversely impacts patient quality of life in the disease setting, and to further improve survival across all HNSCC populations."
10,page_10,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 10 The non -clinical data demonstrate that the activity of targeting ICOS with an agonist antibody is further enhanced with PD -1 blockade and that the mechanisms of action for each antibody are complementary with one another as evidenced by the non -clinical findings that treatment with a mouse anti -PD-1 antibody resulted in upregulation of ICOS+ cluster of differentiation ( CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors and lymph nodes; conversely, treatment with anti -mouse ICOS antibodies increased PD -L1 levels in the tumor. Furthermore, when com bined, the two agents resulted in a greater survival effect than either agent alone in syngeneic mouse tumor models (refer to Section 2.2.1 ). The preliminary clinical data from INDUCE -1 demonstrate that the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab exhibits promising antitumor activity in participants with HNSCC (refer to Sectio n 2.2.3 ). Combining i mmunomodulatory agents targeting different components of the cancer immunity cycle [Chen , 2013] may be able to overcome the multiple mechanisms of immune suppression which prohibit an effective antitumor immune response . Thus, targeting both the ICOS and PD -1 axes may translate into enhanced clinical activity and expand the population that benefits with the combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist antibody) and pembrolizumab (PD -1 blocking antibody) which is supported by the available non -clinical and clinical evidence. The clinical data from INDUCE -1 has validated the non -clinical findings whereby the 24% overall response rate ( ORR ) observed with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab was higher than that observe d with GSK3359609 monotherapy as described in Section 2.2.1.1 and higher than that reported for pembrolizumab alone as first -line therapy [ Burtness , 2018] or subsequent -line therapy [ Cohen , 2019] in R/M HNSCC. The purpose of Study 209227 is to evaluate if the addition of GSK3359609 to pembrolizumab in combination with platinum -based chemotherapy improves the efficacy of the pembrolizumab combination with platinum -based chemotherapy in patients with R/M HNSCC. Objectives and Endpoints : Primary Objectives Endpoints • Compare the efficacy of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab + 5FU-platinum chemotherapy versus placebo in combination with pembrolizumab + 5FU-platinum chemotherapy in the total population (PD-L1 CPS all) and in the PD-L1 positive (CPS1) population • OS in the total and the PD-L1 CPS1 populations , defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death due to any cause • PFS per RECIST v1.1 by Investigator assessment in the total population ; defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first"

The study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 1) compared with placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 2) as a standard first -line regimen in HNSCC. Study participants will be stratified by PD -L1 CPS status (CPS20 versus 1≤ CPS<20 versus CPS <1) and HPV status for oropharyngeal cancers (positive vs . negative/unknown) vs non -oropharyngeal cancers then randomly assigned to one of the two study treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio."
12,page_12,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 12 The Phase II/III study design is deemed an efficient approach to consider the potential of expanding Study 209227 to a Phase III design based on pre -specified , external adaptive decision rules from Study 209229 (INDUCE -3) [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2019N403389_03 ] that are based on ORR/DCR per RECIST v1.1 guidelines in approximately 100 participants (PD -L1 CPS ≥1 population) with a minimum follow -up of 6 months . If the adaptive analysis results from Study 209229 meets the defined adaptive decision criterion to expand Study 209229 to a Phase III study ( ORR 8%), then Study 209227 will expand to a Phase III design with 640 participants randomized. If the outcome does not meet the aforementioned defined criteria but meets the criteria for Study 209229 to remain as a Phase II study ( 0% ∆ORR<8% ), then Study 209227 will be conducted as a Phase II/III seamless design with the second adaptive decision for Study 209227 to be based on the outcome of the first OS analysis within Study 209227 . This analysis for OS will occur after 9 months of OS follow -up in the first 300 participants. All participants randomized are included for inference at the end of Phase III (approximately 640 participants) . In addition, all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints are formally tested for statistical significance at the end of Ph ase II /III or Phase III. Disclosure Statement : This is a parallel group treatment study with 2 arms that is sponsor, participant and investigator blinded. Crossover between study treatment arms is not permitted. Number of Participants: Overall, if the study expands to a Phase III design, approximately 640 participants with R/M HNSCC will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio either to GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 1) or placebo in combination with p embrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 2) . Based on the prevalence of PD -L1 CPS status reported in KN -048 [Burtness , 2018], in a target sample size of 640 R/M HN SCC participants , the study will enroll approximately 544 participants with PD -L1 CPS 1 (PD -L1 positive expression) of which 275 participants have PD-L1 CPS 20 (PD -L1 high expression) , and 9 6 participants with PD -L1 CPS <1 (PD-L1 negative) . Strata may be collapsed in the case where a very small stratum size is observed ; details will be documented in Statistical Analysis Plan . The overall proportion of participants by PD-L1 C PS status will be capped such that the maximum proportion of participants in PD -L1 CPS 20, 1 CPS <20 or CPS <1 will not exceed the expected proportion by 5% for any subgroup. Refer to Section 9.2 for the expected sample size of each subgroup . Intervention Groups and Duration: The study is comprised of three periods: screening, treatment, and follow -up. The total duration of study participation begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). After a screening period of up to 45 days, eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment arms. For participants who meet all eligibility criteria and are randomized within the study, the maximum duration of treatment with pembrolizumab, GSK3359609 and placebo is"
13,page_13,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 13 expected to be approximately 2 years, up to 35 cycles. The duration of chemotherapy treatment will be 6 cycles (cycle=21 days ). If the course of chemotherapy treatment is completed after six cycles or discontinued prior to completion of 6 cycles, GSK3359609 , placeb o and pembrolizumab treatment may continue for the aforementioned duration indicated . The follow -up period begins when study treatment is permanently discontinued; participants will undergo follow -up assessments for safety, patient reported outcomes, PFS o n first subsequent anti -cancer therapy (PFS2) , subsequent anticancer therapy and survival as indicated in the Schedule of Activities (SoA); refer to Section 1.3. The total duration of study participation begins with the signing of the ICF through the final protocol -defined follow -up assessment for survival. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following combinations: • GSK3359609 24 mg + pembrolizumab 200 mg + 5FU 1000 mg/m2/24 hours for 4 days + platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 OR carboplatin area under the curve [AUC ] 5) Q3W for 6 cycles (Arm 1) • Placebo + pembrolizumab 200 mg + 5FU 1000 mg/m2/24 hours for 4 days + platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 OR carboplatin AUC 5) Q3W for 6 cycles (Arm 2) GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab are admini stered as 30 -minute intravenous ( IV) infusions . GSK3359609 will be administered first followed by p embrolizumab ; 5FU-platinum chemotherapy will be administered after pembrolizumab infusion is complete . The sequence in which chemotherapy doublets are administered is per standard practice. Independent Data Monitoring or Other Committee: The study will use an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) . The IDMC membership and governance will be outlined in a separate charter. The IDMC will make recommendations for discontinuation or modification of the study based on ongoing reviews of safety data according to the Charter. In addition, the IDMC will al so evaluate adaptive decision analyses, the interim analyses of OS and make recommendation s based on observed results of the study. In this double -blind study, all GSK and site personnel will be restricted from access to interim analysis results provided t o the IDMC until the conclusion of the study, unless the IDMC recommends significant changes to study conduct that require a protocol amendment. In this scenario, after receiving the IDMC recommendation and a decision by Chief Medical Officer (CMO), a revi ew of the data may be required. A select group from GSK, as determined by the CMO will be unblinded to review the data to agree on future study conduct. Depending on the recommendation of the IDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. More deta ils will be provided in the IDMC charter ."

INTRODUCTION Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide, accounting for more than 550,000 new cases and 380,000 deaths per year [ Vos, 2017; Naghavi , 2017]. HNSCC is a heteroge neous disease, encompassing a variety of tumors that originate from different anatomic subsites in the head and neck region, and include carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, and nasal cavity/sinuses. The etiology of HNSCC is well -established as being multifactorial with risk factors that include tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption; human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is also an important factor in the pathophysiology and prognosis of HNSCC which includes playing an immunosuppressive role, mainly in the oropharyngeal region [Gillison , 2015; Ang, 2010; Fung , 2017]. Most patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease and are usually treated with multimodal therapy including surgery, radiotherapy/ chemotherapy and systemic therapy. Despite advances in surgical and radiation techniques, as well as the addition of chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor -targeting monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in the treatment of locally advanced HNSCC, more than half of patients eventually exp erience relapse or distant metastases. Most of these patients are no longer suitable for curative treatment approaches. For locally recurrent disease, local treatment options such as surgery and radiotherapy play an important role in this setting. For recurrent disease no longer amenable to local therapy or metastatic HNSCC, platinum - based chemotherapy  cetuximab was the standard treatment option in the United States (US) before the US FDA approval of pembrolizumab in this setting. Even with current multi -agent chemotherapy that now includes pembrolizumab, the expected median survival for a patient in the incurable or metastatic relapse setting remains under 15 months [KEYTRUDA , 2019 ]. 2.1. Study Rationale KEYNOTE -048 (KN -048; NCT02358031) was a randomized, three arm study in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNSCC who had not received prior systemic therapy in the R/M setting. In the standard first -line treatment arm patien ts received chemotherapy (platinum and fluorouracil) in combination with cetuximab based on the EXTREME protocol [ Vermorken , 2008]. In the 2 experimental arms patients either receive pembrolizumab in combination with platinum plus fluorouracil (5FU) or pembrolizumab alone. Pembrolizumab was given at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W), for up to 35 cycles. Pembrolizumab alone and in combination with chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen as first -line treatment improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with R/M HNSCC. However, the degree of survival improvement for pembrolizumab alone or in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy depended on the programmed cell death receptor 1 -ligand 1 (PD -L1) combined positive score (CPS) status. OS improvement in the total PD -L1 CPS population requir ed pembrolizumab in combination with the 5FU-platinum regimen [HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.63 -0.93; p -value: 0.0034] ; in the"
24,page_24,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 24 PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population, pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy resulted in a 35% improvement in the risk of death [HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80; p -value: <0.0001] . Overall , the frequenc ies of all treatment -related toxicities categories were consistent between pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU -platinum and the EXTREME regimen [Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019] . The KN -048 results supported the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU -platinum chemotherapy as first -line treatment of patien ts with R/M HNSCC in the PD -L1 CPS 1 and total populations, respectively [ KEYTRUDA , 2019]. In the EU, the European Commission approved pembrolizumab alone and in combination w ith 5FU -platinum chemotherapy in the PD -L1 positive (CPS 1) population [KEYTRUDA , 2019] . In addition, pembrolizumab alone and in combination with 5FU -platinum chemotherapy were incorporated into the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer guidelines as an option for the first -line treatment in patients with non - nasopharyngeal H NSCC ; the choice of which pembrolizumab -based regimen may consider PD-L1 expression status as well as other patient and disease characteristics [National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCC N), 2020; Cohen , 2019 ]. However, there was a lack of significant improvement in PFS with pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with the E XTREME regimen in the overall population and in the PD -L1 CPS populations analysed; although there was a 37% improvement in PFS in the PD -L1 CPS 20, statistical significance was not reached [HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.55 -0.97; p -value: >0.0017 , as the superiorit y threshold][ Rischin , 2019]. Despite the treatment advancements pembrolizumab has afforded patients with R/M HNSCC, there remains an unmet need due to the limited population of benefit that includes to further im prove disease control, a feature that if not addressed, adversely impacts patient quality of life in this disease setting, and to further improve survival across all HNSCC populations. The non -clinical data demonstrate that the activity of targeting ICOS w ith an agonist antibody is further enhanced with PD -1 blockade. Further rationale for targeting the ICOS and PD -1 axes is supported by the non -clinical finding that treatment with a mouse anti-PD-1 antibody resulted in upregulation of ICOS+ cluster of diff erentiation ( CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumors and lymph nodes; conversely, treatment with anti -mouse ICOS antibodies increased PD -L1 levels in the tumor. Furthermore, when combined, the 2 agents resulted in a greater survival effect than either agent alone in syngeneic mouse tumor models (refer to Section 2.2.1 ). The preliminary clinical data from INDUCE -1 demonstrate that the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab exhibits promising antitumor activity in participants with HNSCC (refer to Section 2.2.3 ). Combining i mmunomodulatory agents targeting different components of the can cer immunity cycle [Chen , 2013] may be able to overcome the multiple mechanisms of immune suppression which prohibit an effective antitumor immune response and contribute to the progression of HNSCC [ Ferris , 2015]. Rationale combination approaches with immune -targeted agents may include c hemotherapies which offer rapid disease control and have bee n shown to possess advantageous immunological effects [Bracci , 2014 ; Galluzzi , 2015] that translated to improvement in overall survival, and in"
25,page_25,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 25 certain disease settings progression -free survival with the combination of PD -1/L1 therapies and standard of care chemotherapy regimens [ Gandhi , 2018 ; Socinski , 2018 ; Burtness , 2018]. Additionally, targeting both the ICOS and PD -1 axes with chemotherapy may translate into enhanced clinical activity and expand the population that benefits with the combination of GSK3359609 (ICOS agonist antibody) and pembrolizumab (PD -1 blocking antibody) which is supported by the available non -clinical and clinical evidence. The clin ical data from INDUCE -1 has validated the non -clinical findings whereby the 24% ORR observed with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab was higher than GSK3359609 monotherapy as described in Section 2.2.3 , and higher than that reported for pembrolizumab alone as first -line therapy [ Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019] or subsequent -line therapy [ Cohen 2019] in R/M HNSCC. In addition, the majority of patients who received GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and achieved a respon se or stable disease ha d PD-L1 CPS status <20 . The purpose of Study 20922 7 is to evaluate if the addition of GSK3359609 to pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU-platinum chemotherapy as first -line treatment improves the efficacy of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy in participant s with R/M HNSCC. 2.2. Background 2.2.1. Inducible T Cell Costimulatory Receptor and GSK3359609 Inducible T cell co -stimulatory receptor ( ICOS ) is a co -stimulatory receptor belonging to the CD28/ B7immunoglobulin (Ig) super family with expression restricted to T cells [Hutloff , 1999]. ICOS differentiates from first generation immunomodulatory antibodies directed against Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte -Associated Protein 4 (CTLA -4) and PD -1/PD - L1 by targeting a different axis in the antitumor T cell response cascade and promoting activation. ICOS is weakly expressed on resting T cells yet is highly induced on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon T cell receptor (TCR) engagement with cognate antigen and activation. The effect of ICOS agonist activity is to promote activation of cytotoxic CD8+ and conventional CD4+ cells, augmenting the expansion, function and survival of these populations thereby resulting in an increased antitumor immune response th at is durable [Fan, 2014; Paulos , 2010; Wakamatsu , 2013, Sharpe , 2002]. GSK3359609 is a humanized anti -ICOS mAb selected for its nanomolar (nM) binding to and agonist activity in ICOS -expressing CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells. GSK3359609 is specifically e ngineered as an Ig G4 hinge -stabilized isotype, IgG4PE, to markedly decrease binding affinity of the Fc (Fragment crystallizable) region of the mAb to activating Fcγ receptors and C1q, and thereby diminish the cytotoxic potential of GSK3359609 that would result in depletion of ICOS -positive T cells through antibody - dependent or complement -dependent cell mediated mechanisms, respectively. Moreover, the IgG4PE isotype retains function al binding to the Fc  inhibitor receptor, Fc RIIb, a feature described as critical for modulating antibody agonist activity [Li, 2011], which also may be essential for optimal ICOS agonist activity and its associated antitumor effects in humans . The T cell activating potential of GSK3359609 was evaluated in multiple in vitro assay formats as a single agent and in combination with other immune checkpoint inhibitors."
26,page_26,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 26 GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated a more robust pro - inflammatory cytokine response , including increases in i nterferon gamma (IFN ) secretio n, than either single agent alone . In vivo experiments in different mouse models either using GSK3359609/pembrolizumab or anti -mouse ICOS in combination with PD-1 surrogate antibodies demonstrated enhanced growth inhibition and increased survivability of mice compared to either agent alone. The upregulation of ICOS with the mouse anti - PD-1 antibodies and the converse whereby I COS mouse surrogate antibodies increase d tumor PD -L1 expression in these in -vivo experiments further support evaluating this combinat ion. Furthermore, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas gene expression data demonstrates that tumors with higher ICOS expression also tend to have higher PD -L1 expression , with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas observed as having the highest ICOS expre ssion suggesting that targeting both axes may result in greater anti -tumor immune response . Refer to the GSK3359609 IB for details on the non -clinical experiments and findings [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_ 02]. 2.2.1.1. GSK3359609 Clinical Experience INDUCE -1 (Study 204691; NCT02723955) is an ongoing, first in -human, dose escalation and expansion study of GSK3359609, alone and in combination with other agents including pembrolizumab, in participant s with advanced solid tumor s. Analysis from the dose escalation phases of GSK3359609 monotherapy (Part 1A, n=22) and GSK3359609 combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2A, n=36), and GSK3359609 monotherapy pharmac okinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic cohort (n=47) demonstrate d GSK3359609 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab was well tolerated across the 0.001 –3 mg/kg dose range. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in Part 1A and Part 2A ; maximum administere d dose of GSK3359609 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab was 3 mg/kg. A range of GSK 3359 609 doses (≥0.1 -1 mg/kg) demonstrated biological and clinical activity supporting the mechanism of action of a non -depleting ICOS agonist as a clinic al target [Hansen , 2018 ; Maio , 2019 ]. A summary safety analyses from a later clinical data c ut-off date of 15 March 2019 that included all participants dosed with GSK3359609 monotherapy (n=194 ), which included participants dosed at GSK3359609 10 mg/kg (MAD), or GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab (n= 260) showed that 39% (n=75) and 50% (n=130) of participants, respectively, experienced at least 1 treatment -related adverse events (TR -AE). In the overall Part 1 population, TR -AEs occurring in ≥5% of participants were fatigue (10%, n=20), asthenia (8%, n =16) and diarrhea (5%, n=9). Eight participants (4%) experienced at least 1 TR -Grade 3 AE; none of which were Grade 5 in severity . In the overall Part 2 population, TR -AEs occurring in ≥5% of participants were diarrhea (7%, n=18), asthenia (7%, n=17), fatigue (7%, n=17), asparta te aminotransferase elevations (5%, n=14), pruritus (5%, n=14) and nausea (5%, n=12). Thirteen participants (5%) experienced at least 1 TR -Grade 3 AE, three of whom experienced at least 1 treatment -related Grade 5 event .

Four of the six participants (67%) experienced at least 1 AE regardless of causality ; mucositis (n=2 , 33%) was the only AE that occurred in >1 participant. The majority of A Es were Grade 1 or Grade 2 in severity; Grade 3 events of diarrhea, neutrophil count decrease and tumor haemorrhage were each experienced in 1 participant (50%). Three of six participants (50%) experien ced at least 1 treatment -related AE which included mucositis (n=2, 33%), abdominal pain (n=1, 17%), colitis (n=1, 17%), diarrhea (n=1, 17%), hypomagnesemia (n=1, 17%), nausea (n=1, 17%), neutrophil count decrease (n=1, 17%) and oral candidiasis (n=1, 17%). No A Es were considered dose limiting toxicities . Two participants experienced at least 1 AE that was considered serious (33%); 1 participant experienced 2 serious A Es of Grade 3 diarrhea and Grade 2 colitis, both events were treatment related and resolved 8 days and 6 days, respectively, after the onset date. A second patient experienced Grade 3 oropharyngeal tumor bleed that was not treatment related and later resolved 12 days after the onset date. 2.2.2. Pembroli zumab Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mA b with high specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD-L1 and PD -ligand 2 (PD -L2). Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. Keytruda ( pembrolizumab ) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications , which includes fi rst-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable recurrent HNSCC. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, another PD -1 inhibitor, is also considered a second -line/subsequent -line standard of care for patients with R/M HNSCC. Refer to the pembrolizumab IB [Merck ; 2021] and approved labeling for detailed background information on MK-3475. The most common reported A Es (20% of patients) with pembrolizumab single agent include fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, decreased appetite , pruritus, diarrhea, nausea, rash, pyrexia, cough , dyspnea , constip ation, pain and abdominal pain [KEYTRUDA , 2019]. Serious and fatal A Es associated with treatment include immune -mediated adverse reactions, which consisted of pneumonitis, colitis, endocrinopathies (i.e., hypophysitis, thyroid disorders, and Type1 diabetes mellitus), hepatitis, nephritis, infusion reactions, and skin reactions including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 2.2.2.1. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (enco ded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig"
28,page_28,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 28 superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signalling upon engagement of its ligands (PD L1 and/or PD - L2) [ Greenwald , 2005; Okazaki , 2001]. The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [ Zhang , 2004]. PD -1 and its family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig -variable –type (IgV type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signalling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signalling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following T -cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, S HP-1 and SHP -2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein kinase C -theta (PKCθ ), and zeta-chain - associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signalling cascade [ Okazaki , 2001; Chemnitz , 2004; Shepard , 2004; Riley , 2009]. The mecha nism by which PD -1 down -modulates T cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signalling proteins [Parry , 2005; Francisco , 2010]. As a consequence, the PD 1/PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention . 2.2.2.2. Non-clinical and Clinical Studies Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD -1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to tumor rejection, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities [Hirano , 2005; Blank , 2004; Weber , 2010; Strome , 2003; Spranger , 2014; Curran , 2010; Pilon -Thomas , 2010]. Anti-mouse PD -1 or anti -mouse PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor responses in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia and color ectal carcinoma [Strome , 2003; Curran , 2010; Pilon -Thomas , 2010; Nomi , 2007; Zhang , 2004] . In such stu dies, tumor infiltration by CD8+ T cells and increased IFNγ, granzyme B and perforin expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD -1 checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effec tor T cell function in vivo [Curran , 2010] . Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy o f anti -mouse PD -1 antibody as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models ( for detail ref er to pembrolizumab IB; Merck , 2021). 2.2.3. GSK3359609 Monotherapy and in Combination with Pembrolizumab in HNSCC The ongoing INDUCE -1 expansion phase is investigating GSK335 9609 as a monotherapy (Part 1B) and GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab (Part 2B) in participants with HNSCC. At a clinical data cut -off date of 26 July 2019, 17 participants with anti -PD-1/L1 treatment -experienced HNSCC received at least 1 dose of 1 mg/kg GSK3359609 in Part 1B cohort. In the treated population (n=17), the median age was 56 years (range: 41-73 years); 8 2% were male and 82% received ≥1 prior lines of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. Sixteen of the 17 dosed partic ipants were considered evaluable for efficacy analysis; the overall response rate"
29,page_29,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 29 (ORR) in the evaluable population was 6% with 1 of the 1 6 participants achieving a partial response (PR). In the Part 2B cohort, 34 participants with anti -PD-1/L1 naïve HNSCC received at least one cycle of 0.3 mg/kg GSK3359609 in combination with 200 mg pembrolizumab. In the treated population (n=34), the median age was 6 2 years (range 37 -77 years); 85% were male and 5 3% received ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy in the advanced/metastatic setting. All 34 dosed participants were considered evaluable for efficacy analyses. The ORR in the evaluable population (n= 34) was 2 4% (95% CI: 1 0.7%, 41.2%) with 8 of the 34 participants achieving a complete response (n=3) or PR (n=5) ; disease control rate (DCR ) was 65% (n=22; 95% CI: 46.5, 80.3) . In addition, the majority of patients that achieved a respon se or stable disease ha d PD-L1 CPS status <20 (10/14 patients with CPS1 and <20, and 1 patient with CPS <1 ).The median progression -free survival (PFS) was 5.6 months (95% CI: 2.4, 7.4) [Rischin , 2019] . 2.3. Benefit/Risk Asses sment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non -clinical studies conducted with GSK3359609 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_ 02] and pembrolizumab [ Merck , pembrolizumab IB, 20 21] can be found in the respective I Bs. Sectio n 2.3.1 outline s the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab FU-platinum chemotherapy. The nonclinical and clinical toxicity profiles of the cytotoxic chemotherapies are well characterized with extensive clinical experience for a range of oncological indications including combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, which have not identified overlapping toxicities across the two drug classes. 2.3.1. Risk Assessment Of 260 participants treated with the combination of GSK3359609 (at various doses) and pembrolizumab in various tumor types across the dose escalation and expansion phases of the INDUCE -1 study , 94% experienced at least 1 adverse event regardless of causality; with 41 % experienc ing at least 1 Grade 3 event and 41% experiencing at least 1 s erious event. The events reported with the highest frequency (10%) regardless of causality were anemia , fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, asthenia , pyrexia, deceased appetite, dyspnea, constipation, cough and vomiting; t hese most common all -cause A Es are consistent with the those reported for pembrolizumab alone [KEYTRUDA , 2019] . Regarding immune related events (irAEs) most have been low grade and were treated su ccessfully; few high grade irAEs were considered significant or required hospitalization (i.e., hypergly cemia and pneumonitis). Refer to the GSK3359609 IB for further details [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N319717_ 02]. In the ongoing INDUCE -1 safety cohort of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab plus 5FU/platinum chemotherapy , 4 of the six participants (67%) experienced at least 1 AE regardless of causality; mucositis (n=2, 33%) was the only AE that occurred in >1 participant (refer to Section 2.2.1.1 .).

Regarding benefit, the focus should be on the following key points: first, the KEYNOTE -048 results support pembrolizumab as a backbone agent in the standard of care for the first -line treatment of R/M HNSCC (refer to Secti on 2.1); second, GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab was shown to have a positive ORR and disease control rate in a small cohort (n= 34) of participants with PD -1/L1 treatment naïve HNSCC (re fer to Section 2.2.3 for further details and Rischin , 2019 ). 2.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion This is a randomized, double -blind , Phase II/III study of GSK3359609/ pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU-platinu m chemotherapy versus placebo/pembrolizumab in combination with5FU-platinum chemotherapy for first lin e treatment of R/M HNSCC. Regarding benefit, the focus should be on the following key points: first, the KEYNOTE - 048 results support pembrolizumab as a backbone agent in the standard of care for the first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC (refer to Section 2.1); second, GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab was shown to have a positive ORR and disease control rate in a small cohort (n=34) of participants with PD -1/L1 treatment naïve HNSCC (refer to Section 2.2.3 ). The risks seen in participants exposed to GSK3359609 (at various doses) in combination with pembrolizumab are summarized in Table 2. Of 260 participants treated with the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab in the INDUCE -1 study, most had at least 1 adverse event, the majority of which were low grade events. The evidence to date for the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab favor an acceptable safety pr ofile and an expected clinical benefit in participants with HNSCC within the context of the anti-tumor effect observed in the small cohort of participants with HNSCC enrolled in INDUCE -1.

Refer to Section 8.8 for details on biomarkers 4. STUDY DESIGN 4.1. Overall Design This is a randomized, double -blinded , adaptive Phase II/III study comparing the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy to placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy in participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or larynx . The first decision that will inform on the Study 209227 design is guided by the analysis of external data from Study 209229 of ORR /DCR per RECIST v1.1 in the approximate first 100 participants across the 2 study treatment arms (PD-L1 CPS ≥1 population) with a minimum follow -up of 6 months [GlaxoSmithKline Document Nu mber 2019N403389_03 ]. If the outcome of the decision from Study 209229 expands Study 20922 9 to a Phase III study, then there will be no pause in enro llment for Study 209227, and the sample size for the Study 209227 Phase III design becomes 640 participants (refer to Section 9.2.1 ). If the analysis for the adaptive decision in Study 209229 is to remain as a Phase II then Study 209227 will be conducted as a Phase II/III seamless design with the second adaptive decision for Study 209227 based on the outcome of the first OS analysis within Study 209227 . This first OS analysis will occur after 9 months of OS follow -up in the first 300 participants ; there will be a pause in enro llment . If the outcome of the decision is for Study 209227 to expand to a Phase III study, an additional 340 participants will be randomized . Otherwise, Study 209227 will stop for futility, then no further enrollment will occur and no further analysis for OS will be performed. Refer to Section 9.2 and Section 9.5 for details on sample size estimations and operating characteristics of the efficacy analyses. If the an alysis for the adaptive decision in Study 209229 is to stop for futility ( ∆ORR<0% and ∆DCR<0%) then Study 209227 may stop and no further accrual will occur . In addition, all available data from other clinical studies may inform on the decision of a Phase III design. If Study 209227 expands to a Phase III, a ll participants randomized are included for inference at the end of Phase III (approximately 640 participants) . In addition, all primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints are formally tested for sta tistical significance at the end of Phase II /III or Phase III. The study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient reported outcomes of GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 1) compared with placebo in combin ation with pembrolizumab and 5FU-platinum chemotherapy (Arm 2) as a standard first -line regimen in HNSCC. Study participants will"
37,page_37,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 37 be stratified by PD -L1 CPS status, and HPV status for oropharyngeal cancers then randomly assigned to the two treatment arms i n a 1:1 ratio. Stratification factor subgroups are PD -L1 CPS by central laboratory assessment (CPS 20 versus 1≤ CPS<20 versus CPS <1), and HPV status in oropharynx sites only (p16 positive versus negative/unknown) versus non -oropharyngeal sites. The overal l proportion of participants by PD-L1 C PS status in the study population will be capped such that PD -L1 CPS 20, 1 CPS <20 or CPS <1 will not exceed the expected proportion by 5% for any subgroup. The study schematic is provided in Section 1.2. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The rationale for progressing the combination of GSK3359609 with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in Study 209227 is supported by the efficacy and safety d ata of the GSK3359609 plus pembrolizumab combination in p articipants with HNSCC from Study 204691 (refer to Section 2.2.3 ), the response rate observed is from a single arm cohort . Thus , the basis for using the Study 209229 adaptive decision analysis as external data to inform on the Study 209227 study design is Study 209229 will evaluate in a randomized fashion the response rate of the combination compared with pembrolizumab alone. This approach supports a Phase III design by properly balancing the risk and benefit of the Phase III expansion decision. A Phase II/III design is deemed an efficient approach to consider potentially expanding into a Phase III study ba sed on pre -specified adaptive decision rules by randomizing additional participants without changing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrollment, endpoints and randomization scheme. The co-primary endpoints are appropriate for this population as ov erall survival is the gold standard measure of clinical benefit and PFS by RECISTv1.1 as a direct measure of disease control in a randomized Phase III study setting The selection of pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy in the contro l arm is supported by the data from KN -048 in which this combination demonstrated a significant clinical improvement in OS in all participants compared with the EXTREME regimen [ Burtness , 2018; Rischin , 2019]; this evidence supported the FDA approval of pembrolizumab in combination with 5FU/platinum chemotherapy in the first-line disea se setting for patients with R/M HNSCC. Randomization will be stratified by the following factors associated as prognostic, and selective of clinical benefit from pembrolizumab: 1. PD-L1 CPS (degree of benefit from pembrolizumab depended on PD -L1 status [Burtness , 2018 ; Rischin , 2019 ]) 2. HPV status (established as a prognostic factor in the oropharynx region and oropharyngeal cancers are staged according by HPV status [Fung , 2017 ; AJCC , 2017 ])"
38,page_38,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 38 The placebo -controlled, double -blinded design will mitigate the intentional or inadvertent bias inherent to an open -label study. 4.3. Justification for Dose 4.3.1. GSK3359609 Dose Justification The dose of GSK3359609 planned for registration studies in HNSCC is 24 -mg administered Q3W. The 24 mg dose of GSK3359609 was selected based upon the cumulative clinical evidence to date from the first -time in human (FTIH) Study 204691/I NDUCE -1 that included preliminary efficacy data from the GSK3359609/pembrolizumab combination HNSCC expansion cohort, pooled preliminary population PK and exposure -response assessments, as well as peripheral target engagement and preliminary tumor biomarke r assessments. Overall, GSK3359609 clinical data demonstrate a lack of dose -dependent differences in efficacy or safety outcomes. A flat GSK3359609 exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safety was found in participants across the range of dose le vels evaluated (0.001mg/kg to 3 mg/kg). Exposures for 24 -mg Q3W are expected to lie within this dose level range and will be close to those obtained with 0.3 mg/kg Q3W, the dose level where in the HNSCC cohort durable objective responses were observed in c ombination with 200 -mg pembrolizumab. The PK disposition of GSK3359609 was evaluated after 30 minutes of IV infusion at the aforementioned dose level range in Study 204691. A preliminary population PK model (n = 251; October 2018), which characterized the influence of body weight, age, and other participant covariates on exposure, has been developed. Results indicate the PK disposition of GSK3359609 is consistent with that of other humanized mAbs, which typically have a low clearance (CL) and a limited cent ral volume of distribution (Vc). Plasma concentration -time profiles of GSK3359609 exhibit a bi -exponential decline with dose-proportional increases in exposure, e.g. Cmax and Cmin. The preliminary comparisons of the FTIH data from Part 1 (monotherapy) vers us Part 2 (pembrolizumab combination) demonstrate no differences in GSK3359609 exposure with concomitant administration of pembrolizumab; no drug -drug interaction affecting PK for the combination of GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab would be anticipated given t hat both are mAb catabolized via high capacity, non -specific pathways. The preliminary FTIH population PK analysis dataset encompassed a wide distribution of bodyweight, with a median of 73 kg and a range of 40.8 –133 kg. Estimates (90% confidence intervals [CI]) of the relationship between clearance and body weight based on the population PK model revealed an allometric exponent (α) of 0.056 (95% CI, - 0.364 – 0.475) for the CL and 0.314 (95% CI, -0.009 – 0.637) for Vc. In theory, body - weight –based dosing wou ld be considered most appropriate where CL scales linearly with patient bodyweight (α equals to 1), whereas fixed dosing would be more appropriate when CL is unaffected by body weight (α = 0). Given that α estimates were closer to 0 for both CL and Vc, no advantage of weight -based dosing over fixed dosing is expected for GSK3359609. Distributions of GSK3359609 exposures from potential fixed doses administered Q3W were simulated with the preliminary FTIH population PK model and compared with the distribution s expected from weight -based dosing regimens, using"
39,page_39,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 39 bodyweight distributions resampled from the Centers for Disease Control National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database. These simulations reveal that a GSK3359609 bodyweight -based dose results in slightly higher exposure in heavier weight participants, with a GSK3359609 fixed dose expected to provide more consistent control of PK variability across the entire bodyweight spectrum. As previously indicated, no MTD was established and no dose limiti ng toxicities were observed in the dose escalation cohorts over the range of GSK3359609 dose levels (0.001 mg/kg [~0.08 mg] to 3 mg/kg [~240 mg]) evaluated in Study 204691. An exposure -response, time -to-event analysis of all reported Grade 2 A Es supports the conclusion of similar safety outcomes across the exposure/dose range evaluated, both in pooled monotherapy cohorts and pembrolizumab combination cohorts. Evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction were observed in the HNSCC expansion cohort at the 0.3 mg/kg dose level. Doses of 0.3 mg/kg (~24 -mg) showed high ICOS receptor occupancy (RO) levels on CD4 and CD8 T cells over the 21 -day dosing cycle. Concentration -ICOS RO analyses suggest bodyweight -based doses of approximat ely >0.1 mg/kg maintained approximately >~70% CD4/CD8 RO over the entire dosing interval. Preliminary exposure -response assessments of tumor size reduction at Week 9 (stratified by tumor type) demonstrate little difference in efficacy outcomes across the exposure/ dose range evaluated. Hence, the integrated body of evidence supports a 24 -mg Q3W dose for evaluation in the pivotal studies of HNSCC in combination with pembrolizumab. The distribution of exposures fro m the 24 -mg fixed dose are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 0.3 mg/kg dose, and importantly, will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range established in the FTIH study. 4.3.2. Pembrolizumab Dose Justification The p lanned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. This pembrolizumab dose and schedule is consistent with that administered in the KN -048 study and which is administered in combination with GSK3359609 in the ongoing INDUCE -1 study. Based on the to tality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications, regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by: • Clinical data from 8 randomized stu dies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure - efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), • Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and • Pharm acology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK [PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W. Among the 8 randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with melanoma and non -small cell lung cancer, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all -comers) and"
40,page_40,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 40 different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose - and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5 -fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently, flat dose -exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally, pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data in KN001 evalua ting target -mediated drug disposition conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD -1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Second, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration an d PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant co variates on exposure, has shown that the fixed - dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK c haracteristics and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols. 4.3.3. Chemotherapy Dose Justification In Arm 1 and Arm 2, carboplatin (AUC 5) or cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 may be combined with 5FU at 1000 mg/m2 (Refer to Table 5). The doses selected were in accordance w ith standard doses given for first -line treatment of R/M HNSCC [ Vermorken , 2008]. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including follow -up for survival or until follow -up for survival is no longer required (refer to Section 7.1).

GSK personnel or delegates, except GSK staff involved in the review/monitoring of site pharmacy records and GSK clinical supplies group, will remain blinded to each participa nt’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study. GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance staff may unblind the intervention assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be s ent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the participant’s intervention assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. In the event of a medical emergency, Investigators may unblind a participant’s treatment assignment immediately through the IRT system by accessing a participant’s home screen using the Subjects tab and clicking the Unblind button . Further details may be found in the SRM and the IRT manual. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance • All study agents will be intravenously administered to participants at the site.

53,page_53,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 53 Please note: In instances where the investigator is directed to permanently discontinue study treatment, the instructions are mandatory as described in Section 7.1. All AEs are to be graded according to NCI -CTCAE (version 5.0) [NCI, 2017 ]. All dose modifications and the reason(s) for the dose modification must be documented in the eCRF . Refer to pembrolizumab prescribing information [KEYTRUDA , 201 9] or IB [ Merck , 2021] for additional information regarding the background and the management of other AEs or potential safety -related issues. The investigator may consult the GSK Medical Monitor on study tre atment modifications (i.e., holds or discontinuation) or on the management of AEs. 6.6.1. General Guidelines for Immune -Related Adverse Events AEs associated with immunotherapy treatment may be immune -mediated . These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment, or during the treatment course, and may affect more than one body system simultaneously . Therefore, early recognition of and initiation of treatment for these events is critical to re duce potential complications. Based on existing data from the study 204691, most treatment -related AEs were Grade 1 or 2, managed with supportive care and if appropriate the administration of corticosteroids . For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm the etiology or exclude other causes . Additional procedures or tests such as, but not limited to, bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation . Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue treatment and administer corticosteroids . Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with immunotherapies are provided in Table 6. Before administration of study treatment, investigators are to review a participant’s AEs, concomitant medications, and clinical evaluation results, e.g., vital signs, laboratory results, ECOG PS, physical examination findings, responses, etc. as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1) to monitor for new or worsening irAEs and ensure continues dosing is appropriate. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) AESI are defined as events of potential immunologic etiology, including irAE s. Such events recently reported after treatment with other immune modulatory therapy include colitis, uveitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, diarrhea, endocrine disorders, and specific cutaneous toxicities, as well as other events that may be immune mediated. Table 6 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune - Related AEs General instructions: • Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon irAE improving to Grade 1 and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks."

Dose Modification and Toxicity Management of Infusion - Reactions Related to Immunothera py Treatment Infusion reactions are a well -documented AE associated with the adminis tration of mAb. Infusion reactions typically develop within 30 minutes to 2 hours after initiation of drug infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 48 hours. The incidence of infusion reactions varies by mAb agent, and there are multiple mechanisms known to lead to infusion -related reactions including both IgE -dependent anaphylactic and non -IgE dependent anaphylactoid hypersensitivities. Cytokine release syndrome , and when severe, cytokine “storm”, has been identified as a sequela of the immune system activation associated with infusion reactions. Infusion reactions may affect any organ system in the body ; most are mild in severity, although severe and even fatal reactions occur. As a group, infusion reactions (including both cytokine -mediated and allergic) usually occur during or within a few hours of drug infusion. Occasionally, a reaction may occur 1 to 2 days after administration . The NCI-CTCAE (version 5.0) fo r grading adverse reactions during chemotherapy administration has a scale for grading the severity of infusion reactions and separate grading scales for allergic reactions and anaphylaxis . While use of these separate grading scales may be useful for class ifying the nature of an infusion reaction for research purposes, they are less useful for clinical care, since it may not be obvious if the participant is having an allergic infusion reaction or a non -allergic infusion reaction. Clinically, an infusion re action may present with flushing, itching, urticaria, and/or angioedema, repetitive cough, sudden nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, and/or change in voice quality, faintness, tachycardia (or less often bradycardia), hypotension, hypertension and/or loss of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and/or diarrhea, sense of impending doom, tunnel vision, dizziness, and/or seizure, severe back, chest, and pelvic pain. Refer to Table 8 for dose modification and treatment guidance for immunotherapy infusion reactions. To better understand the underlying etiology of these events, serum tryptase, C -reactive protein (CRP), ferri tin, and a cytokine panel should be drawn during the occurrence of an infusion reaction/CRS of any grade as outlined in Table 7. The serum tryptase, CRP and ferritin p anels should be performed at the investigator’s designated local laboratory . The serum cytokine panel will be performed at a GSK designated laboratory . These data will aid in the classifying (albeit retrospectively) the etiology of the AE ."

Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participants will receive study treatment for th e duration indicated in Section 6.1 as applicable, unless one of the following events occurs earlier: • Disease progression • Death • Unacceptable toxicity (refer to Section 6.6 and subsections) • Pregnancy (refer to Section 8.3.5 for details) In addition, study treatment may be permanently discontinued f or any of the following reasons: • Deviation(s) from the protocol or non -compliance with study requirements • Request of the participant or proxy (withdrawal of consent by participant or proxy) • Discretion of the investigator • Participant is lost to follow -up • Closure or termination of the study Participants who have disease progression by RECIST v1.1 may continue study treatment up to the protocol specified 35 cycles at the discretion of the Investigator to confirm progression as per iRECIST guidelines . Nevertheless, the consideration to continue study treatment should be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the participant is clinically stable . Continuation on study treatment is contingent upon the following conditions: • Absence of clinical signs o r symptoms indicating clinically significant disease progression • ECOG PS has not worsened, or worsening by no more than 1 point from baseline • Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (e.g., CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor"

All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for any reason (except consent withdrawn) will have safety assessments at the time of discontinuation and during follow -up as s pecified in the SoA. The primary reason study treatment was permanently discontinued must be documented in the participant’s medical records and eCRF . If the participant voluntarily discontinues from treatment due to toxicity, ‘adverse event (AE)’ will be recorded as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation on the eCRF. Once a participant has permanently discontinued from study treatment, the participant will not be allowed to be retreated. Refer to the SoA for assessments to be performed at the tim e study treatment is permanently discontinued and for evaluations that need to be completed. All participant s who permanently discontinue study treatment without disease progression will be followed for progression according to the protocol -defined on - treatment disease assessment schedule in the SoA until one or more of the following occur: • a new anticancer therapy is initiated • disease progression • death All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment for any reason, ex cept withdrawal of consent (refer to Section 7.2) will be followed for survival every 12 weeks until death or until the last participant discontinues treatment and has had their last follow up for safety . The every 12 -week schedule (refer to Table 1 SoA for details of frequency of all assessments during follow -up peri od) should begin once study treatment has been permanently discontinued. If participants are unable or unwilling to attend clinic visits during follow -up, contact to assess survival, may be made via another form of communication (e.g., telephone, email, et c.). 7.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping, and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology. Discontinuation of study intervention for abnormal liver tests is required when: • a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in Section 10.8 and Section 6.6.1 or"
62,page_62,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 62 • when in the presence of abnormal liver chemistries not meeting protocol -specified stopping rules, the investigator believes study intervention discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant. 7.1.2. Rechallenge 7.1.2.1. Study Intervention Restart or Rechallenge after liver stopping criteria met If participant meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge participant with study intervention unless: • GSK Medical Governance approval is granted • Ethics and/or IRB approval is obtained, if required, and • Separate consent for intervention restart/rechallenge is signed by the participant Refer to Section 10.8 and Section 10.8.1 for details. If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart/rechallenge participant with study intervention is not granted , then participant must permanently discontinue study intervention and may continue in the study for protocol -specified follow up assessments. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation /Withdrawal from the Study • A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. This is expected to be uncommon. • At the time of discontinuing from the study, an early discontinuation visit should be conducted, as shown in the SoA. Refer to SoA (Table 1) for the assessments at the time of study discontinuation • The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention and from the study at that time. • If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. • If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destru ction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 7.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:"
63,page_63,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 63 • The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counse l the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must m ake every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in th e participant’s medical record. • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES • Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. • Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed • Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. • Adherence to the study design requirem ents, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. • All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log or equivalent to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failu re, as applicable. • Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified cr iteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. • The maximum volume of blood collected from each participant from Screening through Week 21 of the study treatment phase is estimated not to excee d 180 mL • Note: Repeat or unscheduled blood samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples; these estimates are not included in the calculated maximum Screening All screening assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to randomization unless otherwise specif ied.

The term ‘baseline’ refers to the asse ssment performed during the screening period prior to first dose of study treatment that serves as a comparison or control. For example, the baseline laboratory assessment is the laboratory assessment performed prior to first dose. Refer to SoA ( Table 1) for additional details on assessments required at Screening and prior to start of study treatment. The following assessments are required during screening: • Demographic para meters such as year of birth and sex will be captured • Medical history including cardiovascular medical history, tobacco use, and other risk factors will be assessed as related to the inclusion/exclusion criteria • Disease characteristics including medical, s urgical, and treatment history (best response to prior therapy [radiotherapy and systemic] will be recorded), date of initial diagnosis, primary tumor location, stage at initial diagnosis, histology, HPV status (if available, by the CINtec p16 histology as say; required in oropharyngeal cancers, refer to Table 1), tumor genetic/genomic features and current sites of disease will be taken as part of the disease history/status. • Tumor tissue sent to central laboratory (refer to Section 5.1, inclusion criterion 1 2 for tissue requirements) for the following required screening assessments: o PD-L1 protein expression using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay by central laboratory testing ; an evaluable CPS score is required for eligibility ▪ If PD -L1 IHC testing by 22C3 pharmDx assay was performed for eligibility to Study 209229, retesting is not required provided result was evaluable for CPS NOTE : the PD -L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx is US FDA approved and CE marked in the European Union (EU) o p16 IHC using the CINtec p16 histology assay for the assessment of HPV status (only required in oropharyngeal cancers and if results not available by local laboratory testing /prior testing ) Baseline lesion assessments per RECIST v1.1 guideline [ Eisenhauer , 2009] are required within 28 days randomization and include: • Computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast of the chest and abdomen (must include complete imaging of the liver o Note: Although a CT scan is preferred, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used as an alternative method of baseline disease assessment, especially for those participants where a CT scan is contraindicated due to allergy to contrast .

Thus, p articipants with disease progression by RECIST version 1.1 guidelines may have a confirmatory disease assessmen t no sooner than 4 weeks after the date disease progression was declared in order to c onfirm disease progression by iRECIST guidelines. Confirmatory scans may be done as per clinical standard of care and at the discretion of the investigator up to the prot ocol specified 35 cycles. The visit level responses and treatment -based decisions will incorporate i RECIST guidelines [Seymour , 2017]. Refer to the SoA ( Table 1) for the frequency of disease assessments post Screening. Imaging of the head/neck, chest and abdomen is required at each disease assessment visit and at confirmation of disease progression ; the same modality used at Screening must remain consistent throughout the study duration. Other imaging modalities and regions assessed at Screening and required to measure/evaluate the target and nontarget lesio ns are required at each visit and for confirmation of disease progression. A random BICR audit will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis. Participant BICR randomization designation will no t be known to the investigators; refer to Section 9.7 for details. All imaging scans and clinical assessments (i.e., photographs) performed at Screening and at each disease assessment visit, including unscheduled assessment visits, are required to be uploaded at each visit occurrence for BICR. Refer to the imaging manual for details on imaging/clinical assessment requirements and sub mission guidelines. 8.1.1. Disease Assessments • RECIST version 1.1 guidelines will be used to determine the overall tumor burden at screening, select target and non -target lesions, and in the disease assessments through the duration of the study [ Eisenhauer , 2009]. • As indicated in RECIST version 1.1 guidelines: • Lymph nodes that have a short axis of <10 mm are considered non -pathological and must not be record ed or followed. • Pathological lymph nodes with <15 mm but 10 mm short axis are considered non-measurable. • Pathological lymph nodes with 15 mm short axis are considered measurable and can be selected as target lesions; however, lymph nodes should not be se lected as target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. • Measurable lesions up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions, and recorded and m easured at baseline. These lesions should be selected based on their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically)."
67,page_67,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 67 Note: Cystic lesions thought to represent c ystic metastases must not be selected as target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available. Note : Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated and have not been shown to be progressing following irradiation must not be considered a s target lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered measurable. Bone scans, FDG -PET scans or X -rays are not considered adequate imaging techniqu es to measure bone lesions. • All other lesions (or sites of disease) must be identified as non -target and must also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions will be grouped by organ. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or abs ence of each must be noted throughout follow -up. • Disease assessment modalities may include imaging (e.g., CT scan, MRI, bone scan) and physical examination (as indicated for palpable/superficial lesions). • At each post -baseline assessment, evaluation of the sites of disease (all target and non-target lesions) identified by the baseline scans is required. CT scans with contrast of the chest, and abdomen, or if contra -indicated, MRI, is required at each post-baseline assessment. To ensure comparability between the baseline and subsequent assessments, the same method of assessment and the same technique will be used when assessing response. • Refer to the SoA for the frequency of disease assessment. Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule and should n ot be affected by dose interruptions/delays. • Participants whose disease responds (either CR or PR) may have a confirmatory disease assessment performed at least 4 weeks after the date of assessment during which the response was demonstrated. More frequent disease assessments may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. . 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 8.2.1. Physical Examinations • A complete physical examination performed at Screening will include, at a minimum, assessment of the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. • A brief physical examination performed at each subsequent visit will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). • Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses."

Vital Signs • Vital signs will be measured after 5 minutes of rest and will include temperature, systolic and d iastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry). Blood pressure should be taken in the same position throughout the study and captured in the eCRF. • Vital signs will be measured more frequently if wa rranted by clinical condition of the participant. • If a participant develops fever and infusion related reaction or cytokine release syndrome is suspected, refer to management guidelines (Section 6.6.2 ). • Height will be recorded at Screening only. • Weight will be measured and recorded (in kilograms) at baseline and at every treatment visit. 8.2.4. Electrocardiograms A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at Screening as indicated in the SoA using an ECG machine that calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, and QT intervals. The QT interval corrected for heart rate or RR interval using Fridericia’s formula may be by machine or manual calculation. ECG after Screening will be performed as clinically indicated. 8.2.5. Echocardiograms Echocardiogram will be performed at Screening to assess cardiac ejection fraction for the purpose of study eligibility, as specified in the SoA and Section 5.1. Additional ECHO assessments may be performed if clinically warranted. MUGA can be used in lieu of ECHO (if not available) in the assessment of LVEF; the same modality should be used in any subsequent assessments. 8.2.6. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments • Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency. The clinical laboratory tests will be performed by local laboratory unless otherwise indicated. • The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition."
69,page_69,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 69 • All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 30 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. • If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. • All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3 . The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study interventio n or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (Refer to Section 7). All AEs are to be graded a ccording to NCI -CTCAE ( version 5.0) [ NCI, 2017]. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information • All AESIs and SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment at the time points specified in the SoA ( refer to Appendix 3 for details on SAEs ).

The investigator will"
70,page_70,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 70 submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event . • Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs a nd SAEs • The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 . • Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open - ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence . 8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non -serious AESIs will be followed until event s are resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participa nt is lost to follow -up as defined in Section 7.3. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs • Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. • The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies abo ut the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. • For all studies except those utilizing medical devices investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessar y. • An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE s) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements."
71,page_71,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 71 8.3.5. Pregnancy • Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 120 days after the last dose of stu dy treatment. • If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy . • Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are consid ered SAE. 8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events For any cardiovascular events detailed in Section 10.3.3 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 8.3.7. Events of Clinical Interest Selected events that may be non -serious or serious adverse events and are considered as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) in this study protocol and must be reported to the Sponsor. Events of clinical interest include: 1. An overdose of Study Treatment (GSK3359609/Pembrolizumab) , as defined in Section 8.4 that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. An elevated AST (aspartate aminotransferase ) or ALT (alanine aminotransferase ) lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as deter mined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be made available. It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the settin g of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline"

EORTC I tem Library 50 and 51: Select Domains from the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ -HN35 The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30-item Core module (EORTC QLQ -C30) is the core module designed to cover a broad range of cancer patients and is intended to be supplemented with disease - specific sub -scales as necessary to assess QoL aspects particular to a given type of cancer and to improve the specificity and sensitivit y of measurement [ Sprangers , 1993; Aaronson , 1993]. Select domains from the EORTC QLQ -C30 will b e administered and will be referred to as the EORT C IL50 . The 35-Item Head and Neck Module (EORTC QLQ -H&N35 ) is a head and neck specific module with multi -item scales [ Bjordal , 199 4]. The mouth pain, swallowing, speech problems, opening mouth, coughing, feeding tube, and trouble with social eating domains will be administered and referred to as the EORTC IL51 . 8.11.2. Brief Pain Inventory Short -Form - Item 3 (BPI -SF I3) The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form was designed to assess pain and its impact in cancer. Item 3 measures ‘pain at its worst’ in the last 24 hours using a numerical rating scale of 0 ) to 10 ( scale [ Cleeland , 1994]. 8.11.3. The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Short Form Physical Function - 8 item (PROMIS SF PF 8c) The Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) is a universally applicable set of instruments measuring patient -reported health across different patient populations developed by the US National Institutes for Health (NIH) [Cella , 2007] . The PROMIS -SF PF assesses physical function and measures self -reported capability rather than actual performance of physical activities. This includes the functioning of one’s upper extremities (dexterity), lower extremities (walking or mobility), and central regions (neck, back), as well as instrumental activities of daily living, such as running errands . 8.11.4. Patient Global Impression Items (PGIS and PGIC) The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) assesses global impressio n of symptoms severity at baseline and subsequent timepoints. The second question, the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) serves to rate the global change in symptoms at subsequent time points. In addition to evaluating symptom severity and change, these questions serve as anchors to establish thresholds of clinically meaningful change for the questionnaires in the study [ Guy, 1976]. 8.11.5. Euro qol Questionnaire (EQ -5D-3L) The EQ -5D-3L is a standardi zed instrument for use as a measure of health utility. It is designed for self -completion or interview administration and is cognitively simple, taking only a few minutes to complete. CCI CCI"
78,page_78,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 78 The EQ -5D-3L self -assessment questionnaire has 2 parts. The first part consists of 5 items covering 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Ea ch dimension is measured by a 3 -point Likert scale (no problems, some or moderate problems, and unable or extreme problems). Respondents are asked to choose one level that reflects their ""own health state today"" for each of the 5 dimensions. Respondents ca n be then classified into one of 243 distinct health states. The second part is a 20 -cm visual analogue scale (EQ -VAS) that has endpoints labelled ""best imaginable health state"" and ""worst imaginable health state"" anchored at 100 and 0, respectively. Respo ndents are asked to indicate how they rate their own health by drawing a line from an anchor box to that point on the EQ -VAS which best represents their own health on that day. EQ -5D-3L health states are converted to a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches weights to each of the levels in each dimension. The formula is based on the valuation of EQ -5D health states from general population samples. 8.11.6. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General Population (FACT -GP5) The FACT -G (now in Version 4) is a 27 -item compilation of general questions divided into 4 primary QoL domains: Physical Well -Being, Social/Family Well -Being, Emotional Well -Being, and Functional Well -Being [ Cella , 1993]. It is considered appropriate for use with participants with any form of cancer and has also been used and validated in other chronic illness condition ( e.g., HIV/AIDS and multiple sclerosis) and in the general population (usi ng a slightly modified version). The FACT -G scale has been developed and validated [ Cella , 1993] and is widely used to measure HRQoL in patients with a broad range of cancer diagnoses [ Lee, 2004]. The FACT GP5 it em is a single item from the FACT -G, which assesses how bothersome the side effects of treatment are for cancer patients. The recall period is the past 7 days, and the item has a 5 -category response scale ranging from “0= to “4= . This item is being included to assess the overall tolerability of treatment from the participant’s perspective. 9.

All other secondary endpoints will be summarized descriptive ly. 9.2. Sample Size Determination The adaptive Phase II/III study design allows the study to be a Phase II /III or Phase III study, subject to the outcome of the efficacy analys is at the adaptive decision point s The first adaptive decision point that informs on Study 209227 design results from Study 209229, which are data external from Study 209227 . The timing of the analysis for adaptive decision in Study 209229 will occur when approximately 100 PD -L1 CPS 1 participants have a minimum follow -up of 6 months a nd will be conducted using ORR/DCR per RECIST v1.1 based on investigator assessment. The adaptive decision criteria are defined positive if there is at least an 8% improvement of ORR in the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab arm compared with the pembrolizumab/placebo arm in the PD -L1 CPS 1 population of Study 209229 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2019N403389_03 ]. • If the analysis for the adaptive decision in Study 209229 (INDUCE -3; NCT04128696) is positive (∆ORR 8%), then Study 209227 will become a Phase III study that includes no pause in enrollment. • If the analysis for the adaptive decision in Study 209229 is to remain as a Phase II study (0% ∆ORR<8% , or ∆ORR< 0% and ∆DCR>0% ), then Study 209227 will be a Phase II/III adaptive study and the sample size will depend upon the outcome of the interim OS analysis within Study 209227; refer to Section 9.2.2 and Section 9.5 for details . • If the analysis for the adaptive decision in Study 209229 is to stop for futility (∆ORR<0% and ∆DCR<0%) then Study 209227 may stop. Should a Phase II /III study be decided, then the Study 209227 will randomize approximately 300 participants with a 1:1 ratio between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab plus platinum -based chemotherapy arm and the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab plus platinum -based chemotherapy arm . Assuming the aforementioned prevalence rate of PD -L1 CPS status, a sample size of 300 participants will approximately provide 129 PD-L1 CPS 20 participants, 126 PD -L1 1≤CPS<20 participants and 45 PD -L1 CPS <1 participants. Should a Phase III study be decided, t he study will randomize approximately 640 participants with a 1:1 ratio between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembroliz umab and platinum -based chemotherapy arm and the placebo in combination"
81,page_81,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 81 with pembrolizumab and platinum -based chemotherapy arm. A sample size of 640 participants will approximately provide 275 PD-L1 CPS 20 participants , 269 PD-L1 1≤CPS<20 participants and 9 6 PD-L1 CPS <1 participants . The sample size calculation is driven by survival events. There will be two interim analyses of OS and no interim analyses of PFS. The family -wise type I error rate for the primary hypotheses on PFS and OS i s strongly controlled at 2.5% (one -sided). The strategy to address multiplicity issues with regards to multiple efficacy endpoints and interim analyses are described in Section 9.8 and Section 9.5. The sample size, power calculations, and simulations were performed in the software EAST 6.4 and R version 3.6.2 (package “gsDesign ”). The study is considered to have met the study primary objective if GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum -based chemotherapy is superior to the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum -based chemotherapy for either OS or PFS in the total population . 9.2.1. Phase III Study with No Pause of Enrollment Overall Survival A total of 640 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The final OS analysis will be carried out after approximately 410 eve nts have occurred across two arms in the total population . The sample size and power calculation of OS are based on the following assumptions: 1. The target hazard ratio is 0.72 at the end of study for OS between theGSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm and the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm 2. OS of the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm follows the same d istribution as the pembrolizumab + chemo therapy arm in the total population of KN-048 trial. That is, the survival rates at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months are approximately 77%, 53.0%, 29.4% and 22.6%, respectively , with a median survival time of 13 months 3. Enroll ment period of 21 months 4. Yearly drop -out rate of 5% The following alpha - and beta -spending functions are used in the OS hypothesis . • For the OS hypothesis, the alpha -spending function based on Lan -DeMet s O’Brien -Fleming approximation spending function and the beta -spending function based on the Hwang -Shih-DeCani boundary method with a gamma parameter of -20 are constructed to implement group sequential boundaries that control the type I error rate as well as allow for non -binding futility analysis."

Therefore, 2 OS scenarios were considered as it is expected that 1 of these scenarios will most likely be observed in 209227 trial. Scenario 1 – proportional hazard s with heavy tail Scenario 1 assumes the hazard rat io of OS is consistent between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm and the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm throughout the entire course of the study, with heavy tail s for both arms . Under the proportional hazard assumption with 410 events at the final analysis, the study provides 90 .6% power to demonstrate superiority of OS at the one-sided alpha level of 2.49% with a true HR of 0.7 2. Success for OS at the final analysis approximately corre sponds to an observed hazard ratio of 0.8 1. Scenario 2 – non-proportional hazards with delayed separation of OS curve and heavy tail Scenario 2 assumes the hazard ra tio of OS is non -proportional between the GSK3359609 in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm and the placebo in combination with pembrolizumab and 5FU/platinum chemotherapy arm , with heavy tails for both arms. Specifically, it is assumed that the hazard ratio between the two arms is ~1 for the first 6 months due to potential delayed treatment effect . A simulation study was performed with piecewise time varying hazard ratio of OS at time intervals shown below : 0-6 Month 6-12 Month 12-24 Month After 24 Month Hazard Ratio 1 0.69 0.52 0.50 The simulation showed the final analysis will be delayed by approximately 2 months compared with the proportional hazard scenario. Under the non-proportional hazard assumption with 410 events at the final analysis, the study provides 90.2% power to demonstrate superiority of OS at the one-sided alpha level of 2.49% at the final analysis . Success for OS at the final analysis approximately corresponds to an observed hazard ratio of 0.8 1. Progression -free Survival The final PFS analysis will be carried out after approximately 470 events have occurred across two arms. The final PFS analysis is expected to occur at approximately 9 months after the last participant is enrolled in the study. With 470 PFS events, the study has 93.1% power to demonstrate superiority in PFS when the true hazard ratio for PFS is 0.6 2 at type I error rate of 0. 01% (one -sided).

Thus, 300 and 340 participants will be enro lled before and after IA1, respectively, with an approximate 12 month s pause in enrollment between the 2 enro llment phases . Overall Survival The final OS analysis is event driven and will be carried out after appr oximately 425 events have occurred across 2 arms. The sample size and power calculation of OS are based on the following assumptions: 1.

Unlike RECIST 1.1, iRECIST requires the confirmation of progression and uses the terms unconfirmed progressive disease ( iUPD) and confirmed progressi ve disease (iCPD ). The progression event date (iPD date) to be used in the calculation of PFS per iRECIST should be the first date of documented iUPD provided that iCPD is confirmed at the next assessment. If iUPD occurs, but is disregarded because of later iSD, iPR, or iCR, that iUPD date should not be used as the progression event date. If progression is not confirmed and there is no subsequent iSD, iPR, or iCR, then the iUPD date will be used as iPD date in the following scenarios: • Participant discontinues study treatment because the participant was judged not to be clinically stable • Participant does not und ergo further response assessments due to any reason (i.e., participant refusal, protocol non -compliance, or participant death) • Next timep oint response of iUPD, and iCPD never occurs Determination of dates of iPFS events and dates for censoring in the secondary analysis of iPFS are summarized in Table 11.

Patient Reported Outcomes EORTC IL50 and IL51 (subset of domains from the EORTC QLQ C30 and H&N35 respectively ) are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease symptoms and treatment tolerability in addition to HRQ oL domains . The time to deterioration (TTD) in Pain measured by the EORTC QLQ -H&N35 pain domain (included in the EORTC IL 51) and the TTD in Physical Function (PF) measured by the PROMIS PF 8c will be analysed in the ITT population using the non -paramet ric Kaplan -Meier method. The treatment effect in TTD will be assessed separately by the stratified log -rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (i.e., hazard ratio) between the treatment arms. The hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval from the stratif ied Cox model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported."
92,page_92,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 92 For both Pain and PF, TTD will be defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first definitive meaningful deterioration in score compared to baseline. The deterioration has to be: • Meaningful, i.e. greater than a clinically meaningful within -individual change in score, as defined below; • Definitive, i.e. two sequential assessment s of the score are showing a clinically meaningful dete rioration compared to baseline and no subsequent scores return to baseline , or no further score is available for the patients for any reason (including disease progression or death) Patients who don’t show meaningful deterioration will be censored at the t ime of the last available PRO assessment. As no threshold for meaningful within -individual change is established for the EORTC QLQ -H&N35 pain domain score or PROMIS PF 8c score, the value for use in the T TD analyses will be determined using blinded interim data from the phase II. These analyses will be performed before study unblinding and the value will be set -up before database lock. The full procedure for determination of meaningful within -person change in EORTC QLQ -H&N35pain domain score and PROMIS PF 8c score will be fully described in the clinical statistical analysis plan or in a standalone analysis plan , as appropriate . It will include anchor -based approach using the patient global impression o f severity and change as an anchors, and possibly other clinical anchors (e.g. ECOG status). Supportive distribution -based methods may be applied as sensitivity analyses. The EORTC IL50 , EORTC IL51 , BPI-SF I3 and EQ -5D changes will be summarized as part of the e xploratory analysis. Longitudinal and descriptive data analysis may be used to evaluate patient reported outcomes. The detailed PRO analysis plan will be included in a reporting and analysis plan document. 9.5. Interim Analyses If the study continues as a Phase III study, there will be two interim analyses on OS, allowing for early stopping of the study due to efficacy or allow for non -binding futility analysis. For the Phase III study with no enrol lment pause, the timing of the two interim analyses will be triggered by the pre -specified number of OS events in the total population . The final analysis of PFS will be aligned with the first OS interim analysis . For the Phase II/III study with an enrol lment pause, the first interim ana lyses of OS (IA1, adaptive decision making) will occur when the first 300 pa rticipants have a minimum follow -up of 9 months. A futility criterion of p-value > 0.1 for log-rank test of OS is pre - speci fied for adaptive decision making. If the futility criterion is not met at the first interim analysis (IA1) , the study will continue as a Phase III study and enrollment of an additional 340 participants to a total of 640 participants will occur . If the futility criterion is met in the OS analysis, the study will stop for futility . The timing of the second interim"

The final analysis of PFS will be aligned with the second OS interim analysis . The nominal significance levels for the interim and final analyses of OS will be determined by the Lan -DeMet s spending function based upon the O’Brien -Fleming boundary. The futility bounds of this study are non -binding and the bounds are considered guidance rather than strict bounds. Table 13 and Table 14 summarizes the required number of events , sample size and decision g uidance for the planned PFS and OS analyses for the 2 Phase III study scenarios , respectively . Efficacy boundaries and non -binding futility boundaries are based on initially assigned type I error rate before any alpha re -allocation and projected number of events at study mile stones. The actual boundaries will be determined from the actual number of interim analyses conducted and from the actual number of events , at the time of the specified interim analysis using the alpha - and beta - spending functions. Actual futility bounds will be updated if overall beta is changed with respect to alpha reallocat ion. Results of the interim analyses will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). Further details of interim analyses are provided in the IDMC Charter. Any change to the planned event size will be described in the statistical analys is plan before any unblinding of the data.

The IDMC membership and governance will be outlined in a separate charter. The IDMC will make recommendations for discontinuation or modifi cation of the study based on ongoing reviews of safety data according to the Charter. In addition, the IDMC will also evaluate all adaptive decision analyses , PFS analysis and OS interim analysis, and make recommendation s based on observed results of the s tudy and the totality of data available . In this double -blind study, all GSK and site personnel will be restricted from access to interim analysis results provided to the IDMC until the conclusion of the study, unless the IDMC recommends significant change s to study conduct that require a protocol amendment. In this scenario, after receiving the IDMC recommendation and a decision by Chief Medical Officer (CMO), a review of the data may be required. A select group from GSK, as determined by the CMO will be u nblinded to review the data to agree on future study conduct. Depending on the recommendation of the IDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. More details will be provided in the IDMC Charter. 9.7. Blinded Independent Central Review Auditing A ran dom sample -based BICR auditing approach will be used to assess whether bias exists in estimation of PFS hazard ratio between investigator assessments and BICR assessments [ Stone , 2015]. The study is currently designed as a randomized, double -blind study. The risk of investigator bias can be mitigated in a properly double -blinded randomized study [ Dodd , 2008]. The objective of the sample -based BICR approach is to corroborate the analysis results of the investigator -assessed PFS and to assist in the evaluation of potential bias. The BICR audit ap proach is not intended to provide an alternative means of definitive analysis. Evaluation bias will be assessed through the use of measure proposed by Stone et al [Stone , 2015 ]. The hazard ratio ratio (HRR), where HRR is defined as the ratio of the hazard ratio (HR) for the treatment effect estimated from the BICR to the corresponding HR for the investigator assessments , i.e. HRR=HR BICR/HR Inv. Larger values of HRR are suggesti ve of a less acceptable bias. The maximum acceptable HRR will be derived based on the graded approach [Stone , 2015]. For example, in order to preserve two -thirds of the observed HR based on investigator assessment , the maximum acceptable HRR is 1.204 if the full study HR based on investigator assessment is 0.62. If the sample HRR is within the range specified by the maximum acceptable HRR, it is concluded that the sample is sufﬁcient to rule out meaningful levels of bias , and no further scans will be assessed by the BICR ; otherwise the BICR will be performed in all participants . The audit size of the sample -based BICR will be 35% of all participants . Assuming the correlati on in the logarithm of HRs between investigator assessment and BICR is 0.85, with t he maximum acceptable HRR of 1.204 and the testing of evaluation of bias is"
96,page_96,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 96 conducted at the 10% alpha level , and 70% of participants have an event according to investigator assessment and 65% according to BICR, the audit size of 35% will ensure that the specificity is ~9 0% in all participants. 9.8. Multiplicity The family -wise type I error for this study is strongly control led at 2. 5% (one -sided) with 0.01% allocated to the PFS hypotheses and 2. 49% allocated to the OS hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the initial one -sided alpha-allocation for OS, PFS, and key PRO endpoints . The weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented on the lines connecting hypotheses.

Refer to Section 9.2 for alpha - and beta -spending functions used in the OS hypothesis for each possible desig n.

Definition of AE AE Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered r elated to the study intervention. • NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition • Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or in tensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. • Signs , symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. • ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, sympt oms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE."

Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: o Results in death o Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulf ills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. • Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."
107,page_107,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 107 Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial dis ruption. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious . • Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 10.3.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: • Myocardial infarction/unstable angina • Congestive heart failure • Arrhythmias • Valvulopathy • Pulmonary hypertension • Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack • Peripheral arterial thromboembolism • Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism • Revascularization"

Recording and Follow -Up of AE and SAE AE and SAE Recording • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation ( e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator will then record all relevant AE/S AE information in the CRF. • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the eve nt based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Severity • The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and will assign a grade according to the NCI -CTCAE v5.0 [NCI, 2017 ]. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. • A ""reasonable possibility"" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled o ut. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administr ation will be considered and investigated. • The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes th at he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred , and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very"
109,page_109,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 109 Assessment of Causality important that th e investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . • The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with t he updated causality assessment. • The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. • The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 10.3.5. Reporting of SAE to GS K SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool • The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. • If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. • The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes available. • After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. • If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see ne xt section) or to the medical monitor/SAE coordinator by telephone. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the SRM ."
110,page_110,TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 110 SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF • Refer to the SRM for the method to transmit the SAE paper CRF and to whom the information should be sent. • In rare circumstances notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. • Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and si gn the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in SRM .

GSK3359609 and pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero. Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. In order to participate in the study, participants of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement as indicated in Section 5.1 and Section 10.4.2 . If there is any question that a participant of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that participant should not be entered into the study . 10.4.1. Definitions: Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless pe rmanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear ( e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athl etes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categ ories are not considered WOCBP 1. Premenarchal 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: • Documented hysterectomy • Documented bilateral salpingectomy • Documented bilateral oophorectomy For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, ( e.g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant’s medical records, medic al examination, or medical history interview. 3. Postmenopausal female • A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. • A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used t o confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)."
112,page_112,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 112 However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required. • Females on HRT and whose meno pausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal stat us before study enrollment. 10.4.2. Contraception Guidance: Male participants • Male participants with female partners of child -bearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following during the protocol -defined time frame in Section 5.1. • Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent • Agree to use a male condom plus an additional method of contraception with a failure rate of <1% per year as described in Table 16 when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential • Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration for the duration of the study and for at least 120 days after the last dose of study treatment . Female participants Table 16 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE: • Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. • Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationc • Intrauterine device (IUD) • Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomized partner • Note: Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days."

The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. a. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical studies. b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently and correctly. c. If loca lly required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action. Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction) 10.4.3. Collection of Pregnancy Information: Male participants with partners who become pregnant • Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female partner of a male study participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. • After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregn ancy. • The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK. • Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.

Study Intervention Rechallenge Guidelines 10.8.1.1. Rechallenge Following Liver Stopping Events that are Possibly Related to Study Treatment Following drug -induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with nearly 50% fatality with halothane readministered within one month of initial injury. However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatality. Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include: • Hypersensitivity [Andrade , 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) • Jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bili rubin > 35% o f total) • Participant currently exhibits severe liver injury defined by: ALT >3xULN, bilirubin >2xULN (direct bilirubin > 35% of total), or INR>1.5 • Serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenges [Hunt , 2010; Papay , 2009] • Evidence of drug -related preclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [Hunt , 2010] )"
123,page_123,"TMF-13842020 CONFIDENTIAL 209227 123 Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI t his should only be considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favorable. Approval by GSK for rechall enge with study treatment can be considered where: • Investigator requests consideration of rechallenge with study treatment for a participant who is receiving compelling benefit with study treatment that exceeds risk, a nd no effective alternative therapy is available . • Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with study treatment must be obtained, as required . • If the rechallenge is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death . • The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the rechallenge with study treatment. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart . • Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK . • Participant s approved by GSK Medical Governance for rechallen ge with study treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liv er chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. • If after study treatment rechallenge, partici pant meets protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria, study treatment should be permanently discontinued. • GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as required, must be informed of the participant ’s outcome follow ing study treatment rechallenge. • GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 10.3. 10.8.1.2. Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events NOT Related to Study Treatment Restart refers to resuming study intervention following liver stopping events in which there is a cl ear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, restart is not permitted following liver stopping event when the underlying cause was alcohol - related hepatitis. Approval by GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where:"
