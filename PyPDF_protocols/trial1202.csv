SYNOPSIS Name of Sponsor/Company: TRACO N Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Name of Investigational Product: TRC105 Name of Active Ingredient: TRC105 (carotuximab) Title of Study: A RANDOMIZED PHASE 3 TRIAL OF TRC105 AND PAZOPANIB VERSUS PAZOPANIB ALONE IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED ANGIO SARCOMA (TAPPAS) Investigators and Study center(s): Approximately 40 centers in North America and Europe Studied period (years): Date first patient enrolled: December 2016 Estimated date last patient enrolled: March 2020 Estimated date phase 3 endpoint obtained: September 2020 Phase of development: 3 Rationale: Angiosarcoma , a subtype of soft tissue sarcoma, is a rare and aggressive vascular malignancy associated with poor prognosis. About half of these patients present with primary cutaneous lesion s (tumor arising from the skin, often consisting of multiple lesi ons and located in critical areas like head and neck) . Risk factors for this presentation include prior radiation exposure as well as inflammatory damage in chronically sun exposed skin. Non-cutaneous angiosarcoma may also occur in the setting of prior rad iation exposure. Angiosarcoma has also been associated with prolonged lymphedema from any cause or prolonged immune -suppression . Although complete resection with curative intent , followed by adjuvant radiotherapy , is the treatment of choice for localized disease amenable to surgery, approximately 50% of these patients will develop metastas es and die from the disease. Furthermore, metastas es are frequently present at the time of diagnosis. Current treatment options are limited and of modest benefit. Median overall survival is approximately 8 to 11 months for patients with metastatic disease. Aside from pazopanib, standard regimens for advanced angiosarcoma include taxanes , anthracycline s, and gemcitabine . Tumor control with these therapies is short -lived wit h median progression -free survival ( PFS) ranging from 3.9 to 6.6 months. The short time to progression following current treatment emphasizes that angiosarcoma is a disease in need of more effective and well tolerated treatment options . Pazopanib is an oral inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR )-1, VEGFR -2, and VEGFR -3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tum or growth, and cancer progression. Pazopanib is approved based on improved PFS in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy and approved in Europe for adult patients with selectiv e subtypes of advanced soft tissue s arcoma who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy. However, activity in angiosarcoma is limited; no complete responses were observed i n the largest series of an giosarcoma patients treated with single agent pazopanib reported to date (n=30). TRC105 (carotuximab) is a monoclonal antibody to endoglin (CD105) , an essential angiogenic target highly expressed on tumor vessels that is disti nct from VEGFR . Endoglin is also expressed directly on tumor cells in angiosarcoma and is upregulated following VEGF inhibition . TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastases in preclinical models and complements the activity of"

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendment #4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 4 of 112 bevacizumab and multi -kinase inhibitors that target the VEGFR. In a phase 1 study of advanced solid tumors, single agent TRC105 therapy reduced tumor burden at doses that were well-tolerated. By targeting a non -VEGF pathway that is upregulated following VEGF inhibition , TRC105 has the potential to complement VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) and could represent a major advance in the treatment of angiosarcoma. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may result in more effective angiogenesis inhibition and impro ved clinical efficacy over that seen with pazopanib alone. In a phase 1b/2 study of TRC105 and pazopanib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma, TRC105 , at its recommended phase 2 dose of 10 mg/kg given by weekly intravenous infusion , was combined safely with pa zopanib given at 800 mg p.o. once daily . Interim efficacy data from the Phase 1b/2 study indicated tumor reductions in all 5 of the first patients with angiosarcoma, of whom 2 had progressed following prior pazopanib treatment; notably, median PF S was grea ter than 12.9 months in these 5 patients and 2 of the 3 patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma achieved durable complete responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ). Data available from the patients in the expansion cohorts enrolling angiosarcoma patients continues to demonstrate activity and tolerability of TRC105 in combination with pazopanib. Objective s: Primary:  To compare PFS of TRC105 and pazopanib vs single agent pazopanib in patients with unresectable angiosarcoma Secondary:  To compare the objective response rate ( ORR ) of TRC105 and pazopanib vs single agent pazopanib in patients with unresectable angiosarcoma  To compare overall survival (OS) of TRC105 and pazopanib vs single agent pazopanib in patients with unresectable angiosarcoma  To assess the overall safety and tolerability of TRC105 and pazopanib vs single agent pazopanib in patients with unresectable angiosarcoma  To characterize patient reported outcomes between the two arms of the study  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of TRC105 and pazopanib between the two arms of the study  To assess PFS and ORR by Investigator assessment between the two arms of the study  To characterize the immunogenicity of TRC105 Exploratory:  To correlate efficacy endpoints ( e.g., PFS, ORR and OS ) with endoglin expression on angiosarcoma tumor samples  To correlate efficacy endpoints ( e.g., PFS, ORR and OS ) with circulating angiogenic protein biomarkers  To correlate efficacy endpoints (e .g., PFS , ORR and OS ) with numbers of endoglin expressing circulating tumor cells (CTCs) Endpoints : Primary:"

For the purpose of analysis for patients who are alive at the time of analysis and have not h ad disease progression, the following rules will apply: (1) The patient will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease; (2) if the patient was given antitumor treatment other than study drug treatment, the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor assessment prior to initiating that antitumor therapy; (3) if the patient was removed from study for toxicity or other reason , the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor asse ssment on study. With regar d to missed tumor assessments, in the event of one missed tumor assessment followed by a subsequent assessment of progressive disease (PD), the subsequent PD assessment qualifies as objective tumor progression . In the event of mo re than one consecutive missing tumor assessment followed by a subsequent ass essment of PD, the p atient will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment. Secondary:  Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients with a best respon se of complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) divided by the number of randomized patients. ORR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of randomization and the date of documented progression, as determined by Central Radiographic Review according to RECIST 1.1, or date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. For patients without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the ORR determination. A designation of CR or PR in this study requires confirmation at a subsequent consecutive assessment at least 4 wee ks following the initial designation of CR or PR , respectively . Duration of response (DR) will be reported in patients who achieve ORR, but without a formal statistical comparison between arms.  Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. Overall survival will be calculated in days as: Date of Death – Date of Randomization +1. Subjects alive or lost to follow -up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date when they were last known to be alive.  Type, incidence, severity (graded by National Cancer Institute [ NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE ] Version 4. 03), timing, seriousness, and relatedness of AEs and laboratory abnormalities.  Patient reported outcomes as measured by the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire ( EQ- 5D-5L) and the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire .  TRC105 and pazopanib pharmacokinetic (PK) concentrations will be measured using validated methods from peak and trough samples .  Anti-TRC105 an tibodies will be measured using validated methods and anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers will be correlated with PK parameters and AEs."

Adult p atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TRC105 in combination with standard dose pazopanib (Arm B) vs standard dose single agent pazopanib (Arm A). Patients will be stratified by angiosarcoma subtype (cutaneous vs non-cutaneous ) and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for angiosarcoma (0 versus 1 or 2). For the purposes of this study, cutaneous angiosarcoma will include primary skin/scalp angiosarcoma; all other angiosarcoma including primary subcutaneous angiosarcoma will be categorized as non-cutaneous ( e.g., visceral, bone, soft tissue). Due to possible differences in treatment effect in the cutaneous and non-cutaneo us angiosarcoma subgroups, an adaptive enrichment design will be employed. An interim analysis is planned after 40 events or 30 days after the enrollment of 120 patients from Cohort 1 and will result in one of the following decisions: (1) no change to the study design and sample size, (2) no change to the study design but an increase in the sample size, or (3) termination of enrollment of the non-cutaneous subtype and adjustment of the sample size of the cutaneous subtype . Cohort 1 is defi ned as the adult patients enrolled prior to the interim analysis . Enrol lment at a given site will be limited to a maximum of 15% of total patients. Additionally, enrollment of Cohort 1 will be monitored to ensure that no more than 50% of the total adult patients enrolled will have the non -cutaneous subtype. Treatment in the assigned arm must start within 3 calendar days of randomization. Trial Design Schema: Number of patients (planned): At least 190 patients will be enrolled. The number of patients enrolled may increase to a maximum of approximate ly 340 after the planned , prospectively specified interim analysis."

Dose modification of TRC105 is allowed per patient tolerance. Pazopanib dose and administration: Adult and adolescent patients with a BSA > 1.8 m2 will receive 800 mg of pazopanib beginning on C1D1 and once daily thereafter, in the absence of toxicity. All other p ediatric patients will receive 600 mg of pazopanib beginning on C1D1 and once thereafter, in the absence of toxicity. Treatment must start within 3 days of randomization. Dose modification of pazopanib is allowed per patient tolerance. Duration of treatment: Patients are eligible for treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent, or other reasons. A patient should be withdrawn from study treatment if, in the opinion of the Investigator, it is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient . In addition, patients will be withdrawn from treatment in the case of: 1. RECIST 1.1 -defined disease progression confirmed by central radiographic review . 2. A need for surgery, radiation, or other anticancer therapy not permitted under this protocol. 3. Lost to follow -up or substantial noncompliance with the protocol . 4. Pregnancy.

Patients in the combination arm who cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy and who demonstrate a response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination and are thought to benefit fr om continued single agent therapy may continue on study on TRC105 or pazopanib alone. Statistical Considerations : Efficacy Analyses The study population for efficacy (i.e., the intent -to-treat, ITT, population) will include all randomized adult patients . Patients age 12 to 17 will not be randomized and will receive treatment with TRC105 and pazopanib and therefore will not be included in the ITT population . The primary endpoint is PFS and the primary analysis will compare the TRC105 plus pazopanib and the single - agent pazopanib groups using a one-sided, stratified by angiosarcoma location (cutaneous versus non - cutaneous) and by number of lines of prior systemic chemo therapy for angiosarcoma (0 versus 1 -2) log rank test at the two-tailed alpha = 0.05 level of significance . Estimates of median PFS will be provided along with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals. The PFS distributions in the two arms will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method. The primary analyses of efficacy endpoints dependent on disease assessments (PFS and ORR ) will be performed in the ITT population based on results of the independent central application of modified RECIST 1.1 . Imaging will be performed every 42 days from date of randomization . Sample Size Justification A hazard ratio o f 0.55 is considered to be clinically relevant. Based on 1:1 randomization and the use of log -rank test at the 2-sided alpha of 0.05 level of significance, 95 events provides 83% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55."

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendment #4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 11 of 112 The expected PFS of angiosarcoma patients treated with pazopanib who have progressed following first line treatment is 4 months. A hazard ratio of 0.55 corresponds to an improvement of median PFS from 4 months to 7.27 months. Due to the uncertainty of the treatment effect, and heterogenei ty among the cutaneous and non -cutaneous subgroups, an adaptive enrichment design will be employed . The initial study design calls for enrolling two cohorts, with 120 adult patients in cohort 1 and 70 adult patients in cohort 2. The initially planned fina l analysis will be conducted when 60 events are observed from cohort 1 and 35 events are observed from cohort 2, whichever comes at a later time. A formal interim analysis based on unblinded data review by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) will be conducted and the trial might be expanded to enroll a total of 340 adult patients from the full population or enriched to enroll a total of 280 adult patients including 120 adult patients from cohort 1 from full population and 1 60 adult cutaneous di sease patients for cohort 2 from the cutaneous subgroup only. The operational and statistical details for implementing this ada ptive enrichment are included in the statistical analysis plan (SAP)."

Angiosarcoma Sarcomas are rare tumors that originate from mesenchymal tissues (e.g., bone, cartilage, fat and muscle ). In the United States, the incidence of bone and soft tissue sarcomas is approximately 13,000 new cases per year, leading to more than 5,000 deaths annually [1]. According to the WHO classification of 2002, over 70 different types of sarcoma have been described [2]. Localized tumors are curable but patients with metastatic disease have a median survival of approximately 12 months [3]. Standard systemic chemotherapy regimens are poorly tolerated and of limited usefulness with response rates in the range of 10 -40% [3]. Angiosarcomas are rare, aggressive, and heterogenous tumors of endothelial cell origin accounting for approximately 2% of soft tissue sarcoma ( STS) [4]. Anigiosarcoma can arise in any soft -tissue structure or viscera. About half of patients present with a primary cutaneous lesion (skin, scalp ). The pathogenesis of this presentation includes prior radiation exposure as well as inflammatory damage in chronically sun exposed skin. Non-cutaneous angiosarcoma (soft tissue , bone , viscera ) can occur in the setting of prior radiation exposure or other unknown causes. Angiosarcoma has also been associated with prolonged lymphedema from any cause. Although complete resection with curative intent followed by adjuvant radi otherapy is the treatment of choice for localized disease amenable to surgery, approximately 50% of these patients will develop metastasis and die from the disease. Furthermore, metastases are frequently present at the time of diagnosis [5]. The surgical removal of metastatic lesion is rarely feasible [6]. Treatment options are limited for advanced disease and of modest benefit. The median overall survival is <12 months for patients with metastatic disease [5, 7, 8]. There are no approved therapie s specifcially for angiosracoma. Aside from pazopanib, standard regimens for advanced angiosarcoma include taxanes, anthracyclines, and gemcitabine. Tumor control with these therapies have been short -lived with median PFS ranging from 3.9 to 6.6 months [5, 9]. Recen tly, the VEGFR TKI pazopanib was approved based on improved progression free survival (PFS) in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy and approved in Europe for adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced soft tissue sarcoma who have received prior chemotherap y for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy . Pazopanib improved PFS in chemotherapy refractory patients compared to placebo (PFS of 4.6 months with pazopanib versus 1.6 months with placebo) and was general ly well tolerated, with the most common AEs seen at higher levels than in patients treated with placebo being fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, weight decreased and hypertension. However, activity in angiosarcoma is limited; no complete responses and median PFS o f 3.02 months were observed in the largest series of angiosarcoma patients (n=30) treated with pazopanib r eported to date [10]. Studies of other VEGFR TKIs confirm a poor response rate and PFS of < 4 months [5] . The short time to progression following current treatment emphasizes that angiosarcoma is a disease in need of more effective and well tolerated treatment options. 2.2. Angiogenesis and Cancer Angiogenesis is required for the survival and growth of solid cancers [11, 12]. It is generally accepted that solid cancers have two phase s, an avascular phase and a vascula r phase [12]."
21,page_21,"Combining TRC105 with Pazopanib (TAPPAS) TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendment #4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 22 of 112 During the initial avascular phase, tumors exist as small aggregates of malignan t cells supported by simple diffusion of oxygen and nutrients. The progressive growth of solid cancers beyond clinically occult sizes requires the continuous formation of new blood vessels, a process known as tumor angiogenesis. Tumor growth and metastasis require angiogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and selective inhibition of the tumor vasculature represent potentially effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of solid cancers. Therapies that are directed against targets implicated in the development of tumor angiogenesis are attractive for many reasons. First, except for female reproduction and wound healing, angiogenesis in adults is generally part of a pathologic process such as tumor growth or choroidal neovasculariza tion. Second, treatments that interrupt tumor angiogenesis should apply broadly to all solid cancers. Third, angiogenic targets are present in the plasma or on endothelial cells themselves. These targets are readily accessible to antibody treatments, in co ntrast to targets expressed within tumors that are more difficult for antibodies to access. Fourth, angiogenic targets on vascular endothelial cells are less prone to genetic mutation than targets expressed by genetically unstable cancer cells. As a result , development of resistance may be more predictable for agents that target endothelial cell functions than for those targeting cancer cells. Indeed, agents that target pathways required for tumor angiogenesis have an important role in the therapy of cancer patients. The monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which binds to the angiogenic cytokine VEGF, significantly prolongs overall survival for patients with advanced colorectal cancer or non -small cell lung cancer when added to standard chemotherapy regimens [13, 14]. Bevacizumab is also effective therapy for renal cell cancer and malignant glioma [15- 17]. Orally available small molecule VEGF inhibitors include suni tinib, sorafenib , pazopanib, and axitinib , which have been shown to prolong survival in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer, hepatocellular cancer, colorectal cancer, and sarcoma [18-21]. 2.2.1. Endoglin (CD105) and Angiogenesis Endoglin (CD105) is a homodimeric cell membrane glycoprotein that was initially identified as a human leukemia -associated antigen [22] and later also found on endothelial cells [23, 24]. Endoglin is a transforming growth factor -β (TGF -β) coreceptor that is essential for angiogenesis [25, 26] and is strongly expressed on the proliferating vascular endothelium of solid tumors [24, 27]. Endoglin acts to modulate signaling of multiple kinase receptor complexes of the TGF -β superfamily, including TGF -β receptors, activin receptor -like kinases (ALKs) , bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptors, and activin recept ors [28]. TGF -β binds to endoglin complexed with TGF -β receptors causing phosphorylation of SMAD 2 and 3 proteins , which inhibit endothelial cell growth. However, BMP activa tes endoglin complexed with BMP receptor 2, causing phosphorylation of SMAD 1 and 5, which activate endothelium by overriding the growth inhibitory effects of TGF -β receptor signaling on endotheli um [29]. Not surprisingly, prevention of endoglin activation by endoglin antibody acts synergistically with TGF -β to inhibit endothelial cell g rowth [30]. Endoglin expression is required for endothelial cell proliferation and is upregulated in the setting of hypoxia through the induction of hypoxia -inducible factor -1-α (HIF -1-α) [31, 32]. Endoglin has also been shown to protect hypoxic cell s from apoptosis [33]. In adults, endogl in expression is limited to vascular endothelial cells , activated monocytes, activated fibroblasts, and proerythroblasts, a red blood cell precursor [34]. All of these properties make endoglin an"
22,page_22,"Combining TRC105 with Pazopanib (TAPPAS) TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendment #4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 23 of 112 attractive target for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer [35]. In animal models, endoglin targeted therapy has demonstrated antiangiogenic effects by inducing regression of established tumors as well as by preventing new tumor formation and inhibiting expansion of existing tumors [24, 36-39]. Therefore, endoglin offers a novel a lternative target relative to the VEGF inhibitors currently available for antiangiogenesis therapy. Importantly, endoglin expression is upregulated in tumor endothelial cells following inhibition of the VEGF pathway. Endoglin expression increased more t han 2-fold in human pancreatic cancers grown in mice treated with an antibody that binds VEGF [40]. As well, treatment of human bladder cancers gr own in mice with an antibody that blocks activation of the VEGF receptor increased endoglin expression within the core tumor vasculature [41]. Preclinical data suggest that targeting the endoglin pathway and the VEGF pathway concurrently is a more effective means of inhibiting angiogenesis than targeting either pathway individually [42, 43]. Endoglin is critical for normal human bl ood vessel development [44]. Endoglin haplotype insufficiency causes a well -described syndrome known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (H HT-1 or Osler -Weber -Rendu Syndrome). HHT -1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by localized telangiect asia involving the nasal, buccal, gastrointestinal mucosa and skin microvasculature. Telangiect asia also occur in vessels from in ternal organs including the lungs, liver and brain [45]. The genotype is manifested in utero , but the phenotype does not become apparent for many years following birth. Affected patients commonly present with epistaxis in the second decade of life. The phenotype of this disorder is characterized by vascular effects, indicating the specific role o f endoglin in vascular development [46]. 2.2.2. Endoglin and Angiosarcoma Endoglin is also expressed on the tumor tissue of certain tumor types in addition to the tumor vasculature. Endoglin is a marker of mesenchymal stem cells, the normal cell type from which sarcoma s originate [47, 48]. Endoglin -expressing sarcomas are relatively frequent and express endoglin at higher density than carcinoma cell lines. In one report, high surface expression of endoglin by whole cell flow cytometry was seen in 7 of 8 sarcoma cell lines compared to only 4 of 16 carcinoma cell lines [49]. Moreover, the level of endoglin expression correlated with proliferativ e capacity, and the addition of neutralizing endoglin antibodies reversed the increase in proliferation. Endoglin expression in human sarcoma tumor tissue has been reported by several groups. Gromova et al. found endoglin on 26 of 49 human gastrointestina l stromal tumors (GIST), and higher expression correlated with more aggressive tumors and high risk disease [50]. Moreover, endoglin knockdown reversed the increased tumor cell plasticity, invasiveness, and anchorage independent growth associated with endoglin expression [51]. Other endoglin -expressing sarcomas identified in the literature include angiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma) , Kaposi’s sarcoma, Wilms tumor, and chondrosarcoma [52-56]. Endoglin expression was evaluated by im munohistochemistry on archival tumor samples from almost 150 patients with various types of sarcoma [57]. Among the sarcoma tumor types evaluated, a ngiosarcoma expressed endoglin on tumor tissue most universally (1 9 of 20 samples) and densely. TRC105 is expected to be more active in tumor types, particularly angiosarcoma, that densely express endoglin on tumor tissue in addition to tumor vasculature."

TRC105 Background TRC105 is a novel immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) antibody that binds endoglin with high avidity. TRC105 is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against human endoglin [58], a growth proliferation receptor found on the surface of normal and proliferating endothelial cells [24, 32, 36]. The antibody is an IgG1 kappa immunoglobulin containing murine variable region sequences and human constant region sequences [58]. TRC105 has an approximate molecular weight of 148 kilodaltons ( kDa). TRC105 has a binding avidity for human endo glin of approximately 5 pM. TRC105 binds to the endoglin orphan domain and competitively inhibits BMP binding, thereby inhibiting SMAD 1/5/8 phosphorylation necessary for endot helial cell activation [29]. SN6j, t he mu rine parent antibody of TRC105, binds to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with nea rly identical avidity as TRC105. SN6j has been shown to bind the tumor vasculature of malignant tissues including breast, colon, rectum, kidney and lung cancers and to inhibit the growth of tumor xenografts [37]. Reactivity with carcinoma tissue is restricted to the tumor endothelium, as endoglin is not generally expressed on epithelial tumor cells [36]. TRC105 induces antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) on proliferating HUVECs at low conentrations and induces apoptosis and growth inhibition at higher concentrations . Studies at Duke University explored the in vitro effects of dual angiogenesis inhibition using bevacizumab and TRC105 in HUVEC s. Combinati on therapy was found to be more potent in decreasing HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tubular network formation than bevacizumab or TRC105 treatment alone [39]. Furthermore, TRC105 induced apoptosis in HUVEC, and promotes SMAD2/3 phosphorylation while inhibiting SMAD1/5/8 signaling, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis in response to VEGF and basic fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) [29]. Finally, antibody to mouse endoglin potentiate d the activity of multitargeted kinase inhibition that targets the VEGFR -2, in mouse bearing cancer xeno grafts [59]. For these reasons, endoglin blockade using TRC105 in combination with VEGF inhibition by pazopanib may provide greater clinical benefit than would be seen with either dr ug alone. 2.3.1. Studies with TRC105 Several studies with TRC105 are underway or have been completed. As of the date of this report, there have been 10 completed clinical trials of CD105, and four trials are ongoing. A total of 438 patients had been exposed to TRC105 monotherapy or combination therapy, of whom 99 received the combination of TRC105 and pazopanib. For a complete review of clinical information, please refer to the current TRC105 Investigational Brochure (IB). 2.3.1.1. Study 105ST101 Phase 1 Monotherapy 2.3.1.1.1. Study 105ST101 Phase 1 Monotherapy Pharmacokinetics In the initial, safety Study 105ST101, TRC105 pharmacokinetics were assessed on patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors ( including renal c ell, uterine, c olorectal, synovial sarcoma, prostate, and GIST) enrolled at doses up to 15 mg/kg weekly. Detailed TRC105 pharmacokinetics are available from Study 105ST101, the first in human dose escalation study ,"

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendment #4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 25 of 112 which explored a broad range of doses (0.01 to 15 mg/kg ) and schedules (every 2 weeks and weekly). Doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg dose levels produced measurable serum concentrations of TRC105 beyond the initial day of dosing. Volume of distribution at these doses was similar to plasma volume, which was consistent with preclinical toxicokinetics and would be expected for an antibody administered intravenously. Area under the curve ( AUC ) exposure increased supra -proportionally with dose whereas the maximum concentration ( Cmax ) appeared to be dose propo rtional. TRC105 clearance was consistent with target mediated disposition, and decreased clearance at higher doses was consistent with target saturation. Serum concentrations were achieved continuously in most but not all patients at a dose of 15 mg/kg eve ry 2 weeks and were achieved continuously in all patients at a dose of 10 mg/kg weekly. TRC105 accumulated at a dose of 15 mg/kg weekly. Importantly, as shown in Figure 1, weekly dosing with 10 mg/kg produced continuous mean TRC105 serum concentrations above the target concentration of 25 μg/mL shown to saturate endoglin receptors and produce maximum inhibitio n of HUVEC activation in vitro (i.e., maximal inhibition of SMAD1 phosphorylation in response to BMP). Figure 1: Single -Dose and Multiple -Dose Pharmacokinetic Data from Study 105ST101 2.3.1.1.2. Study 105ST101 Phase 1 Monoth erapy Safety A total of 50 patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors (including renal cell, uterine, colorectal, synovial sarcoma, prostate, and GIST) were treated on Study 105ST101 with escalating doses of TRC105 at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg e very 2 weeks and then 10 and 15 mg/kg weekly. Dose escalation proceeded stepwise until the top dose was reached. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was exceeded at 15 mg/kg weekly and the recommended phase 2 dose of TRC105 was therefore determined to be 10 mg/kg weekly or 15 mg/kg every 2"

Anemia was associated with accumulation of TRC105 and characterized by a low reticulocyte production index. Additional laboratory and clinical evaluations excluded common causes of anemia including blood loss, hemolysis, plasma volume expansion, inadequate erythropoietin, iron deficiency, and vitamin B -12 or folate deficiency. The anemia is believed to result from TRC105 -mediated suppression of proerythroblasts, the only cells i n the bone marrow known to express substantial levels of endoglin [34]. Anemia was reversible and manageable with dose reduction and standard supportive measures including erythropoietin and blood transfusion. Infusion -related reactions, anemia, fatigue, epistaxis and headache were the most frequently observed AEs consid ered related to TRC105. The majority of treatment -related AEs were grade 1 or 2. Infusion -related reactions were initially reported in the phase 1 study of TRC105 monotherapy (105ST101) in patients without premedication who received TRC105 produced in non-secreting murine myeloma (NS0) cells. Two of 21 patients treated up to 1.0 mg/kg with NS0 TRC105 d rug supply experienced infusion -related reactions to TRC105. Both patients were among 6 treated at the 1.0 mg/kg NS0 TRC105 dose level. One patient exper ienced Grade 2 fever and Grade 1 chills after the initial infusion of TRC105, which resolved with oral acetaminophen and did not recur with acetaminophen premedication on subsequent infusion. A patient experienced Grade 3 hypersensitivity (allergic reacti on) with the second infusion of TRC105. The hypersensitivity reaction consisted of symptomatic bronchospasm, urticaria, and hypotension that required parenteral medications and resulted in discontinuation of study treatment. TRC105 produced in Chinese hams ter ovary (CHO) cells was known to more potently engage ADCC in vitro than TRC105 produced in NS0 cells. Because of this, the initial dose level for patients receiving CHO -produced TRC105 was de -escalated to 0.3 mg/kg. Despite dose de -escalation, the first 2 patients at 0.3 mg/kg treated with CHO -produced TRC105 experienc ed Grade 2 and Grade 3 infusion -related reactions with the first dose of TRC105 in the absence of prem edication (the Grade 3 infusion -related reaction included diaphoresis, dyspnea, tachyca rdia and rigors). The Phase 1 105ST101 protocol was therefore amended to require a premedication regimen consisting of a glucocorticoid , acetaminophen, famotidine or a similar H2 -histamine blocker, and an H1 -histamine blocker such as diphenhydramine, and e xtend the initial infusion duration from 1 to 4 hours. Mandating such premedication and extending the duration of the initial TRC105 infusion duration successfully reduced the fre quency and severity of infusion -related reactions and allowed dose escalation to continue in the 105ST101 phase 1 study. One additional patient who received CHO -produced TRC105 at 1 mg/ kg developed a Grade 3 infusion -related reaction with the third dose given over 2 hours despite premedication. This patient had experienced a Grade 2 infusion -related reaction when the dose was initially administered over 4 hours with premedication. In all 3 patients with Grade 3 infusion -related reactions, TRC105 was not detectable in serum at the time of dosing, which therefore allowed de novo binding of TRC105 to CD105 expressing endothelium within the vasculature. Grade 3 infusion -related reactions were not observed in patients dosed at 10 or 15 mg/kg in the Phase 1 105ST101 study who maintained TRC105 serum levels known to saturate CD105 bindin g sites for the full dosing interval. Only 7 patients have experienced a Grade 3 and only 1 patient experienced a Grade 4 infusion -related"

For study 105SAR301 premedication will not include an H2 -histamine blocker, as neutral stomach pH is known to decrease pazopanib exposure by up to 40% and H2 -histamine blockade is not felt to significantly ameliorate typical signs and sympt oms of TRC105 infusion -related reactions. Three patients developed grade 1 cutaneous telangiectasia on the trunk early in the course of therapy, all at dose levels of 10 or 15 mg/kg weekly that resu lted in continuous serum levels of TRC105 known to saturate endoglin sites on human endothelium. Grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage was reported, including intermittent postcoital vaginal bleeding (that also occurred prior to TRC105 treatment), epistaxis, and superfic ial gingival bleeding. Grade 1 or 2 headaches were observed, mainly in patients treated at doses of TRC105 above 3 mg/kg. Headaches began the day following infusion and were generally manageable with acetaminophen. However, grade 2 headache in one pat ient at 15 mg/kg weekly prompted discontinuation prior to completion of the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. Fatigue was one of the more common AEs attributable to TRC105 and was more prevalent at doses above 3 mg/kg. One patient develope d DLT of grade 4 hemorrhage presenting as melena from a gastric ulcer within 5 days of the initial TRC105 infusion at 0.1 mg/kg. He discontinued TRC105 treatment, was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and the bleeding resolved with nonsurgical management by the time of upper endoscopy. Serious bleeding was not observed following protocol amendment to exclude patients with a history of peptic ulcer di sease (unless healing was documented) and patients on ulcerogenic medications including non -stero idal anti -inflammatory drugs. Classic toxicit ies associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria and thrombosis were not prominent. One patient with recurrent anal cancer treated with TRC105 0.1 mg/kg developed proteinuria considered a suspected adverse reaction to TRC105, but proteinuria was also noted prior to TRC105 dosing. Transient hypertension (156/112 mm Hg) without QT interval changes on electrocardiogram occurred in a single patient one day following infusion of 15 mg/kg, and was controlled by a single dose of oral antihypertensive medication. There were no arterial or venous thromboembolic events , nor gastrointestinal or other perforations in these patients. 2.3.1.1.3. Study 105ST101 Phase 1 Monotherapy Efficacy In study 105ST101 s table disease ≥ 2 months was observed in 2 1 of evaluable 45 patients (4 7%) and stable disease ≥ 4 months in 6 of 44 patients (14%) with advanced or metastatic solid tumors . Decreases in carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ), prostate -specific antigen ( PSA), or cancer antigen 125 ( CA-125) were noted in 7 of 21 patients (3 3%). One patient with castrate - refractory prostate cancer remains on TRC105 treatment after 8 years at a TRC105 dose of 0.01 mg/kg every 2 weeks. He ha s an ongoing complete PSA response, with resolution of bone pain and bone scan normalization. One patient with metastatic carcinosarcoma manifested decreased tumor burden on computerized tomographic scanning and maintained stable disease for 20 months on therapy. The latter is especially notable wh en one considers that this patient had received 3 prior treatments - carboplatin + paclitaxel for 4 months, anastrozole for 8 months,"

In effect, TRC105 provided the most favorable clinical outcome and did so as a fourth -line therapy. 2.3.1.2. Study 105SAR101 Phase 1b/2 a with Pazopanib 2.3.1.2.1. Study 105SAR101 Summary of Safety , Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity Study 105SAR101 was a Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating the combination of TRC105 and pazopanib in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma . In the Phase 1b dose escalation portion, the safety of TRC105 dosed weekly at 8 mg/kg and then 10 mg/kg given with pazopanib at 800 mg taken orally daily was evaluated. Because the single agent paz opanib dose is frequently de -escalated during the first month of dosing to ameliorate toxicity, the trial contained a 2- to 4-week run -in period of single agent pazopanib treatment, so that a tolerable dose would be determined in each patient prior to the introduction of TRC105. Using this schema, 3 patients were treated with TRC105 at 8 mg/kg weekly in and 15 patients were treated at 10 mg/kg w eekly in the Phase 1b portion of the trial. There were no DLTs and the addition of TRC105 to pazopanib did not increase pazopanib toxicities [20]. Given the non -overlapping toxicity profile, Investigators recommended concurrent dosing of TRC105 with pazopanib starting on day 1 for the Phase 2 portion of the Phase 1b/2 study. Safety data from the Phase 2 portion o f the trial that enrolled 63 soft tissue sarcoma patients indicate that toxicities remain non -overlapping and pazopanib dose adjustment can be made based on its product labeling , irrespective of concurrent dosing with TRC105. The toxicity profile of TRC105 was similar to that noted in single agent studies, recurrent infusion -related reactions were not observed, chronic steroid premedication was not required, and signs of the Osler -Weber -Rendu syndrome (e.g., low grade telangiectasia with associated epistaxi s and gingival bleeding) were observed routinely. The safety profile for TRC105 in combination with pazopanib has been consistent with that observed in other studies of TRC105 where AEs characteristic of each individual drug did not increase in frequency or severity , with the possible exception of pneumothorax, when the two drugs were administered together . AEs commonly (>10%) experienced by patients and believed by the sponsor to be reflective of the currently recognized toxicity profile of TRC105 includ e the following, which were predominantly grade 1 -2: epistaxis (grade 1 -3), headache (grade 1 -3), fatigue (grade 1 -3), gingival bleeding (grade 1), anemia (grade 1 -3), infusion -related reaction (grade 1 -3) and telangiectasia (grade 1). Patients also commonly (>10%) experienced the following AEs, judged by the investigator as being at least possibly related to TRC105: nausea (grade 1 -2), vomiting (grade 1 -3), flushing (grade 1 -2), decre ased appetite (grade 1 -3), stomatitis (grade 1 -2). One grade 4 suspected adverse drug reaction of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was reported, from which the patient recovered. One suspected adverse drug reaction of grade 2 transient ischemic attack was reported. One patient experienced grade 3 colitis , 1 patient experienced grade 3 embolism and 1 patient experienced grade 1 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage. Seven patients treated with the combination of TRC105 and pazopanib experienced a pneumo thorax, a known adverse reaction associated with the use of pazopanib in soft tissue sarcoma. The frequency of pneumothorax was similar to the frequency reported with single agent"

All 7 patients had lung metastases and grade 3 was the highest grade reported. At 10 mg/kg weekly, continuous serum concentrations of TRC105 were achieved in 12 of 15 patients at exposures above the target concentration of 25 µg/mL by the time of the t hird weekly dose (N=15; mean: 97 µg/mL )) and were achieved in 27 of 28 patients at exposures above the target concentration of 25 µg/mL by the time of the fifth weekly dose (N=28; mean: 127 µg/mL ). Notably, trough concentr ations were similar following dosing with TRC105 at 10 mg/kg as a single agent or with pazopanib . Immunogenicity was rarely observed : 3 patients had samples with a moderate to high signal defined as greater than 3 times above the assay cut point . Further, steady state pazopanib plasma concentrations when dosed with TRC105 were similar to those reported fo llowing single agent dosing . A TRC105 dose reduction schedule (starting with dose de -escalation to 8 mg/kg weekly ) has been established to manage drug re lated toxicity . The majority of patients requiring a dose reduction of TRC105 dose reduced to 8 mg/kg weekly. TRC105 dose reductions have resulted in observations of improved tolerability and have not compromised response, while maintaining TRC105 concentr ations necessary to avoid recurrent infusion -related reactions. All 3 patients remain in CR after reducing the TRC105 dose to 8 mg/kg weekly (3 patients) and then to 6 mg/kg weekly (1 patient). Although there is expected inter -patient and intra -patient va riability, dose reductions have generally result ed in decreased serum exposures . For a dose reduction from 10 to 8 mg/kg (a 20% reduction in dose), paired before and after data are available for 13 patients and show a percent reduction in pre -dose concent ration by an average of 14% (SD 83%) and median 52%. For dose reduction from 8 to 6 mg/kg (a 25% reduction in dose), paired data are available for only 2 patients and show a percent reduction in pre -dose concentration by an average of 8% (SD 52%) and medi an 8%. One patient required dose reduction to 4 mg/kg weekly and remained on study for 5 weeks at the reduced dose. In some cases a dose reduction did not decrease TRC105 exposure. The lack of an observed decrease in exposure in patients who had dose reduction may reflect decreased endoglin expression, consistent with a reduction in tumor burden as a result of treatment response. Because TRC105 is cleared by target mediated disposition, clearance is expected to decrease in patients with lower numbers of endoglin -expressing tumor vessels as a consequence of a reduction in tumor burden. This phenomenon may explain the variability and non -linearity of systemic exposure as a function of dose level. Infusion -related reactions have been rare with repeat dos ing in patients who have dose reduced. Two patients experienced 1 infusion -related reaction each, which was not observed on subsequent infusions: 1 patient on the day of dose reduction and the second patient on day 1 of cycle 18. 2.3.1.2.2. Study 105SAR101 Summary of Efficacy Preliminary clinical data from the phase 1b portion of study 105SAR101 demonstrate that the combination is well tolerated with signs of clinical activity. Six of 18 soft tissue sarcoma patients (33% of those evaluable for efficacy) exhibited >1 0% tumor reduction by RECIST 1.1, including 1 patient with cutaneous angiosarcoma that experienced a durable CR that is ongoing for 25 months as of October , 2016 . Duration of therapy ranged from 2 to 27+ cycles (in the phase 1b"

A total of 5 patients with angiosarcoma were initially treated in the phase 1b and 2a portions of study 105SAR101 and al l 5 patients had radiographic reductions in tumor volume. Two of these 5 patients had durable CR (including the patient noted above), 1 cutaneous angiosarcoma patient had a 25% reduction in tumor volume before exiting the study at week 10 due to an unrelat ed AE of duodenal ulcer. The other 2 patient s, both with visceral angiosarcoma, experienced tumor reductions of 7% and 14%. Notably the median PFS in these patients as of June 2016 was greater than 12.9 months as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Data available from the patients in the angiosarcoma expansion cohorts continue to demonstrate activity and tolerability of TRC105 in combination with pazopanib. 2.4. Study 105SAR301 Rationale The rationale for combining TRC105 with pazopanib for the treatment of angiosarcoma is three - fold. First, several nonclinical studies indicate endoglin is a dominant mechanism of escape from VEGF inhibitor therapy. Pazopanib is a VEGF inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced STS, including angiosarcoma, who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months following (neo) adjuvant therapy. Nonclinica l and preliminary clinical data suggest that targeting the endoglin pathway and VEGF pathway concurrently is a more effective means of inhibiting angiogenesis than targeting either pathway alone; accordingly, the combination of TRC105 and pazopanib may be a more effective means of treating sarcoma compared to single agent pazopanib. Second, endoglin is expressed densely on tumor cells in angiosarcoma, a malignancy of endothelial cells, providing an additional mechanism of direct targeting of cancer cells ( in addition to targeting proliferating tumor vasculature). Finally, because they target distinct pathways, the toxicity profile of TRC105 and pazopanib are non -overlapping and the drugs have been tolerable when given concurrently for more than 24 months. Clinical data from Phase 1b/2 study 105SAR101 validate the biological rationale , in that robust activity, including durable complete responses, was observed in angiosarcoma. The combination of the recommended TRC105 dose of 10 mg/kg weekly with standard dos e pazopanib was also shown to be well tolerated. Importantly, the tolerability of the combination allows for extended dosing durations in contrast to more toxic chemotherapy regimens. 2.5. Population to be Studied Patients wit h histologically -confirmed angiosa rcoma that is not amenable to curative intent surgery (e.g., metastatic or bulky disease and disease for which surgical resection would carry an unacceptable risk to the patien t) who have not received pazopanib or TRC105 previously will be enrolled in this trial. Due to the rarity of angiosarcoma, and lack of standard of care for patients 12 to 17 year of age, these patients, who are eligible only after enrollment in Cohort 1 is complete, will not be randomized and will receive only the combination TRC105 and pazopanib treatment ."

Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients Please refer to the current TRC105 Investigational Brochure (IB) for a complete review of potential risks and benefits of TRC105. 2.6.1. Potential Risks 2.6.1.1. TRC105 Common (≥ ~10%) TRC105 suspect ed AEs across all studies were headache, epistaxis, fatigue, anemia, nausea, infusion -related reaction, gingival bleeding, flushing, vomiting, hypertension, decreased appetite, telangiectasia, and diarrhea . Grade 1 and 2 muco cutaneous telangiectasia relate d to TRC105 occur early in the course of therapy and have been the source of gingival bleeding and epistaxis. Grade 1 and 2 periodontal disease reported under various terms including gingival pain, gingival disorder, gingival swelling and gingival infectio n was reported in approximately 8% of patients. Grade 3 anemia has occurred with TRC105 therapy at the recommended phase 2 dose . All patients treated with TRC105 should be monitored closely for anemia and treated appropriately, including the possibility of TRC105 dose interruption and/or reduction. The anemia related to TRC105 is hypopro liferative and non -hemolytic in nature , reversible with interruption of treatment, and may be managed with transfusion, erythropoietin or darbepo etin, and other intervent ions as appropriate. Anemia may also be related to blood loss from epistaxis or gingival bleeding that result from mucocutaneous telangiectasia. Infusion -related reactions have been observed following TRC105 administration and may include one or more of th e following signs or symptoms: rigors, chills, flushing, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria , fever, rash, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, change in blood pressure, and change in heart rate. Infusion -related reactions generally occur red with the initial infusion in patients dosed at recommended phase 2 doses of 10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and are typically of grade 1 or 2 severity following dosing with premedication that includes glucocorticoids. All patients treated with TRC105 should receive appropriat e premedication as defined in this protocol, be monitored during the TRC105 infusion, and be treated appropriately for infusion -related reactions (including possible TRC105 dose interruption). Hypersensitivity reactions with infusions are a potential risk for sensitized patients, and TRC105 should be avoided or used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the drug product. Pneumothorax has been observed in trial s of TRC105 administered with pazopanib in patients with lung metastases. Pneumothorax is an expected AE associated with the use of pazopanib , particularly in sarcoma patients with lung metastases . However, pneumothorax was observed in 1 patient, also with lung metastases, receiving single -agent TRC105. 2.6.1.2. Pazopanib The most common adverse reactions in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (≥ 20%) are fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, decreased weight, hypertension, decreased appetite, hair color changes, vomiting, tumor pain, dysgeusia, headache, musculoskeletal pain, my algia, gastrointestinal pain, and dyspnea. ."

Other Study Risks This study treatment may involve risks to unborn child ren. Therefore , patients should not become pregnant or father a baby while participating in this study. Patients should not breast - feed while on this study. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test before taking part in this study. Wom en must be of non -child bearing potential due to surgical sterilization (at least 6 weeks following surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy or tubal ligation) confirmed by medical history or menopause; or must agree to use two acceptable methods of birth control, one of which must be highly effective (see below), at the same time during study treatment (including during temporary breaks from treatment), and for at least 180 days after stopping TRC105 or pazopanib . Men with pregnant partners and m en with non -pregnant partners that are of childbearing potential must agree to use a condom with spermicide, during study treatment (including during temporary breaks from treatment), and for at least 180 days after stopping TRC105 or pazopanib . The long t erm risk of infertility is unknown. Ovarian failure has been observed with other antiangiogenic agents. Acceptable birth control methods considered highly effective are the following :  bilateral tubal ligation  intrauterine device (IUD)  vasectomy that has received medical confirmation of surgical success  Sexual abstinencea aIn the context of this protocol, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method of birth control only if refraining completely from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk (i .e., during study treatment, including during temporary breaks from treatment, and for at least 180 days after stopping TRC105 or pazopanib). If sexual abstinence is the highly effective method of birth control used, a s econd acceptable method is not required. Acceptable birth control methods not considered highly effective include the following :  male or female condom with spermicidea  cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide aA female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between the two can result in either product failing. 2.6.2. Potential Benefits TRC105 is an investigational product, and its efficacy has not been established. Although not approved specif ically for angiosarcoma, pazopanib is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (including angiosarcoma) who have received prior chemotherapy and approved in Europe for adult patients with selective subty pes of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (including angiosarcoma) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy. Together, the use of TRC105 with pazopanib may result in more eff ective angiogenesis inhibition and improved clinical efficacy over that seen with pazopanib alone."

Primary Endpoint  PFS is defined as time from randomizat ion to either first disease progression (per independent radiology review of images by RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause. For the purpose of analysis for patients who are alive at the time of analysis and have not had disease progression, the following rules will apply: (1) The patient will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease; (2) if the patient was given antitumor treatment other than study drug treatment, the patient will be censored as of th e date of the last tumor assessment prior to initiating that antitumor therapy; (3) if the patient was removed from study for toxicity or other reason, the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor assessment on study. With regard to missed tumor assessments, in the event of one missed tumor assessment followed by a subsequent assessment of progressive disease (PD), the subsequent PD assessment qualifies a s objective tumor progression. In the event of more than one consecutive missing tumor assessment followed by a subsequent assessment of PD, the patient will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment. 4.2. Secondary Endpoints  Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients with a best response of CR or PR divided by th e number of randomized patients. ORR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of randomization and the date of documented progression, as determined by Central Radiographic Review according to RECIST 1.1, or date of subsequent therapy, whichever occurs first. For patients without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the ORR determination. A designation of CR or PR in this study requires confirmation at a subsequent consecutive assessment at least 4 weeks following the initial designation of CR or PR , respectively . Duration of response (DR) will be reported in patients who achieve ORR, but without a formal statis tical comparison between arms.  Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. Overall survival will be calculated in days as: Date of Death – Date of Randomization +1. Subjects alive o r lost to follow -up at the time of analysis will be censored at the date when they were last known to be alive.  Type, incidence, severity (graded by NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03), timing, seriousness, and relatedness of AEs and laboratory abnormalities.  Patient reported outcomes as measured by the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire.  TRC105 and pazopanib concentrations will be measured using validated methods from peak and trough samples."

Overall Study Design and Plan This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel group, phase 3 study of TRC105 in combination with standard dose pazopanib compared to pazopanib alone in patients with angiosarcoma not amenable to curative intent surgery (e.g., metastatic or bulky disease and disease for which surgical resection would carry an unac ceptable risk to the patient ) who have not received pazopanib or TRC105 previously. Adult p atients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to TRC105 in combination with standard dose pazopanib (Arm B) vs standard dose pazopanib alone (Arm A). Patients will be stratified by angiosarcoma type (cutaneous vs non-cutaneous ) and the number of lines of prior systemic therapy for angiosarcoma (0 versus 1 or 2). For the purposes of this study, cutaneous angiosarcoma will include primary skin/scalp an giosarcoma ; all other angiosarcoma including primary subcutaneous angiosarcoma will be categorized as non -cutaneous ( e.g., visceral, bone, soft tissue). Due to possible differences in treatment effect on the cutaneous and non-cutaneous angiosarcoma subgrou ps, an adaptive enrichment design will be employed. An interim analysis is planned after 40 events or 30 days after the enrollment of 120 patients from Cohort 1 and will result in one of the following decisions: (1) no change to the study design and sample size, (2) no change to the study design but an increase in the sample size, or (3) termination of enrollment of an unresponsive non-cutaneous angiosarcoma subtype and adjustment of the sample size of the remaining cutaneous subtype . Cohort 1 is defined as the adult patients enrolled prior to the interim analysis . Enrollment at a given site will be limited to a maximum of 15% of total patients. Additionally, enrollment of Cohort 1 will be monitored to ensure that no more than 50% of the total adult patients enrolled will have the non -cutaneous subtype. Treatment in the assigned arm must start within 3 calendar days of randomization. Figure 2: Trial Design Schema 5.1.1. Overview All patient s must sign a consent form (and assent if under 18) prior to undertaking any protocol - specified procedures.

Tumor Imaging: All patients will undergo radiographic imaging. CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast t o be performed at screening , within 7 days prior to randomization and every 42 days from the date of randomization (+/- 7 days ). If subjects are unable to receive CT contrast due to CT contrast medium allergy or renal insufficiency, enhanced MRI scans may be used. A combination of non -contrast CT and MRI studies (such as chest CT without contrast and abdominal MRI with contrast) may be used. The same method of assessment must be used throughout the course of the study thereafter. Similarly, if a subject de velops a contraindication to CT contrast during the course of the study; assessments may shift to non -contrast CT of the chest and contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen for subsequent scans. In addition, a brain MRI or CT with contrast to be performed at s creening and on study as needed if metastases are suspected. A bone scan is to be performed at screening if bone metastases is suspected. If a bone scan documents bone disease at baseline, it needs to be repeated only when complete response is identified o r progression in bone is suspected. All other known areas of disease should be consistently followed throughout the study. Assessments should be performed whenever disease progression is suspec ted. A designation of CR or PR in this study requires confirma tion at a subsequent consecutive assessments separated by at least 4 weeks following the initial designation of CR or PR , respectively .

Description of TRC105 Study Drug TRC105 (carotuximab) is a genetically engineered human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against human endoglin found on the surface of proliferating endothelial cells and tumor cells of some tumor types . 7.1.1. Composition of TRC105 TRC105 is an IgG1, kappa immunoglobul in contai ning murine light - and heavy -chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. TRC105 has an approximate molecula r weight of 148 kDa. 7.1.2. TRC105 Dose Level Each patient will be dosed with 10 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 850 mg of TRC105 for women and 1,000 mg of TRC105 for men (i .e., 85 kg for women and 100 kg for men is the maximum weight that should be used for purposes of dose calculation on this study). TRC105 is distributed according to lean body mass rather than overall body weight. Patients who are overweight would be at risk for high serum levels of TRC105 if the doses were not capped. 85 kg for women and 100 kg for men represent accepted maximum lean body masses for the two genders. There is no body weight limit for enrollment purposes except for patients < 18 years of age (ages 12 -17), who must weigh ≥ 40 kg at the time of study enrollment . The dose of TRC105, administered in the combination treatment arm with pazopanib (Arm B) will be the same for patients of all a ges. The first weekly dose will be split into 2 doses whereby 3 mg/kg will be administered on cycle 1 day 1 and the balance will be administered on cycle 1 day 4. The entire weekly dose of TRC105 (10 mg/kg) is then given on cycle 1 day 8 and weekly therea fter (Table 5). 7.1.3. TRC105 Packaging and Labeling TRC105 will be supplied at 25 mg/mL in 20 mM L -Histidine/L -Histidine Monohydrochloride, 240 mM Trehalose, 0.01% Polysorbate 20 Formulation (25 mg TRC105/mL) in one or more of the following presentations. 200 mg TRC105/8 mL single -use vial 400 mg TRC105/16 mL single -use vial 7.1.4. TRC105 Storage and Shipping TRC105 must be stored between 2°C and 8°C ( 36°F to 46°F) and protected from light . 7.1.5. TRC105 Preparation TRC105 wi ll be prepared in the pharmacy and diluted into normal saline using appropriate aseptic technique. TRC105 will be administered using an in -line 0.2 micron filter. No incompatibilities between TRC105 and polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin bags have been"

Multiple vials will be required for a single dose. The following formulae should be used to calculate the volume of TRC105 to be added to normal saline:  Patient weight (kg) × dose level (mg/kg ) divided by TRC105 concentration (mg/mL) = volume of TR C105 ( mL) to be administered.  For a 70 kg patient, for example: (70 kg x 10 mg/kg)/ (25 mg/mL) = 28 mL of TRC105 product to be administered (i.e., 28 mL from the total of 32 mL from two 16 -mL vails) The volume of TRC105 that is to be administered can be rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 mL; in the case of an increment of 0.5 mL the volume should be rounded up. If the patient’s weight changes by > 10% during the study, the dose of TRC105 will be re calculated. At that time a new baseline weight will be established such that subsequent weight changes by > 10% from the new baseline weight would require further recalculation of the TRC105 dose. The calculated volume of TRC105 will be diluted with norm al saline. Appropriate judgment should be exercised in withdrawing an adequate amount of saline necessary to permit injection of the appropriate volume of TRC105 antibody into a normal saline bag in accordance with the dose needed. The final TRC105 conce ntration must be between 0. 6 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL. The prepared TRC105 must be gently inverted several times in order to ensure a homogeneous solution. The diluted infusion solution o f TRC105 must be used within 8 hours of preparation if stored at room tempe rature, or within 24 hours of dilution if stored at 2° to 8°C (36º to 46ºF). The expiration time should be labeled on the bag. If the diluted infusion solution of TRC105 has not been completely infused within 8 hours of preparation (i .e., the prepared inf usion has been at room temperature for more than 8 hours) , a second bag will be prepared that contains the balance of the planned dose that was not already delivered. The prepared solution should not be frozen. TRC105 should be diluted in ≤ 250 m L of normal saline in patients weighing less than 70 kg (this will prevent the administration of intravenous fluid in excess of 10% of blood volume during an infusion). 7.1.6. TRC105 Administration Patients should be encouraged to drink abundant fluid (e.g., two 8 ounce glasses of water or juice) prior to the first treatment. Intravenous hydration prior to and during therapy is left to the discretion of the Investigator, but should be considered for patients that may be volume depleted. In order to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of infusion -related reactions to TRC105, which are believed to be due to an ADCC mechanism of action with release of cytokines , the administration of the following TRC105 premedication regimen , including the methylprednisolone infusion , should be completed at least 30 minutes and no more than 2 hours prior to the start of TRC105 infu sion as indicated below (see Table 5):  Acetaminophen 650 mg p.o. x 1 or paracetamol 1000 mg p.o. x 1 (analgesic and antipyretic given as prophylaxis for fever and headache )  Methylprednisolone 100 mg i.v. will be given prior to the cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 1 day 4 infusions (glucocorticoid given as prophylaxis for signs and symptoms of infusion -related reactions, including bronchospasm, urticaria, fever, and rash) . Methylprednisolone may be discontinued starting with cycle 1 day 8 in the absence of infusion -related reaction with the prior dose ."

Cetirizine (or similar oral or intravenous H1-antihistimine) may be discontinued starting with Cycle 2, in the absence of infusion -related reactions with the prior dose.  Anti-emetic treatment, wh ile not required, may be given prior to the initial dose and subsequent doses to reduce the frequency of nausea and vomiting that may be observed during TRC105 infusions . As a precaution, resuscitation equipment should be immediately available at the locat ion where TRC105 is being infused. TRC105 will be administered intravenously utilizing an infusion pump. TRC105 has been demonstrated to be compatible with polyethylene lined, non -di(2-ethyl -hexyl)phthalate ( DEHP ) infusion sets and polyvinyl chloride, non -DEHP infusion sets. TRC105 is required to be administered with a 0.2 micro n downstream filter. The attachment of the infusion pump administration set to the i.v. bag and transport of the TRC105 study drug to the patient will be performed as per standard study site procedures. Following the appropriate premedication regimen, the first we ekly TRC105 dose will be split into 2 administrations whereby 3 mg/kg is administered on cycle 1 day 1 over 4 hours (+/ - 15 minutes) and the balance (e.g., 7 mg/kg) is administered on day 4 over 2 hours (+/ - 15 minutes) . Do not increase the infusion rate above 25 mg/min. Thereafter, the full dose of 10 mg/kg TRC105 dose will be administered i.v. weekly over 1 hour (+/ - 15 minute s). Patients must complete at least one 4 -hour infusion without the development of any infusion - related reactions in order to reduce the duration of the subsequent TRC105 infusion to 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) and , in turn, complete a 2 -hour infusion witho ut the development of any infusion -related reactions in order to reduce the duration of the subsequent TRC105 infusions to 1 hour (+/ - 15 minutes) . See Table 5 for ideal dosing schema s. Patients with infusion -related reactions of any kind should be managed appropriately (see Section 7.1.8 ) and are not permitted to reduce the duration of the next planned infusion . The rate of TRC105 infusion must not exceed 25 mg/min. When the i.v. bag containing TRC105 is empty, flush the i.v. line with sufficient saline to clear the tubing . The dose level, time of transfer to i.v. bag, and the infusion start and stop times must be recorded in the source documents."

Premedication, with the exception of acetaminophen, can be discontinued over time in the absence of subsequent infusion -related reaction. 7.1.7. TRC105 Dose Delay and Modification TRC105 dose reductions and delays should be avoided , if possible . TRC105 d ose must be held for grade 3 or 4 related AEs. When the event improves to grade 1 or to the patient’s pre -study baseline (including anemia) , TRC105 may be resumed at a reduced dose (with the exception of infusion -related reactions , which will not trigger dose reductions because infusion -related reactions could be exacerbated by dose reductions ). Treatment dose delays cannot exceed 8 consecutive weeks (i.e., both TRC105 and pazopanib dosing held for patients in Arm B or pazopanib alone if in Arm A). However, patients who cannot tolerate pazopanib or TRC105 therapy and who demonstrate a response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) with the combination and are thought to benefit from continued single agent therapy may continue on study on TRC105 or pazopani b alone per Section 6.2. TRC105 (and pazopanib ) should be held for at least 1week prior to scheduled surgery , the decision to resume treatment after surgery should be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. Port placement prior to treatment initiation do es not require a 7 day wait period ; treatment can be initiated as early as the following day. TRC105 DOSING DELAY : If a patient misses a weekly TRC105 dose and dosing is resumed ≥ 10 days after the last dose, premedication and TRC105 is administered as described in Table 6. Split dosing i s not required. However, it is recommended that if the patient experienced a severe headache with a previous infusion , the initial dose is split over 2 days and Table 5 is followed for premedication and TRC105 infusion. The Schedule of Assessment should be followed with regards to visits, labs, and any other required assessments even if TRC105 dosing is held (Table 4). In cases of dosing delay of more than 3 weeks, hematology results within 3 weeks of dosing resumption should be known and within the specifi ed protocol eligibility criteria prior to resuming treatment. In addition, in cases of dosing delay of more than 6 weeks, chemistry (including TSH) results within 6 weeks of dosing resumption should also be known and within the specified protocol eligibi lity criteria prior to resuming treatment."

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 8.1. Radiological and Photographic Tumor Assessment s The primary determination of efficacy will be based on objective tumor assessments made by the independent blinded Central Radiographic Review according to RECIST version 1. 1 [62] modified as noted in Section 8.1.1.1 . RECIST 1.1 PD MUST be centrally confirmed prior to withdrawing patients from the study on the basis of PD . All lesions will be classified as target or non-target lesions at the Screening v isit. Each lesion designation will be maintained through the course of the study. All patients should receive CT or MRI scans of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast. If subjects are unable to receive CT contrast due to CT contrast medium allergy or renal insufficien cy, enhanced MRI scans may be used. A combination of non -contrast CT and MRI studies (such as chest CT without contrast and abdominal MRI with contrast) may be used. For a given patient, t he same method of assessment must be used throughout the course of the study thereafter. Similarly, if a patient develops a contraindication to CT contrast during the course of the study , assessments may shift to non -contrast CT of the chest and contrast -enhanced MRI of the abdomen for subsequent scans. Such a situation does not imply mandatorily a non-evaluable (NE) overall response designation . Patients with cutaneous tumors will undergo 2D color photography of all visible cutaneous lesions . In addition, a brain MRI or CT with contrast is to be performed at screening and on study as needed if metastases are suspected. A bone scan is to be performed at screening if bone metastases are suspected. If a bone scan documents bone disease at baseline, it needs to be repeated only when complete response is identified or progression in bone is suspected. All other known areas of disease should be consistently followed throughout the study . The same method and technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at Screening, during the study treatment period, and at the End of Study visit. Imaging - based evaluation rather than clinical examination is the required technique when both could be used to assess the antitumor effect of the treatment. Radiology -based evaluation over photography -based evaluation is preferred when both could be used to assess the antitumor effect of the treatment. Tumor evaluation by positron emission tomography (PET) scan or by ultrasound may not substitute for CT or MRI scans. The CT portion of a PE T/CT could be acceptable as long as it is of diagnostic quality. (5mm slice thickness, and readable) . Tumor assessments will be performed at screening and every 6 weeks from randomization as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4), and whenever disease progression is suspected. Known areas of disease should be consistently followed throughout the study. Another tumor assessment will be performed at the End of Study Visit if an assessment has not been performed within the prior 6 weeks. All patient files and radiological images mus t be available for CRF source verification."

Measurability of Tumor Lesions Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least 1 measurable lesion. At baseline , individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the Investigator as measurable or non -measurable according to modified RECIST 1.1 as described below.  Measurable Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  10 mm by CT scan or MRI (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  10 mm cutaneous lesion measured by digital 2D color photography : lesion measurements are generated from the 2D photographs by the Independent Central Radiographic Review panel ; the measurements are reported b y longest diameter  Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed Lytic bone lesions , with an identifiable soft tissue component, evaluated by CT or MRI, can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component otherwise meets the definition of measurability previously described. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable . Lesions in previously irradiated areas (or areas treated with local therapy) should not be selected as target lesions, unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion .  Non-Measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly non - measurable lesions. Lesions considered to be truly non -measurable are bone lesions (lytic lesions or mixed osteolytic -osteoblastic lesions without identifiable soft tissue components, and osteoblastic lesions), leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, cutaneous or pulmonary lymphangitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdomina l masses not confirmed by imaging techniques, and cystic lesions . 8.1.1.1. Obtaining Cutaneous Lesion Measurements from 2D Photography The following modifications will be applied when using RECIST 1.1 criteria to evaluate visible cutaneous lesions via 2D color photography.  Up to 5 target cutaneous lesions  2D color photographs are reviewed by independent medical experts.  The reviewer determines whether each lesion can best be measured digitally or via a tape measure included in the lesion photograph.  For each lesion, the Central Radiographic Review panel is provided with all available photographs.  The Central Radiographic Review panel incorporates the measurements into their RECIST 1.1 ass essment."

Recording Tumor Measurements Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 10 total , including 5 cutaneous lesions and up to 5 non - cutaneous lesions representative of all involved organs (with a maximum of 2 lesions per organ , other than skin, where up to 5 target lesions may be used) should be identified as target le sions and measured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesion s with the longest diameters) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (by the selected imaging techniques). Target lesions may include lymph nodes with a short axis > 15 mm and cutaneous lesions > 10 mm in at least 1 dimension. The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion (with the exception of lymph nodes, wher e the short axis will be used) . The sum of the diameter s for all target lesions at baseline will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum diameter to be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimensio n of the disease during treatment. All measurements be recorded in metric notation in millimeters. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required a nd these lesions should be followed as “present ,” “stable ,” “absent ,” “increased ,” or “decreased .” 8.1.2. Definitions of Tumor Response 8.1.2.1. Target Lesions  Complete response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  Partial response (PR) : A least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of the target lesions , taking as a refer ence the baseline sum diameters .  Progre ssive disease (PD) : At least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum mus t also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm . The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.  Stable disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD , taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study . 8.1.2.2. Non-Target Lesions  Complete response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  Non-CR/non -PD: Persistence of ≥ 1 non -target le sion(s).  Progressive disease (PD) : Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions, or the appearance of ≥ 1 new lesion."

Determination of Overall Response 8.1.2.3.1. RECIST 1.1 When both target and non -target lesions are present, in dividual assessments will be recorded separately. The overall assessment of response will involve all parameters as depicted in Table 11. A designati on of CR or PR in this study requires confirmation at a subsequent consecutive assessments separated by at least 4 weeks following the initial designation of CR or PR, respectively . Per RECIST 1.1, a modest increase in the size of 1 or more non -target lesi ons is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient ’s best r esponse assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this dete rmination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy before confirming the complete response status. 8.1.3.

Materials for central review are the following: 1. All imaging studies performed on study, preferably in digital format on compact disc or optical disc. All digital media must be in DICOM format. Films may be forwarded for review if necessary; all films must be originals (second original films acceptable) rather than copies of films. 2. 2D photographs of sites of all target and non -target lesions . It is impor tant to the integrity of the study that all 2D photographs, including annotation of baseline 2D photographs with target lesion border demarcation, are forwarded to the review laboratory as each patient enrolls and progresses through the study. Details co ncerning clinically assessed lesions will be collected on the CRFs. Further information on materials to be forwarded for central review is provided in separate manuals provided by the vendors . 8.2. Primary Endpoint PFS is defined as time from randomization to either first disease progression (per independent radiology review of images by RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause. For the purpose of analysis for patients who are alive at the time of analysis and have not had disease progression, the following rule s will apply: (1) The patient will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease; (2) if the patient was given antitumor treatment other than study drug treatment, the patient will be censored as of the da te of the last tumor assessment prior to initiating that antitumor therapy; (3) if the patient was removed from study for toxicity or other reason, the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor assessment on study. With rega rd to missed tum or assessments, in the event of one missed tumor assessment followed by a subsequent assessment of progressive disease (PD), the subsequent PD assessment qualifies as objective tumor progression. In the event of more than one consecutive missing tumor as sessment followed by a subsequent assessment of PD, the patient will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment. Rarely, a patient not amenable to curative intent surgery enrolled onto study therapy may become amenable due to treatment effect. Patie nts who undergo surgery with curative intent will be censored at the time of surgery in the primary endpoint of PFS. These patients will continue to be evaluated with tumor assessments , as scheduled , until progression, death, or receipt of other anti-cance r therapy. A secondary analysis of the data will be conducted without censoring such patients . Pediatric patients will not be randomized and will not be analyzed in the determination of primary or secondary endpoints. Individual efficacy data will be reported for pediatric patients who enroll in the trial."

Secondary Endpoints 8.3.1. Objective Response Rate Objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the number of patients with a best response of CR or PR divided by the number of randomized patients. ORR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of randomization and the date of documented progression, as determined by Central Radiographic Review and Central Photographic Review according to RECIST 1.1 criteria, or date of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs first. For patients without documented progression or subsequent therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the ORR determination. A designation of CR or PR in this study requires confirmation at a subsequent consecutive assessments separated by at least 4 weeks following the initial designation of CR or PR , respectively . Patients who undergo curative intent surgery on study due to treatment response and are determined to have a pathologic CR, best overall resp onse for these patients will be CR. If patients do not have pathologic CR, best overall response is that determined prior to the surgery. Duration of response (DR) is defined as the time from first objective response (CR or PR) to the date of the first doc umented tumor progression, as determined by Central Radiographic Review and Central Photographic Review according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or date of death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For subjects who neither progress nor die, the duration of r esponse will be censored at the same time they were censored for the definition of PFS. This endpoint will only be evaluated in subjects with objective response of CR or PR and without a formal statistical comparison between treatment arms 8.3.2. Overall Survival Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. A patient who has not died will be censored from OS analysis as of the last known alive date. 8.3.3. Safety Safety will be analyzed through incidence of AEs, both serious and non-serious , ECGs, physical examinations and vital signs, ECOG performance status, and specific laboratory abnormalities in each treatment arm.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 9.1. Safety Parameters Adverse events (AEs) will be characterized in terms of the type, timing, frequency, severity (graded by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], Version 4.03), seriousness, and relatedness to study therapy (individually to TRC105 and to pazopanib) . In addition, physica l examination, vital signs, and ECOG performance status will be serially monitored. Laboratory safety analyses will be b ased on the local laboratory data, and will include hematology, serum chemistry (including liver and kidney function), urinalysis , and serum or urine pregnancy testing . Serum will also be assessed for immunogenicity to TRC105 (including anti-TRC105 antibody titers). In addition, 12-lead ECGs will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4). 9.1.1. Laboratory Safety Assessments Abnormal and clinically significant laboratory tests should be recorded as AEs. To meet the definition of clinically signifi cant, the test result generally requires a change in medical management (e.g. new medication, unplanned treatment, additional tests, etc.). 9.1.1.1. Hematology, Serum Chemistry, Coagulation, and Pregnancy Test Assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4) and analyzed at local laboratories. Investigator s may have additional blood tests performed for the purpose of planning treatment administration, or for following AEs as clinically indicated.  Hematology: Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential and platelet count . Iron studies (serum iron, transferrin and ferritin) are ob tained only a Screening, and then on study only if clinically indicated .  Coagulation: Interna tional Normalized Ratio (INR) will be assessed  Serum Chemistry: Total bilirubin, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, lipase, amylase, total protein, albumin, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chlo ride, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen or serum urea , creatinine, magnesium, TSH, and glucose  Pregnancy Test: Serum pregnancy tests will be performed locally on all female patient s of childbearing potential . 9.1.1.2. Urinalysis Urinalysis (without microscopic analysis, unless indicated) will be performed at time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4) and analyzed by local laboratories. Microscopic analysis , urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPCR) , and 24 -urine collection for protein should be performed as clinically indicated."

Physical Examination A physical examination including, but not limited to, general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, heart, chest, abdomen, musculoskeletal, e xtremities, skin, lymph nodes, neurological genitourinary (as appropriate), and rectal (as appropriate) will be assessed at time points indicated within the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4). The physical examination will include examination of known and suspected sites of disease. 9.1.1.4. Vital Signs Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate and weight will be assessed at time points indicated within the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3 and Table 4). Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate will also be assessed during TRC105 infusions as described in Section 5.1.2.2 and the footnotes of Table 3 and Table 4 (Schedule of Assessments ). 9.1.1.5. Performance Status The ECOG scale (Section 21.2) will b e used to assess performance status at Screening. 9.1.1.6. ECG Three consecutive 12 -lead ECGs at least 2 min apart will be performed . It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate standard intervals automatically. ECG will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 and Table 4) and as clinically indicated throughout the study. Prolonged QT intervals and torsades de pointes have been observed in association with pazopanib administration. Pazopanib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak concentrations of 2 to 4 hours after the dose . The timing of the ECG at day 15 should reflect the cardiac status at the anticipated maximal plasma concentrations of pazopanib based on the protocol -specified timing of pazopanib dosing on the days when ECG is performed . 9.1.1.7. Patient Reported Outcomes Patient reported outcome questionnaires will be performed at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 and Table 4). The EuroQol Group Patient Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) quality of life questionnaire comprises the following 5 dimension s: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. On the EQ -5D-5L, each dimension has 5 levels (e.g., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable). EQ -5D is one of a handful of measures r ecommended for use in cost -effectiveness analyses by the Washington Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health & Medicine. In the UK, NICE has issued revised guidance that argues for the use of measures like EQ -5D that have been weighted according to the socia l preferences of the UK population. The more specific ways in which EQ -5D is being used:  Monitoring the health status of patient groups at different moments in time, e.g. referral, admission, discharge, follow -up of outpatients."

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendm ent # 4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 76 of 112  Evaluation and audit of he alth care, by measuring changes in health status in individual patients and in groups of patients.  Assessing the seriousness of conditions at different moments in time.  Providing relevant information for resource allocation at a variety of levels.  Assisting in providing evidence about medical effectiveness in processes where drugs or procedures have to be approved. Establishing levels of population health status both locally and nationally. Examples include health surveys carried out in Canada, Finland, Spain (1994 Catalan health survey interview) UK (UK Department of Health Omnibus Sample Survey 1996, Health Survey for England) and the US (current Medical Expenditure Panel Survey by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) [63-66]. EORTC QLQ -C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. The QLQ -C30 is composed of both functional scales and symptom scales. All the scales range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, while a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems . 9.2. Adverse Events All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of suspected causal relationship to TRC105 and/or pazopanib study drug s will be reported as described below. The CRF page will collect onset time and signs and symptoms of infusion -related reaction s. Medications administered and all other actions taken to treat the event , the outcome, and any recurrence upon re -challenge will be captured . 9.2.1. Definition of Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial patient who is administered a drug or biologic (medicinal product); the event may or may not have a c ausal relationship with the medicinal product. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to the following:  Clinically significant symptoms and signs including:  Signs and symptoms resulting from drug overdose, abuse, misuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, dep endency, interaction or toxicity.  All possibly related and unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a preexisting illness.  Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident (hip fracture from a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the outcome of the accident (hip fracture from a fall ) should be reported as 2 separate AEs.  Symptoms or signs resulting from exposure in utero .  Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat confirmatory test)."

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendm ent # 4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 77 of 112  Laboratory abnormalities that meet any of the following (Note: Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the below conditions, doe s not constitu te an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE.):  Test result that is associated with accompanying symptoms  Test result that requires additional diagnost ic testing or medical/surgical intervention  Test result that leads to a change in TRC105 study drug dosing outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y  Test result that is considered to be an AE by the Investigator or TRACON 9.2.2. Serious Adverse Events An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as a serious AE (SAE) :  Results in death  Is life -threatening ( i.e., at immediate risk of death)  Requires in patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  Other important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical interve ntion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependence or drug abuse. Serious also includes any other event that the Investigator or sponsor judges to be serious, or which is defined as serious by a regulatory authority in the country in which the event occurred. Progression of the malignancy under study ( including signs and symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an AE unless the outcome is fatal during the trial or within the saf ety reporting period, in which case it should be reported as an SAE. Hospitalization due to signs and symptoms of dis ease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the patient expires during the trial or within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an SAE with NCI CTC grade 5. The onset date of an SAE is defined as the d ate on which the event initially met serious criteria (e.g., the date of admission to a hospital). The end date is the date on which the event no longer met serious criteria (e.g., the date the patient was discharged from a hospital)."

Hospitalization AEs associated with in -patient hospitalization , or prolongation of an existing hospitalization , are considered serious. Any initial admission, even if the duration is less than 24 hours is considered serious. In addition, any transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit is considered serious (e.g. , transfer from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor or transfer from a medical floor to a coronary care unit). However, t he following situations should not be considered serious:  Rehabilitation facility admission  Hospice facility admission  Respite care  Skilled nursing facility admission  Nursing home admission  Emergency room visit  Outpatient s ame day surgery /procedure  Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of precipitati ng clinical AEs as follows:  Admission for treatment of preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new or worsened AE  Social admission  Administrative admission (e.g. , for yearly physical exam)  Protocol -specified admission during a clin ical trial  Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)  Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures that are not related to an SAE  Hospitalization for observation without an AE  Diagnostic and the rapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs. The medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE (e.g., acute appendicitis that begins during t he AE reporting period should be reported as an AE and the appendectomy should be recorded as a Concomitant Procedure ). 9.3. Reporting Adverse Events 9.3.1. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the trial patient using concise medical terminology. In addition, each trial patient will be questioned about AEs at each clinic visit following initiation of treatment. The question asked will be, “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”"

Adverse Event Reporting Period The AE reporting period for this trial begins with informed consent and en ds following the completion of the 28 -day follow -up visit or at least 28 days after the last dose of pazopanib or TRC105 study drug is administered, whichever occurs later. Data for patients who screen fail will not be collected in the clinical database. However, if a screen fail patient experiences an AE that is considered related to study conduct or study procedures during the screening period, the event will be tracked on the Screening Log and the event will be assessed for reportability. All events t hat occur following randomization, even if the patient does not go on to receive study treatment, will be entered on CRFs. AEs occurring prior to the initiation of the study treatment will be considered “baseline -emergent adverse events” and will be recor ded on the corresponding CRFs. All AEs that occur in trial patients during the AE reporting period specified in the protocol must be reported to TRACON, whether or not the event is considered study treatment -related. In addition, any known untoward event that occurs beyond the AE reporting period that the Investigator assesses as a suspected adverse reaction to the investigational medications/products should also be reported as an AE. 9.3.3. Reporting Requirements Each AE is to be classified by the Investigator as SERIOUS or NONSERIOUS (Section 9.2.2 for serious adverse event definition) . This classification of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed. If a n SAE occurs, reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any AE that meets one of the criteria for an SAE immediately upon learning of the event. Any subseque nt revisions that are made to information pertaining to serious adverse events (e.g., change in seriousness criteria , relationship to study drug etc.) should also be communicated to TRACON immediately. This notification should be made to:"

The initial AE CRF is to be updated with more detailed SAE information within 5 calendar days of the event whenever possible . In the rare event that the Investigator is not immediately aware of a n SAE (for example , if the study subject seeks urgent medical attention elsewhere ), the Investigator is to notify the Sponsor immediately upon learning of it and document his/her first awarene ss. Each SAE should be followed until resolution, returns to the patient’s pre-treatment baseline status, or until such time as the Investigator determines that it has become stable. Information pertaining to follow -up of SAEs should also be sent to the T RACON Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Recording Adverse Events in the Case Report Forms The Investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the trial patient . In addi tion, each trial patient will be questioned about AEs. All AEs that meet the criteria specified in Section 9.2.1 are to be recorded on patient source documents and on the CRFs . AEs should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs . 9.3.5. Grading of Adverse Event Severity To report AEs on the CRFs, the Investigator will use the severity grading as described in NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03). Every effort should be made by the Investigator to assess the AE according to CTCAE criteria. However, the diagnosis term should not be altered to accommodate the CTCAE dictionary. If the Investigator is unable to assess severity because the term is not de scribed in NCI CTCAE (Version 4.03), severity of MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING, or FATAL may be used to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: Table 12: Adverse Event Grading Grade Non-CTCAE Severity Definition 1 Mild Does not interfere with patient ’s usual function 2 Moderate Interferes to some extent with patient ’s usual function 3 Severe Interferes significantly with patient ’s usual function 4 Life-Threatening That event r esults in immediate risk of patient ’s death 5 Fatal That event r esults in patient ’s death Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with patient ’s usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 1 of the criteria for serious events. 9.3.6. Relationship of Adverse Event to TRC105 and Pazopanib Study Drugs In this study, TRC105 study drug may be given in combination with pazopanib . The relationship of an AE to TRC105 study drug and pazopanib should be classified by the Investigator independently using the following guidelines:  Suspected Adverse Reaction to TRC105 : There is a reasonable possibility that TRC105 caused the AE (i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between TRC105 and the AE). See Section 2.6.1.1 for common TRC105 adverse reactions ; however , the most current version the TRC105 IB should be referenced.  Suspected Adverse Reaction to pazopanib: There is a reasonable possibility that pazopanib cau sed the AE (i.e., there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between pazopanib and the AE). Section 2.6.1.2 for a list of common pazopanib adverse reactions ; however , the most current version the pazopanib product labeling should be referenced."

Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendm ent # 4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 82 of 112  Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with TRC105 study drug or pazopanib . Causality assessment should be reported for every AE. An AE could be reported as related to one study drug, both study drugs or not related to any study drug. Please refer to Section 2.6.1.1 and Section 2.6.1.2 for the most common TRC105 and pazopanib adverse reactions; for complete reference, please use the most current version the TRC105 IB and the most current version the pazopanib product labeli ng. Note: an AE could be considered as related or possibly related to study drug(s) even if not referenced in the IB or the product labeling if in the opinion of the investigator there is a reasonable possibility that the drug(s) may have caused the AE. 9.3.7. Expectedness Assessment All TRC105 AEs and suspected adverse drug reactions are considered “unexpected” if not listed in the applicable section of the current TRC105 I nvestigator Brochure (IB) or not listed at the specificity or severity that has been obse rved and listed in the IB. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculi tis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents. ""Unexpected,"" as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a clas s of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. For the expectedness assessment of AEs related to pazopanib, the most recent product labeling will be referenced. 9.3.8. Exposure in Utero A pregnant patient will be withdrawn from the study. If any trial patient (or partner of a trial patient) becomes or is found to be pregnant during the study or within 180 days of discontinuing the in vestigational medication/product, the Investigator must report the information to TRACON, or designee via the Pregnancy Notification Report Form . This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnanc y. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery. The Investigator will follow the patient (or partner of a trial patient) until completion of the pregnancy or until pregnancy termination (i .e., induced abortion) and then not ify TRACON, or its designee, of the outcome within 5 days or as specified below. The Investigator will provide this information as a follow -up to the initial report. The reason(s) for an induced abortion must be specified. For pregnancies of partners of male participating in the study: all partners who become pregnant and provide appropriate consent to TRACON will be monitored to the completion or termination of the pregnancy as described above.

The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection unless pre -abortion laboratory findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classif ied as SAE s follows:  “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion.  All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAE s. In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the Investigator assesses as possibly related to the in utero exposure to the investigational medication should also be reported. 9.3.9. Follow -up of Unresolved Adverse Events All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or return to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline, or the Investigator assesses them as stable ; every effort should be made to make this determination by the 28 -day follow -up visit . Any increase or decrease in AE grade should be recorded as a new AE. All serious and those non -serious events ass essed by the Investigator as suspected adverse reaction to the investigational medication/product must continue to be followed even after the patient ’s participation in the trial is over , until the event is either resolved, improved to the patient’s pre -treatment baseline or better , stable without anticipated future change or the patient is lost to follow -up, or in the case of a suspected adverse reaction, later determined to be not related to the investigational medicinal product. 9.4. Safety Monitoring The TRACON Clinical Team will monitor safety throughout the study via the following activities:  Surveillance and reporting of SAEs according to regulatory guidelines as outlined in the safety plan  Routine monitoring of non -serious AEs as they are recorded in the CRFs and the source documents at study sites  Periodic teleconferences with the Principal Investigators to share experiences and ensure communication  New t oxicity information that may affect the treatment of patients on this study will be promptly communicated in writing to all participating clinical sites and institutions participating in this clinical trial  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC) will review the data from the trial. The IDMC will periodically review the progress of the st udy and accumulating safety and efficacy data. Following each review, the IDMC will recommend to the Sponsor (TRACON Pharma) whether to continue the trial unchanged, modify the conduct of the study, or terminate the study early. The DMC will be comprised of 3 voting members"

Sample Size A hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55 is considered to be clinically relevant. Based on 1:1 randomization and the use of log -rank test at the 2-sided alpha of 0.05 level of significance, 95 events provides 83% power to detect a HR of 0.55. The expected PFS of angiosarcoma patients treated with pazopanib who have progressed following first line treatment is 4 months. A HR of 0.55 corresponds to an improvement of median PFS from 4 months to 7.27 months. Due to the uncertainty of the treatment effect, an d heterogeneity among the cutaneous and non -cutaneous subgroups, an adaptive enrichment design will be employe d. The adaptive design calls for enrolling two cohorts, with 120 adult patients i n Cohort 1, and 70 adult patients in Cohort 2. The initially planned final analysis will be conducted when 60 events are observed from Cohort 1 and 35 events are observed from cohort 2, whichever comes at a later time. A projection of events in Cohort 1 will be done prior to the interim analysis, and the sample size of Cohort 1 may be increased by no more than 20% to compensate for a lack of expected events. Similarly, a projection of events in Cohort 2 will be done at 55 events in Cohort 1 and the sampl e size and number of events in Cohort 2 only may be increased by no more than 20% to compensate for a lack of or expected time frame of events. A formal interim analysis will be performed after observing 40 events or 30 days after enrolling 120 patients in cohort 1. Based on the results obtained at this interim analysis, the trial will be classified into one of four zones: favorable, promising, enrichment, and unfavorable. The future course of the trial may be modified in one of the following ways ( Figure 3): 1. Favorable Zone: If the conditional power of demonstrating treatment effect with full population is high, i.e., CP F > 95%, the trial is considere d to fall into the favorable zone. In this case, it will continue with the initially planned enrolment of 120 adult patients for Cohort 1 and 70 adult patients for Cohort 2 from both cutaneous and non -cutaneous patients. The final analysis will be performe d on the full population when 60 events are observed for Cohort 1 and 35 events for Cohort 2, whichever comes later. 2. Promising Zone: If the conditional power of demonstrating treatment effect with full population is between 30% and 95% inclusive, the tri al is considered to fall into the promising zone. If the trial falls into promising zone, enrollment into Cohort 2 will be increased from 70 adult patients to 220 adult patients from the full population and the events in Cohort 2 will be increased from 35 to 110. The final analysis will be performed on the full population when 60 events are observed from the 120 adult patients in Cohort 1 and 110 events are observed from the 220 adult patients in Cohort 2, whichever comes later. 3. Enrichment Zone : If the conditional power for the full population is < 30% and the conditional power for the cutaneous subgroup is > 50%, the enrollment for Cohort 2 will be restricted to the cutaneous subgroup only and 1 60 adult patients will be en rolled. The final analysis will be performed on the cutaneous subgroup only, when 60 events are observed from the 120 adult patients in Cohort 1 and when 110 events are observed in cutaneous subgroup from both cohorts combined."

Unfavorable Zone: If the conditional power for the full population is < 30% and the conditional power for cutaneous subgroup is ≤ 50%, the trial is considered to fall into the unfavorable zone. In this case, the trial will remain unchanged, enrolling 120 adult patients for Cohort 1 and 70 adult patients for Cohort 2 from the full population. The final analysis will be performed on full population when 60 events are observed from the 120 adult patients in Cohort 1 and 35 events are observed from the 70 adult patients whichever come s later. The IDMC might recommend termination of the trial for futility by exercising its judgment based on the totality of the data at interim time if TRC105 seems doing worse than the control group. In order to preserve the statistical integrity of the a daptive design it is pre-specified that 120 subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 1, and followed until 60 events are obtained . This specification was based on initial assumptions about patient enrollment rates and HR s. The actual rates could vary from these initial assumptions. In addition it has not been factored in the impact of possible patient drop -outs. If there are too many drop -outs from Cohort 1, it may either become impossible to obtain the required 60 eve nts or the duration of patient follow -up may become excessively prolonged. To mitigate these risks, the sample size of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 may increase by a maximum of 20% as detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) in a manner that does not incr ease the Type 1 error rate."

Definition of Analyzed Study Populations The following study populations will be considered when reporting study results:  The study population for safety includes all patients receiving at least a portion of 1 dose of either TRC105 or pazopanib . If a patient actually received study drug not according to their randomiz ed treatment arm, they will be analyzed for safety in the treatment arm according to the study drug they actually received."
89,page_89,"Combining TRC105 with Pazopanib (TAPPAS ) TRACON Pha rmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Study Protocol: 105SAR301 Amendm ent # 4: 23Jul 2018 Confidential Page 90 of 112  The study population for efficacy will include all randomized adult patients (intent - to-treat, ITT ). 11.2. Data Analysis Descriptive statistics (such as means, medians, standard deviations and ranges for continuous data and percentages for categorical data) will be used to summarize patient characteristics, treatment administration/compliance, immunogenicity ( anti-TRC105 antibodies ), efficacy , PK parameters , protein biomarkers, and archival tumor tissue . Data will also be displayed graphically, where appropriate. Additional details of data analyses for the study may be found in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 11.2.1. Analysis of Primary Objective PFS is defined as time from randomization to either first disease progression (per independent radiology review of images by RECIST 1.1) or death from any cause. For the purpose of analysis for patients who are alive at the time of a nalysis and have not had disease progression, the following rules will apply: (1) The patient will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment documenting absence of progressive disease; (2) if the patient was given antitumor treatment other than study drug treatment, the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor assessment prior to initiating that antitumor therapy; (3) if the patient was removed from study for toxicity or other reason, the patient will be censored as of the date of the last tumor assessment on study. With regard to missed tumor assessments, in the event of one missed tumor assessment followed by a subsequent assessment of progressive disease (PD), the subsequent PD assessment qualifies a s objective tumor progressi on. In the event of more than one consecutive missing tumor assessment followed by a subsequent ass essment of PD, the patient will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment. The primary efficacy analysis will test the null hypothesis that the HR of the experimental arm relative to the control arm is 1 against the alternative hypothesis that the HR is less than 1, at the 2-sided 0.05 level of significance. The hypothesis test will be based on the method of Jenkins, Stone and Jennison [67], thereby ensuring strong control of Type 1 error for this adaptive design. Additional su pportive analyses will include Kaplan -Meier plots for each treatment arm and the p-value and confidence interval for the HR, unadjusted for the adaptive nature of the design . A pre -planned assessment of the primary endpoint will additionally be done to d etermine the primary endpoint of PFS without censoring patients with tumor response who undergo curative intent surgical resection. A Cox regression model will be used to explore the potential influences of the stratification factors on the primary PFS en dpoint. In addition, the potential influences of baseline patient characteristics will be evaluated. An exploratory, sensitivity analysis will be conducted that will apply the modified RECIST 1.1 separately to cutaneous lesions and to non -cutaneous lesion s for each patient with both cutaneous and non -cutaneous sites of disease. The secondary endpoints will be tested in a hierarchical order only if the test for primary endpoint is significant at 2 -sided significance level 0.05. More specifically, if the t est for PFS is significant at the final analysis time, the objective response rate ( ORR ) will be tested next at the same 2 -sided 0.05 level followed by the test for overall survival (OS) at the same level ."

Analysis of Pharmacokinetics Serum TRC105 and pla sma pazopanib concentrations will be measured using validated methods and assessed for potential correlations with response, PFS, survival, AEs, and baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics and models as appropriate. To the extent possible potential PK drug interaction between pazopanib and TRC105 and the relationship between pazopanib exposure and efficacy/safety endpoints in the pazopanib alone arm will be explored, and examine the assumption that the exposure -response relationship for pazop anib is flat and that there is no drug interaction between pazopanib and TRC105 in the combination arm. Intensive pharmacokinetic data collection with additional analyses will be done for patients 12 -17 years of age to provide data in support of extrapolation of the treatment effects of TRC105 and pazopanib from adults to this pediatric population. 11.2.3. Analysis of Protein Biomarkers Angiogenic protein biomarker data for each patient who received at least 1 dose of TRC105 or pazopanib will be listed . 11.2.4. Analysis of Circulating Tumor Cells Endoglin expressing circulating tumor cell data for each patient who received at least 1 dose of TRC105 or pazopanib will be listed . 11.2.5. Analysis of Immunogenicity Anti-TRC105 antibody responses will be measured using a val idated bridging electrochemiluminescent (ECL) assay format (on the MesoScale Discoveries platform) at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 4). This method employs an initial acid dissociation step to increase drug tolerance of TRC105 to > 400 μg/mL. A three -tiered approach will be utilized for sample analysis: screening, confirmatory, and titration assays. Samples that are above the cutpoint in the initial screening assay will be considered potentially positive. The potentially positive samples will then be tested in a confirmatory assay, where they will be assessed in the presence or absence of TRC105 to establish whether a sample is a true positive or false positive. Samples determined to be true positives in the confirmatory assay will be taken to the third tier assay where they will be titrated until the signal falls below the assay cutpoint in order to determine a titer for the sample, which reflects the magnitude of response. Anti-TRC105 antibody responses will be evaluated in the context of PK parameters and AE profiles. To the extent possible as provided by the available data, the effect of anti -TRC105 antibodies on the PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety of TRC105 will be evaluated."

Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) Before this study starts, the trial protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and any other information provided to study patients will be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), Euro pean Medicines Agency ( EMA ) or other national health authorities and to each IEC/IRB for review, as applicable. As required, the study will not start at a given investigational center before the IEC/IRB and health authority (where applicable) for the cente r gives written approval or a favorable opinion. All correspondence and other evidence of appropriate and timely communications with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator/site files. Copies of all IRB/IEC approvals should also be forwarded to TRACON. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and TRACON in writing within 5 business days after the implementation. 14.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The trial will be performed in accordance with the protocol, applicable local regulatory requirements and laws, and the International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) Guideline on Good Clinical Practice , which supports the application of ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki (see ICH E6, § 2.1 ). 14.3. Written Informed Consent The informed consent form language must be agreed upon by TRACON an d the IRB/IEC and must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. The informed consent information must not be changed without prior approval by TRACON and the IRB/IEC.

DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPING 15.1. Inspection of Records CRFs are required and should be completed for each patient who receives any treatment with either TRC105 or pazopanib . Screen failure CRFs will not be collected. Nevertheless, records of potential patients identified and screened shall be retained on site screening logs . The completed original CRFs are the sole property of TRACON and should not be made available in any form to third parties without written permission from TRACON (except for authorized representatives of a Regulato ry Authority and in accordance with Health Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ) regulations). It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion and to review and approve all CRF data. The Investigator will sign off on his/her data per pat ient. These signatures serve to attest that the Investigator has reviewed and approved the information contained on the CRFs and that the information is complete, accurate, and true. At all times, the Investigator has final personal responsibility for th e accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the CRFs. The use of electronic CRFs (eCRFs) to capture study data using automated computerized data capture systems does not change the principles and requirements for collectin g study data. The Investigator still retains final personal responsibility for eCRF data and any associated data pertaining to it (e.g. , metadata including any record of change to the originally recorded data). The Investigator’s signed approval of the e CRF data serves to attest that the electronic data and all of its associated metadata (including changes) has been reviewed and accepted as complete, accurate, and true for each patient in the study. All CRF/eCRF data must be verifiable in the patient’s so urce records by TRACON or its designee . TRACON will review CRF data as compared to source records in an attempt to identify missing and spurious data and notify the Investigator of findings so that proper corrections can be made. TRACON representatives ( monitors and auditors) and regulatory inspectors shall have direct access to the original source records in its original recorded format: electronic or hardcopy. TRACON (or its designee) will perform all data management functions associated with the study. Data will be captured electronically in this study . Automated data verification (“ edit checks ”) will be used to ensure that the data are logical and consistent. Any inconsistencies will be queried for clarification or correction as appropriate by the clinical site. 15.2. Retention of Records To allow for appropriate evaluations and/or audits by regulatory authorities or TRACON, the Investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link reco rds, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all CRFs, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. Essential documents will be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a mar keting application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These docum ents should be retained for a"
