Primary Objectives To evaluate the effect of different doses of TIP on the change in P. aeruginosa bacterial load in sputum as assessed by the change in colony forming units (CFUs) from baseline to Day 29 of treatm ent, each compared to placebo. To assess the safety and tolerability with different doses of TIP and different regimens during the treatment epoch and during the follow -up epoch for each ,as compared to placebo. Secondary Objectives To assess the ef fect of different doses of TIP and different regimens on the frequency of pulm onary exacerbations To assess the efficacy profile of different doses of TIP and different regimens, as measured by the useof anti -pseudomonal antibiotics To assess th e tim e to first hospitalization To assess the pharmacokineti cconcentrations of tobramy cin in serum and in sputum from different doses of TIP and different regimens. To assess the antimicrobial efficacy of TIP over the entire study duration, as measured by the abs olute change in P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFU) in sputum from baseline to each post -baseline treatment visit and during the follow -up visits. To evaluate the safety profile of TIP in terms of clinical laborator y results. To evaluate the impact of treatment with TIP on the Quality of Life Questionnaire for Bronchiectasis (QOL -B) by measuring change from baseline to all post -baseline visits. Study design This is a blinded, randomized, dose and regimen finding trial utilizi ng a 3 treatment cohort design where active TIP doses or placebo in addition to the local standard care within each cohort are delivered once or twice daily. Approximately 180 eligible patients will be randomized to one out of the 3 cohorts .The patients w ithin each cohort will be randomized to blinded TIP (TIP continuous regimen orTIP/placebo cyclical regimen cohorts )or placebo. Total duration of the study is expected to be up to 196 days. Population The study population will consist of approximately 180 male and female BE patients ≥18 y ears old with clinical diagnosis of non -CF bronchiectasis"

The comparisons of different TIP daily doses (combining TIP continu ous or TIP/placebo cyclicalregimens withi n a cohort) versus placebo will be evaluated by testing the following null hypothesis (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha): H0: TIP treatment group is equal to placebo group in bacterial load in sputum at Day 29 Ha: TIP treatment group is not equal to placebo group in bacterial load in sputum at Day 29 The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will contain treatment, cohort, baseline CFU, and baseline macrolide use. Pairwise comparisons of TIP dosing groups will be conducted versus placebo. To control the family -wise type-I error rate (three dose levels vs. placebo) at the two -sided 5% significance level, the step -wise Dunnett procedure will be used. The estimated adjusted treatment diffe rence (TIP –placebo) will be displayed along with the associated standard error, 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI), and p- value (2 -sided).

12,page_12,"Novartis Confidential Page 13 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Amendment 3 Amendment rationale The purpose of this pro tocol amendment is to revise: Exclusion criterion 33b: T o clarify the assessment of total abstinence as highly effective contraception method . Total abstinence has to be in line with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. For consistency with the “Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing” of the Clinical Trials Facilitation Group the wording has been reverted to the initial protocol wording. In addition, this amendment includes the definition of personal data and modified withdrawal of study consent definition in accordance with the European Economic Area General Data Protection Regulation requirements. This amendment also includes the follo wing changes in planned statistical anal ysis: removing the cohort from the models due to confounding with treatment, including the multiple imput ation tec hnique as a sensitivity analysis and, dropping some explo ratory analyses due to small sample size as outlined below. Changes to the protocol Glossary of terms Definition of personal data added and definition of withdrawal of consent modified. 4.2 Exclusion criteria Exclusion criterion 33b revised, as described above. 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed con sent. Section revised, as described above. Section 9: Cohort is removed in the models for statistical analy sis of primary and secondary variables due to confounding with treatment. Section 9.1. Information has been added to clarify that patients who are mistakenly randomized or who have not taken double blind study drug will be excluded from the full analysis set (FAS). Section 9.4.3 refers toasensitivity analy sistoaccount forpatients who require treatment with anti-pseudomonal drugs forexacerbation: it was previously planned toexclude patient data from thestart dayofsystemic anti-pseudomonal treatment fortherelevant efficacy endpoints. This analy siswill not be performed. Alternatively ,fortheprimary endpoint only,multiple imputation will be implemented, as multiple impu tation technique is more robust."
13,page_13,"Novartis Confidential Page 14 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Section 9.5.1.2 states that theproportion ofpatients with atleast one pulmonary exacerbation, andtheproportion ofpatients who permanently discontinue study drug dueto pulmonary exacerbation will be analyzed using both logistic regression and time to event analysis. However, due to small sample size, these two endpoints will be evalua ted using time to event analysis only. The annual rate ofpulmonary exacerbations will besummarized only overall and not by exacerbations category due to small sample size. Section 9.5.1.3 refers to the use of anti-pseudomonal antibiotics . As anti-pseudomonal antibiotics used for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations are often used in combinati on, dose cannot bedefine d consistently . Therefore,t he total amount (in doses) of anti- pseudomonal antibiotics used to treat pulmonary exacerbation during the treatment epoch and the s tudy period will not be analy zed. Summary of previous amendments Amendment 2 Amendment rationale The purpose of this protocol amendment is to revise thefollowing enrolment criteria: Exclusion criterion 9a: The criterion was revised to reduce the number of disease -free survival yearsfrom 5 to 2in patients with a history of cancer. Based on the tobramy cin safet y profile, there is no increased risk of cancer expected due to study medication. Exclusion criterion 10a: The exclusion criterion was revised to clarify that patients with clinically significant (in the opinion of the investigator) hearing loss that interferes with patients’ daily activities (such as normal conversations) or chronic tinnitus should not be enrolled. The use of a hearing device is reflective of a clinicall y significant heari ng loss; hence patients using hearing aids at screening are not eligible. Ototoxicity , manifested as both auditory toxicity (hearing loss) and vestibular toxicity , has been reported with parenteral aminogly cosides. Hearing loss and tinnitus were reported by patients in clinical trials with tobramy cin inhalation powder. Patients with a past history of clinically significant hearing loss in the opinion of the investigator may be eligible only if their hearing threshold at screening audiometry is 25dB or lower at frequencies 0.5- 4 kHz. Exclusion criterion 18a: The renal exclusion criterion was updated with focus on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR , as per MDRD ) and proteinuria , which are specific indicators tocharacterize the patient’s renal function. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) have been removed as they are subject to significant diurnal variation based on the patients’ hydration status and dependent on the meal composition taken . The mention of creatinine clearance is redundant as eGFR is measured."
14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Exclusion criterion 21a: Patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) were previously excluded from study participation because these patients frequently have hearing impairment secondary to chronic sinusitis and repeated otitis media episodes . The exclusion criterion was revised so thatPCD patients may be enrolle d, provided their hearing threshold at screening audiometry is 25dB or lower at frequencies 0.5-4 kHz. Exclusion criterion 33a: The criterion was revised to clarify the assessment of abstinence as highl y effective contraception method. The window for re-screening was revised to allow re-screening once for any patient until enrolment is completed. Bronchiectasis patients with P.aeruginosa infections may have several exacer bation sa year. Therefore, patients who had an exacerbation during the screening period are now allowed to be re -screened twice until enrolment is completed. Furthermore, the renal alert criteria and follow -up actions and the discontinuation criteria were amended in order to focus on the relevant renal function markers .To improve the renal function monitoring distin ction is made between renal findings and confirmed renal events. Instructions forstudy treatment interruption/discontinuation have been clarified to distinguish events that mandate permanent study drug discontinuation as per protocol from those that are at investigators’ discretion. Study treatment must be discontinued in patients who have a serum creatinine increase of 50% or more compared to baseline, as confirmed according to Appendix 2 Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Actions . The threshold of 50% is aligned with the definition of Stage 1 Acute Kidney Injury/Risk for Acute Kidney Injury in the KDIGO guideline (2012) . Serum creatinine increase of up to 50% can reasonabl y be the result of patients’ hydration status. Patients with serum creatinine increase of 25 –<50% will be monitored according to Appendix 2, which now includes also eGFR measurement as follow up action in patients with serum creatinine increase. Investigators should consider stud y treatment interruption or discontinuation based on clinical judgement. In patients with proteinuria ≥ 3+ urine microscopy , albumin -creatinine -ratio (ACR) and protein -creatinine -ratio (PCR) will be determined. Patients with confirmed proteinuria ≥ 3+ must discontinue study treatment . BUN has been removed from the discontinuation criteria because it is not specific enough to determine renal failure. The pharmacokinetics ( PK)sampling scheme was revised in order to maximize the number of samples for tobram ycin exposure in particular inpatients who are on alternating TIP/placebo treatment. Changing PK sampling from Day 29 to Day 8 is acceptable to assess the exposure . This is based on the short estimated terminal half -life of tobram ycin in serum after inhalation of a single 112 mg dose of TI P which was approximately 3 hours (Ting 201 4). Additional minor clarifications were included, as summarized below in Changes to the protocol."
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Changes to the protocol 3.1 Study design Any patient can be re -screened once until enrollment has completed. Patients who had an exacerbation during the screening phase can be re -screened twice until recruitment has been completed. 4.2 Exclusion criteria Exclusion criterion 9a. was amended to allow p atients with a history of cancer (excluding lung cancer) and 2 years or more disease -free survival time tobe included. Exclusion criterion 10a. was amended to clarify that patients with c linically significant (in the opinion of the investigator) hearing loss that interferes with patients’ daily activities (such as normal conversations) or chronic tinnitus are n ot to be enrolled. Patients with a past history of clinically significant hearing loss in the opinion of the investigator may be eligible onl y if their hearing threshold at screening audiometry is 25dB or lower at frequencies 0.5-4 kHz. The use of a hearin g device is reflective of a clinically significant hearing loss; hence patients using hearing aids at screening are not eligible. Exclusion criterion 18a. was amended to remove serum creatinine and serum urea (BUN) from the panel of renal values relevant f or enrolment. Exclusion criterion 21a. was revised: P atients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD )may be enrolled, if their hearing threshold at screening audiometry is 25dB or lower at frequencies 0.5- 4 kHz. Exclusion criterion 33a. was revised to clarify that women of child- bearing potential may participate in the stud y if the investigator assesses their abstinence compliance. 5.4 Section was amended to include unblinding requests from the Novartis study -independent safet y review team. 5.5.7 Concomitant medication Section was revised to clarify that short -term (maximum of 28 consecutive day s)treatment with corticosteroids in case of an Adverse Event is permitted. 5.5.8 Prohibited medication Section was revised to clarify that long -term treatment (more than 28 day s) with corticosteroids >15mg/day is prohibited. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment The discontinuation criteria were amended based on above rationale and aligned with Section 14 Appendix 2 Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Actions .

The changes described in this amended protocol require IEC approval prior to implementation. The changes herein affect the I nformed Consent. Sites ar e required to update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this protocol amendment. Amendment 1 Amendment rationale The purpose of this protocol amendment is to clarify specific elements in the protocol. First, the timing of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) interim review is removed, as this is detailed in the DMC charter. Furthermore, the amendment clarifies that for the signs and symptoms characterizing the pulmonary exacerbations and which are required to last for more than 24 hours, additional information regarding duration will be collected to document if the reported signs and symptoms are present for more than 48 hours. The additional information is collected in line with the recently published consensus definition of pulmonary exacerbations for clinical research ( Hill et al 2017). In addition, thresholds and criteria for renal event monitoring are revised in accordance with the upda ted Novartis renal safet y guideline and the safet y profile of Tobramy cin Inhalation Powder (TIP) obtained from clinical and post-marketing experience in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Based on the review of the most recent data cumulativel y (until 30-June-2017), there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between use of TIP and the potential risk of"
17,page_17,"Novartis Confidential Page 18 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 nephrotoxicity . The risk for nephrotoxicity is expected to be very low considering the systemic levels of tobramy cin after TIP administration (Cmaxis 1.02 ± 0.53 μg/mL) compared to the maximum systemic levels recommended for avoidance of the toxicity associated with intravenous tobram ycin therapy (Cmaxgreater than 12 μg/mL) (Sweetman 2011). The revised renal safet y alert criteria have been designed to facilitate the earl y detection of a renal event. Moreover, corrections on minor inconsistencies or clarifications are incorporated in this protocol amendment. Changes to the protocol Section 4.1 Inclusion criteria: In inclusion criterion 4 ‘intravenous’ has been replaced with ‘parenteral’ anti-pseudomonal antibiotic treatment. For consistency ‘intravenous’ has been replaced with ‘parenteral’ anti-pseudomonal antibiotics in sections 2.2 secondary objectives, 5.5.7 Concomitant medication and 9.5.1.3 Anti- pseudomonal antibiotics. Section 4.2 Exclusion criteria: exclusion criterion 26 has been clarified, in line with exclusion criterion 27. Table 6-1 and Section 6.4.6 Exit Interviews: The footnote on e xit interviews is updated considering the timing of conduct of exit interviews. Section 6.4.4 Pulmonary exacerbations: additional time point of 48 hours is added to collect the presence of exacerbation symptoms, signs and findings lasting for more than48 hours. Furthermore, the protocol definition has been aligned to reflect the data collection in the Case Report Forms (‘fever’). Section 6.4.6 Health-related Quality of Life: The instructions were previously based on paper questionnaires and have been aligned with the electronic data collection used in this study . Section 6.5.4.3 Urinal ysis: The assessments have been revised according to the updated renal event monitoring. Section 6.5.7 Audiology: The audiology assessment time window at visit 2 and followi ng visits has been clarified. Section 7.4 Renal safety monitoring: Renal Alert criteria have been revised for consistency between sections 7.4 and Appendix 2 and in line with the revised Novartis guideli nes.

The gold standard method for diagnosis is via high resolution computerized tomograph y (HR-CT) scan. Bronchiectasis is frequently idiopathic in origin, or may be a result of a number of post-infectious causes, congenital diseases (e.g., immunodeficiency , primary ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis), inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease) or anatomic obstruction, all of which predispose to a cy cle of chronic infection and inflammation, and airway s damage. BE is often associated with bacterial infections that may be linked to higher morbidit y. The cystic fibrosis population, who demonstrate significant bronchiectatic changes as a result of chronic lung infection and inflammation, experience a significant morbidity and mortalit y related to chronic Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa infection. The presence of bacterial colonization/infection in non–cy stic fibrosis bronchiectasis (non–CF BE) has been associated with predictors of morbidity , such as exacerbations, and hospital admissions (Chalmers and Hill 2012). The pathogens most frequently associated with non-CF BE are: Haemophilus influenzae (30-47%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (7-11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12- 31%), Staphylococcus aureus (4-7%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (2-20%) (O’Donne ll 2008). Wilson et al (2013) have published other potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) such as Klebsiella spp(7%) and Proteus spp(6%). However, the link between a specific bacterial colonizati on and exacerbation is often difficult to demonstrate. Several studies tried to identify the predictors of morbidity in non-CF BE patients. Among them colonization with P. aeruginosa may play a key role (Ho et al 1998, Angrill et al 2002, Loebinger et al 2009 ). Non-CF BE prevalence is not well defined; in a US cohort using a claims database (with the cohort definition having a combination of diagnostic criteria) estimates range from 4.2 cases per 100,000 persons aged 18-34 years up to 272 cases per 100,000 in those over 75 years (Wey cker et al 2005) with a mean age of 61 years. Most subjects (68%) were women and common comorbidities included COPD (30.1%), ischemic heart disease (12.6%), malignant neoplasms (11.4%), diabetes mellitus (8.9%), and heart failure (8.1%). At present, no specific treatment standards are available; some “best practice” recommendations have been developed such as the British Thoracic Society guidelines (Pasteur et al 2010); there are also review papers based mainl y on the experience from CF. In stable lung disease (with or without chronic infection) the treatment aim is to reduce symptoms, limit exacerbations, preserve lung function and improve health -related qualit y of life (HRQoL). Antibiotic treatment is primaril y recommend ed to treat exacerbations. Data on long-term treatment with antibiotics are sparse and evidence for clinical benefits remains limited: inhaled continuous therap y with gentamicin over 12 months was successful, however treatment effect was lost after 3 month s off-treatment (Murray et al 2011). Recently Haworth et al (2014) have shown that 6 months therap y with inhaled colistin was successful, but only in the adherent subgroup."
20,page_20,"Novartis Confidential Page 21 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 A few pilot studies using inhaled tobramy cin nebulised solution have been performed in non- CF BE patients, with variable treatment success rates (Barke r et al 2000 , Scheinberg and Shore 2005, Drobnic et al 2005 ). Other exploratory studies have assessed inhalation treatment as follow -up after intraven ous ( i.v.) therapy (Orriols et al 1999 ) or add-on treatment to oral ciprofloxacin during acute exacerbations (Bilton et al 2006); trends in improvemen ts of clinical and/or microbiological outcomes have been noted in the arms with inhaled tobramy cin. Eradication of P. aeruginosa infection has been noted in some of these studies, varying from less than 20% up to 40% (Barker et al 2000, Scheinberg and Shore 2005 ). Tolerability in these studies was noted to be lower than that seen with TOBI (tobram ycin nebulised soluti on) registration trials in CF patients. Barker et al ( 2000) :n= 74 patients double blind study TOBI 300 mg/5mL b.i.d. (37 patients) vs. placebo (37 patients), 4 weeks on/2 weeks off dru g. Efficacy : signi ficant microbiologic effect demonstrated –P. aeruginosa density reduction 4.54 log 10CFU/g sputum, P<0.01; P. aeruginosa eradicated in 35% of TOBI patients, more TOBI patients evaluated as having “improved” medical condition (investigators judgment). Safe ty: subset of patients appeared to have drug -related adverse events –increased cough, dy spnea, increased sputum, chest pain, wheezing. Scheinberg and Shore (2005 ): n=41 Open label; 3 cy cles of 2 weeks on/2 weeks off nebulized TOBI 300 mg/5mL b.i.d.: 40 day follow -up. Result: microbiological benefit (decreased P. aeruginosa density ) in addition to an improvement in pulmonary symptom scores. Orriols et al (1999 ): n=17 open label; nebulized ceftazidime 1000 mg + nebulized tobramy cin solution 100 mg b.i.d. for 12 months vs. no inhaled antibiotics .Results: fewer hospitalizations, no improvement in pulmonary function (spirometry & arterial blood gas analysis). Drobnic et al ( 2005 ): n=30 double -blind, cross over; 300 mg/5mL nebulized TOBI b.i.d. or placebo, two 6 months treatment periods with 1 month wash out. Results: number of admissions and day s of admissions reduced, decreased Pa densit y. No difference in exacerbation rate, pulmonary function and quality of life. No bacterial resistance. Bilton et al (2006) : n=53 double -blind, r andomized; cipro floxacin oral plus either 300 mg/5mL nebulized TOBI b.i.d. or placebo, 2 weeks treatment , clinical outcome assessment at day 21.Results: consistent microbiological response but no statistical significant difference in clinical efficacy . Tobram ycin inhalation powder (TIP™) has been developed for the suppressive management of pulmonary infection due to P. aeruginosa in CF subjects aged 6 years and older. TIP is supplied in hard capsules at 28 mg dosage strength, to be administered via the T-326 dr y powder inhaler. Phase III clinical studies have shown efficacy and safety comparable to nebulized tobramy cin (TOBI) but with faster administration time and improved portabilit y (Konstan et al 2011b ). Bronchiectasis is a major component of the CF lung disease. TIP is intended to be developed for the treatment of chronic lung infection with P.aeruginosa in symptomatic bronchiectasis patients, as documented by CT-structural changes. Given the benefits of inhaled tobramy cin in CF patients and based on the preliminary results from pilot studies in BE patients with TOBI and also with inhaled gentamicin ( Murray et al 2011), TIP is expected to show a reduction in bacterial load in BE patients which could translate into"
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 reduction of clinical symptoms, reduction in rates of exacerbation and reduction in use of systemic antibiotics. The pharmacokinetics of parenteral tobram ycin do not differ significantly in CF patients compared with patients without CF when subject age, fat -free mass, sex and renal function are taken into consideration ( Hennig et al 2013 ). Based on the known concentration -dependent killing of bacteria and a post-administration antibiotic effect of aminogl ycosides, once daily (o.d.) parenteral administration of tobramy cin is well accepted (Smyth et al 2005). Concentration -dependent killing means that the bactericidal action of aminogly cosides is related to the peak concentration of antibiotic achieved. Greater bactericidal effect occurs at concentrations exceeding the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The post-administration antibiotic effect is a phenomenon in which the bactericidal action of the aminogly coside continues even after the antibiotic has been cleared and its concentration has fallen below the MIC. These pharmacological properties suggest that aminogly cosides can be administered o.d. Therefore in this study a once -daily regimen will be evaluated and compared to b.i.d regimen . This study has been developed and will be executed as part of the iABC (inhaled Antibiotics in Bronchiectasis and Cystic Fibrosis) project. iABC, as an IMI (Innovative Medicines Initiative) project, The scope of the iABC project is to advance the development of two inhaled antibiotics (one of them being TIP) for patients with CF and BE. Novartis retains the role of the sponsor and as such is responsible for the regulatory and pharmacovigilance activities, including clinical trial conduct. 1.2 Purpose Thepurpose of this Phase II study is to support the selection ofa safe and tolerable TIP daily dose, frequency of administration and regimen that exhibits effective bacterial reduction of P. aeruginosa in non-CF BE patients with a history of exacerbations and who had at least one positive culture of P.aeruginosa in sputum in the last 12 months, and a positive culture at screening for P.aeruginosa . Data from this study will be used to provide guidance on the dose selection and frequency of administration for subsequent studies. 2 Study objectives and endpoints 2.1 Primary objectives To evaluate the effect of different doses of TIP admi nistered o.d. and one b.i.d. dose on the change in P. aeruginosa bacterial load in sputum as assessed b y the change in colon y forming units (CFUs) from baseline to Day 29 of treatment, each compar ed to placebo. To assess the safet y and tolerability with di fferent doses of TI P administered o.d. and b.i.d. and different regimens (TI P and TI P/placebo cy clical) during the treatment epoch (112 days) and during the follow -up epoch (56 day s)for each as compar ed to placebo."

Approximately 180 eligible patients will be randomized to one out of the 3 cohorts in a ratio of 1:1:1. The patients within each cohort will be randomized to blinded TIP or placebo with the following randomization scheme: TIP: TIP/placebo cyclical: placebo, in a2:2:1 ratio. In total, the study has nine treatment arms distributed among the 3 cohorts (see Section 5.1 ). Total duration of the study is expected to be up to 196 days with a total of 9 visits, consisting of up to 28 days for the screening epoch; after randomization a 112-day treatment epoch with 6 clinic visits, followed by a 56-day follow -up e poch with 2 clinic visits. Patients will be assessed for safety , tolerability and efficacy (see Assessment Schedule Table 6 - 1). At an initial screening visit (Visit 1), informed consent will be obtained before any study related assessment or procedures are performed , inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed and current medications reviewed. All patients signing informed consent must be registered in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The patients will commence a flexible 7-28 day screening epoch where all screening assessments will be performed and the prese nce of pulmonary bacterial colonization with P. aeruginosa based on sputum culture will be done. Patients who are otherwise eligible may be re-tested for P. aeruginosa in the sputum and/or laboratory evaluations during the screening epoch. Any patient can bere-screened once until enrollment has completed. Patients who had an exacerbation during the screening phase can be re-screened twice until recruitment has been completed .The P. aeruginosa bacterial load estimation will be done by quantitative identifi cation using standard culture methods (Patel et al 2002). .At the completion of the baseline assessments on Day 1 (Visit 2), all patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the three treatment cohorts and enter the 112- day treatment epoch on the same day . The randomization bycohort and treatment arm will be stratified by use of macrolides. After Visit 101(Day 1) , the patients will attend a visit after 7 days of treatment (Day 8, Visit 102). The next visit is planned on Day 29 (Visit 103), and monthly thereafter (Day 57 Visit 104 to Day 113, end of treatment Visit 106). Following the treatm ent epoch, patients will enter the 56-day follow - up epoch (no study medication, but"
25,page_25,"Novartis Confidential Page 26 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 baseline standard care according to the local guidelines) and attend two follow -up epoch visits (Visits 201 and 202). Figure 3-1 Study design 3.2 Rationale for study design The patient population will be described in more detail in the Section 4 below. This study is designed to find a dose and regimen in non-CF BE patients with pulmonary P.aeruginosa infections. A parallel study design with three treatment cohorts is used to investigate three different TIP doses and regimens ve rsus placebo. The study will implement a within -cohort blinding approach. If the study were blinded across all arms, all of the subjects in the study would need to inhale the maximal dose of 10 capsules every day to maintain the blind in a double -blind double dummy design (5 morning + 5 evening). In previous double -blind studies in CF patients (EVOLVE and EDIT) it has been noted that tolerability of placebo was overall similar with that of TI P, being most likely driven by the amount of powder inhaled and its oro-phary ngeal deposition (Konstan et al 2011a , Konstan et al 2011b ). In order to assess tolerability (defined by the rate of local AEs) related tothe dose, within -cohort blinding is planned in this study . For each dose level, the patients will be randomi zed as follows: TIP:TIP/placebo cyclical: placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. This randomization scheme will allow the analysis of tolerability across treatment arms within the same cohort for those patients on active study drug without bias from an open design, and will also permit comparison of efficacy outcomes to a pooled placebo group. The randomization scheme has been chosen to ensure that a total of 36 patients are randomized into the three cohorts to receive placebo (12 placebo patients per cohort) and also the number of patients between TIP/placebo cyclical and TIP are evenl y distributed 24 patients per treatment arm.

26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 27 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 is not expected that the amount of placebo powder administered will influence efficacy measurements, therefore the placebo patients will be pooled (12 patients per dose, in total 36 patients on placebo for the efficacy endpoint). Patients from both TIP and TIP/placebo cyclical treatmen t arms will be pooled within the same cohort for the primary endpoint measurement at Day 29, as they both receive the same active treatment during the first 28 days. For further details about the anal ysis, see Section 9.4 . From the pilot studies in BE patients with the nebulized tobramy cin solution it has been suggested that tolerability might be lower in BE patients compared to in CF patients, because of coughing, dyspnea or wheezing. The current design is able to assess the tolerability of different doses and regimens of TIP in this new indication. The number of arms and regimens were selected on the basis of the dose rationale below. 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment The planned doses to be administered in this study are 84 mg (3 capsules), 140 mg (5 capsules) once daily each and 112 mg (4 capsules) twice daily to identify the TIP dose that exhibits effective bacterial reduction in non-CF BE patients who had one positive sputum cultures in the last 12 months and a positive culture at screening. The 112 mg twice daily dose has been established as the safe and effective dose for the treatment of patients with CF (Konstan et al 2011a , Konstan et al 2011b) and is used as reference dose in this study . The dose regimens selected for this study are chosen based on the early pilot studies with TOBI suggesting that BE patients may tolerate inhaled therap y less well than CF patients. Further, in the TPI001 study (Geller et al 2007), the sputum concentrations measured in CF patients after single doses of 3 capsules and 4 capsules provided similar tobramy cin sputum concentrations with the range sof Cmax largel y overlapping, the mean slightl y above 1000 µ g/g sputum. The concentrations achieved for o.d. doses of 3 and 4 capsules of TIP in TPI001 study (Geller et al 2007 ) have largel y exceeded the tobramy cin MIC, including the MICs for highly resistant P.aeruginosa strains and hence were chosen for this study . The 5 capsule o.d. dose was chosen to evaluate whether it offers superior safet y and efficacy compared to the approved 4 capsule b.i.d. dose. One capsule dose was consi dered, butnot retained, because in the TPI001 study the tobram ycin Cmax was 258 µg/g sputum, which is close to the upper end of the tobram ycin MIC range that is seen in some patients, creating a risk for selection of resistant strains. Additionally , it is well established that the efficacy of tobramy cin, an aminogl ycoside, is driven by a concentration -dependent bactericidal effect (Maglio et al 2002 , Scaglione and Paraboni 2006); therefore it is suited to once daily dosing, which would substantially enhance patient compliance. The use of tobramy cin once daily intravenousl y in cystic fibrosis patients has been shown to be safe and effective ( Smyth et al 2005 , Whitehead et al 2002 ). The treatment duration of 16 weeks (followed by 8 weeks follow -up) is chosen to test efficacy and safet y beyond 4 weeks of treatment. Indeed, there is precedent from the TI P studies in the CF indication, that 4 weeks of treatment are sufficient to achieve bacterial suppression in the lungs (Konstan et al 2011a , Konstan et al 2011b ). However based on the TOBI pilot study in"
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 BE(Barker et al 2000 ) it is assumed that a duration of 4 weeks of treatment is too short to translate into improvement in clinical outcomes (reduction of exacerbations, use of i.v. antibiotics). A duration of 112 days allows to test two full cycles (28 days on-/ 28day s off- therap y) of cyclical dosing. With regards to the cyclical regimen (TIP/placebo cyclical treatment arms), it is thought that a single cycle is not sufficient to detect a clinical effect. For example, in ORBIT - 2, using inhaled dual- release ciprofloxacin for inhalation (Serisier et al 2013), the trends in exacerbation were only observed after the second treatment period. Clinical evidence in bronchiectasis is increasing to suggest that a continuous regimen also might be appropriate. Long -term studies in BE with continuous therapies (Murray et al 2011, Haworth et al 2014), have shown improvements in exacer bations and patient reported outcome (PROs). Murray et al (2011 )(12 months daily inhaled gentamicin in BE patients, followed by 3 m onths off-treatment period) have shown a reduction in exacerbations (gentamicin group: 33.3% vs. saline: 80%). Notably , the treatment effect was lost after 3 months follow -up. Authors have seen no emergence of resistance. Haworth et al (2014) in a double -blind placebo controlled study , 6-months daily therap y with colistin in BE patients, have shown in the overall population trends in favor of the therapy were shown, but which did not reach statistical significance (p=0.11). However, in the adherent patients, the delay in time to exacerbation was statistically significant (p=0.038). Therefore it is proposed to also test a continuous treatment regimen for 16 weeks, a duration that may allow to detection of trends in improving clinical outcomes and PROs, as compared to placebo. Further, 8 weeks of follow - up will inform about the persistence of theclinical effects. Smith et al (1989 )suggested that twelve weeks of continuous inhaled tobramy cin treatment in CF patients led to increase in MIC. Recent studies of 12-months' and 6-months', respectivel y, duration (Murray et al 2011 and Haworth et al 2014 ) in BE patients, did not observe an increase in resistance that translated into a loss in clinical efficacy . Therefore, during the proposed phase II study , tobramy cin MIC will be closel y monitored at every visit and the microbiology data will be interpreted in the context of change in clinical response. 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator Placebo is chosen as comparator since no approved active comparator is available for the indication under study . Itis considered necessary to include placebo in order to determine which doses and frequency of regimen offer an efficacy benefit in terms of reduction of bacterial load. Both patients and investigators remain blinded to the assignment to active or placebo within the cohort. The subjects would be aware of the number of capsules and the frequency of daily administration of active and placebo that they have been assigned to but have no knowledge of whether they were allocated to active or placebo. 3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations Not applicable. 3.6 Risks and benefits The risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria. All patients will be closely supervised in this study . Systemic antibiotic treatment is allowed,"

Its efficacy and safet y profile is well- established. TOBI®(tobramy cin inhalation solution, or TIS) has become the gold standard inhaled antipseudomonal treatment in CF since its launch in 1998. TIP was developed for use in the same CF population as TIS. The approved TIP dose for CF provides comparable sputum and serum pharmacokinetic exposures to the approved TIS dose with respect to tobramy cin and has comparable safet y and efficacy profile s. TIP is approved for use in CF at thedose 112 mg (i.e. 4 capsules of 28 mg each) twice daily. The pharmacokinetics of parenteral tobram ycin do not differ significantl y in CF patients compared with patients without CF when subject age, fat-free mass, sex and renal function are taken into consideration (Hennig 2013 ). Therefore the systemic exposure in BE is not expected to differ from the CF patients. Based on the serum pharmacokinetic data from previous studies of TIP in CF patients, a dose of 5 capsules is not expected to exceed the maximum threshold of 12 µg/ml for Cmaxand 2 µg/ml for Ctrough. Increased variability can be expected in subjects treated with 5 capsules compared to 3 capsules of TIP. To assess the pharmacokinetic properties of tobram ycin from TIP in BE patients and to develop a PKmodel, tobram ycin concentrations in serum and sputum will be measured. The safet y and tolerability profile of TIP in BE patients is not yet established. The highest daily dose planned to be tested in this study is the dose that has been demonstrated to besafe and effective in CF patients. The phase II study will define a dose that is effective in suppressing clinically relevant bacterial pathogens which is also safe and well tolerated. Renal and oto- toxicity will be monitored. 4 Population The study population will consist of approximately 180 male and female BE patients ≥18 years old with clinical diagnosis of non-CF bronchiectasis confirmed radiologicall y by CT scan, a history of exacerbations requiring systemic antibiotic administration and who had one positive culture for P. aeruginosa in sputum in the last 12 months and a P. aeruginosa positive culture at screening. Patients also should have an FEV 1of at least 30% predicted. It is anticipated that approximately 260 patients will need tobe screened in order to randomize approximately 180 patients across 3 cohorts of the study with a cohort randomization ratio of 1:1:1 and within each cohort a ratio of 2:2:1 for TIP:TIP/placebo cyclical:placebo randomization.

The test product consists of capsules of TIP at 28 mg dosage strength. The matching placebo is provided in hard capsules containing placebo particles consisting of DSPC (1,2- distearo yl-sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine) and calcium chloride (CaCl 2). Three different dose regimens for the test product and placebo are investigated in this study . A dose will alway s consist of sequential inhalation of the content of the number of prescribed capsules. 5.1.2 Additional treatment No additional treatment beyond investigational treatment is requested for this trial. Patients will be allowed standard of care, as defined locally . 5.2 Treatment arms Patients will be randomized to the following three cohorts in a ratio of 1:1:1. Blinding will be done within each cohort. Patients will be further randomized within each cohort to one of the three treatment arms: TIP, TIP/placebo cyclical, orplacebo with a randomization ratio of 2:2:1. Cohort A: TIP: Three capsules of blinded TI P at 28 mg dosage strength, inhaled o.d. via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 day s (on treatment). The total daily dose and each treatment therefore consists of 84 mg tobramycin (3 capsules of 28 mg each), TIP/placebo cy clical : patients will take same doses , i.e. 3 capsules o.d., b y alternating TIP 28-days with placebo 28 -days for two cy cles for a total of 112 day s. Placebo: The reference product consists of placebo capsules (DSPC/CaCl 2). The dose regimen for the reference product is three capsules blinded, inhaled o.d. via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 day s (on treatment)."
33,page_33,"Novartis Confidential Page 34 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Cohort B: TIP: Five capsules of blinded TI P at 28 mg dosage strength, inhaled o.d. via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 day s (on treatment). The total daily dose and each treatment therefore consists of 140 mg tobramy cin (5 capsules of 28 mg each). TIP/placebo cy clical : patients will take same doses , i.e. 5 capsules o.d., b y alternating TIP 28-da ys with placebo 28 -days for two cy cles for a total of 112 day s. Placebo: The reference product consists of placebo capsules. The dose regimen for the reference product is five capsules blinded, inhaled o.d. via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 days (on treatment ). Cohort C: TIP: Four capsules of blinded TI P at 28 mg dosage strength, inhaled b.i.d. in the morning and in the evening via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 day s of treatment. Each dose therefore consists of 112 mg tobramy cin (4 capsules of 28 mg each), the to tal daily dose corresponds to 224 mg tobramy cin (112 mg b.i.d. ), TIP/placebo cy clical : patients will take same doses , i.e. 4 capsules b.i.d., by alternating TIP 28-days with placebo 28- days for two cy cles for a total of 112 day s. Placebo: The reference pr oduct consists of placebo capsules. The dose regimen for the reference product is four capsules blinded, inhaled b.i.d. via the T -326 Inhaler, for 112 days (on treatment). The treatment epoch is followed by a 56 -day follow -up epoch ( no study treatment). 5.3 Treatment assignment and randomization At Visit 101 (see Table 6-1), all eligible patients/subjects will be randomized via Novartis Interactive Response Technology (NIRT) to one of the treatment arms with the randomization stratum (use of macrolides as part of their standard of care therapy ). The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the NIRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The NIRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of investigational treatment to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the Novartis IRT (NIRT) provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Drug Suppl y Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s). Randomizatio n by cohort and treatment arm will be stratified byuse of macrolides. The randomization scheme for patients /subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group."
34,page_34,"Novartis Confidential Page 35 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 5.4 Treatment blinding The study will implement a within -cohort blindi ng approach (for details see Section 3.2). Patients/subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods: Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible b y anyone else involved in the study. The identity of the treatment swithin -cohort will be concealed b y the use of study drug that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste, and odor. The randomization codes associated with patients/subjects from whom PK samples are taken will be disclosed to PK bioanaly sts who will keep PK results confidential until data base lock. Unblinding will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 5.5.9), request from the Novartis study -independent safety review team, request from the Data Monitoring Committee if needed for the safet y interim analysis (Section 8.4) or as an outcome of their evaluation and at the conclusion of the study . Health autho rities will be granted access to unblinded data if needed. Any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertentl y or for an y non -emergency reason will be discontinued from treatment . Each center shall identify individuals(s) called Independent Study Coordinators (ISC) responsible for dispensing study drug to the patient, assisting and supervising the patient with the first inhalation at the site during Visit 101, and supervising the patient whilst inhaling study drug at Visits 102 thru106(last inhalation). The ISC are independent of the study team in that they do not perform any patient assessments or study activities. The ISCs must not discuss the characteristics of the trial drug with the patients, the investigator(s) or any study staff responsib le for evaluating patients, or Novartis personnel involved in conducting, monitoring, or analy zing data in this trial. 5.5 Treating the patient Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. 5.5.1 Patient numbering Each patient is uniquely identified by a S ubject Number which is composed of the site number assigned by Novartis and a sequential number assigned by the IRT. Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the investigator or his/her staff will contact the IRT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to regist er them into the I RT. The site must select the eCRF book with a matching Subject Numbe r from the EDC sy stem to enter data."
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being randomized will be entered on the Screening epoch Study Disposition C RF. 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each study site will be supplied by Novartis with study drugin packaging of identical appearance specific for each dose level. Active and placebo packaging will be matching for each dose level. The study drugpackaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the 9 treatment arms. Investigator staff will identify the investigational treatment package(s) to dispense to the patient by contacting the IRT andobtaining the medication number(s). Immediately before dispensing the package to the patient, the ISC or appropriate independent investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patient’s unique subject number. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secur ed location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Techni cal complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis Qualit y Assurance per the procedure provided by the Field Monitor . Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storag e conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the tr ial. Patients/subjects will be asked to return all unused study treatment and empty blisters from Visit 102, through Visit 106 or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment (TD) . At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment Not applicable."
36,page_36,"Novartis Confidential Page 37 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment The study drug (TIP or placebo) will be dispensed by the ISC at Visit 101 (start of treatment) and Visit 103 through Visit 106. Each patient will receive a kit of investigational treatment containing the medication for 28 days of treatment. For dosing visits 103, 104 and 105 study drug administered during the visit should be taken from the newl y dispensed kit. At Visit 106, the study drug administered during the visit should be taken from the kit dispensed at Visit 105. Each kit contains five weekl y boxes with each weekl y box containing an inhaler and the required number ofblister cards for one week dosing. The content of the fifthweekl y box serves as a reserve in case a reserve inhaler is needed and provides supply until the next scheduled visit. I nstructions for use for the T -326 I nhaler are given in Appendix 4 and will be handed out to the patient at Visit 101. Use of the reserve suppl y will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Patients will be provided with medication as described in Section 5.2. The ISC will train the patient and assist and supervise the patient with the first inhalation at the site during Visit 101 by using instructions for use of T -326 Inhaler, describing in detail how to handle the drug-device combination. The ISC will also assist and supervise the patient ’s inhalation of thestudy drug at Visit 102 (Day 8 ) through Visit 106 (Day 113) or at the study treatment discontinuation visit (TD) if applicable. Detailed instructions for use are included in Appendix 4. In summary , each capsule containing thestudy medication has to be removed one at a time from the blister card, inserted into the T -326 Inhaler, the inhaler actuated and the study drug inhaled according to instructions. Patients are instructed to perform two inhalations and breath -hold maneuvers for each capsule by default, then verif y that the capsule has been emptied completely and inhale again as necessary . The last administration of study medication will be in the morning at Visit 106 (Day 113). Administration of any short- acting bronchodilator should occur 15 to 90 minutes prior to the spirometric assessments. Any other inhaled medications should have been taken prior to administration of study drug and any chest physiotherapeutic m easures shall have been completed previousl y. If applicable, any long-acting bronchodilator prescribed to the patient should have been taken within the last 12 hours prior to the spirometric assessments; otherwise a short -acting bronchodilator shall be taken as described above. Also, the examinations which should be performed before study drug inhalation defined in Table 6-1 need to be completed prior to study drug administration. To ensure a robust and valid assessment of FEV 1at each assessment it is important that these are done consistently at a similar time of day (to account for diurnal effects) and following consistent use (or not) of prior bronchodilator therapy . All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF. All kits of investigational treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the IRT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatment exactl y as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s safet y and the validity of the study . The patient must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for an y reason to take the study treat ment as prescribed."

The forms will be supplied to each investigator site by the Field Monitor. 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment Study drug dose adjustments are not permitted. The patients with pulmonary exacerbations will continue in the study as scheduled once they have recovered and discontinued antibiotics administered for the exacerbation. If the patient continues in the study after the interruption of the study drug treatment, the schedule of visit/treatment cy cle should be aligned with the original visit schedule. Any interruption of the inhalation of study drug treatment must be recorded on the Dosage Administration Record CRF. 5.5.6 Rescue medication Rescue medication for pulmonary exacerbations (including systemic antibiotics) and for bronchospasm is allowed. For concomitant treatments permitted see Section 5.5.7. Use of rescue medication must be recorded on the Concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapies CRF. 5.5.7 Concomitant medication If a patient experiences a pulmonary exacerbation and/or worsening of the disease condition, he/she will be treated as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Following treatment for the pulmonary exacerbation and/or worsening of the disease condition, the patient will be expected to continue in the study as scheduled provided, in the opinion of the investigator, he/she can be safel y returned to their pre-pulmonary exacerbation concomitant medications. In addition, if the patient requires anyprohibited treatment listed in Table 5-1, then he/she should be withdrawn from the study medication. The following treatments are permitted between Visit 101 and the compl etion of the study /termination v isit and should be accuratel y documented in the CRF: Antibiotics ( parenteral or by mouth) are allowed for the trea tment of pulmonary exacerbations as dictated by the patient’s condition. Inhalation of study medication must be interrupted during i.v. aminogl ycoside therapy . A window of 12 hours is recommended between stop of the study medication and initiation of i.v. aminoglycosides. Patients should restart inhalation of study medication with in24 hours after completing the i.v. treatment in order to complete the 112- day treatment epoch as close as possible to their initial study schedule, following completion of the c ourse of i.v. aminogly coside therapy . Inhalation of study medication may continue upon phy sician’s decision, if the antibiotics used are other than aminogl ycosides. Pre-planned sy stemic antibiotics in the absence of an AE (proph ylaxis of pulmonary exacerbation) are permitted only during the follow -up epoch ."
38,page_38,"Novartis Confidential Page 39 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 Short term treatment (of a maximum of 28consecutive days) with corticosteroids for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations or other adverse events Macrolides (anti -inflammatory regimen): Patients should have been initiated on oral chronic macrolide therap y (i.e. macrolides prescribed for more than 14 day s) more than 28 day s prior to study drug administration (Visit 101) and should remain on treatment through the completion/termination visit. Bronchodilators: Patients should have been kept on the same regimen more than 28 day s prior to the first study drug administration (Visit 101) through the completion/termination visit. I f patients are on short -acting bronchodilators, they should be consistently used prior to each assessment and inhaled 15 to 90 minutes prior to any spirometric assessments. Long -acting bronchodilators should be inhaled at least 12 hours prior to an y spirometric assessments. To ensure a robust and valid assessment of FEV 1 at each visit, it is recommended that these are done consistently at a similar time of day (to account for diurnal effects) and following consistent use (or not) of prior bronchodila tor therap y. Inhaled corticosteroids: Patients should have been initiated on therap y more than 28 days prior to study drug administration (Visit 101) and should remain on an unaltered regimen through the completion/termination visit. Use of ox ygen is allo wed for acute events, such as exacerbation. Long -term oxy gen therap y for chronic h ypoxemia over >15 h per day is not allowed. Selected information for all antibiotics and macrolides, corticosteroids and bronchodilators administered within 12 months prior to screening will be recorded in the CRF. Caution for concomitant use Based on the interaction profile for tobram ycin following intravenous and aerosolized administration, concurrent and/or sequential use of TIP with other drugs with neurotoxic, nephrotoxic , or ototoxic potential should be avoided. Other medicinal products that have been reported to increase the potential toxicity of parenterall y administered aminogl ycosides include: amphotericin B, cefalot hin, poly myxins (risk of increased nephrotoxicity ); platinum compounds (risk of increased nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity ); anticholinesterases, botulinum toxin (neuromuscular effects). If the patient’s condition/disease requires medications (including those listed above) which may potentially affect the systemic tobram ycin levels (even the study drug is tobram ycin inhalation powder), continuation of inhalation of study medication is at the investigator’s discretion. If inhalation of study medication is continued during the following drug therap y, patients"
39,page_39,"Novartis Confidential Page 40 Amended Pr otocol Version 03 (Clean) Protocol No. CTBM100G2202 will continue with the study schedule for the remainder of the study ; however, therapeutic drug monitoring is strongly recommended. If inhalation of stud y medication is interrupted during the following drug therap y (either as a routine measure or due to ele vated serum tobramy cin levels), patients should restart inhalation of study medication in order to complete the 112- day treatment epoch as close as possible to their initial study schedule. Caution should be exercised when prescribing TIP to patients with known or suspected neuromuscular disorders such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson’s disease. Aminogl ycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare -like effect on neuromus cular function. 5.5.8 Prohibited medication Use of the treatments display ed in Table 5-1is NOT allowed after the start of the study treatment administration (Visit 101). If a prohibited medication is taken between start of study treatment administration and end of the treatment epoch , study drug must be discontinued. If taken during the follow -up epoch, the prohibited medication should be stopped as soon as possible. Use of the prohibited medication should be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF.

Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novart is (or CRO) monitor for the site and the Study Team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number study drug name (if available) patient number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un- blinding can be performed at an y time. Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. Study drug must also be discontinued for an y patient whose treatment code has been inadvertentl y broken . 5.6 Stud y Completion and Discontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post -study treatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. Completion of the study will be when the last patient has completed Visit 202. Continuing care should be provided by investigator and/or referring physician based on patient availability for follow -up. This care may include resuming of their standard of care treatment as deemed b y their phy sician. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of Study Treatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a patient occurs when study drug is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the patient or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would negativel y impact the risk/benefi t of trial participation . Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Patient wish Non-compliance of the patient with study procedures or investigator instructions, as per the investigator’s judgment"

Any renal finding needs to be followed up according to Section 14 Appendix 2 Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Actions , which lists additional laboratory abnormalities that may require study treatment discontinuation based on clinical judgement. Confirmed renal events need to be followed up and documented according to Section 14 Appendix 2 . Patients who interrupted study medication based on the investigator’s decision should continue in the study , as per the visits and assessment schedule (see Section 5.5.5) - interruption of study treatment does not necessarily mandate withdrawal from the study . Patients who discontinue study medication should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study .The patient should return to the clinic as soon as possible , after discon tinuation of study drug, for a study treatment discontinuation visit and then enter the 2-month follow - up epoch . Treatment discontinuation visit assessments detailed in the “treatment discontinuation visit” (TD) in Table 6-1should be completed and recorded in the CRF. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort should be made to contact them as specified inSection 5.6.4 .The investigator must determine the primary reason for the patient’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the Dosage Administration CRF. After study treatment discontinuation , at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should to be collected at clinic visits or via telephone visits: new / concomitant treatments adverse events/Serious Adverse Events"

This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient’s discontinuation from study treatment. If study drug discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 5.5.9. 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Subje cts may voluntaril y withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at an y time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the stud y any longer , and Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in assessment table ( Table 6 -1.) Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient’s withdrawal from the study . Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment orwithdraw from the study will not be replaced. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue orwithdraw, the investigator should show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time po int of his/her scheduled end of study visit has passed."

Should this be necessary, the patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated for a p rematurely withdrawn patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RBs/IECs) of the earl y termination of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments The study will consist of a screening epoch, a 112-day treatment epoch and a 56-day follow - up epoch after the last treatment. Table 6-1lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “x” when the visits are performed. Patients/subjects must be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. All data obtained for these assessments must be supported in the patients’ source documentation. Visit 2 (baseline) and Visit 101 are performed on the same day (Day 1). Patients are required to complete specific ‘baseline assessments (Inclusion/E xclusion criteria) as part of Visit 2 prior to being randomized and moving into the treatment epoch (Visit 101). Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients/subjects who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled and the adverse event and concomitan t medications reconciled on the CRF. At a minimum, patients will be contacted for safety evaluations during the 30 days following the last administration of study treatment. The PRO questionnaires should alway s be completed before any other assessments at a study visit. The following assessments should be performed prior to dosing for applicable visits: Physical examination Vital signs Body weight Serum specimen for Safety Laboratory Serum pregnancy test Urine pregnancy test Urinaly sis Sputum specimens (2 separate specimens) for central anal ysis Pre-dose serum specimen for PK sub- study (if applicable) Audiology at Visit 2 Pre-dose spirometry"

Adverse events that are not SAEs will be f ollowed by the investigator and collected onl y in the source data. 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all patients include: date of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicity , and source of patient referral. Relevant medical history or current medical condition data include data present before signing informed consent. Where possible, diagnoses and not symptoms will be recorded. History of pulmonary exacerbations will be collect ed on a specific medical history CRF. A standard 12 lead ECG will be performed at screening (Visit 1). For eligibility in the study the interpretation of the tracing must be made by a qualified physician and documented. The original ECGs, appropriately signed, should be collected and archived at the study site. ECGs must be recorded after 10 minutes rest in the supine position to ensure a stable baseline. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection is ECG collection first, followed by vital signs, blood sampling, and spirometry . The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) should be used for clinical decisions. Each ECG tracing should be labeled with study number, subject initials, subject number, date and time, and filed in the study site source documents. For any ECGs with subject safet y concerns, two additional ECGs should be performed to confirm the safety finding. If the ECG findings are clinicall y relevant and would prevent the patient from participating in the study (taking into account the overall status of the patient as well as the medication profile), the patient should be recorded as a screen failure, should NOT be randomized and should not receive treatment. Clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded on the relevant s ection of the medical history /Current medical conditions/AE CRF page as appropriate. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the medical history CRF whenever in their judgment, the test abnormality occurred prior to the informed consent signature. Conditions associated with bronchiectasis disease and signs or symptoms including etiology and age at diagnostic will be captured by using a specific BE-related Medical History CRF page. Baseline data (using a specific CRF as necessary ) such as spirometry, previous hospital admissions and exacerbations, baseline Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness score, colonization with P. aeruginosa and other organisms, and radiological changes will be collected for calculation of the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) for all patients. The BSI will serve as a disease -specific severit y assessment tool ( Chalmers et al 2014 )."

Before sending CT image sto the Central Reader by secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) server ,courier or eRoom ,all images will be de-identified. For each patient CTimage s will be scored for the presence or absence of BE. Furthermore, all CT images will be scored using the Bauman and Hartmann scoring systems to quantify the presence and extend of key lung disease features including BE, airway wall thickening, trapped air, parench ymal abnormalities and nodules. In addition for a subset of random selected CT image s, advanced image an alysis of the most appropriatie series for each CT scan will be executed in random order to develop the PRAGMA- BE scoring s ystem. For the development of the Airway Artery (AA) method for objective measurement of airway dimensions CT images from a subset of approximately 30 patients will be used. The following structures will be manually measured: airway lumen area (Ainner), airway outer area (Aouter) and the area of the accompany ing vessel (A) for all visible airway vessel pairs (100-300 per scan) (de Jong et al 2005). From these measurements the following ratios will be computed: Aouter/A; Ainner/A; Airway wall Area (AWA)/A .The automated airway and artery extraction algorithm as developed by the central reader imaging group will subsequently be tuned to match these manual annotations. Automated measurement will be further validated by determining agreement with the same measures derived from manual annotation in this patient cohort. Furthermore, the manual and automated AA-method will be compared to BE and airway wall thickness sub- scores and spirometry outcomes. Through image analysis quantitative image analy sis parameters will be allocated for each patient to CT image sthat will be included into the clinical database. The annotated images will be stored within the secured hospital environment on the data storage facility of the Central Reader. Results from the Phase II study will be used to select the best image analy sis strategy to phenoty peBE CTimage s and to fine -tune the automated AA method to be used . 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance Assessment of compliance will be based on the electronic patient diary to capture the number of inhaled capsules in every morning and evening if applicable, and the number of unused capsules returned per patient assessed by the ISC.

Patients should be advised to contact the site when experiencing a pulmonary exacerbation for advice. An unscheduled visit should occur within 2 working days of the event to confirm the diagnosis, unless the patient is hospitalized and thus unable to attend the site. AEs/SAEs, concomitant medications, and safet y laboratory exams should be captured, as appropriate. The start date for a pulmonary exacerbation recorded in the CRF should be the first day of symptom worsening of at least 3 of the 6 symptoms, as defined above . The end of a pulmonary exacerbation episode is marked by the return to pre -exacerbation sy mptom status. An exacerbation might result in missed or rescheduled visit(s) and missing associated CRF data in some circumstances. Patients who develop a pulmo nary exacerbation between screening and prior to treatment will be screen failed but will be permitted to be re-screened once the inclu sion/exclusion criteria have been met (see exclusion criteria). 6.4.5 Pulmonary function tests Pulmonary function testing will be performed locally at the site using locally available spirometry equipment. FEV 1, values will be recorded on the CR Fas absolute volume measurements . The pre -dose values will be used as efficacy measurements.

Patients/subjects should be given sufficient space and time to complete all study PROs. If patients/subjects experience any difficult ies with submission after they complete the PROs, the study staff should assist them with submitting their PRO responses. Attempts should be made to collect responses to all PROs for all patients/subjects, including from those who prematurely discontinue prior to the study evaluation completion visit, however, if patients/subjects refuse to complete PROs, this should be documented in study source records. Patient’s refusal to complete stud y PROs are not protocol deviations . Completed questionnaires will bereviewed and examined by the investigator, before the clinical examination, for responses that may indicate potential adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). The investigator should review not onl y the responses to the questions in the questionnaires but also for any unsolicited comments written by the patient. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed, then the physician must record the events as per instructions given in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of the protocol. Investigators should not encourage the patients to change the responses reported in the completed questionnaires."

The QOL -B consists of 8 domains (Respiratory Symptoms, Physical, Emotional, Social, and Role Functioning, Vitality , Treatment Burden, and Health Perceptions), all have been developed based on patient interviews and went through preliminary validation, its validity and reliability has been confirmed. The respirator y domain is of particular interest. The minimal important difference (MID )has been found to be 8 on this domain and have shown to be responsive to treatment ( Quittner et al 2015 ). The recall period is o ne week, and the responses are graded on a 4- point Likert scale. The instrument will be administered at each of the following study visits: baseline (Visit 2) and each of the post-baseline visits. It must be administered at the beginning of each study visit, before any measurements are taken ( i.e., weight, lung function). The appropriate language version(s) of the questionnaire will be used in each participating country . The same language version of the questionnaire should be used by a p articular patie nt throughout the study . The study coordinator should be familiar with the instrument and the associated user guides and training materials provided. The patient should complete the questionnaire on his/her own (no famil y members present) in a quiet area and be allowed to ask questions; however site staff should take care not to influence the patient’s responses. The patient will be instructed to provide the truest and for them best response. While completing the PROs, the electronic device will prompt p atients at appropriate intervals to ensure that they respond to all questions to minimize missing data. At later visits patients are not allowed to review their previous responses. The original questionnaire will be kept with the patient’s file as the sour ce document. Exit Interviews Novartis will conduct (by an entrusted external vendor) exit interviews with a subset of patients completing this trial to evaluate the content validity of the QOL -B, with particular emphasis on the Respiratory Symptoms subscale, as recommended in the feedback received from the FDA. Exit interviews will be conducted in the U nited Kingdom only and the planned recruitment is approximately 25 patients. Telephone interviews with the patients should be conducted at the last follow-up visit after completion of the PRO questionnaires and prefer ably prior to other assessments . The results will be independentl y reported."

Microbiological data will assess the direct impact of the drug on the pathogens, while spirometric data and pulmonary exacerbations are representative for the control of BE overall. 6.5 Safet y The following assessments will be performed to assess study treatment safety : Adverse events, Serious adverse events Physical examination and vital signs Clinical chemistry , Hematology Urinaly sis and dipstick Post-inhalation events Bronchial hy perreactivity measured by change in FEV 1% predicted post -inhalation Audiology (will be performed at selected sites andin patients w ho have oto -toxic AEs during the study ) Serum pregnancy (fema les of child bearing potential) Adverse events of special interest (ototoxicity /hemopty sis/renal) Hospitalizations for respiratory -related AE 6.5.1 Physical examination Physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or sy mptoms, additional exams may be performed. Information for a ll phy sical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Clinically relevant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent must be included in the Medical History part of the CRF. Significant findings made after first administration of investigational drug which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the CRF. 6.5.2 Vital signs Systolic/diastolic blood pressure, radial pulse rate (over a 30 s interval), respiratory rate and body temperature will be recorded at Visit 1 (screening), start of treatment epoch (Visit 101), end of the treatment epoch (Visit 106), and end of the follow -up epoch (Visit 202). Single measurements will be performed before inhalation of study medic ation in the case of a dosing visit. All blood pressure measurements should be taken after the patient has rested in the sitting position for at least 10 min."
58,page_58,"Novartis Confidential Page 59 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 6.5.3 Height and weight The patient’s height in centimeters (cm) and body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram [kg] in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be measured. Refer to Table 6 -1for the assessment schedule. 6.5.4 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for analy sis of all specimens collected. Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1 . 6.5.4.1 Hematology Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet count will be measured. 6.5.4.2 Clinical chemistry Urea (or BUN), creatinine, glucose, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutam yl transpeptidase, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, bicarbonate, phosphate, total protein, albumin , and uric acid will be measured. Based on serum creatinine values, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be calculated using the MDRD ( Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ) criteria. 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis Measurement sfor specific gravit y, protein (prote inuria at all visits ,urine albumin -creatinine ratio and urine protein- creatinine ratio at baseline and when renal alert criteria are met), glucose (glycosuria) , and blood (hematuria) in urine will beperformed . White blood cell and red blood cell sediments will also be measured. 6.5.5 Post -inhalation events Events occurring within 5 minutes after inhalation of the study treatment (post -inhalation events) will be observed at the site by site personnel at Visits 101, 102, 1 03, 104, 1 05 and 106. The ISC sho uld supervise the study treatment inhalation by the patients whether an event occurred or not. If the event is determined to be an adverse event, this should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF. In addition, event details will also be captured in the Post-inhalation Adverse Event CRF. For post-inhalation events that are determined not to be an adverse event, event details will be recorded in the Post -inhalation clinical events CRF. If a patient prematurel y discontinues study drug, airway reactivity should be assessed at the treatment discontinuation (TD) visit provided the patient agrees to inhale study medication during the visit."
59,page_59,"Novartis Confidential Page 60 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 6.5.6 Bronchia l hyperreactivity Bronchial hyperreactivity will be measured as the acute relative change from pre-dose to 30±15 minu tes post-dose in FEV 1% predicted at Visits 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106. A change of 20% or more is considered a clinically significant indicati onof bronchospasm/ bronchial h yperreactivity. It is at the investigators discretion to initiate treatment with a bronchodilator prior to inhalation of study treatment or to consider discontinuation of study treatment in the case that bronchial h yperreactivity is experienced. If a patient prematurel y discontinues study drug, airway reactivity should be assessed at the treatment discontinuation (TD) visit provided the patient agrees to inhale study medication during the visit. 6.5.7 Audiology The patient should be questioned at each visit about the occurrence of any hearing abnormalities. If any such change is suspected by the patient, the investigator should have the case assessed and followed up by an audiologist, regardless of whether or not the site participates in theaudiology sub-study . Audiological assessments will be conducted at selected stud y sites at Visits 2, 103, 104, 105, 106 (or discontinuation visit) andalso at follow - up visits 201 and 202 , as relevant . For patients whose audiology is normal up to and including the end of the treatment epoch (Visit 106) , there is no need for additional audiology at Visits 201 and 202. If theaudiology is abnormal at any visit, itshould be repeated at all following visits including the end of study visit. Patients will have auditory acuity measured using a standard dual-channel audiometer at frequencies from 250 Hz to 8 kHz. Measurements of interoctaves are not necessary . An audiogram (pure -tone air conduction) and tympanogram will be performed by an audiologist. Bone conduction will be performed if the air conduction show s a decrease of 20 dB from the patient’s pre-dose measurements in either ear. Novartis and the investigator must be notified within 5 working days if a 20dB drop versus as compared to the most recent pre-dose value (either screening or baseline) is noted in either ear. In this case, the patient will be withdrawn from treatment and monitored until auditory acuity values return to baseline or until the follow -up visit, whichever occurs first. Only at the baseline visit (Visit 2), the audiology assessment must be performed prior to dosing. At the following visits, audiology can be performed within 3 day s before or after the assigned visit. 6.5.8 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility All female patients after the onset of menarche who are not surgicall y sterile will have a serum pregnancy test performed by the central laboratory from the blood sample taken for safet y laboratory examination at Visits 1 and 106. Additionally , a urine pregnancy test will be done at Visits 2 and 202. A positive serum pregnancy test at Visit 1 leads to the exclusion of the patient from the study prior to the start of study treatment administration. In case of a positive urine pregnancy test at Visit 2, the patient must not commence inhalation of study medication. In these cases, a serum pregnancy test must be performed and the results awaited to verify the pregnancy . If a serum pregnancy test is determined to be positive, the patient"
60,page_60,"Novartis Confidential Page 61 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 must be discontinued from the trial. In case of positive test results, the pregnancy must be followed up until after birth. 6.5.9 Adverse events of special interest Certain events have been identified in the TIP AE profile for cystic fibrosis which will have a more detailed assessment. If an adverse event regarding ototoxicity and/or hemopty sis is reported, specific data which may includ esymptoms , medical history and relevant local assessment will be collected by using a specific CRF . 6.5.10 Hospitalizations for respiratory -related adverse eve nts Hospitalizations for respiratory -related adverse events will be recorded on a specific CRF. The rate and duration of hospitalization due to serious respiratory -related AEs will be determined ,based on the information collected in the CRF. 6.5.11 Appropriateness of safety measurements The use of systemic aminogly cosides in humans has been related to eighth cranial nerve impairment ( Guthrie 2008 ) manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicit y. The audiological assessment (Section 6.5.7) and questioning the patient at each visit for hearing abnormalities have been included in this study to closel y monitor the hearing ability of patients exposed to TIP. Renal function is survey ed by clinical chemistry assessments as nephrotoxic effects have been reported from systemic aminogl ycosides (Martinez -Saldago et al 2007). All other safety assessments selected are standard for the indication BE and this patient population. 6.6 Other assessments 6.6.1 Resource utilization At each scheduled and unscheduled visit, respiratory healthcare resource utilization for hospitalizations will be assessed and recorded on the appropriate CRF. Hospitalization will be defined as any visit to the hospital requiring an overnight stay. The total length of stay including date of admi ssion and discharge will be recorded for respiratory -related in-patient hospitalizations. Any procedures performed during the hospitalization will be recorded in the appropriate CRF. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed then the physician must record the events as per instructions given in the protocol. 6.6.2 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic properties of tobramy cin from different doses of TIP o.d. and b.i.d. will be assessed at Visits 101, 102 and 104. It is expected that few patients will be able to expectorate spont aneously multiple sputum samples at a given visit. As patients are required to provide pre-dose sputum samples for microbiology assessment (primary endpoint), for the PK sputum specimens a ll patients will be requested to provide specimen sof sputum post-dose per specified interval, at Visits 101 (0- 1"
61,page_61,"Novartis Confidential Page 62 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 h and 1-2 h post-dose measured time interval from the completion of study drug administration) ,atVisit 102 (5-6 h) and Visit 104 (3 -4h). Sputum samples for tobramy cin concentration testing must be at least 200 mg in weight (0.2 ml in volume) and must not be saliva. In patients who are not able to spontaneously produce sputum, one specimen of induced sputum post-dose per specified interval will be collected. No induced sputum sample for PK will be collected at baseline in patients who had induced sputum pre-dose for microbiology assessments. All patients will also provide serum specimens at Visits 101 and 102 (one specimen per specified interval): 0-1 hours, 1-2 hours, post-dose (measured time interval from the completion of study drug administration). To evaluate serum PK in approximately 16 patients on active treatment , at least 20 -22 patients from each cohort (at least 60 total patien ts) will participate in a PK sub- study . All patients will be asked to participate in the sub -study until enrollment is fulfilled for each cohort. Patients in thisPK subset (20-22 patients/ cohort) will instead provide one serum specimen per specified interval at Visits 101 and 10 2:pre-dose andpost-dose 0-1, 1-2, 3- 4 and 5 -6 h. If there is more than one serum or sputum sample to be collected per visit, there has to be a minimum of one hour difference between consecutive sampling points. Samples will be obtained from a peripheral site by phlebotom y or through a temporary i.v. site, but not through an existing central access or catheter. If a patient discontinues earlyand is on study drug, the patient will be asked to provide an extra serum and sputum spe cimen at the treatment discontinuation (TD) visit. A separate laboratory manual will be provided with instruction s on tube labeling, sample collection, processing, storage conditions and shipping of specimens. The time of sputum and blood collection is tobe recorded (e.g. actual time of dosing and actual times of sputum/ blood collection have to be recorded on the PKsputum andblood collection CRF page s)."

63,page_63,"Novartis Confidential Page 64 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 6.6.5 Patient diaries All patients will be provided with an electronic Patient Diary to record dosing of study treatment (number of inhaled capsules every morning and evening during the treatment epoch ). 7 Safety monitoring 7.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], sy mptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce c linical signs or sy mptoms, they are considered clinically significant, they require therapy . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse ev ents. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 . Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events CRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied b y the following information: the severit y grade mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities its relationship to the study treatment (no/ yes) its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported."
64,page_64,"Novartis Confidential Page 65 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 whether it constitutes a s erious adverse event (SAE – See Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) action taken regarding study treatment All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken ( e.g. furth er observation only ) study treatment dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted study treatment permanently discontinued due to this adverse event concomitant medication given non-drug therap y given patient hospitalized/patient’s hospitalization prolonge d (see Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown) Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessary ) of any changes in severity , the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventio ns required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient. The investigator must also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported t o Novartis. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing )] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: is fat al or life -threatening results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect"
65,page_65,"Novartis Confidential Page 66 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of bronchiectasis, not associated with any deterioration in patient’s condition ( e.g. preplanned prophy lactic i.v. a ntibio tic therap y ) elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission social reasons and res pite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothe tically might have caused death if it were more severe (see Annex I V, ICH-E2D Guideline). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the last study visitmust be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 d ay period after the last study visit should only be reported to Novartis if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All follow -up informat ion for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow -up information) is collected and recorded on the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form. The investigator must assess the relationship to each specific component of study treatment , complete the SAE Report Form in"
66,page_66,"Novartis Confidential Page 67 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 English, and send the completed, signed form by fax within 24 hours after awareness of the SAE to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. The telephone and fax number of the contact persons in the local department of Drug Safety and Epidemiology , specific to the site, are listed in the inves tigator folder provided to each site. The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the case report form documentation at the study site. Follow -up information should be provided using a new paper SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow- up to a previousl y reported SAE . Follow -up information provided must describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the treatment code was broken or not and whether the patient contin ued or withdrew from study participation. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Broch ure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further informa tion from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the compet ent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 7.3 Liver safet y monitoring Tobram ycin is not metabolized in the liver and therefore a hepatotoxicity effect is not expected following exposure to TIP.Standard serum chemistry , including liver enzy mes,will be monitored during the study . 7.4 Renal safety monitoring The following two categories of abnormal renal laboratory values have to be considered during the course of the study : Serum renal event: confirmed (after ≥24h) increase in serum creatinine of 25 –<50% compared to baseline during normal hydration status acute kidney injury : confirmed serum creatinine increase ≥ 50% compared to baseline Urine renal event confirmed new onset ( ≥3+) proteinuria confirmed new onset ( ≥3+)hematuria Every renal laboratory trigger or renal event occurring after randomization as defined in Table 14-1 in Appendix 2should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site as summarized in Appendix 2 ."
67,page_67,"Novartis Confidential Page 68 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situa tions where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or psychological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in the DAR (dose administration record) CRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associa ted with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safety database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE.

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. 8 Data revie w and database management 8.1 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Novartis or CRO representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis and CRO employ several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to"
68,page_68,"Novartis Confidential Page 69 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the (e)CRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. Novartis or CRO monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence t o the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. 8.2 Data collection Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the CRFs using fully validated software that conforms to US CFR 21 Part 11 requirements. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC sy stem until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before transfer of the data to the CRO working on behalf of Novartis. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the CRFs are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database management and quality control Novartis staff (or CRO working on behalf of Novartis) review the data entered into the CRFs by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or additions. Queries are sent to the invest igational site using an electronic data query . Designated investigator site staff is required to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. If the electronic query system is not used, a paper Data Query Form will be faxed to the site. Site perso nnel will complete and sign the faxed copy and fax it back to Novartis staff that will make the correction to the database. The signed copy of the Data Query Form is kept at the investigator site. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non-drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) ter minology ."
69,page_69,"Novartis Confidential Page 70 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Patients/subjects will fill in their PRO data via a handheld electronic device or an electronic site based tablet . The system will be supplied by a vendor(s), who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronicall y to Novartis personnel (or designated CRO). Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient and all dosage chan ges will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data Monitoring Committee An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will be set-up to review AE / SAE data and provide the Sponsor with guidance on safet y issues. SAEs will be reviewed on a regular basis. The DMC will also perform a pre-planned review of AE and additional pre -defined safet y data as described in the DMC charter . The membership of the DMC and the responsibilities of the DMC and Novartis will be defined in a separate ‘DMC Charter’ document. The DMC Charter will include information about data flow, purpose and timings of DMC meetings, communication strategy , procedures for ensuring confidentiality , procedures to address conflicts of interest and statistical monitoring guidelines. 8.5 Adjudication Committee Not required."
70,page_70,"Novartis Confidential Page 71 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 9 Data analy sis The study is characterized by 3 cohorts. Each of them consists of TIP, TIP/placebo cy clical, or placebo in a ratio of 2:2:1 for blinding purposes. For the efficacy analysis the placebo patients will be pooled from the three cohorts. For the safety anal ysis, pl acebo patients across the three cohorts will not be pooled. Data will be summarized and analy zed by treatment groups. 9.1 Analysis sets The full anal ysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they are assigned to at randomization, which may be different from the actual treatment received. Patients who are mistakenly randomized or who have not taken double blind study drug will be excluded from the FAS . The per-protocol set (PPS) population will include all patients in the FAS without any major protocol deviations. The safet y set is defined as patients who received at least one dose of study drug. In all safet y analyses patients will be anal yzed according to the actual treatment received. The analy sis of the primary objective will be performed on the FAS. The PPS will be used for the supportive analysis of the primary variable. The FAS will also be used for the analysis of all other efficacy variables. The safet y set will be used in the anal ysis of all safet y variables. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Descriptive statistics for patient demographics data including age, weight, height, gender, and other baseline characteristics will be provided to describe the study population both for overall population and by treatment groups. Categorical variables will be summarized with the number and percentage of patients in each category . Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics including number of patients, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. 9.3 Treatments The prescribed dosing regimens are two o.d. (3, and 5 capsules per day) and one b.i.d. (4 capsules twice per day) for TIP, TIP/placebo cyclical and placebo. Descriptive statistics will be provided by treatment group for the duration of treatment and the percent compliance to study drug by treatment groups. The reasons for dose changes and interruptions will be tabulated with number and percentage. The number and percentage of patients taking concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment and by ATC classes and preferred terms. Each concomitant medication could be classified by more than one ATC class and will be counted for each. Summary tables will be created for concomitant medications started prior to study drug, started on or after start of study drug a nd for non- CF BE related medications started on or after start of study drug. Duration of exposure (days) will defined as end date of study medication in on-treatment phase minus start date of study medication in on-treatment phase plus 1 day. The total"
71,page_71,"Novartis Confidential Page 72 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 duration of exposure in the TI P/placebo cy clical arm will be the sum of duration from the two treatment cycles. The duration of exposure will be presented with standard descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median and maximum) and with number and percentage for pre -defined categories ( ≤28 day s, 29 -56 day s, 57 -84 day s, 85- 112 day s and ≥113 day s. Discontinuations of study (yes/no) will be summarized with number and percentage of patients by treatment groups. Treatment compliance with study medication ov er the study period will be summarized. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s) The anal ysis of the primary efficacy variable will be based on the FAS. 9.4.1 Variable(s) The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in the bacterial load in sputum as assessed by the change in log10 colon y forming units (CFUs) of P. aeruginosa from baseline to Day 29 of treatment . Baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dos e of blinded study medication. 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis The comparisons of TIP 3 capsules o.d, 5 capsules OD, and 4 capsules b.i.d versus placebo will be evaluated by testing the following null hypothesis (H0) versus the alternative hypothesis (Ha): H0: TI P treatment group is equal to placebo group in bacte rial load in sputum at Day 29 Ha: TI P treatment group is not equal to placebo group in bacterial load in sputum at Day 29 The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will contain treatment, baseline CFU, and baseline macrolide use. Pairwise comparisons of TIP dosing groups will be conducted versus placebo. Tocontrol the famil y- wise type-I error rate(three dose levels vs. placebo) at the two-sided 5% significance level , the step -wise Dunnett pro cedure will be used. For the primary efficacy analysis, patients from treatment arms TIP and TIP/placebo cyclical regimen will be pooled for each cohort. This is possible because all patients within the same cohort on the TIP treatment arms (cyclical or continuous) are receiving the same treatment during the first 28 day s. Placebo patients will be pooled across the 3 cohorts, as the number of placebo capsules is not expected to influence the change in P. aeruginosa bacterial counts. The estimated adjusted treatment difference (TIP –placebo) will be displayed along with the associated standard error, 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI),and p-value (2- sided) . 9.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations No missing value imputation will be implemented for the primary efficacy analysis. Various imputation methods will be explored to handle missing values due to censoring or discontinuations in the sensitivity analy ses."

Details of the sensitivity analyses will be specified in the statistical analy sis plan prior to database lock. 9.4.4 Supportive analy ses The non-parametric Mann -Whitney -Wilcoxon test will be carried out as a sensitivity analysis due to the potential non -normality of the CFU data. The primary efficacy analy sis will be repeated in the PP population as a sup portive anal ysis. 9.5 Analysis of secondary variables 9.5.1 Efficacy variables For efficacy analy sis, patients assigned to placebo arms will be pooled across the 3 cohorts, as the number of placebo capsules is not expected to impact the efficacy assessments. Unless otherwise specified, the following analysis will be conducted both over the treatment epoch (through Day 113) and over the study period (through Day 169). 9.5.1.1 P. aeruginosa colony forming units (CFU) Anti -microbial efficacy of TIP versus placebo over the entire study duration, as measured by the absolute change in P. aeruginosa colon y forming units (CFU) in sputum from baseline to each post-baseline visit, other than Visit 103, will be assessed by biotype and sum of all bioty peswith the same ANCOVA mode l as specified for the primary efficacy variable. 9.5.1.2 Pulmonary exacerbation The following pulmonary exacerbation - related parameters over the treatment epoch (through Day 113) and the study period will be summarized by treatment (pulmonary exacerbation is defined inSection 6.4.4).

Items in the questionnaire are expressed either “negatively ” or “positively ,” therefore a number of items must be recorded before the scores for each of the domains are calculated. The score is calculated by adding the score obtained for each item of a domain (scale), after any necessary recoding. Scoring for each domain can be computed only if at least half the items have been completed. If not, then the domain should not be scored and should be considered missing for that particular person who filled out the questionnaire. The minimum or maximum score alway s corresponds to the highe st QOL and the minimum score alway s corresponds to the lowest QOL. Change from baseline in QOL- B Respiratory Symptom Score (RSS) will be analyzed using a linear repeated measure model. The model will contain treatment, baseline macrolide use, visit ( visits 102 to 202), and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effect swith baseline Q OL- B RSS, baseline -by-visit interaction as covariates.

Appropriate summary statistics will be provided for laboratory test results, audiology , bronchial h yperreactivity and vital signs. AEs will be deemed treatment -emergent if the onset date is on or after the date of first study drug and until study completion. Treatment emergent AEs will be summarized by MedDRA primary SOC and prefer red term for each cycle and overall. The actual MedDRA version in effect at the time of the clinical study report will be used for coding AEs. Audiology testing will beperformed at selected centers and in patients with hearing events .

Descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum will be provided for the duration of the event in seconds. Bronchial hyperreactivity will be measured as the acute relative change from pre-dose to 30±15 minutes post-dose in FEV 1% predicted at Visits 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106. A change of 20% or more is considered a clinically significant indicative of bronchospasm/ bronchial hy perreactivity. This change will be summarized with the number and percentage of patients who experienced no change, a decrease/increase of >0-<10%, a decrease/increase of 10-<20% or adecrease/increase ≥20%. Both analy ses will also be done for the patients who did the post -dose spirometry test in a 60 minutes time window . 9.5.3 Resource utilization Data relating to resource utilization will be used for the purpose of economic evaluation which will be carried out and reported as a separate activity . 9.5.4 Pharmacokinetics The serum and sputum pharmacokinetic properties of tobramy cin will be assessed by evaluating tobram ycin concentrations in serum and sputum collected from non-CF BE population post administration of o.d. or b.i.d. doses of TIP. Descriptive statistics will be provided for tobram ycin serum concentrations by scheduled visit and time of collection.

77,page_77,"Novartis Confidential Page 78 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 PK modeling of serum and sputum concentration data will be considered to characterize the population PK in BE patients. If a model can be constructed then the effect of covariates (such as age, weight, baseline creatinine clearance, CFU/g of sputum) will also be explored in describing the inter -subject variability . Exploratory exposure -response modeling of the time course of CFU data collected during the treatment period in addition to the data collected post treatment may be performed if supported by the data. The CFU modeling will explore the relationship between exposure, most likely based on the sputum PK model, and CFU reduction fr om baseline. The results of these exposure -response analyses will be combined with the results from complementary data analy ses of these same data, as well as analyses of data on other efficacy and safet y endpoints, to support dose and regimen selection. 9.6 Interim analy ses No interim analysis for efficacy is planned. It is planned that the independent DMC will review semi -blinded safety data (see Section 8.4 ). 9.7 Sample size calculation Sample size estimati on was based on a difference of 2.0 log 10CFU/g, with standard deviations of 2.0 log 10CFU/g. The assumptions were based on conservative estimates from published results (Konstan et al 2011a , Konstan et al 2011b , Barker et al 2000 , and Wilson et al 2013). As there are three primary comparisons betwe en the three doses versus placebo, the Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment has been used (0.05/3) for sample size calculation. Using α=1.67% (two-sided) and 90% power, the sample size estimation yielded n = 36 subjects per treatment group as valid for ITT analyses. This takes into account an approximate 20% - discontinuation rate. For the primary efficacy analysis, patients from TIP continuous and TIP cyclical regimen within the same cohort will be pooled as they receive exactly the same treatment during the first 28 days. Placebo patients will be pooled across the 3 cohorts, as the number of placebo capsules is not expected to influence the change in P.aeruginosa bacterial counts. With the current study design, the power is 94% to detect a reduction of 2.0 log10 CFU/g for each dose level versus placebo. For calculation of sample size, NQuery Advisor vers ion 7.0 module MTTO -1 was used. 10 Ethical considerations 10.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US CFR 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, L abor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki."

Spirometers must have the capacit y to print FVC tracings. All spirometry values should be reported at BTPS by the method established by the manufacturer. Calibration The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for the study are p erformed. Calibration reports should be printed and stored as source data at the site. Preparing the test subject On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following:"
93,page_93,"Novartis Confidential Page 94 Amended Protocol Version 0 3 (clean ) Protocol No.CTBM100G2202 Coffee, tea, chocolate, cola and other caffeine -containing beverages and foods and ice- cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry Smoking within at least 1 hour of testing Exposure to environmental smoke, dust or areas with strong odors Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study . A seated position with nose clips is recommended to reduce risks related t o dizziness or sy ncope. When possible, spirometry should be conducted by the same technician using the same spirometer. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry visits should start at approximately the same time of day at each visit. Performing Spirometry The subject’s age, height and gender will be entered into the spirometer. It is important that the height is measured accuratel y at the study site. Spirometry , an effort-dependent test, requires careful instruction andcooperation of the subject. The technician should ensure a good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the subject’s posture is correct. The subject should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, followed by maximum forced expiration until no more air can be exhaled or for at least 6 seconds. Expiration must be rapid with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability . Acceptability criteria should be applied before repeatability is determined. Number of trials A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a subject is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be discontinued. Acceptabili ty An acceptable maneuver has the following characteristics: No hesitation or false start; A rapid start; No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures No earl y termination of exhalation (minimum exhalation time of 6 seconds is recommended, or no volume change for at least 1 second) or the subject cannot continue to exhale further Repeatability The 2 largest FVC and FEV 1values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary by more than 0.150 L . Recording of data"
