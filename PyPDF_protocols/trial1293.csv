4,page_4,"Methodology: This is a Phase 3b, 2-stage, open -label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg (99 pounds) with Fabry disease and with amenable GLA variants. Subjects must be either naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or have stopped ERT at least 14 days at the time of screening. The study will consist of 2 stages. Stage 1 will be a treatment period of approximately 1 month (4 weeks); Stage 2 will be a treatment period of 11 months and a 30 -day (untreated) safety follow -up period. There will be no break in treatment between Stages 1 and 2. Prior to Stage 1, there will be a screening period lasting at least 14 days and up to 30 days (or more, if GLA genotyping is required). Stage 1 and 2 together will consist of a 12 -month treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow- up period, for a total of approximately 14 months. Subjects may have the option to enroll in a long-term extensio n study conducted under a separate protocol. Number of Subjects (planned): Approximately 20 subjects are planned globally for enrollment in this study. An attempt will be made to enroll subjects of each sex. At least 7 to 10 of these subjects will be aged 12 to < 16 years for a subgroup analysis to be conducted at the end of Stage 1. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be considered for enrollment in the study: 1. have a parent or legally -authorized representative who is willing and able to provide written informed consent and authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information or research -related health information, and subject provides assent, if applicable 2. male or female, diagnosed with Fabry disease aged between 12 and < 18 years at baseline, and who might benefit from specific treatment for their condition, in the opinion of the investigator 3. confirmed amenable GLA variant determined using the migalastat amenability assay Note: For subjects without a known amenable GLA variant, GLA genotyping must be performed prior to Visit 2.

6,page_6,"Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration: Migalastat will be supplied as capsules. Migalastat capsules contain 123 mg migalastat free base, which is equivalent to 150 mg migalastat HCl. Administration One migalastat 150 mg capsule will be administered with water every other day for 12 months. Subjects should take study drug at the same time of day during the every other day dosing schedule. Subjects will be instructed not to eat for at least 2 hours before and for 2 hours after administration of study drug. Water can be consumed during this period. During Stage 2, if a subject’s weight decreases to below 43 kg an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 to 4 weeks later in order to monitor the subject’s weight. If the subject’s weight remains below 43 kg at the follow -up visit, additional blood samples will be drawn for PK and PD (plasma lyso -Gb 3) assessments. Based on the PK results and other parameters, at the discretion of the investigator and the Amicus medical monitor, the subject may remain on study drug with additional monthly follow -up visits until his/her weight returns to at least 43 kg. Duration of Treatmen t: There will be 2 stages of treatment administration totaling approximately 12 months. Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration: There is no reference therapy for this study. Criteria for Evaluation: Safety Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, body weight and height, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, Tanner staging of sexual development, and use of concomitant medications. Safety endpoints are as follows: • incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug • changes in clinical laboratory test results from baseline over time • changes in vital signs from baseline over time • changes in physical examination findings from baseline over time • change in body weight and height from baseline over time • changes in ECG results from baseline over time • changes in echocardiogram parameters from baseline to Month 12/early termination (ET) • change in Tanner stage from baseline to Month 12/ET • use of concomitant medications Stage 1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments The schedule for sparse PK sampling is presented in the table below. All samples must be collected within a 24 -hour period following the same dose of migalastat, between Day 15 and Day 30 following initiation of migalastat treatment.

In one 24-hour period between Day 15 and Day 30 f ollowing initiation of study drug administration, each subject will have 4 PK samples collected at the times specified in the table above (relative to the last dose of study drug) according to their randomized PK sampling group assignment. b Sample should NOT be taken at the same time as the previous sample. Samples should be taken approximately 15 minutes apart at a minimum. In the event that follow -up PK assessments are required, at each follow-up visit additional sparse PK samples will be drawn at 4 time intervals according to the sampling group to which the subject was initially assigned. Stage 2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments Single blood samples for analysis of plasma migalastat concentration will be collected at the Month 6 and Month 12/ET study visits, at the same time that samples are collected for clinical laboratory tests, ie, trough sample taken prior to migalastat administration. Pharmacokinetic endpoints are as follows: • population PK model that describes the relationship between weight and age and migalastat pharmacokinetics in pediatric subjects (with primary PK parameter outputs listed in the following text) • PK parameters based on simulated plasma-concentration data for migalastat after multiple -dose administration at steady -state concentration − Cmax: maximum observed plasma concentration − Cmin: minimum observed plasma concentration − tmax: time to reach C max − AUC 0-τ: area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 over the dosing interval (ie, 48 hours) − t½: terminal elimination half -life − CL ss/F: apparent oral clearance at steady -state concentration − Vss/F: apparent oral volume of distribution at steady -state concentration Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 8 of 70"
8,page_8,"Pharmacodynamic Assessments The pharmacodynamic biomarker to be evaluated in this study is lyso-Gb 3 levels in plasma. Blo od samples will also be collected for exploratory biomarkers. The pharmacodynamic endpoint is change in plasma levels of lyso -Gb 3 from baseline to Months 3, 6, and 12/ET. Efficacy Assessments Efficacy assessments include eGFR, urine protein and albumin levels, LVMi and other cardiac parameters using echocardiograms, and subject questionnaires (electronic diary [e-diary] for gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and pain [Short Fabry Disease Patient-Reported Outcome – Gastrointestinal Signs and Symptoms (FABPRO- GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (24 -hour version)], Patient Global Impression of Change [PGI -C], Fabry -Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire [FPHPQ], and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ [PedsQL™]). Efficacy endpoints are as follows: • change in eGFR from baseline to Months 1, 3, 6, and 12/ET • change in urine protein and albumin levels from baseline to Months 3, 6, and 12/ET • change in LVMi and other echocardiogram parameters from baseline to Month 12/ET • change in gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and pain from baseline to Month 12/ET, as measured by e -diary responses ( FABPRO -GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [24-hour version] ) • mean PGI -C values at Mont hs 3, 6, and 12/ET • change in FPHPQ scores from baseline to M onth 12/ET • change in PedsQL scores from baseline to Month 12/ET Statistical Methods: The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. All safety and pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed using the safety pop ulation. The Stage 1PK population will include all subjects who have a complete set of sparse PK samples from the single day of collection at steady -state during Days 15 to 30 of Stage 1. There will be 2 interim PK analyses. One will be performed using the entire Stage 1 PK population of adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years. A second interim analysis will include a subpopulation of at least 7 to 10 subjects age 12 to less than 16 years. The final PK population will include all subjects with at least one quantifiable concentration and a known weight and eGFR. All final PK analyses will be performed using the final PK population. The intent-to -treat population will include all enrolled subjects. All efficacy analyses will be performed using intent -to-treat popul ation. Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarized by number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Discrete variables will be summarized by counts and percentages. In general, data will be summarized by sex and combined across all subjects. For the population PK analysis, predicted median (2.5 th and 97.5th percentile) concentration -time data based on a previously established population PK model will be visually compared with observed concentration -time data for all subjects and for the subgroup aged 12 to < 16 years at the end of Stage 1.

9,page_9,"Sample Size: A sample size of at least 7 to 10 subjects per age/weight group is required for statistical comparison with adult exposure based on 2 methods described by Wang, Jadhav et al. 2012. First, assuming the final plasma clearance estimates and inter -individual variability of 28.5% (Migalastat Abbreviated Report of the Simulations of Migalastat in Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease, 16 October 2016), 7 subjects is adequate to achieve at least 80% power for a study design with rich PK sampling intended for non- compartmental analysis. Second, according to the sample size calculation for a study with sparse/rich PK sampling intended for population PK analysis, ( 𝑒𝑒−𝑡𝑡(0.975 ,𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)×𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡(0.975 ,𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑)×𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) should be within the pre -defined criteria of (0.6, 1.4), where SELCL is the standard error for log -transformed pediatric clearance that relates to weight, and t (0.975, df) is the 97.5% upper quantile values from t distribution corresponding to the sample size. Mathematically, SELCL was approximately equal to the relative standard error of untransformed clearance, 0.16. Therefore, a sample size of approximately 10 subjects is adequate t o achieve the pre-defined boundary of (0.6, 1.4).

17,page_17,"5. INTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONALE 5.1. Fabry Disease Fabry disease is a rare, progressive and devastating X -linked lysosomal storage disorder affecting males and females, with an estimated prevalence of 1:117,000 up to 1:40,000 ( Desnick and Schindler 2001; Germain 2010; Meikle, Hopwood et al. 1999 ; Eurordis 2005). Newborn screening studies have identified a higher incidence of variants in GLA , the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme, α -galactosidase A (α- Gal A) ( Spada , Pagliardini et al. 2006; Mechtler , Stary et al. 2012), although the impact of these findings on disease prevalence has not been established. Disease-causing variants in the GLA gene result in a deficiency of α -Gal A, which is required for glycosphingolipid metabolism ( Brady , Gal et al. 1967). Beginning early in life, the reduction in α -Gal A activity results in an accumulation of glycosphingolipids, including globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and plasma globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso- Gb3), and leads to the symptoms and life-limiting sequelae of Fabry disease, which include pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular events, and early mortality (Germain 2010). Ea rly initiation of therapy and lifelong treatment may provide an opportunity to slow disease progression and prolong life expectancy. Fabry disease encompasses a spectrum of disease severity and age of onset, although it has traditionally been divided into 2 main p henotypes, “classic” and “late- onset” ( Desnick , Ioannou et al. 2001 ; Filoni, Caciotti et al. 2010; Topaloglu, Ashley et al. 1999; Shabbeer , Yasuda et al. 2002; Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 2006 ; Ishii , Chang et al. 2007 ). The classic phenotype has been ascribed primarily to males with undetectable to low α -Gal A activity and is associated with earlier onset of renal, cardiac, and/or cerebrovascular manifestations. The late -onset phenotype has been ascribed primarily to males and females with higher residual α -Gal A activi ty and is associated with later onset of disease. Heterozygous female carriers typically express the late-onset phenotype, but may also display the classic phenotype depending on the pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. More than 1000 Fabry disease- causin g GLA variants have been identified (data on file). Approximately 67% are missense variants, resulting in single amino acid substitutions in the α-Gal A enzyme (Germain 2010; Gal , Schäfer et al. 2006). Missense GLA variants often result in the production of abnormally folded and unstable forms of α -Gal A (Fan, Ishii et al. 1999; Ishii , Chang et al. 2007) and the majority are associated with the classic phenotype ( Filoni, Caciotti et al. 2010 ; Topaloglu, Ashley et al. 1999; Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 2002 ; Shabbeer , Yasuda et al. 2006; Ishii , Chang et al. 2007). Normal cellular quality control mechanisms in the endoplasmic reticulum block the transit of these abnormal proteins to lysosomes and target them for premature degradation and eliminati on. Many missense mutant forms are targets for migalastat, an α-Gal A-specific pharmacological chaperone ( Yam , Zuber et al. 2005; Yam , Bosshard et al. 2006; Benjamin , Flanagan et al. 2009). Note: In the Migalastat Clinical Development Program, all subjects were previously, and continue to be, required to have a GLA variant that is amenable to migalastat treatment. Historically in Amicus Therapeutics (Amicus) documents, these variants were referred to as “mutations”. Mutation will be referred to as “variant” in all new or revised Amicus-sponsored protocols, consistent with the guidelines of the American Medical College of Genetics and Genomics.

18,page_18,"5.2. Migalastat Migalastat (also known as AT1001), a low molecular weight iminosugar, is an analogue of the terminal galactose of GL -3/lyso- Gb3. Nonclinical in vitro and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that migalastat acts as a pharmacological chaperone, selectively and reversibly binding with high affinity to the active site of wild -type α -Gal A and specific mutant forms of α -Gal A ( Ishii, Chang et al. 2007), the genotypes of which are referred to as amenable variants. Migalastat is a precis ion medicine targeted specifically to patients with Fabry disease who express specific mutant variants of the GLA gene that can be functionally restored by migalastat. Migalastat binding stabilizes these mutant forms of α -Gal A in the endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating their proper trafficking to lysosomes where dissociation of migalastat allows the now active α -Gal A to reduce the level of GL -3 and other substrate s (Yam , Zuber et al. 2005 ; Yam , Bossha rd et al. 2006; Benjamin , Flanagan et al. 2009 ). The Migalastat Amenability Assay, which is compliant with Good Laboratory Practices and has been clinically validated, was developed to identify patients with variants amen able to treatment with migalastat. Amenable variants are those that translate to mutant forms of the enzyme and that show a relative increase in enzyme activity that is ≥ 1.20 -fold above the baseline value and an absolute increase of ≥ 3.0% of wild-type at a threshold of 10 μM migalastat in the Migalastat Amenability Assay (Benjamin , Della Valle et al. 2017). Approximately 35% to 50% of patients with Fabry disease are currently estimated to have amenable variants, the majori ty of which are associated with the classic phenotype of the disease ( Benjamin , Flanagan et al. 2009 ; Filoni, Caciotti et al. 2010; Germain , Shabbeer et al. 2002; Shabbeer, Yasuda et al. 2006). 5.3. Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Safety Data 5.3.1. Nonclinical Data Available results from single -dose and repeat -dose nonclinical studies with migalastat having a wide margin of safety (ie, with doses that were ≥ 25-fold higher than those used in clinical studies) suggest no specific hazard regarding chronic toxicity to humans, based on values for area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC), with the exception of possible transient, fully reversible male infertility. In addition, a 39 -week toxicity study in juvenile monkeys did not demonstrate a concern for toxicity, suggesting that migalastat does not induce adverse effects in the developing organ systems evaluated in that study. In nonclinical studies using hR301Q α -Gal A Tg/knockout mice, a 30-mg/kg dose of migalastat was found to be optimal (AUC, 18400 ng•hr/mL; Study RR1001-08); at this dose, significant increases in α-Gal A activity and GL- 3 substrate reduction were demonstrated across all tissues. At higher doses, no further improvements were observed. Nonclinical studies also demonstrated that greater GL -3 reductions were observed with a regimen less frequent than daily administration, including every-other- day administration. In regard to safety, the pivotal chronic dosing studies utilized rats and monkeys of approximately 6 weeks and 21 to 27 months of age, respectively, at the initiation of dosing. Developmentally, this corresponds to a human of approximately 12 years of age with respect to the rat, and less than 12 years of age with respect to the monkey ( Beck 2006).

19,page_19,"T he main finding identified with migalastat in nonclinical studies was reversible infertility in male rats. Full fertility returned to the previously migalastat- treated animals after a 4 week washout period, a period of less than a full spermatogenic cycle (> 2 months). No effects on sperm count, morphology, or motility were detected to account for the reduction in male fertility. These observations with migalastat, and the published information on other iminosugars including miglustat, strongly suggest that the infertility is due to effects on sperm maturation or function ( Zavesca Prescribing Information 2017 ). Numerous studies indicate that these effects are related to sexual maturation processes that only occur after puberty, and not an adverse effect on testicular spermatogenesis. There is no indication of adverse effects on the germinal epithelium or testicular spermatogenesis that would be of particular concern for the proposed pediatric use of migalastat. There were also no effects on sperm motility, count or morphology in rats, and no changes in organ weights or pathology in the testes or accessory sex organs reported in rats, mice or monkeys. In addition, there were also no observations suggesting that the reproductive effects may be mediated by endocrine disruption which also would be of importance in developing animals and relevant for the proposed use in young people. Based on these findings, the fertility effects are not considered to pose any increased risk to pediatric patients compared to adults. In addition, a 39-week toxicity study in juvenile monkeys did not demonstrate adverse effects in the developing organ systems evaluated in that study. 5.3.2. Clinical Data Clinical data for migalastat are available for healthy adults, and adolescents (16 to < 18 years of age) and adult patients with Fabry disease. 5.3.2.1. Pharmacology In adult subjects with Fabry di sease and amenable variants, the dose and regimen of migalastat were selected to obtain the optimal balance between migalastat concentration and its subsequent clearance, in order to maximize in situ α -Gal A activity and GL -3 substrate reduction. Dose selection was based on findings from nonclinical and clinical studies. Exposure observed following a single oral dose of migalastat hydrochloride (HCl) 150 mg in humans (AUC, 13521 ng•hr/mL) was similar to that observed after a 30 -mg/kg dose in mice (see Secti on 5.3.1 ). In a Phase 1 repeat -dose study in healthy subjects, greater increases in wild -type α -Gal A activity levels were observed in white blood cells (WBCs) after oral administration of migalastat HCl 150 mg twice daily (BID) for 7 days as compared to that seen af ter 50 mg BID. In five Phase 2 studies, ranges of regimens and doses were explored in 27 subjects (18 males and 9 females): BID (25, 100, 250 mg), once daily (50 mg), every other day (50, 150, 250 mg), and 3 days on/4 days off (250, 500 mg). In these studies, migalastat HCl 150 mg every other day (QOD) resulted in the best balance of substrate (ie, urine GL-3) reduction and safety in subjects with amenable variants compared with other doses and regimens. Treatment with 150 mg QOD also resulted in decreases in kidney interstitial capillary GL -3 levels and was associated with long-term stability of renal function. In Study FAB- CL-205, when subjects were switched from 150 mg QOD to higher, less frequent doses (250/500 mg 3 days on/4 days off), no further increa ses in WBC α-Gal A activity or reductions in urine GL- 3 levels were observed. Additionally, a higher incidence of treatment- related adverse events (AEs) was observed at the 250- and 500- mg dose levels. On the basis of these collective data, 150 mg every other day was Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 20 of 70"
20,page_20,"s elected as the dose and regimen for Phase 3 studies of migalastat in adults (ie, ≥ 16 years of age). Migalastat is to be taken 2 hours before and 2 hours after a meal based on 2 food- effect studies (Study FAB- CL-103 and AT1001-016), which demonstrated that food reduces the bioavailability of migalastat as assessed using area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC 0-∞), maximum observed plasma concentration (C max), and time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (t max) (Johnson, Mudd et al. 2015). Details of these studies are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 5.3.2.2. Safety Migalastat has a favorable safety profile in adults based on results from a comprehensive development program. A total of 386 adult and adolescent (≥ 16 years of age) subjects have been exposed to migalastat in Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies conducted globally. The extent of exposure to migalastat among subjects with Fabry diseas e in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies is approximately 595.2 patient -years, with the longest subject exposure being 11.2 years as of 17 March 2017. No treatment -related deaths have been reported in clinical studies, and most serious adverse events (SAEs) were n ot considered treatment -related. In Phase 1 studies, the most frequently reported adverse event (AE) was headache. In completed Phase 2 studies in subjects with Fabry disease (Study FAB- CL-201 through Study FAB- CL-204), the most frequently reported AEs were headache, arthralgia, diarrhea, and nausea. In completed Phase 3 studies in subjects with Fabry disease (Study AT1001-011, Study AT1001-012, and Study AT1001- 041), the most frequently reported AEs were diarrhea, headache, arthralgia, pain in extremity, nausea, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, dizziness, and influenza, though the order by frequency was not necessarily the same in all 3 studies. 5.3.2.3. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters for migalastat from single -dose studies are summarized in Table 2. Migalastat had a moderate rate of absorption reaching C max in approximately 3 hours (t max) after oral administration over the dose range of 25 to 2000 mg. Mean C max and AUC 0–∞ values increased in a dose-proportional manner following oral doses from 75 to 1250 mg migalastat. The mean elimination half- lives (t ½) ranged from 3.0 to 4.8 hours.

Study Rationale This is a Phase 3b, 2 stage, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age with Fabry disease and amenable GLA variants. The youngest pediatric subjects included in previous studies with migalastat were 16 years of age. Early signs and symptoms of Fabry disease tend to manifest during childhood and adolescent years (ie, < 18 years), particularly in males with the classic phenotype, and are followed later in life by the development of overt kidney, cardiovascular, and central nervous system complications. In the 2 largest disease registries, the Fabry Outcome Survey and the Fabry Registry (Ramaswami , Whybra et al. 2006; Hopkin, Bissler et al. 2008 ), the me dian age of symptom onset is reported to be approximately 6 years in boys and 8 to 9 years in girls. Diagnosis is often delayed due to the different manifestations of the disease, its relative rarity, and the lack of clinical awareness of the condition, making the median age of diagnosis approximately 9 years in boys and 9 to 13 years in girls. Data from these Fabry disease registries indicate that the most common symptom among pediatric subjects was neuropathic pain (eg, episodic pain crises, chronic pain, and acroparesthesia), which was reported more frequently by boys than by girls (58.8% versus 40.5%), and with an earlier age of onset (7 vs 9 years). The gastrointestinal tract was the second most commonly involved organ system with 18% of children experiencing signs and symptoms (eg, abdominal pain and diarrhea); the median age at onset of symptoms was 5 years in boys and 9.5 years in girls. The next most common sign was skin findings such as angiokeratomas. As with neuropathic pain, these symptoms and signs were more prevalent in boys than girls and occurred at an earlier age of onset. Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 22 of 70"
22,page_22,"R enal involvement appears less commonly in the younger population; however, a limited number of older adolescents have been reported to have impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR), proteinuria, and hyperfiltration, along with cardiac abnormalities, pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Considering the young age of symptom onset, diagnosis, and the progressive nature of Fabry disease, early intervention and treatment for pediatric patients could be important in slowing the progression of this disease ( Hopkin, Jefferies et al. 2016). 5.5. Dose Selection The dose regimen of migalastat HCl proposed for evaluation in pediatric subjects aged 12 to < 18 years with Fabry disease is the same as the adult dose and is supported by simulation results from a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model derived using data from adults, based on body weight (Migalastat Abbreviated Report of the Simulations of Migalastat in Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease, 20 October 2016). The proposed dose is 150 mg every other day for subjects aged 12 to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 45 kg (99 pounds). 5.6. Justification for Proposed Dose and Regimen in Pediatric Subjects with Fabry Disease Migalastat has not been studied in pediatric subjects under 16 years of age. Although adolescent subjects with Fabry disease 16 to < 18 years of age were included in Phase 3 studies, the number of adolescent subjects included in those studies was limited . Therefore, simulations have been performed (100 subjects per age group) to select doses that match exposure in pediatric patients to exposure observed in adults receiving migalastat HCl 150 mg QOD. Area under the plasma concentration -time curve over the dosing interval (AUC 0-τ) at steady -state concentration was selected as the target parameter for dose selection in pediatric subjects because existing safety and tolerability data in adults suggest that increased risk is not expected with increases in C max and that changes in minimum observed plasma concentration (C min) are not likely to affect efficacy given there is likely an indirect relationship between plasma concentrations and efficacy. The aim is to achieve AUC values in pediatric subjects that are si milar to those in adults with Fabry disease and with normal renal function who were receiving migalastat HCl 150 mg every other day. The largest biological factor affecting migalastat plasma clearance (CL/F) is renal function. While many adult patients with Fabry disease have reduced renal function (15% and 42% of subjects in Study AT1001-011 with moderate or mild renal impairment, respectively, based on estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]), pediatric patients with Fabry disease have relatively high values for eGFR (mean, 147 mL/min/1.73 m 2) (Hopkin, Bissler et al. 2008). Body weight also explains variability in the pharmacokinetics of migalastat in individuals < 70 kg, with effects on CL/F, volume of distribution in the central compartment (V2/F), volume of distribution in the peripheral compartment (V3/F), and distribution clearance (Q/F). These effects were incorporated into the dose rationale simulations for pediatric subjects by using the range of weights from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention weight chart (data on file). Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 23 of 70"
23,page_23,"L astly, there is a very small change in CL/F (15%) and V2/F (31%) in the presence of Fabry disease. This effect was accounted for in the simulations, even though these differences result in exposures that are similar to those reported for healthy subjects.

Study Design This is a Phase 3b, 2 -stage, open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of migalastat treatment in pediatric subjects 12 to < 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 45 kg (99 pounds) with Fabry disease and with amenable GLA variants. Subjects must be either naïve to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) or have stopped ERT at least 14 days at the time of screening. The study will consist of 2 stages. Stage 1 will be a treatment period of approximately 1 month (4 weeks); Stage 2 will be a treatment period of 11 months and a 30-day (untreat ed) safety follow-up period. There will be no break in treatment between Stages 1 and 2. Prior to Stage 1, there will be a screening period lasting at least 14 days and up to 30 days (or more, if GLA genotyping is required). Stage 1 and 2 together will consist of a 12-month treatment period, and a 30-day safety follow-up period, for a total of approximately 14 months. Subjects may have the option to enroll in a long-term extension study conducted under a separate protocol. At screening, all subjects first m ust have a blood test to confirm their GLA variant prior to completing any additional screening assessments. Subjects with a documented variant (ie, those who have a full genotype report) that is known to be amenable to migalastat may continue to be screen ed according to the procedures outlined for Visit 1. For subjects without a known GLA variant, screening will resume after receipt of the variant result, if amenability is confirmed. For subjects with a GLA variant that has not yet been tested in the Migal astat Amenability Assay, amenability testing also will be performed. If variants are determined to be amenable according to the Migalastat Amenability Assay, screening procedures will resume at that time. If the variant is non -amenable, the subject will be considered a screen failure. (Note: the Migalastat Amenability Assay may take up to 8 weeks.) The study design is displayed in Figure 1. Figure 1: Study Design -30 to -14 Days 1 Month (4 weeks) 11 Months 30 Days Screening: Stage 1: Safety/PK Stage 2: Safety/PD/Efficacy Follow- up: Safety Genotyping A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will operate according to a charter that includes operational and logistical procedures for the DMC. The DMC will monitor and evaluate all available safety data from this study by reviewing summaries of safety data on a regular basis, evaluating risk/benefit where possible, identifying any clinically relevant trends through the study, and assessing whether it is safe for the subject and/or study to continue. Safety assessments include monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, body weight and height, 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, Tanner staging of sexual development, and use of concomitant medications.

The pharmacodynamic biomarker to be evaluated in this study is lyso- Gb3 levels in plasma. Blood samples will also be collected for exploratory biomarkers. Efficacy assessments include eGFR, urine protein and albumin levels, left ventricular mass index (LVMi) using echocardiograms, and subject questionnaires (electronic diary [e- diary] for gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and pain [Short Fabry Disease Patient-Reported Outcome – Gastrointestinal Signs and Symptoms { FABPRO -GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (24 -hour version)}], Patient Global Impression of Change [PGI- C], Fabry- Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire [FPHPQ], and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory™ [PedsQL™]). 7.2. Details of Study Treatment Migalastat will be supplied as capsules that are generally referred to as “migalastat”; the term “migalastat HCl” refers to the salt form and is used only when referring to a specific dosage of migalastat for administration. Migalastat capsules contain 123 mg migalastat free base, which is equivalent to 150 mg miga lastat HCl. 7.2.1. Administration of Study Treatment One migalastat 150 mg capsule will be administered with water every other day continuously for 12 months during Stages 1 and 2 of the study. Subjects should take study drug at the same time of day during the every other day dosing schedule. Subjects are to record the date and time of each migalastat administration in the Dosing Diary provided in the dosing wallet containing their study drug. Study drug should not be taken on 2 consecutive days. If a dose is missed entirely for the day, the subject should take the missed dose of study drug only if it is within 12 hours of the time the dose normally is taken. If more than 12 hours have passed, the subject should resume taking study drug at the next planned dosing day and time according to the every-other- day dosing schedule. Subjects will be instructed not to eat for at least 2 hours before and for 2 hours after administration of study drug. Water can be consumed during this period. Pharmacokinetic simulations su ggest that if a subject’s weight decreases to 43 kg, their exposure following a 150 mg QOD dose is not substantially higher than exposure in subjects weighing ≥ 45 kg. Therefore, in the event of weight loss down to 43 kg during Stage 2, subjects may continue on study drug with close monitoring. During Stage 2, if a subject’s weight decreases to below 43 kg, an unscheduled visit will be arranged 2 to 4 weeks later in order to monitor the subject’s weight. If the subject’s weight remains below 43 kg at the follow -up visit, additional blood samples will be drawn for PK and PD (plasma lyso- Gb 3) assessments. Follow -up PK assessments will be drawn at 4 time intervals according to the sampling group the subject was initially assigned to. Based on the PK results and other parameters, at the discretion of the investigator and the Amicus medical monitor, the subject may remain on study drug with additional monthly follow- up visits until his/her weight returns to at least 43 kg.

Study Drug Interruptions The investigator may choose to interrupt administration of study drug in case of an AE (eg, abnormal result of an assessment or laboratory test) or for administrative reasons. Any interruption in dosing must be documented in the subject’s electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and source medical record. The Medical Monitor/Clinical Project Manager should be informed as soon as possible after the decision is made to interrupt study drug for a subject. 7.2.3. Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance will be assessed at each clinic visit through subject interview, and by comparing the amount of study drug that should have been taken since the last study visit with the amount of study drug returned. If a subject is not compliant with study drug administration, the investigator (in consultation with the Medical Monitor) will consider whether the noncompliance should warrant withdrawal of the subject from the study. 7.3. Concomitant Medications Concomitant medications, including vaccinations, taken within 1 month before screening or at any time throughout the study must be recorded in the eCRFs, along with the reason for use, dates of administration, dosage, frequency, and route of administration. 7.4. Prohibited Medications Use of the following medications or treatments during this study is prohibited and will result in withdrawal from the study: • investigational/experimental therapy • ERT (eg, Replagal® [agalsidase alfa], Fabrazyme® [agalsidase beta]) • Glyset® [miglitol] • Zavesca® [miglustat] Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 28 of 70"

Replacement of a subject may only occur after consultation with and written approval of the Amicus Medical Monitor. 8.5. Subjects of Childbearing Potential Female subjects of reproductive potential, and all male subjects must use a medically accepted contraceptive regimen during their participation in the study and for 30 days after the last dose of migalastat. A medically acceptable birth control method is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (ie, < 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. A female subject is considered of reproductive potential if she has functional ovaries, ducts, and uterus with no impairment that would cause sterility. Thi s includes females with oligomenorrhea (even severe), and females who have just begun to menstruate. A female is considered of non -reproductive potential if she is at least 26 weeks status -post documented surgical sterilization (includes hysterecto my, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or salpingectomy). The allowed methods of contraception described in the following text are only effective when used consistently, correctly, and, if applicable, in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for ensuring subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Medically acceptable methods of contraception for female subjects enrolled in the study include the following: • total abs tinence, which refers to refr aining from penile-vaginal intercourse, when this is the female’s preferred and usual lifestyle • hormonal contraception (ie, combination oral contraceptive pills, implant, injection, ring, or patch) for at least 12 weeks before screening • intrauterine device that meets the < 1% failure per year rate, as stated in the product label, for at least 12 weeks before screening • double-barrier method, defined as condom and occlusive cap (eg, diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) used in combination with spermicide (eg, fo am, gel, film, cream, suppository) − Note: the double-barrier method does not satisfy the requirements for an effective method of birth control in all countries and may not be utilized as a contraceptive method by subjects participating at sites in those countries . Medically acceptable methods of contraception for male subjects enrolled in the study include the following: • total a bstinence, which refers to refraining from penile-vaginal intercourse, when this is the male’s preferred and usual lifestyle • surgical sterilization (eg, vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior to the subject’s entry into the study Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 32 of 70"

Any pregnancy (in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject) occurring during the study must be reported as described in Section 10.5.1. In the event of pregnancy in a female subject, migalastat must be discontinued immediately upon becoming aware of the pregnancy. Female subjects or a female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be monitored by the investigator until the outcome of the pregnancy is known. Both the detection and the outcome of the pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptom-thermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Four blood samples for determination of migalastat concentrations in plasma will be collected in one 24-hour period between Day 15 and Day 30 following initiation of study drug administration. If they are to be done at the site, the PK collection visit should be scheduled on a migalastat administration day and subjects are to be instructed to bring their study drug with them. Blood sampling for PK is relative to migalastat administration and collection times must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page . Each subject will have 4 PK samples collected at the times specified in Table 4 according to their randomized PK sampling group assignment. Alternately, PK blood collections may be done by a home healthcare professional. In either case, the collections must follow migalastat administration at the times speci fied in Table 4 and the time of migalastat administration prior to the collections and the times of each collection must be recorded .

In addition, ejection fraction, fractional shortening, left ventricular internal diameter end diastole and end systole, midwall fractional shortening, and wall thickness will be assessed. Echocardiograms will be read centrally. 9.2.5.4. Subject Questionnaires All Questionnaires will be provided in a separate Patient Outcomes Manual. 9.2.5.4.1. Electronic Diary Subjects will be asked to complete daily diary entries at approximately the same time of day (preferably in the evening before bed time) beginning on Day 1 and for the duration of the study. Diary entries will include completion of the FABPRO- GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (24 -hour version). The FABPRO- GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials (24 -hour version) consists of 4 questions regarding gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and 2 questions regarding pain relative to the past 24 hours. Subjects will record the frequency and consistency of stools using the Bristol Stool Scale, a pictorial chart a nd descriptive text for 7 types of stool, ranging from Type 1 (separate hard lumps, like nuts – hard to pass) through Type 7 (watery, no solid pieces – entirely liquid). Subjects will also rate the severity of their worst occurrence of diarrhea, constipati on, tummy pain, and overall pain from 0 (none) to 10 (worst possible); for tummy pain, subjects will indicate the location of any tummy pain using a diagram. 9.2.5.4.2. Patient Global Impression of Change The PGI -C consists of 4 questions regarding diarrhea, abdominal pain, overall pain, and daily living to be answered using a 7- point scale. Subjects will complete the questions by themselves without assistance from their parents or legal guardians. 9.2.5.4.3. Fabry -Specific Pediatric Health and Pain Questionnaire The FPHPQ inc ludes questions about Fabry disease-specific symptoms (eg, sweating, pain, dizziness and tiredness, heat and cold intolerance, swollen eyelids, gastrointestinal symptoms, feeling thirsty, difficulty hearing, ringing or buzzing noise in the ears, and ability and enjoyment to participate in sports). The frequency of these symptoms will be rated using a 5-point Likert scale (always, often, sometimes, seldom, never). Pain intensity is measured on a 10 -point scale, numeric responses are given for onset of pain and school days missed, and yes/no questions are posed about difficulty hearing and other problems not specifically mentioned. There are 2 age- specific self -report versions for children 8 to 12 years and 13 to 18 years, respectively.

For each subject, reporting of AEs and SAEs begins after written informed consent is provided. 10.1. Definitions 10.1.1. Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Therefore, AEs include the following: • the onset of new signs, symptoms, conditions, and illnesses • exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or illnesses • abnormal laboratory findings deemed clinically significant by the investigator • physical examination changes deemed clinically significant by the investigator • abnormal medical evaluation findings (eg, ECG) that are not documented at screening and/or, in the investigator’s opin ion, represent a clinically significant change in the subject’s health during study participation Note: Screening medical evaluation findings (eg, ECG) that were not previously provided as medical history and can be determined as starting before screening, are not considered AEs and will be recorded as medical history. Adverse events will be recorded in the eCRF and subject’s source record beginning from the time written consent (assent) is provided through the follow- up visit (at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug). A single diagnosis should be entered when known. If a clear diagnosis cannot be determined at the time of eCRF completion and the subject’s source record entry, each sign and symptom must be recorded individually, until a final diag nosis is established. Conditions, signs, symptoms, etc that are present in the subjects’ medical history at screening should only be reported as AEs if they worsen (ie, increase in severity) since screening. Adverse events that begin after the first dose o f study drug will be considered treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

46,page_46,"10.1.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: • death • a life -threatening event − This includes any AE that in the view of either the investigator or sponsor places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death. • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization − Hosp italization signifies the subject has been admitted, regardless of duration, for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in a physician’s office or outpatient setting. − Hospitalizations for elective or pre-planned treatment of a pre- existing condition do not have to be reported as SAEs if the following criteria are met: − the condition is documented in the subject’s medical history and has not worsened since the informed consent form was first signed; and − the condition and planned procedure are documented in the subject’s source records at screening . − Emergency room/department or outpatient treatments that do not result in admission do not have to be reported as an SAE, unless another SAE criterion is met. Events assessed and treated in these circumstances should be captured as AEs in the eCRF and documented in the subject’s source records. − Hospitalizations solely based on subject logistics ( eg, subject is admitted due to limited hospital accessibility for what would otherwise be an out-subject procedure) do not have to be reported as SAEs provided that the hospitalizations are clearly defined as such in the subject’s source record. • persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functio ns • congenital anomaly/birth defect An important medical event that does not result in one of the above serious outcomes may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the listed serious outcomes. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

47,page_47,"I f the following 4 elements are known, the event must be reported as described in Section 10.4.2 : • identifiable subject • event term • study drug • identifia ble reporter Additionally, the investigator’s assessment of an event’s relationship to study drug (see Section 10.2) is essential for the sponsor to appropriately process the report and must be included. Subjects and parents or legally -authorized representatives must be informed and understand that they should report events meeting the definition for SAE to study site personnel as soon as possible (and not wait until their next study visit). If a non- serious event becomes serious, the change in status must be appropriately entered in the eCRF and the subject’s source record, and reported to the sponsor as described in Section 10.4.2. If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and considers the event possibly, probably, or definitely related to study drug, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor (see Table 1)/Clinical Operations Lead to determine how the SAE should be documented and reported. 10.2. Relationship to Study Drug The investigator or a medically qualified sub- investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to study drug based on available information and according to the following guidelines: • Definite: a reaction that follows a distinct temporal relationship from administration of study drug; that follows a known reaction to the agent or chemical group of the study drug; and that canno t be explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors • Probable: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and that could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state • Possible: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors • Unlikely: a reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study drug; however, causality from the study drug cannot be ruled out • Unre lated: a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to study drug Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 48 of 70"

Events assessed as unlikely or unrelated will b e considered “not related” to study drug (ie, not associated with the use of study drug). 10.3. Severity Assessment The investigator or a qualified sub-investigator will review each event and use the following definitions for rating intensity: • Mild: awareness of sign, symptom or event, but the AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity • Moderate: discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant intervention, but the subject is still able to function • Severe: incapa citating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects clinical status, and requires medical intervention It is important to distinguish the difference between events that meet the definition of serious and events that are deemed as severe in intensity. Adverse events assessed as severe in intensity are not SAEs unless at least 1 of the definitions in Section 10.1.2 is met. Adverse events of any intensity must be reported as SAEs if at least 1 def inition in Section 10.1.2 is met. 10.4. Reporting Events 10.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events Information regarding AEs is to be obtained by questioning or examining the subject and/or parents or legally -authorized representative s. As noted in Section 10.1.1, AEs will be recorded in the eCRF and subject source record beginning from the time written consent (assent) is provided through the follow- up visit (at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug). Required information will be detailed in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 10.4.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events must be documented and reported to the sponsor immediately, but no later than within 24 hours of any know ledge by study site personnel of events. Serious adverse event reports must be faxed to the designated safety fax number ( Table 1) to ensure appropriate dissemination and processing of the information. An alternate email address is provided as a backup, if the fax transmission is unsuccessful. Serious adverse event forms, which will be provided by the sponsor, should be as complete as possible, with all information known at the time included. All relevant supporting documentation (eg, admission and progress notes, results of diagnostic evaluations/procedures/examinations, etc) available at the time of reporting, should be included in the fax (or email, if necessary) along with the SAE report form.

Reporting timelines (as described above) must not be delayed while obtaining or preparing supporting information. If more than 1 SAE is identified in 1 subject simultaneously, separate SAE reports should be generated for each event. Information not available at the time of the initial report (eg, event end date and outcome, supporting documents (eg, discharge summary, etc) must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of any knowledge/receipt by study site personnel of the information . Information must be faxed (or emailed, if necessary) to the designated safety fax number (or email address) (Table 1) to ensure appropriate dissemination and processing.

Medical history, concomitant medication, and AE information obtained through SAE reporting must also be consistently recorded in the eCRF. 10.4.3. Additional Reporting Requirements for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction The sponsor is responsible for processing suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). SUSARs are also referred to as alert reports, expedited safety reports, and investigational new drug application (IND) safety reports. A SUSAR is defined as any SAE that is determined to be associated with the use of study drug and is une xpected (not currently listed in the safety reference information or is not listed at the specificity or severity that been observed). The sponsor will notify all investigators currently conducting migalastat clinical studies of all SUSARs in accordance wi th applicable regulations. SUSARs will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs according to the rules in effect in each country where study sites are located: • If the SUSAR is fatal or life -threatening, regulatory authorities and e thics committees will be notified within 7 calendar days after the sponsor learns of the event. • If the SUSAR is not fatal or life -threatening, regulatory authorities and ethics committees will be notified within 15 calendar days after the sponsor learns o f the event. These notifications will need to be filed in each site’s Study File Notebook and submitted to each site’s IRB/IEC in accordance with policy. Safety updates will be provided periodically to the regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs responsible f or the study according to the rules in effect in each country where study sites are located. These updates will include information on SUSARs and other relevant safety findings. Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 50 of 70"
50,page_50,"10.5. Other Reporting Situations 10.5.1. Pregnancy Pregnancy information for female subjects and female partners of male subjects participating in the study is collected by the sponsor. Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE (unless there is a suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication). If a female subject becomes pregnant during the course of the study, or if the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the subject’s participation in the study, the sponsor must be informed within 5 working days of any knowledge of the pregnancy by study site personnel. If an SAE occurs in conjunction with the pregnancy, the SAE must be reported as described in Section 10.4.2. The sponsor will provide pregnancy report forms (initial and follow-up) and instructions to study site personnel regarding collection of pregnancy and outcome information (subject to receipt of data privacy release approvals where required under local privacy laws). Pregnancy report forms must be faxed (or emaile d, if necessary) to the designated safety fax number (or email) (Table 1) to ensure appropriate dissemination and processing of the information. 10.5.2. Medication Errors, Including Overdose and Under Dose Medication error refers to any unintended error in the dispensing or administration of a study drug. If a subject experiences an overdose (defined as ≥ 20% higher than the assigned dose of study drug for that period in the protocol) or an under dose (defined as ≥ 20% low er than the assigned dose of study drug for that period in the protocol) during the course of the study (whether symptomatic or not), the Amicus’ medical monitor must be notified within 5 working days of the investigator or study staff first becoming aware of the overdose. Medication errors, including overdose and under dose, should be captured in subjects’ source records and recorded in the eCRFs. Any AE or SAE that occurs as a result of a medication error should be reported according to AE/SAE reporting requirements (see Section 10.4 ). 10.5.3. Reporting of Possible Study Drug Product Quality Defects Any defect or possible defect associated with study drug must be reported to the sponsor (clinicalcomplaints@amicusrx.com ) within 1 working day of any study site personnel knowledge of the possible defect. The study drug and packaging components in question, if available, must be segregated and stored in a secure area at the site under the specified storage conditions (see Section 12.4) until it is determined whether or not the study drug and/or packaging is required for investigation of the possible defect. If the possible defect is associated with an SAE, the SAE must be reported as described in Section 10.4.2. The SAE report must include the possible study drug defect complaint.

Efficacy Endpoints Efficacy endpoints are as follows: • change in eGFR from baseline to Months 3, 6, and 12/ET • change in urine protein and albumin levels from baseline to Months 3, 6, and 12/ET • change in LVMi and other echocardiogram parameters from baseline to Month 12/ET • change in gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and pain from baseline to Month 12/ET, as measured by e- diary responses (FABPRO-GI and Pain Questionnaire for Clinical Trials [24 -hour version]) • mean PGI -C values at Months 3, 6, an d 12/ET • change in FPHPQ scores from baseline to Month 12/ET • change in PedsQL scores from baseline to Month 1 2/ET 11.2. Sample Size Considerations A sample size of at least 7 to 10 subjects per age/weight group is required for statistical comparison with adult exposure based on 2 methods described by Wang , Jadhav et al. 2012. First, assumi ng the final CL/F estimates and inter -individual variability of 28.5% ( Migalastat Abbreviated Report of the Simulations of Migalastat in Pediatric Patients with Fabry Disease, 16 October 2016), 7 subjects is adequate to achieve at least 80% power for a study design with rich PK sampling intended for non- compartmental analysis. Second, according to the sample size calculation for a study with sparse/rich PK sampling intended for population PK analysis, ( 𝑒𝑒 −𝑡𝑡(0.975,𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 )×𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡(0.975,𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 )×𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) should be within the pre-defined criteria of (0.6, 1.4), where SE LCL is the standard error for log -transformed pediatric clearance that relates to weight, and t (0.975, df) is the 97.5% upper quantile values from t distribution corresponding to the sample size. Mathematically, SE LCL was approximately equal to the relative standard error of untransformed clearance, 0.16. Therefore, a sample size of approximately 10 subjects is adequate t o achieve the pre-defined boundary of (0.6, 1.4). 11.3. Data Analysis Considerations 11.3.1. Analysis Populations The safety population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose or partial dose of study drug. All safety and pharmacodynamic analyses will be performed using the safety population.

Continuous variables will be summarized by number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. Discrete variables will be summarized by counts and percentages. In general, data will be summarized by sex and combined across all subjects. A month will be defined as 30 days. No missing data imputation method is planned to handle missing data. Data will be summarized as observed. All data will be listed. 11.3.2.1. Interim Analysis The interim PK endpoint is a graphical presentation of plasma- concentration time data (observed versus predicted). Interim analysis of the plasma concentration -time data collected during Stage 1 will be conducted when these results are available. There will be 2 interim PK analyses. One analysis will be performed using the entire Stage 1 PK population of adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years. A second analysis will include a subpopulation of at least 7 to 10 subjects age 12 to < 16 years. 11.3.2.2. Safety Analyses Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class and preferred term. Summaries will be provided for TEAEs, TEAEs by severity, and TEAEs by relationship to study drug as well as deaths, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment. Listings will also be provided for SAEs and TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment.

54,page_54,"T he PK analyses for the current study will be performed according to the following steps: • Step 1: After combining previous concentration- time data from adults with pediatric data from the current study, the population PK model established previously (Migalastat Amended Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Migalastat, Amendment 02; Migalastat Abbreviated Report of the Simulations of Migalastat in Pediatric Pa tients with Fabry Disease, 20 October 2016) will be updated. Most importantly, the allometric scaling functions for CL/F and volume parameters (ie, V2/F, V3/F) will be re -evaluated and corrected, if necessary. Other covariates that are predictive of drug disposition (eg, age, weight, body surface area) may be evaluated. • Step 2: Using the updated population PK model, clinical trial simulations will be conducted assuming administration of migalastat to steady-state concentration for each pediatric subject an d for adults (with equivalent renal function) receiving migalastat HCl 150 mg every other day. The simulations will use population PK parameter uncertainty from a nonparametric bootstrap, inter-individual variability, and residual variability. At least 100 0 clinical trials will be simulated assuming at least 24 subjects per age group. • Step 3: Pharmacokinetic endpoints (ie, C max, Cmin, and AUC 0-τ) for migalastat will be calculated from simulated concentration -time data in pediatric groups and in adults. The AUC 0-τ and C max in 12 to < 18 year olds will be compared to the values in adults with equivalent renal function using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the geometric least squares means of C max and AUC 0-τ will be constructed for comparison of the pediatric group with adult group. These 90% CIs will be obtained by exponentiation of the 90% CIs for the difference between the least squares means based on an ln -transformed scale. • Step 4: Exposures in the pediatric group and adults will be considered equivalent when 90% CIs of the ratio of the geometric least squares means of AUC 0-τ are within the range of 0.8 to 1.25 (ie, 80% to 125%). Intervals obtained from Step 3 will be evaluated according to these a priori criteria. The ratios and CIs will also be determined for C max. • Step 5: If the bioequivalence criteria cannot be met in S tep 4 using the dosing regimen listed in Section 7.2.1, adjusted dosing regimens will be proposed to achieve bioequivalence considering dose proportionality, if necessary, and used for future pediatric clinical trial simulations. • Step 6: The proposed dose for pediatric subjects (12 to < 18 years and 12 to < 16 years) will then be considered the dosage regimen producing an AUC 0-τ meeting the 80% to 125% rule and a C max that either meets this rule or, if not possible, is as close as possible balancing the available dosage strengths with safety. 11.3.2.4.

The investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF pages as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that the subject is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure. Any outstanding entries must be completed immediately after the final examination. All data must be documented separately in source records. An explanation should be given for all missing data. Details of eCRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that data are properly recorde d on each subject’s eCRFs and related documents. If the investigator authorizes other persons to make entries onto the eCRFs, the names, positions, signatures, and initials of these persons must be documented in writing and supplied to the sponsor. The co mpleted eCRFs must be reviewed and electronically signed by the investigator who signed the study protocol signature page to ensure that the observations and findings are recorded on the eCRFs correctly and completely 13.2. Data Management Only data specified in the protocol will be collected as part of this study. All eCRF data will be entered into the EDC system and managed by a contract research organization (CRO). Additional protocol-specified data, such as laboratory and ECG data, may be collected through third party vendors and integrated with eCRF data by the CRO to create complete datasets for analysis. All protocol- specified data will be transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or the CRO). Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance wit h applicable standards and data cleaning procedures as defined in the Data Management Plan to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, determining errors and inconsistencies in the data, and ensuring data are corrected by study site personnel or designees). After database lock, each site will receive an electronic copy containing all of their site -specific eCRF data as entered into the EDC system for the study, including full discrepancy and audit history. Additionally, an electronic copy of all data from the study collected at that study center will be retained by the sponsor or designee for storage. 13.3. Study Monitoring, Source Data Verification, and Onsite Audits Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or endorsed by the sponsor will be followed, in compli ance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Direct access to the onsite study documentation and source documents must be ensured by the investigator. Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 59 of 70"
59,page_59,"M onitoring will be performed by personal visits from a sponsor representative (ie, study monitor) who will che ck the eCRFs for completeness and clarity, and crosscheck them with source documents (see essential documents, Section 13.4). In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent communications (eg, letter, e -mail, te lephone, and fax) by the study monitor will ensure that the study is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. Domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, and/or an auditor authorized by the sponsor may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other study- related documentations for onsite audit or inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who must provide support at all times for these activities. Medical record s and other study documents may be copied during audit or inspection provided that subject names, family member names, telephone numbers, and addresses are obliterated on the copies to ensure confidentiality. The investigator should contact the sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory authority regarding an inspection or audit. 13.4. Records Retention The investigator must obtain approval in writing from the sponsor before destruction of any records. Essential documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of migalastat. However, because of international regulatory requirements or country- specific r equirements, the sponsor may request retention for a longer period. Prior to any decision regarding the disposal or destruction of study documents, the investigator should contact the sponsor. The sponsor may request that the site take alternative actions other than disposal or destruction of study documents. Essential documents include the following: • signed informed consent /assent documents for all subjects • subject identification code list, screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log Note: European Union (EU) legislation requires this list to be maintained for a minimum of 15 years. • composition of the IEC/IRB and recor d of all communications between the investigator and IEC/IRB as well as between the investigator and sponsor or CRO • list of sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has delegated significant study -related duties, together with their roles in the study and their signatures • copies of eCRFs and documentation of corrections for all subjects • investigational product accountability records Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 60 of 70"

If investigators are unable to meet this obligation, they must ask the sponsor for permission to make alternative arrangements. Details of these arrangements must be documented in writing. 13.5. Use of Study Findings All information concerning migalastat as well as any matter concerning the operation of the sponsor, such as clinical indications for migalastat, its formula, methods of manufacture, and other scientific data relating to it, that has been provided by the sponsor and are unpublished, are confidential and must remain the sole property of sponsor. The investigator will agree to use the information only for the purposes of carrying out this study and for no other purpose unless prior written permission from the sponsor is obtained. Amicu s has full ownership of the data collected as part of the study. By signing the clinical study protocol and the confidentiality agreement, the investigator agrees that the results of the study may be used for the purposes of national and international registration, publication, and information for medical and pharmaceutical professionals. Regulatory authorities will be notified of the investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement. The sponsor will ensure that a final report on the study is prepared. The sponsor will ensure that the study findings are reported in a manner that complies with applicable requirements for reporting clinical study results. As required by local regulation or by the IEC/IRB, a summary of the study will be submitted by the sponsor to the regulatory authorities and by the investigator to the IEC/IRB. 13.6. Study Close -out The end of study is defined as date of database lock. The study must be closed at each site on completion. Study close-out will be performed by the study monitor upon closure of the study. Completion or premature termination of the study will be reported by the sponsor to regulatory authorities and by the sponsor or by the investigator to the IEC/IRB as required by local regulation or by the IEC/IR B. Furthermore, the sponsor or the investigator has the right to close any study site at any time. The reason(s) for closure will be documented in writing. As much as possible, premature closure would occur after mutual consultation. Study materials must b e returned, disposed of, or retained as directed by the sponsor (Section 12.4).

Quality Assurance To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the sponsor may conduct a quality assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and the regulatory authorities may conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during or after completion of the study. In the event of an assessment, audit or inspection, the investigator (and medical institution) must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s) and inspector(s) direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to discuss the conduct of the study, any findings/relevant issues and to implement any corrective, and/or preventative actions to address any findings/issues identified during the regulatory audit or inspection. 14.2.4. Confidentiality Subject names (and the names of family members, telephone numbers, and addresses) will not be supplied to the sponsor. A unique subject number will be recorded in the eCRF, and if the subject name appears on any other document (eg, laboratory report), it must be obliterat ed on the copy of the document to be supplied to the sponsor. Study findings stored on a computer will be stored in accordance with local data protection laws (eg, EU Directive 95/46/EC, EU Directive 94/45/EC, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679]). The subject and the subject’s parent or legally -authorized representative will be informed that representatives of the sponsor, IEC/IRB, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in accordance with local data protection laws. The investigator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with the corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified. 14.3. Clinical Study Protocols and Amendments Any non-administrative changes to the protocol, initiated either by the sponsor or by the investigator, will require a formal amendment procedure. Approval of all amendments must be obtained from the sponsor, relevant IEC/IRB, and regulatory authorities (in accordance with local requirements) prior to implementation. Changes to the administrative aspects of the study will not require formal protocol amendments or IEC/IRB approval, but can be treated as administrative amendments. However, the IEC/IRB should be kept informed of such changes. Changes in study staffing or contact information are examples of administrative changes not requiring formal protocol amend ments. Protocol deviations to eligibility criteria, addition or deletion of tests, dosing, duration of treatment, and/or any other aspect of the study design that may significantly impact subject safety or scientific integrity, are not permitted under GCP or by the sponsor, unless necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subject(s). Where the sponsor and/or investigator must take urgent safety measures to protect the subjects from an immediate hazard, a protocol deviation may be allowed prior to obtaining approval from the relevant IEC/IRB (and/or regulatory authorities) according to the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 312.30(b)(2). In such cases, the sponsor and the IEC/IRB must be notified within 1 business day. Amicus Therapeutics Protocol AT1001-020 Amendment 4 13 June 2019 Confidential Page 64 of 70"
