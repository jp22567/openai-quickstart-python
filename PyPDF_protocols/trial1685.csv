Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 04 27 June 2018 Confidential 7 Background Etrasimod is an orally available, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate 1 (S1P 1) receptor modulator. S1P is a signaling sphingolipid required by lymphocytes to exit the lymphoid tissue and enter the blood stream via a chemotactic gradient. The S1P 1 receptor is a physiological mediator that has been shown to regulate lymphocyte recirculation between lymphoid tissue and blood. Binding and internalization of the S1P 1 receptor may result in lymphocyte retention within lymphoid tissue, with subsequent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count and lymphocyte availability for recruitment to sites of inflammation. S1P 1 receptor surface expression is required for S1P gradient - mediated lymphocyte migration out of lymphoid tissue into the circulation1. Modulators of the S1P 1 receptor, such as etrasimod, block lymphocyte migration out of the lymph tissue through internalization of the receptor, resulting in a sequestration of lymphocytes 1. Recent clinical development of S1P 1 receptor modulators has demonstrated their effect on resulting lymphocyte sequestration, and their potential for treating multi ple autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Rationale for use of etrasimod in treatment of PBC Histologically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with damage to biliary epithelial cells, dense portal inflammatory infiltrate and progress ive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts. T cells are important players in the pathogenesis of PBC. The disease results from a chronic inflammatory process in which T cells attack the small bile duct epithelial cells. These epithelial cells eventually dis appear, causing cholestasis and further progression of PBC. The T cells seem to be of both CD4+ and CD8+ origin, as shown by immunohistochemical staining in portal and periportal areas 2. The trigger of this autoimmune disea se is unknown, but genome -wide association studies have suggested the importance of certain HLA variants and other immune -related genes, such as components of the IL - 12 signaling cascade. Furthermore, more than 95% of patients also develop a humoral autoim mune response to mitochondrial proteins (i.e., antimitochondrial antibodies, AMA) 2,3. The reduced peripheral lymphocyte availability seen with the S1P 1 modulator etrasimod is expected to decr ease both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recruitment to sites of inflammation, such as around the bile ducts. In addition to S1P 1 modulation, the"

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 04 27 June 2018 Confidential 8 activation of S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors may confer additional immunomodulatory effects that could translate into efficacy for the treatment of PBC. NK cells appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC: their levels are increased in blood and liver of patients with strong cytotoxic activity against biliary epithelial cells4, and resting as well as activated NK cells express S1P 1, S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors. The S1P 5 receptor has been reported to be involved in chemotaxis of NK cells 5. Other cells that may be potentially blocked by etrasimod include neutrophils, which were recently observed to be S1P4 dependent 6. Compared with other S1P 1 receptor modulators such as fingolimod, etrasimod has shown overal l more selective activation of S1P 1, S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors7 and may thus represent a novel and suitable approach for treating patients with PBC. Objectives: Primary objective: Safety • To assess the safety and tolerability of etrasimod in patients with PBC. Secondary objectives: Efficacy and PK • To evaluate the efficacy (i.e., changes in alkaline phosphatase [ALP] levels from baseline) of etrasimod in patients with PBC. • To assess single dose and steady -state PK of etrasimod in patients with PBC. Exploratory objectives: • To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) response (lymphocyte counts and subsets thereof). • To assess serum high sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), AMA, total IgG and IgM, and 7 -alpha hydroxy 4 -cholesten -3- one (C4). • To assess quality of life (QoL) and incidence of pruritus and fatigue. • • To assess changes in Schirmer tests in patients with abnormal results at screening. Study Design This pilot, open -label, single arm, proof of concept, multicenter study will evaluate orally administered etrasimod for 24 consecutive weeks in PBC patients who had an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)."

Follow -up Visit/End of Stu dy Visit: Visit Week 26, 2 weeks after end of treatment: Patients will return to the study site for the final visit, and final procedures will be performed per Schedule of Procedures and Visits ( Table 1). Premature Discontinu ation: All procedures planned for Weeks 24 and 26 visits should be performed for all patients who discontinue the study prematurely. Dose -stopping Rule s: Any of the following findings in a patient during treatment will lead to a stop in etrasimod dosing in the affected patient : 1. Certain ECG changes (see details in text below), or 2. Clinical evidence of drug -induced liver injury (DILI; as described in 6.15) As described in the study plan above, at the discretion of the PI, the dose of etrasimod may be adjusted from 2 mg q.d. back to 1 mg q.d. if deemed necessary. If the patient is on 1 mg, the PI may discontinue etrasimod treatment if deemed necessary based on the dose -stopping rule s. Close Observation for Possible DILI : It is critical to initiate close observation immediately upon detection and confirmation of early signals of possible DILI, and not to wait until the next scheduled visit or monitoring interval. Close observation is mandatory for any study subject who meets one or more of the following “possible DILI” laboratory criteria: • ALT or AST that is <ULN at baseline, followed by ALT or AST increase to >3 × ULN • ALT or AST that is >ULN at baseline, followed by ALT or AST increase to >2 × baseline • ALP >2 × baseline • Total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN Close observation includes: • Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests within 48 -72 hours. Then, repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abno rmalities resolve, abnormalities stabilize, or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic. • Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases."

Background on Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) PBC is a rare, autoimmune, chronic, cholestatic liver disease, and is the most common cholangiopathy observed in adults 3. It is characterized by a progressive bile duct injury from portal and periportal inflammation causing cholestasis, fibrosis, and eventually leading to liver cirrhosis. Although the precise cause of disease is unknown, there is evidence of liver immune in filtration and systemic aberrant immunity in PBC patients 2. PBC affects individuals of all ethnic origins and accounts for 0.6% -2.0% of deaths from cirrhosis worldwide. Incidence rates for Europe, North America, and Austral ia range from 0.33 to 5.8 per 100,000 inhabitants and prevalence is 1.91 to 40.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. PBC disproportionately affects women (10:1 women to men ratio) 8,9. The pathogenesis of PBC includes both adaptive and innate immune responses and evidence indicates that environmental, infectious, and genetic factors are involved 3. Approximately 7 - 34% of patients with PBC have overlapping Sjög ren’s syndrome10 and approximately 10% of patients with PBC have autoimmune hepatitis as well 11. Chronic inflammation of the small interlobular bile ducts leads to cholangitis, ductopenia, and ductal proliferation 3. These bile ductal injuries gradually progress to cholestasis, biliary fibrosis, and cirrhosis, which w ill eventually lead to liver failure if untreated. The risk of hepatocellular, colorectal and hepatobiliary cancers is also increased in patients with advanced stage PBC 12. The diagnosis of PBC is based on a sustained eleva tion of serum markers of cholestasis (i.e., ALP), and the presence of serum AMA directed against the E2 subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex 10. Other autoantibodies, such as ANA, are often identiﬁed in patients with PBC. The ANAs anti -Sp100 and anti -gp210 have a high speciﬁcity for PBC and could be helpful when AMA is negative 10. Historically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with injuries to biliary epi thelial cells, an extensive portal inflammatory infiltrate, and progressive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts 3. The most frequent symptoms in PBC patients are fatigue and pruritus, occurring in nearly 80% and 20 -70% of patients, respectively 10. However, at the time of diagnosis, most patients are asymptomatic and are identified through the presence of abnormal liver enzymes during routine physical exams. Patients with PBC have a shorter s urvival than healthy subjects. In one follow -up study, the 10 -year survival of PBC patients was 59%, compared with an expected 81% in the age - and sex -matched healthy population13. Patients with advanced PBC have a median su rvival of only 1.4 -4.1 years 3. 1.1.1 Treatment Options There is no cure for PBC. Liver transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment option for PBC patients. Furthermore, post -transplant recurrence of PBC is reported up to 34% 10,14. The only pharmacological agents approved for the treatment of PBC are ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, 7β -epimer of the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid [CDCA], appro ved in the US in 1997) and obeticholic acid (OCA, approved in the US in 2016). Reports suggest that 10 -20 mg/kg/day UDCA delays the need for transplantation or prolongs survival without liver transplantation; however, an estimated 40% of PBC patients are incomplete biochemical responders (reduction in ALP) to long -term UDCA monotherapy 10,15. Reduction of ALP with UDCA has been recognized as a surrogate marker of slower disease progression and improved transplant -free overall survival 15. PBC patients who do not"

Rationale for Treatment, Study Design and Dose Selection 1.3.1. Rationale for Treatment S1P1 receptor signaling on certain lymphocyte subpopulations allows their exit from lymph nodes along a S1P gradient. Functional antagonism, through agonism and subsequent internalization, of these S1P 1 receptors results in retention of certain lymphocyte subpopulations in lymph nodes and prevents their egress to the bloodstream. It is through this mechanism that etrasimod may potentially reduce inflammation and autoimmune response in PBC. Lymphocyte lowering has been correlated with clinical efficacy for S 1P functional antagonists in MS (fingolimod, ponesimod, siponimod, ozanimod)25, psoriasis (ponesimod)26 and ulcerative colitis (ozanimod) 27. This same mechanis m may also be useful in treating a variety of different inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The availability of lymphocyte trafficking agents such as etrasimod would offer PBC patients an anti - inflammatory/autoimmune response, oral, and potentially more convenient treatment. T cells are important players in the pathogenesis of PBC. The disease results from a chronic inflammatory process in which T cells attack the small bile duct epithelial cells. These epithelial cells eventually disappear, causing chole stasis and further progression of PBC. The T cells seem to be of both CD4+ and CD8+ origin, as shown by immunohistochemical staining in portal and periportal areas 2. The trigger of this autoimmune disease is unknown, but ge nome -wide association studies have suggested the importance of certain HLA variants and other immune -related genes, such as components of the IL -12 signaling cascade. Furthermore, more than 95% of patients also develop a humoral autoimmune response to mitochondrial proteins 2,3."
28,page_28,"Etrasimod (APD334) Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 04 27 June 2018 Confidential 29 The reduced peripheral lymphocyte availability seen with the S1P 1 modulator etrasimod is expected to decrease T cell recruitment to sites of inflammation, such as aroun d the bile ducts. In addition to S1P 1 modulation, the receptor activity with S1P 4 and S1P 5 may confer additional immunomodulatory effects that could translate into efficacy for the treatment of PBC. NK cells appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC : their levels increased in blood and liver of patients with strong cytotoxic activity against biliary epithelial cells 4, and resting as well as activated NK cells express S1P 1, S1P 4 and S1P 5 receptors. The S1P 5 receptor ha s been reported to be involved in chemotaxis of NK cells5. Other cells that may possibly be blocked by etrasimod include neutrophils, which are S1P 4 dependent 6. In addition to immune cells, S1P receptors are expressed in hepatocytes, of which S1P 1 and S1P 2 appear most dominant. Inhibition of S1P 1, but not S1P 2 receptors, reduced bile salt (glycochenodeoxycholic acid) -induced apoptosis in rat hepatocytes, indicating potential therapeutic benef its in PBC 28. Furthermore, it has been reported that S1P 1 may be involved in processes promoting liver fibrosis, suggesting that blockade of the S1P 1 pathway may help attenuate liver fibrosis 29. Together, this evidence suggests that immune cells, in addition to hepatocytes, play a role in PBC and that S1P 1, and possibly S1P 4 and S1P 5, receptor modulation may represent a novel therapeutic approach in PBC. The aim of the proposed clinical study is to evaluate the role of S1P receptor modulation in the setting of PBC. Next generation S1P receptor modulators with improved side effect profiles, such as etrasimod, may represent a novel therapy for PBC patients. 1.3.2. Rationale for Study Design This is an open -label, multicenter, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety , tolerability, PK and efficacy of two oral etrasimod daily doses (1 mg and 2 mg) for a total of 24 weeks (12 weeks at each dose level) in up to 20 patients with early stage PBC. In each patient, 1 mg daily will be evaluated initially for 12 weeks followed by a potential dose escalation to 2 mg daily based on each individual patients’ safety and PK data. The open - label nature of the study allows for each subject to be evaluated closely fo r dose escalation based on their safety and PK data. The pharmacological activity and efficacy of etrasimod will also be evaluated. Clinically, PBC is monitored by assessing biochemical markers primarily, ALP levels, and other liver enzymes including gamma - glutamyltransferase (GGT) and bilirubin. Given the nature of these measures it is reasonable to plan an initial evaluation of clinical response without inclusion of placebo controls in this study. A 3-month (12 -week) treatment period for each dose level was chosen to assess the safety, efficacy and pharmacodynamic activity in patients. This timeframe is judged appropriate to establish an initial safety and clinical effect of etrasimod in PBC patients. Although this study is only including patients with ea rly stage of PBC disease, it is possible that clearance of estrasimod may be decreased and systemic exposure increased. For this reason, the study was designed to assess the PK of the low dose (1 mg) after the initial dose on Day 1 and on Week 2 (i.e. stea dy-state) in each patient prior to allowing a dose escalation to 2 mg at Week 12. 1.3.3.

Overall Study Design and Plan This is an open label, single arm, multi -center clinical study to assess the safety and tolerability, PK and efficacy of etrasimod in patients with PBC. The trial will include adult patients, 18 -80 years of age, with a confirmed PBC diagnosis, and who had an inadequate response to UDCA. The scree ning period will last 5 to 8 weeks and will be followed by a 24 -week treatment period. All patients will receive 1 mg etrasimod for 12 weeks followed by a potential dose increase to 2 mg etrasimod for 12 weeks. Those patients who do not dose escalate will remain on 1 mg etrasimod for the duration of the study through Week 24 ( Figure 1 ). During the treatment period, patients will need to take 1 tablet of study medication (p.o. q.d.). The last dose is planned to be taken one day before the end of the treatment period (during Week 24). A follow -up visit will take place 2 weeks after the end of treatment. Please refer to the Schedule of Procedures and Visits ( Table 1 ) for the detailed plan. Figure 1. Schematic of APD334 -010 Study Design a Screening Visit 1 is to occur between Week -8 and Week -5. Screening Visit 2 is to occur at least 4 weeks from Screening Visit 1. For patients with ALP, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin values from Screening Visits 1 and 2 that are not within 20% of each oth er (see Inclusion Criterion 9), an unscheduled visit within the screening period may be conducted to repeat these assessments. The study will consist of the following periods: Screening Period ( 5 to 8 weeks before baseline visit): Each patient will be asked to visit the study site at least 2 times for screening assessments within the 8 weeks prior to the planned start of the treatment (Day 1). Screening Visit 1 is to occur between Week -8 and Week -5. Screening Visit 2 is to occur a t least 4 weeks from Screening Visit 1. For patients with ALP, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin values from Screening Visits 1 and 2 that are not within 20% of each other ( see Inclusion Criterion 9 ), an unscheduled visit within the screening period may be cond ucted to repeat these assessments. All patients must be consented before any study specific procedure is performed and written informed consent must be obtained. Patients will then undergo screening procedures to determine eligibility.

Informed Consent Prior to undergoing any study specific procedures, each subject must sign a writt en Informed Consent Form (ICF) that has been approved by the investigator’s designated Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and by the sponsor. All patients will be informed of the nature of the protocol and investigationa l therapy, their possible hazards, and their right to withdraw at any time, and will sign a form indicating their consent to participate prior to the initiation of study procedures. The signed ICF should be included in the patient’s medical record, which s hould also contain written documentation indicating that informed consent was obtained. Study procedures will be conducted only after a written informed consent has been obtained and documented appropriately in the source data. 6.2. Screening Failures A screeni ng failure is defined as a patient who has signed the ICF, does not meet all the entry criteria as outlined in this protocol and has not been randomized or received study medication. A screening log will be maintained by the Investigator or designee, indic ating the reason for the screening failure. 6.3. Medical History A complete medical history will be collected at screening. Concomitant medications, recent illnesses, and participation in other investigational drug studies will also be recorded. The examination s will be performed as outlined in Schedule of Procedures and Visits ( Table 1 ). 6.4. Physical, and Neurological Examinations 6.4.1. Physical Examination The examinations will be performed as outlined in Schedule of Proce dures and Visits ( Table 1 ). The physical examination will be performed by the investigator. It will include assessments of general appearance, skin, head (eyes, ears, nose, and throat), neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, b ack, lymph nodes, and extremities, and body weight. Height will only be obtained at screening. Patients with eye disturbances indicating macular edema, such as blurred vision in combination with metamorphopsia, must be referred to an ophthalmologist for fu rther examination. 6.4.3. Neurological Examination The neurological examination includes assessments of the neurological system (cranial nerves, motor and sensory function, coordination, and mental status). In addition, monitoring for PML will be performed using a subjecti ve PML checklist (refer"

For female partners who m become pregnant by male study patients during the course of the study, reasonable efforts will be made to collect information on the partner’s pregnancy through the first well baby visit as provided by the male study patient. 6.15.3. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity The severity of each AE will be assessed at onset by a nurse and/or physician. When recording the outcome of the AE the maximum severity of the AE experienced will also be recorded. The severity of the AE will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.0 3 31 definitions, listed below: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; lim iting age - appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*. Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL**. Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to AE. Activities of Daily Living: *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 6.15.4. Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Study Medication The relationship of an AE to investigational product(s) will be classified us ing modified WHO criteria (Edwards and Biriell, WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows: Related : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, un likely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal. Re -challenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or an event that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals where information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not related : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other cause; etc.); or an event with a temporal relationshi p to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations."

AEs that have not resolved or stabilized at 30 days after the last patient’s last study dose, will be reviewed with the sponsor on an individual basis to determine whether the database will be locked and subsequently upda ted once the events of ongoing AEs are resolved or whether database lock will be held. 6.16. Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Surveillance In July 2009, the FDA released a Guidance for Industry entitled “Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluatio n,” which reviews the importance of DILI surveillance in drug development . DILI has been the most frequent single cause of safety -related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years , and h epatotoxicity discovered after approval for marketing has limit ed the use of many drugs . Furthermore, the guidance addresses how laboratory measurements that signal the potential for DILI can be obtained and evaluated during drug development. Given the fact that all subjects enrolled in this study have pre -existing li ver disease (i.e., PBC) and baseline elevations in laboratory tests of liver health ( ALP , ALT and/or AST), DILI"
55,page_55,"Etrasimod (APD334) Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 0 4 27 June 2018 Confidential 56 surveillance is of critical importance to patient safety. Therefore, in collaboration with the FDA and after careful consideration of the principles outlined in the DILI guidance, the sponsor has established procedures to ensure early detection of possible DILI and study drug discontinuation in the contex t of suspected DILI. 6.16.1. Close Observation for Possible DILI It is critical to initiate close observation immediately upon detection and confirmation of early signals of possible DILI, and not to wait until the next scheduled visit or monitoring interval. Close observation is mandatory for any study patient who meets one or more of the following “possible DILI” laboratory criteria: • ALT or AST that is <ULN at baseline, followed by ALT or AST increase to >3 × ULN • ALT or AST that is >ULN at baseline , followed by A LT or AST increase to >2 × baseline • ALP >2 × baseline • Total bilirubin >1.5 × ULN Close observation includes: • Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests within 48 -72 hours. Then, repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times week ly. Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities resolve , abnormalities stabilize , or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic. • Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurren t diseases. • Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets. • Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. • Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. • Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appro priate (e.g., INR, direct bilirubin). • Considering consultations, imaging studies, and/or therapeutic interventions, as required. 6.16.2. Study Drug Discontinuation for Suspected DILI Should any patient who meets “possible DILI” laboratory criteria have persistence or worsening of lab data (i.e., ALT, AST, ALP , and/or total bilirubin ) after one week of close observation, study drug must be discontinued. In addition, immediate study drug discontinuation i s mandatory for any study patient who meets one or more of the following “suspected DILI” clinical criteria:"

Removal of Patients from the Trial or Study Drug The study may be terminated early if, in the opinion of the sponsor, investigator, or IEC, an unacceptable risk to the safety and welfare of patients is posed by the continuation of the study in light of review of the key safety data. Evidence of macular edema in patients requires study dr ug discontinuation. Patients will be free to withdraw from the study at any time should they so wish. A patient may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons (including but not limited to): • Clinical investigator may remove a patient if, in his/her opinion, it is in the best interest of the patient (including decisions based on the dose -stopping rule s). • Withdrawal of consent: Any patient may withdraw his/her consent from the study at any time. The investigator should make a reasonable atte mpt to document the specific reason why consent was withdrawn. • Deviation/noncompliance with the protocol or study drug. • An AE. • Lost to follow up. 6.18.1. Handling of Withdrawals Although a patient is not obliged to give his/her reason for withdrawing prematurely, the investigator will make a reasonable effort to obtain the reason while fully respecting the patient’s rights. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient will remain under the supervision of the study physician until in satisfactory health . Reasonable efforts will be made to contact a patient who fails to attend any follow -up appointments, in order to ensure that he/she is in satisfactory health. If a patient is prematurely discontinued from this study, every attempt will be made to follow the Week 24/EOS visit procedures. If consented by the patient, effort will be made to conduct a follow -up visit within 2 weeks of discontinuation ( Table 1 ), if the patient has received at least 1 dose of the study drug. 6.18.2. Replacements Patients who terminate early from the study due to reasons other than AEs will be replaced."

Data Collection All data (ECGs, clinical laboratory data, and all other study -related data) will be collected according to the sponsor/CRO’s SOPs or according to study site standards, if applicable. 8.2. Data Coding 8.2.1. Adverse Events AEs will be coded using the most current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maximu m severity, causal relationship to study medication, and action taken. Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., self -limited fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured as an upper respiratory infection rather than by the individual signs and symptoms). AEs will be regarded as ‘pre -treatment’ if they occur between screening and the time of administration of the first dose of etrasimod . All other AEs that occur after the f irst dose of study medication will be considered to be ‘treatment -emergent’. 8.2.2. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Treatments Due to the variability in how medications are recorded, a standard naming convention is required to tabulate this data effectively. A common method of standardization is to categorize medications by their Preferred Term (PT). Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO DD), Format C. 8.2.3. Medical History Medical history will be coded using the most cu rrent MedDRA -version."

Efficacy Analysis There are no inferential comparisons for study endpoints. Summary statistical analyses will be performed for all efficacy measures. For proportion -based measures, N, frequencies, proportion and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be produced. For continuous measure, N, mean, median, range, and SD will be produced for observed values, and additional 95% CI for change or percent change from baseline will be produced if applicable. 9.6.2. Subgroup Analyses Exploratory analysis of main study endpoints will be performed in subset of patients of medical interests, such as patient demographics, baseline ALP levels, baseline disease characteristics, biomarker, previous disease treatment received, etc. 9.6.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Pharmacok inetic parameters of etrasimod, and its metabolites (if possible) will be calculated using non -compartmental methods. Individual etrasimod plasma concentrations at specified time points will be listed for each patient. Individual plasma concentration -time points of etrasimod will be plotted on both a linear and a semi -logarithmic scale for each dose level. 9.6.4. Interim Analysis An informal interim analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed when up to half the patients have finished 12 weeks of treatment. 9.7. Safety Analysis Safety and tolerability will be assessed by a review of all safety parameters including AEs, laboratory safety parameters, vital signs, and ECG. AEs will only be presented as summary tabulations. When assessing change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. Baseline for the safety analysis is defined as the average of the pre- dose measurement s. No missi ng data will be imputed for the safety analysis. For continuous variables, summary statistics (N, mean [or median], SD, mean [or median] change/percent change) and 95% CI will be produced if applicable; for proportion -based measures, N, frequencies, propor tion and its 95% CI will be produced. 9.7.1. Adverse Events AEs will be coded using the most current MedDRA and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severity at onset, maximum severity, causal relationship to study medication, and action taken.

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 0 4 27 June 2018 Confidential 95 Summary of Changes for Amendment 2.0 Dated 07 February 2018 Protocol APD334 -010 was amended to primarily add or clarify criteria and procedures to improve patient safety. Revised text in Amendment 2.0 is indicated in bold font, and text deleted from Version 1.0 is crossed out in the table below. Minor/editorial ch anges are not listed in the summary table. Section Amendment 1.0 Amendment 2.0 Reason for Change Global Change The screening period was up to 4 weeks long, and the total study duration was up to 30 weeks. The screening period is now 4 to 8 weeks long, and the total study duration is now up to 34 weeks. Baseline values should be established by at least two samples obtained at least 4 weeks to 8 weeks apart to account for disease -related changes in liver enzymes. Global Change dose escalation committee safety and dose escalation committee The name of the dose escalation committee was revised to the safety and dose escalation committee to better reflect its function. Synopsis: Dose -stopping Rules Any of the following findings in patient s during treatmen t will lead to a stop in etrasimod dosing : Any of the following findings in a patient during treatment will lead to a stop in etrasimod dosing in the affected patient : The text was rephrase d to make it clear that the stop in dosing will occur only in the a ffected patient . Synopsis: Dose -stopping Rules 5.2.1: Dose -stopping Rules 2. ALT/AST >3 x baseline level and >ULN, or Total bilirubin >2 x baseline level and >1.8 mg/dL (30.8 umol/L) 2. Clinical evidence of drug - induced liver injury (DILI; as described in 6.15) This dose -stopping rule was revised to reflect the new study drug discontinuation for suspected DILI criteria added to this version of the protocol. Synopsis: Dose -stopping Rules 6.15.1: Close Observation for Possible DILI New text Close Observation for Possible DILI: It is critical to initiate close observation immediately upon detection and confirmation of early signals of possible DILI, and not to wait until the next scheduled visit or monitoring interval. Close observation is mandatory for any study subject who meets one or To further protect patient safety, a detailed clinical management plan is included to evaluate and respond to cases of new elevations (or new elevations from baseline) in transaminases or tests of live r function."

Tests will be performed in the central laboratory. If the patient lives in a remote area, laboratory testing for close observation for possib le DILI may be performed locally and the results promptly communicated to the clinic. Clarified that a local laboratory may be used for patients who live in remote areas for DILI monitoring to allow for a more rapid assessment of liver function. 6.9.1 : List of Laboratory Parameters 6.9.5: Blood Volume The total blood volume collected to cover all sampling pro cedures (as required by the outline in Schedule of Procedures and Visits [Table 1 ]), is up to 200 mL during the study. The total blood volume collected to cover all sampling procedures (as required by the outline in Schedule of Procedures and Visits [ Table 1 ]), is up to 215 mL during the study. The blood volume was updated to account for the 6 optional PK samples added to this amendment 6.15 Drug -Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Surveillance New text In July 2009, the FDA released a Guidance for Industry entitled “Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” which reviews the importance of DILI surveillance in drug development. DILI has been the most frequent single cause of safety -related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years, and hepatotoxicity discovered after approval for marketing has limited the use of many drugs. Furthermore, the guidance addresses how laboratory measurements that signal the potential for DILI can be obtained and evaluated during drug development. Background information regarding the importance of DILI monitoring was added to provide context for the clinic staff."

Clinical Trial Protocol: APD334 -010 Amendment 0 4 27 June 2018 Confidential 106 Section Amendment 1.0 Amendment 2.0 Reason for Change Given the fact that all subjects enrolled in this study have pre - existing liver disease (i.e., PBC) and baseline elevations in laboratory tests of liver health (ALP, ALT and/or AST), DILI surveillance is of c ritical importance to patient safety. Therefore, in collaboration with the FDA and after careful consideration of the principles outlined in the DILI guidance, the sponsor has established procedures to ensure early detection of possible DILI and study drug discontinuation in the context of suspected DILI. 6.18: Study and Site Discontinuation New text. Additionally, if more than three patients develop a CTCAE grade 3 or higher event in the same category, or if three or more patients meet one of the individual stopping rules, the safety and dose escalation review committee (5.5) will convene to evaluat e the findings. Further, dosing will be stopped in randomized patients and no new patients will be randomized until the safety and dose escalation review committee reviews and evaluates the findings. Expanded upon the definition of the original stopping cr iteria “incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicating a potential hazard to patients.”"
