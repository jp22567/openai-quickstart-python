In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsib le for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information Obesity is common, serious and costly . In the U.S. alone, more than one -third of adults and 17% of youth have obesity3. Obesit y is a multifactorial, chronic disease that is associated with major comorbidities, including hy pertension, hy pergl ycemia, T2DM , dyslipidemia, certain ty pes of cancer, obstructive sleep apnea and atherosclerosis4, 5 6 7in combination leading to reduced life expectancy8, 9. Patients with obesity also suffer from physical s ymptoms (e.g., joint pain, urinary incontinence ), functional limitations (e.g. ,impaired mobility ), and ps ycho -social problems ( e.g., body image di sorders and depression)10-14. In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3.4 million deaths, 4% of y ears of life lost, and 4% of disability -adjusted life y ears worldwide15. Intensive behaviour therapy for obesit y has produced mean weight losses of 8 -10% of initial weight across clinical trials16and significant reduct ions in the risk for developing T2DM and cardiovascular disease17, 18. Importantl y, shorter -term and perhaps more patient -centric benefits of weight loss ,such as alleviation of sy mptoms of obesity (joint pain, urinary incontinence), functional limitations (such as decreased mobility ), depression, a nd improved quality of life has alsobeen observed19. Weight losses of this magnitude can be induced by a high intensit y program of lifestyle modification consisting of hy po-caloric diet, increased phy sical activity , and frequent behaviour therap y provided in counselling sessions in 6 months. This is the frequency of group or individual counse lling recommended by a recent NIH expert panel20. It is also the frequency of brief (approximately 15-minute s) individual counselling prescribed and reimbursed in primary care for patients with obesit y (body mass index ( BMI )≥30 kg/m2) by the Center sfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)21. After 6 months, most subjects will equilibrate (caloric intake balancing energy expenditure) and will require adjustment of energy balance if they are to lose additional weight. Continued intervention contact after initial weight loss treatment is associated with better mai ntenance of lost weight, with more frequent visits associated with greater weight loss20. The CMS schedule specifies monthly visits after 6 months21. Remarkably , the efficacy of the specific CMS model of counselling (CMS -IBT) has not been evaluated. CONFIDENTIAL"

A total of 282 subjects will be randomised in a 1:1 manner to receive either liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo, as an adjunct to CMS -IBT. Throughout the 56 -week treatment period, subjects will attend site visits to monitor response to treatment and 23 brief ( approximately 15-minute) behavioural counselling visits (see Section 2). A 30 -day follow -up period is included after the 56 -week treatment period in accordance with FDA guidance32. Figure 5–1 Trial Design 5.2 Rationale for trial design A randomised controlled and double -blinded trial design is used to minimise bias in the assessment of the effect and safet y of liraglutide 3.0 mg vs placebo, both as an adjunct to CMS -IBT18, 23. To minimise missing data and in line with current clinical recommendations33, subjects discontinuing randomised treatment prematurel y are encouraged to stay in the trial and continue CMS -IBTand the scheduled site visits. This is to mimic the ‘real- world’ situation of an approved weight loss drug.

Based on the weight loss time course established in phase 3a trials, trial duration of 56 weeks is considered sufficient to measure the full effect of liraglutide 3.0 mg on the weight loss curve. 5.3 Treatment of subjects 5.3.1 Investigational medicinal product The investigational medicinal product ( IMP)is injected subcutaneousl y (s.c. ) once dail y for 56 weeks. Dose escalation of trial product will take place during the first 4 weeks after randomisation (see Table 5–1). Table 5–1 Dose Escalation and treatment period IMP Dose Duration Liraglutide/placebo 0.6 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 1.2 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 1.8 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 2.4 mg 1 week Liraglutide/placebo 3.0 mg 52 weeks Follow up period 0 mg 4 weeks If the subject does not tolerate an increased dose during the dose escalation window, the investigator can delay the dose escalation b y maintaining the subject at the current dosage step for one additional week. Such a delay is allowed onl y once during dose escal ation (i.e. maximum allowed time for complete dose escalation to 3.0 mg is 5 weeks ). After reaching the maintenance dose (3.0 mg), the dose anddosing frequency should not be changed. If a single dose is missed, once -daily regimen should be resumed as pre scribed at the next scheduled dose. If more than 3 consecutive day s have elapsed since the last dose, subject should re- initiate dose escalation, (i.e.,restart the dosing at 0.6 mg and follow the dose escalation schedule again ) . This is done to reduce the occurrence of gastrointestinal sy mptoms associated with re - initiation of treatment. NB: Additional or increased dose should not be taken to make up for missed doses. Trial product can be taken at any time of day , irrespective of timing of meals. Trial pr oduct can be injected subcutaneousl y in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm. The injection site and timing can be changed without dose adjustment. NB: Trial product must not be administered intravenously or intramuscularly . CONFIDENTIAL"

For treatment discontinuation reasons, please refer to Section 6.5. In case this happens, it is acceptable to restart trial product (at the discretion of investigator and according to the local clinical practice); the dose must be escalated according to the algorithm above, and date of restart and rationale must be docum ented in the CRF. 5.3.2 Counselling (i ntensive behaviour t herapy) The CMS intensive behaviour therap y (CMS -IBT)will consist of counselling on diet, ph ysical activity and other lifest yle modification s . Subjects will attend a total of 23 individual approximate 15-minutes sessions during the 56 weeks . The CMS -IBTwill be delivered by a primary care physician, a nurse practitioner , a clinical nurse specialist, or phy sician assistant. Registered dieticians are also eligible to provide lifesty le counselling under CMS rules, when supervised b y a nurse practitioner or phy sician35. The individual performing the CMS- IBT is called interventionist in this protocol. Interventionists will be trained in obesit y and its behavioural management prior to beginning the trial and provided on- going assistance and share better practice in how to perform CMS -IBTduring the trial. The content of the CMS -IBT is based on an abbreviated version of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) employ ing the 5A counselling framework (As k, Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist )36,37. The structure and content of each CMS -IBTsession is specified in a nIBT guide, consisting of an interventionist part and a subject hand out .Generally each CMS -IBT session will begin with the subject being weighed and informed of the weight change . Then the subject and interventionist will review the s ubject’s completion of food and physical activity records (see S ection 8.7.1) and the interventionist assist swith solving individual problems. In addition to the above, each CMS -IBTsession will cover a specific topic , for example, advice on diet or phy sical activity as well as lifesty le modification ( e.g., challenging negative thoughts, obtaining social support). Most of the topics will be accompanied b y a homework assignment from the IBT guide to be completed before the next session with the interventionist. CMS -IBTsessions that cannot be completed on -site (be cause of illness, travel, etc.), may be completed on telephone in few cases. Calorie targets Caloric deficit and diet composition are aligned with clinical evidence -based guidelines for management of overweight and obesity in adults20. CONFIDENTIAL"

If asubject achieve sa BM I ≤ 22 kg/m2, the recommended energy intake will be re-calculated with no caloric deficit for the remainder of the trial. The diet will consist of conventional foods with approximately 15-20% kcal from protein, 20 -35% from fat, and the remainder from carboh ydrate. Carbohy drate intake should be monitored by the interventionist. Carbohy drate intake from vegetable s, frui ts, whole grains, legumes and dai ry products should be advised38. Meal plans may be provided. Subjects will be instructed to record their food and calorie intake daily (see S ection 8.7.1 ). Physical activity targets All subjects will initially be prescribed 100 min utes physical activity per week ( e.g., walking or similar aerobic activity ). Subjects should be phy sically active in bouts of >10 min utesin duration with moderate intensity (such as brisk walking), and the phy sical activity should be spread equall y across 4-5 day s each week. Phy sical activity should progress graduall y by 25 min utesevery 4 weeks until 250 min utes/week, consistent with targets required for maintenance of lost weight39. Subjects will be instructed to record thei r physical activity daily using a phy sical activity tracker provided b y NN (see Section 8.7.1)17, 37. 5.4 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. After premature discontinu ation of trial product (temporary /permanent), the subject should still remain in the tri al and follow the IBT sessions and site visits if possible, see Section 8.1. The investigator must note down in the medical record and eCRF if the subject has re- started the trial product , see Section 5.3.1. 5.5 Rationale for treatment Subjects are treated for a period of 56 weeks in order to be able to evaluate the full effect of treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg on the primary and secondary endpoints.

Also, the regulatory authorities’ guidelines for trials in weight management state that the duration of at least 1 y ear is deemed appropriate to evaluate eff icacy , safet y and tolerability . The comparator in the trial is placebo in order to evaluate the absolute safety and efficacy of liraglutide 3.0 mg. Combining frequent behavioural counselling, highly structured hy po-caloric diets and increased physical activity is an effective tool for ac hieving and maintaining weight loss. I t has been shown to be more effective than less intensive lifesty le modification programs for inducing weight loss18, and combining IBT and pharmacologic treatment leads to more weight loss than pharmacologic treatment alone23. Subjects in the trial will receive CMS -IBT irrespective of thetreatment arm they belong to. The CMS -IBT mandates 22 sessions within a span of one year (52 weeks). Since the treatment duration is 56 weeks, an extra CMS- IBT session has been added at week 56. CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (s ee Section 2). Informed consent must be obtained before an y tria l-related activity ;see Section 18.2. The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Onl y subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolmen t log may be combined in one log. At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address( es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to retur n the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6 -digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Fasting requirements The subjects should be fasting when attending some visits, please see flow chart (Section 2). Fasting is defined as at least 8 hours without food and drink intake, except water and other prescribed medication. Trial product and other glucose lowering agents should be withheld on the day of the visit until blood sampling have been performed. If the subject attends a fasting visit in a non-fasting stat e , the blood sampling should be re- scheduled within the visit window. Screening failures For screening failures ,the screening failure form in the electronic case report form (eCRF) must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed b y the investigator into the eCRF. Follo w-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the I WRS. The case book must be signed. Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion, exclusion , or randomisation criteri a, this includes re -sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criterion related to laboratory parameters.

If a subject meets a discontinuation criterion, the trial product must be immediatel y discontinued and the date should be noted in the medical records and eCRF. Discontinuation can be either temporary or permanent. The last paragraph of Section 6.5outlines which discontinuation can be considered temporary .The investigator must note down the date in the medical record and the eCRF once the re is resolution and the subject has re -started the trial product. The subject may also wish to discontinue trial product temporaril y or permanently, irrespective meeting an y criteria. Discontinuation of treatment with trial product, whether temporary or permanent, must not prompt the investigator to w ithdraw the subject from the trial. Instead, the subject should maintain adherence to trial visits (including CMS -IBT) and procedures to the extent possible. In cases where the subject is not willing to attend all scheduled visits after discontinuation of trial product, efforts must be made to collect as much of the scheduled data as possible. Especially important is collection of the data points (primarily body weight) at visit 24 ( week 56 ). Statistical considerations emphasizing the importance can be foun d in Section 17. Premature trial product discontinuation should be registered in the eCRF and in I WRS. T he trial product can be interrupted by performing a ‘treatment status’ session in IWRS , to indicate subject should no longer receive trial product. The primary reason for discontinuation of trial product must be specified when recording the treatment discontinuation in the eCRF. If the disconti nuation of trial product is judged permanent or of a longer period, drug accountability until discontinuation must be performed in IWRS. If the subject has previously discontinued trial product, it is possible, at the discretion of the investigator and at the wish of the subject, to re -initiate treatment with trial product. This will only apply ,if it can be confirmed that the subject has not withdrawn consent, and does not fulfil any of the criteria leading to permanent discontinuation or if a criterion l eading to temporary discontinuation has been resolved. A ‘ treatment status’ session is performed in the I WRS, to indicate that the subject should again receive trial product. See Section 10for registration in I WRS. This should be further noted in the medical records and eCRF . Withdrawal from trial A subject who wishes to withdraw their consent must be withdrawn from the trial. If a subject wants towithdraw consent, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures similar to those for end -of- CONFIDENTIAL"

I f the subject agrees, the follow -up visit must be performed at least 30 day s after discontinuation of trial product. Theend-of-trial form in the eCRF must be completed, and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. The investigator must perform a ‘treatment status’ session in I WRS and discontinue trial product fo r this subject. The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while full y respecting the subject’s rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawing consent must be specified in the end-of- trial form in the eCRF. Lost to follow- up If a subject loses contact with the study staff or does not come for visit 24 or v isit 25, attempts must be made to locate the subject and obtain relevant safet y information. A subject cannot be deemed lost to follow -up until at least substantial contacts with family /relatives/family physician have been attempted . Subject information may be retrieved from other heal th care professionals, medical records or publicly available records. A subject will only be considered lost to follow -up in case vital status cannot be determined at the time of visit 25 for that subject. 8.2 Subject -related information/assessments 8.2.1 Demograph y Demograph y will be recorded at screening and consists of: Date of birth (according to local regulation) Sex Ethnicity (according to local regulation) Race (according to local regulation) 8.2.2 Concomitant illness and medical history A concomitant illness is any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. , at the screening visit) or found as a result of a screening procedure or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product.

A direct and timed measure of walking ability , the 6MWT is technically simple, reproducible, and when administrators are well trained, readil y standardi sed. The goal is for the subject to walk as far as possible in six minutes without running. The subject is allowed to self- pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway of 66 feet (20 m) (see Figure 8–1). The primary outcome is the distance covered in feetover 6 minutes48, 49. Toensure adequate 6MWT standardisation across clinical sites and test administrators, training materials will be developed and provided to all clinical sites prior to subject recruitment. Specificall y, all principal investigators and 6MWT clinical site administrators will receive an instruction manual, providing detailed instructions for administration of the 6MWT. I n addition to the instruction manual, each 6MWT administrator will have a checklist that must be completed prior to initiating each test administration to confirm and documen t that specific test administration criteria are met (e.g., the test is assessed along a flat, straight, enclosed corridor that is at least 6 feet wide; proper footwear as judged b y the investigator is worn b y the subject or otherwise noted)50.

Thus, the stimulation of insulin release and inhibition of glucagon release subsides as the blood glucose decreases and approach eugl ycemia. Therefore, the risk of hy pogly caemia in subjects without T2DM is considered to be low. A hy poglycaemic episode during the trial should be recorded as an AE according to standard AE reporting (see Section 12). Subjects should be instructed in potential sy mptoms of hy poglycaemia: sweating, trembling, hunger or palpitations (rapid or irregular heart beat), confusion, drowsiness, speech difficulty , visual disturbances, odd behaviour, impaired balance or incoordinatio n (reduced ability to coordinate movement). According to ADA classification, a severe episode of hy poglycaemia is defined as an episode requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohy drate, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the return of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced b y low plasma glucose concentration51. Such a severe episode of hy poglycaemia must be reported as a SAE (see S ection 12.2). Blood glucose meters will not be handed out to subjects in this trial. 8.4.6 Patient Health Questionnaire -9 The patient health questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9)is a 9 -item depression module of the patient health questionnaire, which is a self -administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders52. The questionnaire will be available in a linguisticall y validate d version in subject’s fluent language. Subjects should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires b y themselves without interruption. I t takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

The questionnaire will be administered as an interview b y the investigator or a qualified delegate. The questionnaire will be available in a linguistically validated vers ion in the subject’s fluent language. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Prior to administering the C- SSRS questionnaire, the investigator or qualified delegate must complete sufficient training. Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 within the past 30 day s at screening or randomisation excludes the subject from participation in the trial. 8.4.8 Breast and colon neoplasms follow up These forms must be completed at the end -of-treatment and follow-up visit, even if a subject prematurel y discontinues trea tment with trial product. The breast neoplasm follow up form should be filled in only for female subjects. If a subject withdraws consent, the subject must be encouraged to provide this information. 8.5 Laboratory assessments The laboratory anal yses will be p erformed b y a central laboratory . The central laboratory may utilise subcontractors. Descriptions of assay methods, laboratory supplies and procedures for obtaining samples, handling, transportation and storage of samples and information regarding who will perform the assessments, will be described in a trial specific laboratory manual, provided by the central laboratory (for central laboratory details, see Attachment 1 ). The laboratory equipment may provide anal yses not requested in the protocol but produ ced automatically in connection with the requested analy ses according to specifications in the laboratory standard operating procedures. Such data will not be transferred to the trial database, but abnormal values will be reported to the investigator. The investigator must review all laboratory results for concomitant illnesses and AEs and report these according to Section 8.2.2 and Section 12). Laboratory samples may be drawn on another day than the day of the actual visit, as long as it is within the visit window outlined in the flow chart (see Section 2). For some of the samples drawn during the trial, i t is required that the subject is fasting. If a subject is not fasting at these visits, the fasting blood sampling must, as a minimum, be re -scheduled within the visit window. Laboratory results will be sent by the central laboratory to the investigator on an on -going basis. Samples will be destroy ed no later than at finalisation of the clinical trial report (CTR).

If the trial product is re -started, the investigator must note this in the medical record. 8.6.2 Food diary and tracking of physical activity The subjects will be requested to fill in a food diary daily, where all meals and their caloric content are recorded. The interventionist can provide a paper food diary or the subject can use another tracker, tool or app to register food intake ,as preferred by the subject. Daily minutes of phy sical activity will be captured using a device provided by Novo Nordisk . The subject’s adherence with diet and phy sical activit y must be reviewed at all CMS- IBT visits by the interventionist (see Section 8.7.1). The adherence will be further recorded in the eCRF. 8.6.3 Training in the PDS290 pen- injector The subjects must be trained in how to handle the PDS290 pen- injector when handed out the f irst time. Training must be repeated during the trial at each visit if needed, in order to ensure correct use of the device. The following should be emphasised: Alway s use a new needle for each injection as this will prevent contamination and blocked needles When using the first time, priming the pen to ensure product flow The needle should be kept in the skin while counting slowl y to 6 (or as described in the direction for use) after the dose counter has returned to zero after injection.

At each CMS -IBT session, the interventionist must, for each calendar week since the last visit, assess and record the number of day s per calendar week, where the subject has entered information in the food diary (see Section 5.3.2). In addition, how phy sicall y active the subject has been per week for each calendar week since the last visit w ill be recorded. The result must be noted in the subjects’ record in eCRF. Ifa subject is found to be non- adherent, the interventionist should remind the subject of the importance of following the advice given. The interventionist will help the subjects solve issues with non- adherence as part of the counselling (see Section 5.3.2). 8.8 Additional safety assessments 8.8.1 Suspicion of acute pancreatitis If pancreatitis is suspected, trial product should promptly be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in I WRS before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed) and appropriate management should be initiated. Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of am ylase and lipase. The event should be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.2.2 and Section 12). The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features: Abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) Serum lipase activity (and/or amy lase activity ) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal Characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging (CT/MRI) .

The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Phy sical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. Lipase and amylase In general, both am ylase and lipase are elevate d during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amy lase. The level of the serum am ylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severit y of acute pancreatitis. I n general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum am ylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, the subject must be permanently discontinued from trial product and appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject sho uld be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should still remain in the trial (see Section 8.1). If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product sh ould be re -initiated at the investigator’s discretion. 8.8.2 Suspicion of acute gallstone disease In case of suspicion of acute gallstone disease or cholelithiasis, the trial product should promptly be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made i n IWRS before a diagnosis of acute gallstone disease is confirmed). Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should remain in the trial (see Section 8.1) The event should be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection (see Section 8.4.2.2 and Section 12). If acute gallstone disease is confirmed, the trial product must be permanently discontinued. Appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated. Furthermore, the subject should remain in the trial (see Section 8.1). Trial product can be restarted at the investigator´s discretion if cholelithiasis is ruled out or the gallbladder has been removed. 8.8.3 Neoplasm In case of neoplasm, please consider if the trial drug should be discontinued (no ‘treatment status’ session should be made in I WRS before a diagnosis is confirmed).

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. ,an abnormalit y that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example , change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due t o the abnormalit y. The following should not be reported as AEs: Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre- existing conditions should be reported as medi cal history or concomitant illness). Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned ha s worsened from the first trial- related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: Severity –Mild –no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate –marked s ymptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe –considerable interference with the su bject’s daily activities; unacceptable. Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product (s): –Probable -Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible -A causal relationship is conceivable and canno t be dismissed. –Unlikely -The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the tria l or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae -The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury , treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets a SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as a SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal -This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as a SAE. –Unknown -This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow -up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at an y dose results in any of the following: Death. A life -threateningaexperience. In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. A congenital anomal y or birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be consid ered a SAE when -based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition o f SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: –Is admitte d to a hospital or in- patient, irrespective of the duration of ph ysical stay , or –Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must alway s be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regard ed as a hospitalisation.

Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c.A substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions ( e.g., following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption i n his/her body function or structure, ph ysical activity and/or quality of life). d.For example ,intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasia or convulsions that does not result in hospitalis ation, or develo pment of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following adverse even ts must alway s be reported as a SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product risk of liver injury defined as alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL , where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law ). 12.1.3 Non- serious adverse event A non- serious AE is an y AE which does not fulfil the definition of a SAE. 12.1.4 Medication errors A medication error concerning trial products is defined as: Administration of wro ng drug or use of wrong device . Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error Wrong route of administration, such as intram uscular instead of s.c. Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm, m isuse or abuse of trial product Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. That is a dose lower or higher than 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 mg respectively (within 24 hours). However, the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likel y to happen as judged b y the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur If the subject discontinues trial product prematurely , this should not be reported as a medication error (see Section 8.4.2.1).

This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post -treatment follow -up period ( 30 day s). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below (seeFigure 12–1). During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example, by asking: “Have you experienced an y problems since the last contact? ” In addition, the subject should be asked about the mood for example – ‘How has y our mood been since the last contact?’ All AEs, observed b y the investigator or subject, must be report ed by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a safet y information form must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one safet y information form can be used to describe all the SAEs. For all non-serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. Timelines for initial reporting of AEs The investigator must complete the following forms in the eCRF within the specified timelines: SAEs: The AE form within 24 hours and the safety information form within 5 calendar days of the investigator’s first knowledge of the SAE. Both forms must be signed within 7 calendar days from the date the infor mation was entered in the eCRF. For SAEs requiring reporting on a specific event form :Inaddition to the above ,the specific event form must be signed within 14 calendar days from the investigator’s first knowledge of the AE.

Novo Nordisk may need to report this adverse event to relevant regulatory authorities. 12.3 Follow -up of adverse events The investigator must record follow -up information by updating the forms in the eCRF. Follow -up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “r ecovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow -up information should on ly include new ( e.g., corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non -serious AEs which subsequently become SAEs. Non-serious AE s:Non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until the end of the follow -up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be close d with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow -up period and is expected by the investigator to recover.

Definition of primary endpoint :% weight change Change in bod y weight (%) from baseline to week 56, denote d % weight change, is calculated as body weight at week 56 minus body weight at baseline divided by body weight at baseline and multiplied by 100; therefore % weight change= (body weight at week 56 -body weight at baseline) body weight at baseline×100. A ne gativ e value of % weight change indicates a body weight loss from baseline to week 56. Definition of primary endpoint :5% responder s The proportion of subjects having lost at least 5% of baseline bod y weight at week 56, denoted 5% responders, is defined as the proportion having % weight change ≤ − 5%. A 5% responder is defined as a subject fulfilling this, therefore 5% responder =   1 if % weight change ≤ − 5% 0 if % weight change > − 5% CONFIDENTIAL"

But for the sample size calculations, it is assumed that all subjects who discontinue will not return at week 56 and that they have a % weight change like placebo subjects who completed the trial. I t is expected that % weight change for liraglutide 3. 0 mg subjects who discontinue might be somewhere in between completing placebo subjects and completing lira glutide 3.0 mg subjects. The assumption is thus expected to lead to a conservative effect estimate . In trial NN8022 -1839 in non-diabetic subjects andwith obesity , around 31% treatment discontinuations were observed in the placebo group, around 25% in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group. The calculated sample size ensures adequate power if the proportion of discontinuing su bjects should be as high as 30% . Based on findings from NN8022 - 1839, a difference in % weight change between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo of - 5 (-9% vs. - 4 %, SD=7) is assumed among completing subjects. For sample size calculation , a common SD of 7 was assumed for completers of liraglutide 3.0 mg or placebo. In NN8022 -1839, a SD of 6.65 was seen for % weight change among subjects completing liraglutide 3.0 mg at week 56; 5.88 was observed among subjects completing placebo. Adjusting for 30% discontinuation and using a mixture di stribution, a difference of -3.5 is expected in the primary analysis. A sample size of 282 subjects (141 in each arm) ,gives a marginal power of 98.3%. For the primary endpoint 5% responders ,the expected proportions were calculated based on the same assum ptions as above. Adjusting for 30% discontinuation gives an expected 5% responders proportion of 63% i n the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm and 44% in the placebo arm. With 282 subjects , this results in a marginal power of 90%. Given these assumptions, the sample s ize of 282 subjects (141 in each arm) ,results in a combined power of 88.5% . The tests of superiorit y of liraglutide 3.0 mg to placebo for each of the confirmatory endpoints are performed hierarchically in the order in which the endpoints are presented (see Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.1 ). The two primary endpoints are included in the statistical testing hierarch y, and the primary objective will be met if superior ity of liraglutide 3.0 mg vs. placebo is demonstrated for each of the primary endpoints. The test hierarchy is given in Table 17–3 with underl ying assumptions, marginal power and effective power. The effective was calculated using a naïve and conservat ive approach, which assumes no correlation of endpoints by multiply ing the respective marginal power s.

If the value measured at the randomisation visit is missing and the assessment has been made at screening, then the screening value will be used as the baseline value. 17.3.2.2 Handling of missing values at week 56 Missing values at week 56 will be imputed and the relevant endpoints will be derived from the imputed values. Several approaches for imputation of missing values at week 56 will be applied. First, a description of the primary imputation approach used to address the effe ctiveness estimand for the primary endpoints is given. This is followed by a description of a number of sensitivity analyses. Primary approach for handling of missing values The primary approach for multiple imputations of missing values of body weight at week 56 (t ype MT+MD) for both the liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo group is by sampling among all available assessments at week 56 in the placebo group (type AT+AD). This approach is also known as jump to reference and makes the assumption that subjects inst antly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment bey ond what can be expected from placebo treatment as adjunct to diet and exercise55. Body weight measurements at visits between baseline and week 56 are not used f or this imputation approach. The multiple imputation approach is done in three steps. Imputation : Step 1 defines an imputation model based on placebo subjects, which is used to impute missing body weight values at week 56 in both arms. This will be done 10 0 times CONFIDENTIAL"

A more detailed explanation of this step is given below. Analysis : Step 2 analyses each of the 100 complete data sets, using the statistical model defined in Section 17.3.1.1 and 17.3.1.2, and saves the 100 estimation results. Pooling: Step 3 integrates the 100 estimation results into a final result using Rubin’s formula . The imputation model in step 1, uses placebo subjects from FAS with non -missing body weight measurements at baseline and week 56. The imputation model is a linear regression of bod y weight (kg) at week 56 on the factors an d covariates listed in Table 17–4 (except randomised treatment ) with no interactions. The estimated posterior d istribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation model is then used to impute missing week 56 body weig ht values for both randomised treatment arms. If 100 copies are not sufficient to establish stable results, a hig her number will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 80224274 as seed number . Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints for the effectiveness estimand The sensitivity anal yses will address the robustness of the primary approach for handling of missing values . In particular the sensitivity anal yses address how assumptions on how body weight progresses after discontinuation of randomised treatment impact t he estimated treatment difference between liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo. The sensitivity anal yses include the following. A multiple imputation approach as described b y McEvoy56where missing body weight measurement at week 56 for non -retrieved drop -outs (ty pe MD) are imputed by sampling from values obtained from retrieved drop -outs (type AD) in each randomised treatment arm and according to the timing (monthl y) of last available observation (of body weigh t) on randomised treatment (LAO -OT). Missing body weight measurements at week 56 for subjects on drug treatment (ty pe MT) are imputed by sampling from t ype AT in the relevant randomised treatment arm. Thus, the imputat ion model for each randomised treatmen tarm and timing of LAO -OT is a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 56 on the factors and covariates listed in Table 17–4 (except randomised treatment arm) with no interactions and LAO -OT of body weight. If timing b y month is too restrictive , quarters, half -years, or excluding timing will be used. A weighted ANCOVA (wANCOVA) where returning drug discontinuing subjects (AD) are up-weighted relat ive to their proportion of all drug discontinuing subjects (AD+MD) to account for the subjects not returning for assessments at week 5656. Similar ly,AT subjects are up -weighted relative to their proportion of a ll drug continuing subjects (AT+MT). The up-w eighing is done by randomised treatment arm and the timing of LAO -OT.

Missing weight measurement at week 56 for subjects who drop -out (ty pe MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after last available observation (LAO) of bod y weight. Change from baseline is truncated whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. LAO does not need to be the same as LAO -OT as subjects are a llowed to come to scheduled visits after discontinuing randomised treatment. When a subject's LAO represents a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 56. Missing weight measurement at week 56 for subjects on treatment (t ype MT) will be imputed using the LAO. The weight regain imputation wil l be done for both randomised treatment arms. Additionally , a version where onl y the liraglutide 3.0 mg arm uses the regain rate while the placebo arm uses LAO (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed. Tipping point anal ysis. In a similar manner as above for a range of weight regain rates (starting from 0.1 kg/month and in intervals of 0.1 kg/month) for MD in liraglutide 3.0 mg arm will be used to define a tipping point in which superiority of liraglutide 3.0 mg disappears. In this analy sis, the placebo arm will be imputed by LAO. Figure 17–1 and Table 17–5give an overview of the handling of missing values at week 56 assessments. Additional sensitivity analyses Additional analyses will investigate how sensitive the primary statistical models (for primary endpoints) are to the choice of factors and covariates in the model as follows: A model resembling the primary analy sis models using the same imputation method (jump to reference) adjusting onl y for basel ine bod y weight and randomised treatment arm. The imputation model (step 1) will be same as for the primary approach. For the binary primary endpoint, the risk difference (unadjusted for any factors and covariates) and corresponding 95% CI will also be calculated. 17.3.3 Analysis method addressing the efficacy estimand for the primary endpoints The efficacy estimand for % weight change will be assessed using a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM). The MMRM will use assessments only from subjects who are taking the randomised treatment until end of trial or at first discontinuing of trial drug (either temporaril y or permanentl y). A pause of less than three consecutive day s is not regarded as discontinuatio n for this analysis. This means that assessments at week 56 for retrieved drop- outs (ty pe AD) will be CONFIDENTIAL"

Secondary endpoints addressing the first of the secondary efficacy objectives Supportive secondary endpoints will be evaluated to address the effectiveness estimand . These endpoints will be analy sed using the same MI approach as used for the primary and confirmatory endpoints and to address the effectiveness estimand. The statistical model for continuous endpoints will be ANCOVA with covaria tes listed in Table 17–4 with baseline body weight replaced by baseline measurement of endpoint to be analysed. The statistical model for proportions will be anal ysed using logistic regression.

In addition, relative change of bod y weight will be summarized descriptively stratified by visits and different adherence categories, which will be defined based on the distribution of observed data. Exploratory analysis of week 16 responders In this exploratory analy sis, subjects who lost ≥4% of their baseline bod y weight at week 16 after randomisation are considered as ‘week 16 responders’. Subjects who lost <4% of their baseline body weight at week 16 after randomisation are considere d as ‘week 16 non- responders’. Hence, four ‘week 16 r esponse’ groups can be defined: 1.≥4% weight loss at 16 weeks (liraglutide 3.0 mg) 2.<4% weight loss at 16 weeks (liraglutide 3.0 mg ) 3.≥4% weight loss at 16 weeks (placeb o) 4.<4% wei ght loss at 16 weeks (placebo) The change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 56 will be explored among the four ‘week 16 response’ groups based on desc riptive statistics only . Since the comparisons of the four ‘week 16 response’ groups are influenced b y post -randomisation factors, no formal testing will be done. 17.4.3.2 Safety endpoints Descriptive statistics for all safet y endpoints will be provided with the aim to compare liraglutide 3.0 mg and placebo. All anal yses and tabulations will be done using the safety anal ysis set. Unless otherwise stated, no formal statistical analyses are pl anned for the safet y endpoints.

Risks and precautions The sections below describ e identified and potential risks associated with liraglutide treatment. Th e identified/potential risks are based on findings in non -clinical and clinical trials with liraglutide as well as other GLP -1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Neoplasms Subjects with overweight and obesity have an increased risk of certain ty pes of cancer. In the clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg, the reporting rate of neoplasm events confirmed b y external independent event adjudication comm ittee was similar with liraglutide and placebo. Thus, the overall risk of neoplasms and cancer in the weight management trials was low and balanced between treatment groups. Thyroid C -cell tumours Liraglutide causes th yroid C -cell tumours (MTC) at clinical ly relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. Studies in mice demonstrated that liraglutide- induced C -cell proliferation was dependent on the GLP -1 receptor and that liraglutide did not cause activ ation of the rearranged during t ransfection (RET) protooncogene in thy roid C -cells. Human relevance of th yroid C -cell tumours in mice and rats is unknown and has not been determined b y clinical or nonclinical studies. Data from the intensive monitoring of calcitonin (a marker for MTC) in plasma in the li raglutide clinical development programme , do not support an effect of liraglutide on calcitonin levels in humans. As a precaution subjects with personal or family history of MT C, or MEN2 will not be enrolled in the trial. Calcitonin wil l be monitored as pe r flow chart, see Section 2. Subjects with elev ated calcitonin (≥ 100 ng/L) will be discontinued on liraglutide 3.0 mg and appropriate clinical follow-up will be initiated, see Appendix A . Breast and colon tumours Based on a limited number of reports in th e clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg, a numerical imbalance was observed for events of breast neoplasms in females and colorectal adenomas in males. There were too few cases to determine wh ether these cases were related to liraglutide. In addition, there are insufficient data to determine whether liraglutid e has an effect on pre-existing breast neoplasia. Two positively adjudicated cases of malignant colorectal carcinoma were reported in liraglutide -treated subjects and none in placebo -treated subjects. CONFIDENTIAL"

T he long -term clinical effects of the increase in resting heart rate have not been established. There is no indication that the effect on resting heart rate is dose dependent and the increase in heart rate disappears upon treatment discontinuation. When ini tiating treatment with liraglutide 3.0 mg, heart rate should be monitored at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Allergic reactions As in the case with all protein- based pharmaceuticals ,treatment with liraglutide may evoke allergic reactio ns. These may include urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaph ylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected h ypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects wi ll be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hy persensitivity reaction occurs Pancreatitis An association between the use of GLP -1RAs and pancreatitis has been suggested based on case reports receive d in clinical trials and during the post -marketing experience with liraglutide (in T2DM) and other GL P-1RAs. Few events of pancreatitis have been reported in clinical trials with liraglutide in weight management. After initiation of liraglutide 3.0 mg, sub jects must be observed carefully for signs and s ymptoms of pancreatitis (see Section 8.8.1). If pancreatitis is suspected, liraglutide 3.0 mg should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. I f pancreatitis is confirmed, liraglutide 3.0 mg should not be restarted. Subjects with a history of pancreatitis are excluded from participation in the trial. Acute gallstone diseas e Cases of gallstones (cholelithiasis) and inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecy stitis) were reported more commonly in adult subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg compared to placebo in the clinical development programme for liraglutide 3.0 mg. From literature, it is well- known that obesity carries an increased risk of cholelithiasis and that a n association between rapid and/or marked weight loss and the development of cholelithiasis is present58. If cholelithiasis is suspected, treatment should be discontinued and gallbladder examination and appropriate clinical follow -up should be initiated. Gastrointestinal adverse events The most frequentl y reported adverse events in subjects trea ted with liraglutide 3.0 mg were gastrointestinal (nausea and diarrhoea), with onset during the first weeks; these were mostly mild to moderate, and transient. Other gastrointestinal adverse events (GI AEs) included: d yspepsia, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal pain. Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose CONFIDENTIAL"

If subjects do not tolerate an increased dose during dose escalation, dose escalation may be delay ed for approximately one additional week. Renal impairment GLP-1 RAs may cause nausea, vomiting or diarrho ealeading to loss of fluids (dehy dration). Dehydration may cause renal impairment and acute renal failure. Subjects treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to gastrointestinal side effects and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. Benefits In the present trial, subjects will be treated with caa regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into the trial. In the clinical development programme, approximately 2/3 of the subjects lost more than 5% of their initial body weight and approxi mately 1/3 lost more than 10% of their initial body weight. Even a modest weight loss decreases the risk of ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hy pertension and premature cardio -vascular death in patients with obesity (see Section 3.1). Furthermore, improvements in patient reported health- related quality of life and phy sical function have been observed with weight loss. Although subjects will have to spen d time on site visits and procedures required b y trial participation, it is expected that all subjects (including those subjects randomised to placebo) will benefit from the behavioural counselling and increased ph ysical activity , with close follow -up of t heir obesity and a careful medical examination. All of which will result in an intensified management of their obesit y. Conclusion Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. These precautions include thorough information regarding the correct administration of the trial products and gradual dose adjustment. I t is important to note that the target population for liraglutide 3.0 mg is already at serious risk from obesit y and its associated major co -morbidities. The overall efficacy and safet y results from the weight management programme demonstrated that the benefit -risk balance is in favour of liraglutide 3.0 mg, as an adjunct to a reduced -calorie diet and increased phy sical activity , within the investigated population of subjects with overweight and obesity . 18.2 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory require ment(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2.

Such information s hall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other phy sicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects study ing the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publ ish on its clinical trials website a redacted CTR for this trial. One investigator will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign the CTR (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator will be appointed based upon the criteria defined b y the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications59. 23.1 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure b y other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national r egulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure40. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example, when the CTR is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaborativel y by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 day s to protect intellectual propert y. In all cases , the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitati ons. All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. I n the event of an y disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be f airly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Where required b y the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the journal. CONFIDENTIAL"

I t is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and sh ould alway s reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission of a primary publication will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investi gator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C -cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with liraglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) is likel y indicative of C -cell neoplasia; the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively ) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of the neoplasia. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: renal d ysfunction smoking autoimmune thy roiditis several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta -blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C -cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co -morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderatel y affect calcitonin secretion by C -cells. CONFIDENTIAL"

In case a subject has a calcitonin value ≥ 10 ng/L, the algorithm outlined below should be followed. The algorithm applies for all calcitonin values including screening values. Pleas e report clinically significant abnormal values as an adverse event (see Section 12 in the protocol). 1.1 Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L Action: The subject (even if a screen failure) must immediately be referred to a thy roid specialist for further evaluation and the trial product must be discontinued (see protocol section 6.5 premature discontinuation of trial product). The subject can remain in the trial; however, all suspected medications must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background : These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thy roid nodular disease.1All of these patients were diagnosed with MTC resulting in a positive predictive value of 100 %. Diagnostic evaluation should include: thyroid ultrasound fine needle aspiration of any nodules >1 cm potent ially surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or MEN2 and perform a genetic test for RET proto -oncogene mutation. 1.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The s ubject (even if a screen failure) must be referred to a thy roid specialist for further evaluation. The subject can remain in the trial and continue on trial product. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C - cell hy perplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C- cell anomaly of 50%.

Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the subject is a screen failure, or if the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. Background: Calcitonin values from 20 -50 ng/L were found in up to 1% of subjects of the population of 5817 patients with thy roid nodular disease.1. The predictive value of a C- cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin v alues 10- 20 ng/L Costante et al1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patien t out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin of 33 ng/L, and had C -cell h yperplasia at surgery . Two other studies used a cut-off of CT > 10 ng/L to screen for C- cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal CT >10 and <20 ng/L to allow conclusions2, 3 CONFIDENTIAL"
