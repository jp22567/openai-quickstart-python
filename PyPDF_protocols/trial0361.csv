Page 3 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL AMENDMENT HISTORY Amendment 7 The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) convened on 8 March 2021 to evaluate the data from a planned formal interim analysis of overall survival (OS). The IDMC declared superiority of OS in patients receiving cemiplimab as compared to investigator’s choice (IC) chemotherapy. As a result of the assessment, protocol Amendment 7 is being implemented to provide a mechanism for eli gible patients randomized to chemotherapy to receive cemiplimab as part of a cemiplimab Extension Phase. Patients randomized to IC chemotherapy may screen to receive cemiplimab in the Extension Phase up to and including 30 June 2021. Patients previously on IC chemotherapy may continue up to 96 weeks on cemiplimab as per the Schedule of Events for the cemiplimab Extension Phase ( Table 3). All patients c urrently on cemiplimab may continue treatment up to 96 weeks. All patients receiving cemiplimab will do so as per the Schedule of Events for the cemiplimab Extension Phase (Table 3). Patients currently receiving IC chemotherapy (pemetrexed, gemcitabine, topotecan, irinotecan, or vinorelbine) may continue to be treated as long as, in the opinion of the investigator, they are continuing to derive benefit from the assigned treatment. As of Amendment 7 retreatment is no longer an option. As of Amendment 7, follow -up visits are no longer required. Detailed changes are in the following table: Description of Change Brief Rationale Section # and Name Added a cemiplimab Extension Phase so that patients previously randomized to the IC chemotherapy arm can receive cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W up to 96 weeks. Added language stating that patients currently on cemiplimab will also transition to the cemiplimab Exten sion Phase with pared -down assessments up to 96 weeks (inclusive of previous cemiplimab therapy). This is due to the observed superiority of OS in patients receiving cemiplimab as compared to IC chemotherapy at the second interim analysis. Cemiplimab continues to demonstrate a safety profile consistent in class.

Page 27 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL CLINICAL STUDY PROTO COL SYNOPSIS Title An Open -Label, Randomized, Phase 3 Clinical Trial of REGN2810 Versus Investigator's Choice of Chemotherapy in Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Carcinoma Site Location(s) Principal Investigator Patients will be enrolled at approximately 100 sites globally. The Principal Investigator is to be determined. Objectives The primary objective is to compare overall survival (OS) for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who have histology of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and who have any eligible histology, treated with either REGN2810 (cemiplimab) or investigator’s choice (IC) chemotherapy. The secondary objectives performed among SCC patients and among all eligible histologies (SCC and adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous carcinoma [AC]) are: • To compare progression -free survival (PFS) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy • To compare objective response rate (ORR) (partial response [PR] + complete respons e [CR]) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 • To compare the duration of response (DOR) of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy • To compare the safety profiles of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy by describing adverse events (AE) • To compare quality of life (QOL) for patients treated with cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 (EORTC QLQ -C30) Study Design This is an open -label, randomized, multi -center, phase 3 trial comparing cemiplimab versus IC of chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Approximately 590 patients will be randomized to either the experimental cemipli mab treatment arm or the IC of chemotherapy control treatment arm. In the experimental group, cemiplimab will be administered intravenously (IV) as a flat dose of 350 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). In the control group, IC chemotherapy options are 4 classes: (1 ) antifolate - pemetrexed, (2) topoisomerase 1 inhibitor - topotecan or irinotecan, (3) nucleoside analogue – gemcitabine, and (4) vinca alkaloid - vinorelbine. The only chemotherapy treatments allowed in the control arm are any of the 5 drugs that are li sted as IC options. Other agents in these classes are not permitted in this study.

27,page_27,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 28 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL The study includes 3 periods: screening, treatment, and follow -up. The screening period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). The screening period ends when the patient has been confirmed as fully eligible for the study and is randomized, or with confirmation that the patient is ineligible and is a screen failure. The treatment period begins within 5 days of randomization to 1 of the treatment arms. Cycle length is 6 weeks, and tumor imaging is planned to be conducted on day 42 (±7 days) of cycles 1–4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. Planned treatment is for up to 96 weeks. The treatment phase ends when the patient discontinues study therapy. There is no cross -over during this study. After completion of the treatment period, patients enter the follow up period. After the follow -up period, patients will be followed for survival. The second interim analysis demonstrated survival advantage for patients treated with cemiplimab over IC chemotherapy. As such, Amendment 7 will allow for an cemiplimab Extension Phase. Patients randomized to IC chemotherapy will have the option to receive monotherapy with cemiplimab. All randomized patients are eligible fo r this option provide they meet criteria per Section 7.1.7.1 and have not received anticancer immunotherapy. Patients randomized to and continuing treatment with cemiplimab will also enter the cemiplimab Extension Phase. Retreatment is no longer an opt ion as of Amendment 7. Study closeout procedures will be implemented following the last patient last visit of the cemiplimab Extension Phase Study Duration The duration of the study treatment period for a patient is up to 96 weeks (up to 16 cycles of 6 w eeks each), excluding the screening period. The follow -up period continues until death or study completion, per the sponsor and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). Population Sample Size: Approximately 460 SCC patients will be randomized 1:1 (230 per treatment arm) at approximately 100 sites globally. Approximately 590 patients in the overall population are projected to have accrued when the enrollment of SCC patients is completed. However, the actual number of patients in the overall population depends on the proportion of adenocarcinoma patients in the patient population and the time when Amendment 5 is implemented at each of the study sites. Target Population: The study will enroll women ≥18 years old with recurrent, persistent, and/or metastatic cervical cancer that has progressed after platinum -containing chemotherapy given to treat recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Patients who only received prior platinum -based therapy concurrently with radiation VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Starting with Amendment 5, only patients with squamous histology will be enrolled. Treatments Cemiplimab Dose/Route/Schedule: Cemiplimab will be administered IV as a flat dose of 350 mg Q3W, for up to 96 weeks of treatment IC chemotherapy Dose/Route/Schedule: Pemetrexed will be administered IV at a dose of 500 mg/m2 Q3W, for up to 96 weeks of treatment IC chemotherapy Dose/Route/Schedule: Topotecan will be administered IV at a dose of 1 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, every 21 days, for up to 96 weeks of treatment IC chemotherapy Dose/Route/Schedule: Irinotecan will be administered IV at a dose of 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, followed by 10 to 14 days of rest, for a 42 -day (6 -week cycle), fo r up to 96 weeks of treatment. For patients enrolling in Japan, there will be at least 14 days of rest before subsequent irinotecan administration IC chemotherapy Dose/Route/Schedule: Vinorelbine will be administered IV at a dose of 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, every 21 days, for up to 96 weeks of treatment. IC chemotherapy Dose/Route/Schedule: Gemcitabine will be administered IV at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, every 21 days, for up to 96 weeks of treatment Endpoints Primary: The primary endpoint is OS, defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. A patient who has not died will be censored at the last known date of contact. Secondary: The key secondary endpoints are PFS and ORR. Other secondary endpoints will include DOR, QOL, and the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab. Procedures and Assessments Tumor imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will be performed to measure tumor burden and to characterize the efficacy profile of study treatments using response criteria. Every effort will be made to collect survival data on all patients, including patients who withdraw from the study for any reason but have not withdrawn consent to collect survival information. Physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy test for women of chil dbearing potential, and recording of AEs and concomitant medications will be performed to ensure patient safety and to characterize the safety profiles of study treatments. Other assessments will include: • Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) • Blood sampl es to assess anti - cemiplimab antibodies • Biomarkers (serum, plasma, tumor tissue) VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Page 30 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL • Peripheral blood mononuclear cells • Quality of life assessments Statistical Plan The primary OS endpoint will be tested in patients with SCC first. If the null hypothesis is rejected in the SCC patients, then OS will be tested in the overall population. The sample size and power are calculated using East® version 6.4.1 statistical software. The sponsor assumes a median OS of 7 months for SCC patients treated with IC chemotherapy and a median OS of 10 months for SCC patients treated with cemiplimab. The assumptions correspond to an approximately 42.8% increase in median OS and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 if OS is distributed exponentially in both treatment groups. Two interim efficacy analyses are planned using Lan -DeMets (O’Brien -Fleming) spending function at 70% and 85% of the total OS events, respectively. A total of 340 OS events in SCC patients will yield approximately 90% power to detect an HR of 0.7 with an over all type I error of 0.025 (1 -sided). The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed after observing approximately 238 OS events (70% of total OS events). It is projected that an observed HR of 0.729 or lower would result in a statistically signifi cant improvement in OS at the 1 -sided nominal type I error of 0.0074 at the first interim efficacy analysis. The second interim efficacy analysis will be performed after observing approximately 289 OS events (85% of total OS events). It is projected that an observed HR of 0.769 or lower would result in a statistically significant improvement in OS at the 1-sided nominal type I error of 0.0129 at the second interim efficacy analysis. The final efficacy analysis will be performed after observing approximat ely 340 OS events. It is projected that an observed HR of 0.801 or lower would result in a statistically significant improvement in OS at the 1-sided nominal type I error of 0.0202 at the final analysis. The actual alpha spending will be based on the act ual number of OS events included in the analyses and determined by the O’Brien -Fleming spending function at the time of interim and final analyses. Considering the enrollment rate (2 patients/month for months 1 to 5, 9 patients/month for months 6 to 16, 20 patients/month for months 17 to 23, 22 patients/month for month 24 and beyond) and 10% dropout rate per year, enrollment of 460 randomized SCC patients will yield 340 OS events approximately 42 months after the first SCC patient is randomized. At the tim e when 460 SCC patients are enrolled in the study, a total enrollment in the study of approximately 590 patients is projected (SCC + non-SCC). The actual number of patients to be enrolled will depend on the proportion of adenocarcinoma patients in the pat ient population and the time when Amendment 5 is implemented at each of the study sites. If the HR is 0.7, the power for testing OS in the overall population will be higher than 90%. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

INTRODUCTION The global annual incidence of cervical cancer is approximately 527 000 cases per year, and there are approximately 265 000 deaths ( Torre 2015 ). The highest incidence rates are in the Caribbean, Africa, Eastern Europe, and South America ( Forman 2012 ). In the United States (US), there are approximately 13000 new cases and 4100 deaths annually ( Siegel 2016 ). In most cases, causation is due to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Although vaccination against high risk strains of HPV is projected to gradually decrease the global incidence of cervical canc er in the next 15 years, the burden of this disease remains profound ( Bray 2012 ). For patients with locally advanced disease, curative intent therapy is definitive radiation with concurrent cisplatin. However, recurrent or metast atic disease occurs in approximately one third of cervical cancer patients in the US. For women with recurrent or metastatic disease, the GOG240 study established that standard first line therapy is platinum plus taxane doublet with the addition of bevaci zumab if clinically appropriate. Median survival with the triplet regimen is 17 months (Tewari 2014 ). After progression on first line platinum -taxane based chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, there is no standard of care. Non -randomized phase 2 trials have demonstrated survival times of 7.4 to 8.1 months (N = 29 and 43 patients, respectively) with single agent pemetrexed monotherapy ( Lorusso 2010 ) (Miller 2008 ). Gemcitabine monotherapy yielded median overall survival (OS) of 6.5 months in a phase 2 study of women (N = 22 patients) with previously treated cervical cancer ( Schilder 2005 ). In a phase 2 study (N = 45 patients) of topotecan in which most patients had received prior platinum, median OS was 6.6 months ( Bookman 2000 ). In phase 2 studies of vinorelbine for patients who could have received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for squamous or non -squamous advance d cervical cancer, observed response rates were 13% (6/44 patients) and 7% (2/28 patients), respectively ( Muggia 2004 ) (Muggia 2005 ). Weekly dosing of irinotecan yielded a response rate of 13% (6/45 pati ents) in a phase 2 study for women with recurrent squamous cervical cancer in the US ( Look 1998 ), and a response rate of 24% (13/55 patients) in a phase 2 study for women with cervical cancer in Japan ( Take uchi 1991 ). New systemic therapy options are needed for this patient population. Cemiplimab (the INN for REGN2810) is a hinge -stabilized IgG4P anti -PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) monoclonal antibody that has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and favorable tolerability in a phase 1 study that is now enrolling patients in multiple expansion cohorts (Papadopoulos 2016 ) (NCT02383212). Cemiplimab is also being evaluated in various clinical trials and indications globally. On 28 Septe mber 2018, cemiplimab was approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as LIBTAYO® (cemiplimab -rwlc) for the treatment of patients with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. The current study seeks to evaluate the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer that has progressed after platinum -based therapy. Programmed cell death 1 is expresse d on activated T -cells, and binding of PD -1 to its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2, imparts inhibition of cytotoxic T -cell activity ( Francisco 2010 ). Upregulated expression of PD-1/PD -L1 checkpoint signaling in the tumor microenvironmen t plays a role in resistance to antitumor immune responses ( Zou 2008 ). The clinical study of cemiplimab in cervical cancer is supported by both preclinical and clinical observations regarding the role of PD -1/PD -L1 VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Page 36 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL checkpoint signaling in the suppression of anti -tumor immune responses against this and other HPV -associated cancers. First, almost all cervical squamous cell carcinomas are associated with high risk strains of HPV (The Cancer Genome Atlas R esearch Network ). Tumors that express viral antigen appear to be responsive to PD -1 blockade as a strategy to enhance the antitumor immune response, as demonstrated by positive clinical trial results in patients with HPV -associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and in polyomavirus -associated Merkel Cell carcinoma, with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, respectively ( Gillison 2016 ) (Nghiem 2016 ). Secondly, cervical squamous carcinomas may evade immune response by expression of PD -L1 ligand, which was detectable by immunohistochemistry (>5% staining) in 54% (83/154) of squamous tumors, and in 14% (7/49) of adenocarcinomas ( Heeren 2016 ). Thirdly, preliminary clinical data demonst rate efficacy of PD -1 blockade against cervical cancer. In a cohort of 24 cervical cancer patients with PD -L1+ recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer treated with pembrolizumab, objective responses were observed in 17% (4/24) of patients and median OS wa s 9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 to 12 months) ( Frenel 2016 ). In the first-in-human (FIH) study of cemiplimab, 3 patients with cervical squamous cancer were enrolled in dose escalation cohorts to receive cemiplimab pl us hypofractionated radiation therapy (9 gray [Gy] X 3 fractions or 6 Gy X 5 fractions) ( Papadopoulos 2016 ). Two of these patients have experienced durable responses. Radiation therapy was administered in week 2, and cemipl imab was administered intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks (Q2W) for up to 48 weeks or until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Non -radiated lesions were evaluated for response. One patient has experienced a radiologic complete response (CR), a nd another has experienced an overall partial response (CR in target lesions, with a non -target lesion that persisted). Both patients completed 48 weeks of treatment, and entered post -treatment follow up. The cervical cancer patient with partial response experienced progressive disease (PD) with an enlarging supraclavicular node after approximately 8 months of post -treatment follow up, and this was biopsy -proven. This patient resumed treatment with cemiplimab monotherapy (no radiation) and experienced a partial response at the first response assessment (8 weeks) after resuming treatment. Fourth, analysis of gene expression data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network ) demonstrates similarities between cervical cancer and other tumor types for which anti -PD-1 therapy achieves therapeutic advantage. Briefly, average expression of 3 genes (CD8A, PD -1, and PD -L1) in each tumor type is normalized to standard distribution across all tumor types. Tum ors are organized according to Z -scores using hierarchical clustering ( Figure 1). Cervical cancer clusters with non -small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal clear cell carcinoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Programmed cell death 1 blockade improved OS in each of these tumor types in randomized phase 3 studies (Ferris 2016 ) (Motzer 2015 ) (Trivedi 2015 ). Taken together, these observations suggest that a prospective randomized trial of PD -1 inhibition with cemiplimab is warranted for patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer to potentially improve OS.

HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE 3.1. Hypothesis Human papillomavirus viral proteins are recognized as foreign antigens by effector T cells in cervical cancer, and an anti -tumor immune response can be u nleashed by blockade of the PD -1 immune checkpoint. Cemiplimab will improve OS compared to IC chemotherapy for cervical cancer patients who experienced progression of disease after treatment with platinum chemotherapy that was administered in the recurren t or metastatic disease setting, in SCC and in the overall population. 3.2. Rationale 3.2.1. Rationale for Patient Population and Study Design This is an open -label, randomized, phase 3 trial of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastati c cervical cancer that has progressed after platinum -containing chemotherapy. The GOG240 study established the efficacy of first line -therapy for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with the regimen of platinum + paclitaxel + bevacizumab ( Tewari 2014 ). There is no standard -of-care regimen in the second line setting. Agents that may be considered in this setting are the IC options in this study: pemetrexed, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine. Despite the av ailability of various chemotherapy options, patients treated with these agents for cervical cancer have a median survival time of approximately 7 months (Section 3.2.3 ). A concept of “platinum -refractory” disease has been described in the cervical cancer literature, and is related to time since prior platinum therapy (Nishino 2016 ) (McLachlan 2016 ) (Tanioka 2011 ). However, it is not typical clinical practice to re -treat cervical cancer patients with platinum -based chemotherapy if they have already received it in the setting of recurrent or metastatic disease. The chemother apy regimens in the control arm of this study represent the current treatment options for cervical cancer patients who have received prior platinum in the VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
38,page_38,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 39 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL setting of recurrent or metastatic disease. Regardless of the time interval between prior platinum therapy (for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer) and subsequent progression, such patients have unmet medical need and are appropriate for consideration of the clinical study. Platinum -therapy given in other settings (eg, concurrent with radiation the rapy as part of curative -intent therapy, after radiation [or chemoradiation] as adjuvant treatment in a patient with no evidence of disease) does not satisfy the eligibility requirement regarding prior platinum therapy in this study. NOTE : The term pers istent disease is sometimes used to refer to disease for which there was never documentation of complete resolution after chemoradiation. For such patients, first line therapy is the same as that for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease (ie, platinum + paclitaxel ± bevacizumab). As a convention in this study, patients with persistent disease are considered included in the category of “recurrent or metastatic” disease any time that term is used in the protocol. The study population will have rece ived prior paclitaxel and prior bevacizumab, refused such treatment, or been unsuitable for such treatment (or, in the case of bevacizumab, not had access). For patients who received prior paclitaxel and/or prior bevacizumab, disease progression at any time after prior paclitaxel and/or bevacizumab is an acceptable reason for discontinuation of paclitaxel and/or bevacizumab. The study design is a randomized comparison of cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy, with an OS endpoint. For patient populations in wh ich there is no widely accepted standard of care, and in which randomization to a placebo or best -supportive care arm is considered unethical or unfeasible, health authorities have accepted IC as a comparator in studies that have led to regulatory approval s based on OS endpoints ( Donoghue 2012 ) (Ferris 2016 ). Blinding is not practical in the current study due to differences in schedule and differences in AE profiles between cemiplimab and the IC options ( ie, immune -related adverse events [irAEs] with cemiplimab and white blood cell count suppression with chemotherapy). Overall survival directly measures clinical benefit, is not biased, and is not a surrogate endpoint. As such, OS has been selected as the primary endpoint, and this open -label study will compare cemiplimab versus IC chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer who have progressed after prior treatment with a platinum containing regimen that was given in the recurrent or metastatic disease s etting. Rationale for Further Enrollment of only Patients with Squamous Histology The International Collaboration of Epidemiological Studies of Cervical Cancer analyzed data from 23 published studies that included 9052 cervical cancer patients; histolog ic data was available for 8575 patients ( Appleby 2006 ). In the overall analysis of studies globally, approximately 85% of cases had squamous histology, although this did appear to vary by geographic region. Emerging data fro m anti -PD-1 studies in cervical cancer suggests that efficacy of these agents in cervical cancer may be associated with squamous histology. The phase 1 study of cemiplimab (R2810 -ONC -1423) contained expansion cohorts for cervical cancer patients ( Rischin 2018 ). Data from these expansion cohorts, combined with the results of 3 cervical cancer patients in the dose escalation portion of the study ( Papadopoulos 2016 ), suggest an efficacy difference asso ciated with histology: ORR among squamous cell cancer patients was 31% (4/13), and ORR among patients with adenocarcinoma/other histology was 0% (0/10) (Regeneron, data on file). Results with pembrolizumab also support the efficacy of PD -1 blockade in ce rvical cancer patients with VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
39,page_39,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 40 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL squamous histology. The accelerated approval of pembrolizumab for cervical cancer patients in the US was based on a data set (N = 77 patients) in which 92% of the patients had squamous histology ( KEYTRUDA 2018 ). The observation in cervical cancer that PD -L1 expression is higher in squamous cell histology than in adenocarcinoma histology may partially account for the observed association of anti -PD-1 efficacy with histology in this disease ( Heeren 2016 ). These observations support a protocol amendment to improve the ability of the study to test for efficacy in the squamous population, and also to increase the probability that the proportion of patients with squamous histology in the total study population will be consistent with the global proportions of histologies in cervical cancer. As such, Amendment 5 sets forth that enrollment will only be allowed for patients with squamous histology and that enrollment will co ntinue until 460 patients with squamous histology are enrolled per Amendment 6. Based on current and projected enrollment trends and anticipated time to implementation of Amendments 5 and 6 at study sites, total enrollment to the study will be approximate ly 590 patients, and approximately 80% of patients will have squamous histology. This is consistent with global distribution of cervical cancer histologies described above ( Appleby 2006 ). See Section 10 for details regarding statistical analysis considerations regarding histology. 3.2.2. Rationale for Cemiplimab Dose Selection In this phase 3 clinica l study in cervical cancer, cemiplimab monotherapy at a dose of 350 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) is being proposed, to allow for compatibility with many standard chemotherapeutic regimens that are dosed on a Q3W schedule, and to improve patient convenience. Thi s cemiplimab dose of 350mg Q3W was chosen based on the safety and preliminary anti -tumor activity observed in the ongoing FIH study R2810 -ONC -1423 (NCT02383212), and was supported by modeling of cemiplimab exposure in serum based on data collected in the F IH study. Simulations of cemiplimab exposure in 1000 patients using population PK analyses indicated that 1) the variability in cemiplimab exposure (CV%) was similar with body -weight adjusted as compared to fixed doses, therefore supporting the fixed dose selection, and 2) that a 350 mg Q3W dose resulted in similar (≤20% difference) C trough, AUC 12W and C max as compared to a 3 mg/kg Q2W dose, used in the FIH study. cemiplimab concentrations exceeded those observed at 1 mg/kg Q2W dose, which demonstrated cli nical efficacy in the FIH study and C trough values exceeded concentrations of approximately 5 mg/L to 20 mg/L above which saturation of PD -1 target occupancy is expected to occur, based on animal data. The 350 mg Q3W dose of cemiplimab is therefore being proposed as the optimal dose in the phase 3 studies in patients with cervical cancer and across the cemiplimab program. 3.2.3. Rationale for Investigator’s Choice Chemotherapy Options The IC chemotherapy agents in this study are in 4 classes: (1) antifolate - pemetrexed, (2) topoisomerase 1 inhibitor – topotecan or irinotecan, (3) nucleoside analogue – gemcitabine, and (4) vinca alkaloid - vinorelbine. These agents have all been evaluated as monotherapies in single arm, non -randomized, phase 2 studies, and are in cluded as possible treatment options in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer ( NCCN 2017 ). No systemic treatment agents have been associated with a survival VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 41 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL advantage in this patient population, and the IC option in this study comprises a group of treatments that are commonly used in clinical practice as monotherapy options. In a phase 2 study of pemetrexed (900 mg/m2 every 21 days), patients (N = 27) who had 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer had an ORR of 15% and a median OS of 7.4 months ( Miller 2008 ). In another phase 2 trial of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 every 21 days) for patients (N = 43) with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer that had been previously treated with 1 prior chemotherapy regimen in any setting (including concurrent chemoradiation), ORR was 14% and median OS was 8 months ( Lorusso 2010 ). The dose and schedule of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 IV every 21 days with folic acid and vitamin B 12 support) that is used in the current protocol is the same pemetrexed monotherapy regimen that has been approved by the FDA for non -small cell lung cancer ( Hanna 2004 ). Topotecan is an FDA -approved agent for the treatment of cervical cancer when given in combination with cisplatin. Topotecan plus cisplatin, compared to cisplatin alone, improved OS for women with stage IVB, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer that was not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiation therapy in GOG179 ( Long 2005 ). A phase 2 study evaluated topotecan monotherapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had receive d no more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. The regimen was topotecan 1.5 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days of a 21 -day cycle. Of 41 evaluable patients, 34 had received prior chemotherapy, generally including cisplatin. The OR R was 12.5% and the median OS was 6.6 months ( Bookman 2000 ). The 21 -day topotecan monotherapy regimen (topotecan 1.5 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days of a 21 -day cycle) was subsequently approved in small cell lung cancer ( von Pawel 1999 ) and in ovarian cancer ( ten Bokkel Huinink 2004 ). Topotecan monotherapy is recognized as a palliative option for patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer ( NCCN 2017 ). However, in cervical cancer patients who have received prior platinum -based chemotherapy, the topotecan regimen of 1.5 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days is associated with unacceptable hematologic toxicity, including 68% and 39% incidence rat es of grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia, respectively ( Bookman 2000 ). Even among patients who had not received prior systemic therapy for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence rates of grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4 thrombocytopenia with this regimen were 68% and 18%, respectively ( Muderspach 2001 ). To optimize patient safety, the starting topotecan dose and schedule in this protocol is 1 mg/m2 per day for 5 consecutive days, which is acceptable in routine clinical practice. A phase 2 study of gemcitabine administered over a 28 -day treatment course (800 mg/m2, 3 weeks on, 1 week rest) enrolled 22 patients who had received 1 prior regimen for metastatic, persis tent, or recurrent cervical cancer ( Schilder 2005 ). The ORR was 4.5% and median OS was 6.5 months. In the current protocol, the IC regimen for gemcitabine is 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 -day treatment course, which is the FDA -approved dose and schedule for gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin in ovarian cancer ( Pfisterer 2006 ). Gemcitabine also has monotherapy activity in ovarian cancer ( Mutch 2007 ). The FDA appro val in ovarian cancer provides toxicity management guidelines that are specific for this dose and schedule of gemcitabine (see Section 8.4.3 ). Over 12 weeks, this 21 -day treatment course provides similar exposure to gemcitabine (8000 mg) as the 28-day treatment course in the Schilder study (7200 mg). Gemcitabine monotherapy is VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Page 42 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL recommended as a palliative treatment option in recurrent or metastatic c ervical cancer (NCCN 2017 ). Vinorelbine monotherapy (30 mg/m2 days 1 and 8, every 21 days) has been evaluated in two phase 2 studies for women with advanced cervical cancer (recurrent or persistent) who could have received one prior systemic therapy. Among 44 patients with squamous histology, the observed response rate was 13% (5 partial responses, 1 complete response). Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41% of patients ( Muggia 2004 ). Among 22 patients w ith nonsquamous histology, the observed response rate was 7% (2 partial responses), and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 32% of subjects ( Muggia 2005 ). Neither vinorelbine study presented survival data, but the 6 squamous responders received a median of 24 weeks (range, 12 to 30 weeks) of treatment ( Muggia 2004 ), and the 2 nonsquamous responders received 18 weeks of therapy before progression (Muggia 2005 ). The weekly dosing schedule (days 1 and 8, every 21 days) facilitates safe administration for this regimen as regards neutropenia and other potential drug -related AEs. Irinotecan (CPT -11) monotherapy has been studied in several phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cervical c ancer ( Look 1998 ) (Takeuchi 1991 ) (Irvin 1998 ) (Verschraegen 1997 ). A phase 2 study evaluated weekly dosing (125 mg/m2 x 4 weeks, followed by 2 rest weeks ) among women with recurrent cervical cancer who could have only received prior chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer (Look 1998 ). Response rate was 13% (6/45 evaluable patients). Survival data was not presented, but duration of respo nse was 8.8 months in 1 patient with complete response and median duration of response was 4.8 months (range, 3.2 to 12+ months) among 5 patients with partial responses. Grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity occurred in 39% of patients. In a phase 2 study that evaluated the same regimen in cervical cancer patients who could have received 1 prior chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease, response rate was 21% (9/42) and overall median survival was 6.4 months. Dose reduction was required in 77% of patients ( Verschraegen 1997 ). In a Japanese phase 2 study of CPT -11 in cervical cancer and ovarian cancer, the observed response rate was 24% (13/55 patients) in the cervical cancer group, including 5 complete responses. Two regimens were used in the study, but no significant differences were observed between the regimens of 100 mg/m2 weekly dosing or 150 mg/m2 every 2 week dosing ( Takeuchi 1991 ). The regimen of irinotecan 100 mg/m2 (weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks rest) is approved in Japan for women with recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer. Because the patient population in this protocol will include patients who may have received more than 1 prior line of therapy, this 100 mg/m2 weekly do sing regimen (weekly x 4, followed by 2 rest weeks) is selected as the starting dose for this IC option to optimize patient safety. In clinical practice, other possible monotherapy options exist for palliation of advanced cervical cancer, including paclita xel, bevacizumab, ifosfamide, mitomycin, and 5 -fluorouracil (NCCN 2017 ). Paclitaxel or other taxane is not included as an IC chemotherapy option in this protocol because it is anticipated that most study patients will have received prior paclitaxel in the context of prior first -line therapy for recurrent, persistent, or metastatic cervical cancer with cisplatin plus paclitaxel ± bevacizumab as per the GOG240 regimen ( Tewari 2014 ). Most patients with access to bevacizumab will also have received it as part of the GOG240 regimen. Because no survival advantage has been established in this setting for any monotherapy option, the IC options in this protocol (pemetrexed, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and vi norelbine) were selected based on relatively favorable safety profiles and the Gynecologic Oncology Group’s VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

STUDY VARIABLES 4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (eg, age, race, weight, and height) and disease characteristics, tumor histology (squamous versus adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous), and geog raphic region, as well as medical and oncology history. Oncologic history will include prior treatments with platinum agents, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab (or reason why paclitaxel or bevacizumab was not given previously). 4.2. Primary and Secondary Endpoints 4.2.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is OS, defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. A patient who has not died will be censored at the last known date of contact. 4.2.2. Secondary Endpoints The key secondary endpoints are PFS and ORR. Progre ssion -free survival will be defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression using RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause. Patients will be censored according to rules listed below: 1. Patients who do not have a doc umented tumor progression or death will be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. 2. Patients who do not have any evaluable tumor assessments after randomization and do not die will be censored on the date of randomization. Overall res ponse rate will be defined as the number of patients with a best overall response of confirmed CR or PR divided by the number of patients in the efficacy analysis set. Best overall response will be defined as the best overall response between the date of randomization and the date of the first objectively documented progression or the date of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, whichever comes first. 4.2.3. Other Secondary Endpoints Other secondary endpoints will include DOR and QOL. Duration of response will be defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause. Quality of life will be measured by the EORTC QLQ -C30. Other secondary endpoints will also include the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of cemiplimab IC chemotherapy, the incidence of AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and laboratory abnormalities will be assessed.

Study Description and Duration This is an open -label, randomized, multi -center, phase 3 trial comparing cemiplimab versus IC of chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Approximately 590 patients will be rando mized to either the experimental cemiplimab treatment arm or the IC of chemotherapy control treatment arm. In the experimental group, cemiplimab will be administered as a flat dose of 350 mg Q3W. In the control group, IC chemotherapy options are in 4 cla sses: (1) antifolate - pemetrexed, (2) topoisomerase 1 inhibitor – topotecan or irinotecan, (3) nucleoside analogue – gemcitabine, and (4) vinca alkaloid - vinorelbine. A schematic diagram of the study design is presented in Figure 2. The only chemotherapy treatments allowed in the control arm are any of the 5 drugs that are listed as IC options. Other agents in these clas ses are not permitted in this study. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

The screening period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF). The screening period ends when the patient has be en confirmed as fully eligible for the study and is randomized, or with confirmation that the patient is ineligible and is a screen failure. The treatment period begins within 5 days of randomization to 1 of the treatment arms. Cycle length is 6 weeks, a nd tumor imaging is planned to be conducted on day 42 (±7 days) of cycles 1 -4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. Planned treatment is for up to 96 weeks. The treatment phase ends when the patient discontinues study therapy. There is no cross -over during this st udy. After completion of the treatment period, patients enter the follow -up period. After the follow -up period, patients will be followed for survival. Study closeout procedures will be implemented after last patient last visit of the cemiplimab Extens ion Phase (Section 7.1.7.1 ). 5.1.1. End of Treatment Definition There is an end of treatment disposition point for each patient, as reflected by treatment completion/discontinuation case report form (CRF). The end of treatment occurs for each individual patient after the patient completes or discontinues from the treatment ( Table 1), but before follow -up visits 1 and 2 ( Table 2). 5.1.2. End of Study Definition The end of study for the study as a whole is plan ned to occur when approximately 340 deaths have occurred in squamous cell patients, as per Section 10.2. The total duration of study from start of randomization to final analysis of OS is expected to be approximately 42 months (33 months of accrual plus 11 months of follow -up). There is an end of study disposition point for each patient, as reflected by study completion/discontinuation CRF. The en d of study occurs for each individual patient after the patient completes or discontinues from the treatment ( Table 1) and/or follow -up visit 1 and 2 p ortion of Table 2, but before the survival follow -up portion of Table 2. Due to survival benefit, for patients on the cemiplimab arm on second interim analysis, a cemiplimab Extension Phase was added (Section Section 7.1.7 ). Therefore, end of study is now planned to occur after last patient last visit of the cemiplimab Extension Phase. 5.2. Planned Interim Analysis Two interim efficacy analyses are planned using Lan-DeMets (O’Brien -Fleming) spending function. The first interim efficacy analysis will be performed after observing approximately 238 OS events (70% of total OS events). The second interim efficacy analysis will be performed after observing approximat ely 289 OS events (85% of total OS events). The details are provided in Section 10.5. 5.3. Study Committees 5.3.1. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An Independe nt Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) composed of members who are independent from the sponsor and the study investigators will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data and available efficacy data.

Trial Steering Committee All activities of the Trial Steering Committee (TSC) are described in the TSC charter. 5.4. Study Conduct in Response to COVID -19 Included in amendment 6 of the protocol are measures to account for the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic and to minimize the risks to the patients in the study as well as healthcare providers. 6. SELECTION, WITHDRAWA L, AND REPLACEMENT O F PATIEN TS 6.1. Number of Patients Planned Approximately 460 SCC patients will be randomized 1:1 (230 per treatment arm) at approximately 100 sites globally. Approximately 590 patients in the overall population are projected to have accrued when the enrollment for SCC patients is completed. However, the actual number of patients in the overall population depends on the proportion of adenocarcinoma patients in the patient population and the time when Amendment 5 is implemented at each of the study sites. 6.2. Study Populati on The study will enroll women ≥18 years old with recurrent, persistent, and/or metastatic cervical cancer that has progressed after platinum -containing chemotherapy given to treat recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.

Footnotes for the Schedule of Events Table for Screening and Treatment 1. Patients who fail screening may be screened one additional time and an ICF will need to be signed at the re -screen. Some procedures may not need to be repeated if they were previously completed within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1. 2. Informed consent must be provided before the initiation of screening p rocedures, and must be obtained within 45 days prior to cycle1/day 1. All screening assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to cycle 1/day 1. Assessments performed as part of standard of care that fall within the screening window, but before i nformed consent is obtained, may be used for screening and need not be repeated for enrollment eligibility. 3. The first dose should be administered no later than 5 days after randomization (except for patient assigned to pemetrexed, for whom the first dose o f pemetrexed may be given no later than 10 days after randomization due to need for folate premedication for at least 5 days in the 7 day period preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, as per Section 8.1.2.1 ). 4. Only for patients assigned to cemiplimab: At cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 1 day 22, vital signs will be collected prior to infusion, and approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the infusion. For all other cemiplimab infusions, vital signs are collected prior to infusion, and approximately 15 minutes after the completion of the infusion. The allowable window for each specified time point is ±10 minutes. 5. For the IC options, doses are weight -based. For cycle 1/day 1, the investigator should use screening height and weight to calculate dose, but cycle 1/day 1 weight is also allowed to be used, per investigator discretion. Weight is measured at start of each cycle. If there is a ≥10% change in weight, the IC chemotherapy dose should be re -calculated. 6. If cycle 1/day 1 is within 72 hours of screening, this assessment does not need to be repeated at cycle 1/day 1. 7. Complete physical examination includes head and neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and skin. A brief neurologic examination should also be performed. The exam (and measurement of weight) may be performed ≤72 hours prior to study treatment. 8. Limited physical exam includes lungs, heart, abdomen, and skin. The exam (a nd easement of weight) may be performed ≤72 hours prior to study treatment. 9. Hematology and chemistry samples may be obtained ≤72 hours prior to study treatment. 10. Pre-dose serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at screening up to 72 hours prior to first administration. Subsequent predose pregnancy tests (up to 72 hours before the dose) may be urine β -HCG. Serum pregnancy test and urine pregnancy test are requirements for women of child bearing potential only. If surgical procedure for sterility was don e ≤30 days prior to signing ICF, serum pregnancy test must still be performed. 11. The PK samples are collected predose (pre -infusion) and at the end of infusion on day 1 of cycle 1. PK samples are collected at pre -infusion and at the end of infusion on day 1 of cycles 2 through 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. The PK samples are to be obtained only from patients randomized to receive cemiplimab. “End of infusion” includes up to within 10 minutes after completion of the infusion.

The ADA samples for immunogenicity are collected pre -infusion on day 1 of cycle 1, 3, 7, 11, and 15. The ADA samples for immunogenicity are to be obtained only from patients randomized to receive cemiplimab . 13. The biomarker samples are collected pre -infusion on day 1 of cycles 1 through 8. 14. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection is optional. If pre -treatment PBMC is not collected on day 1/cycle 1, PBMC should not be collected at future dates. If PBMC are collected, this sample should be collected prior to treatment on day 1 of c ycles 1 through 3. Samples are to be obtained only from patients randomized to receive cemiplimab. 15.

After the end of study, survival follow -up assessments will occur every 90 days (±10 days) until death or study termination per sponsor and GOG. It is preferable for survival follow -up assessments to occur in the clinic, but telephone assessments are acceptable. Regeneron may request that survival data be collected on all randomized part icipants outside of the 90 -day specified window. At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to determine their survival status unless the patient has withdrawn consent for all contact. 3. Limited physical exam includes heart, lung, abdom en, and skin. 4. During the follow -up period, after end of treatment of cemiplimab, PK and ADA samples are collected at follow -up 1 visit. PK and ADA samples may be collected at follow -up visit 2 (approximately 4 months post last treatment of cemiplimab). I n response to adverse events of special interest (AESIs), such as anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity, ADA samples may be collected closer to the event, based on the judgment of the investigator and/or medical monitor. 5. Radiologic imaging in the post -treatment follow -up period is only required for patients who have not experienced prior PD. Tumor assessments should occur every 90 days (±10 days) until PD. 6. PBMC samples are to be obtained only from patients randomized to receive cemiplimab and have signed option al PBMC consent. 7.1.6. Option for Retreatment Patients who complete 16 cycles of treatment ( Table 1) enter the follow up period ( Table 2). If they have not experienced PD during the study, radiologic assessments will continue until PD, as per Table 2. If a patient experiences PD during the follow -up period, retreatment with the same drug that was given during the treatment period is an option. A patient who was initially randomized to receive cemiplima b may be considered for resumption of cemiplimab. A patient who was initially randomized to IC of chemotherapy may be considered for resumption of the same chemotherapy that they received in the treatment period. Resumption of treatment due to PD during the follow -up period may be allowed if: • The patient received no other anticancer systemic therapy during the follow -up period. • The reason for discontinuation of study treatment was the completion of 16 planned cycles, not for toxicity. • The patient provides written informed consent prior to initiating retreatment by signing the current version of the ICF (eg, the patient repeats the written informed consent process that was performed prior to study enrollment). • All screening period assessments (with the exce ption of providing tumor pathology material) are repeated, and the patient meets all study eligibility criteria (with the exception of the exclusion regarding prior anti -PD-1 therapy if the patient was randomized to cemiplimab). Patients who resume study treatment will follow the schedule of events in Table 1, for up to 8 cycles total with the same treatment to which they were originally randomized. Cycles will be counted as 17 through 24. However, PK, ADA, research blood samples, and PBMC samples are VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

In response to AESIs like anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity, ADA samples clos er to the event may be collected and analyzed, based on the judgement of the medical investigator and/or medical monitor. There is no treatment crossover in this study. 7.1.7. Note Regarding IDMC Interim Analysis 2 The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDM C) convened on 8 March 2021 to evaluate the data from a planned formal interim analysis of OS. The IDMC declared superiority of OS in subjects receiving cemiplimab as compared to IC chemotherapy. As a result of the assessment, Protocol Amendment 7 is bei ng implemented to provide a mechanism for eligible subjects randomized to chemotherapy to receive subsequent cemiplimab as part of the cemiplimab Extension Phase (Section 7.1.7.1 ). Patients randomized to IC chemotherapy may screen to receive cemiplimab in the cemiplimab Extension Phase up to and including 30 June 2021. Patients previously on IC chemotherapy may receive up to 96 weeks on cemiplimab as pe r the Schedule of Events for the cemiplimab Extension Phase as per Table 3. All patients currently on cemiplimab may continue treatment up to 96 weeks. All patients receiving cemiplimab will do so as per the Schedule of Events for the cemiplimab Extension Phase as per Table 3. Subjects currently receiving IC chemotherapy (pemetrexed, gemcitabine, topotecan, irinotecan, or vinorelbine) may continue to be treated with IC as long as, in the opinion of the investigator, they are con tinuing to derive benefit from the assigned treatment. Patients who opt to continue receiving IC chemotherapy will do so as per routine clinical practice. As of Amendment 7, retreatment is no longer an option (Section 7.1.6 ). As of Amendment 7, follow -up visits are no longer required (Section 7.1.4 ). 7.1.7.1. Cemiplimab Extension Phase of the Study All patients currently on cemiplimab will transition to cemiplimab Extension Phase ( Table 3) as of Amendment 7. This section also provides a mechanism for patients randomized to the IC chemotherapy arm to receive cemiplimab 350 mg Q3W. All patients randomized to IC chemotherapy are eligible for crossover to receive cemiplimab in the cemiplimab Extension Phase of the study, as long as eligibility criteria ( Section 6.2) are met. Patients with squamous histology or adenocarcinoma/adenosquamous histology may be eligible for the cemiplimab E xtension Phase. The following criteria are not exclusionary for patients to enter the cemiplimab Extension Phase of the study: • Exclusion crit eria #5: Steroids applied as supportive medications for IC chemotherapy will not be exclusionary. • Exclusion criteria #20: Patients currently enrolled in R2810 -ONC -1676 are not excluded. Patients must complete screening assessments as set forth in Table 3, including signing the ICF. Patients will follow the Schedule of Events in Table 3.

Written informed re -consent for the cemiplimab Extension Phase must be provided prior to the initiation of screening procedures and must be obtained within 45 days prior to fir st dose of cemiplimab in the Extension Phase of the study. All screening assessments must be performed within 28 days prior to first dose of cemiplimab in the Extension Phase. Assessments performed as part of standard of care that fall within the screeni ng window, but before informed consent is obtained, may be used for screening and do not need to be repeated for eligibility. 2. Patients who are currently receiving cemiplimab will transition to the cemiplimab Extension Phase. Their Extension Phase treatment day should correspond to their current treatment day, such that they may receive up to 96 weeks of total cemiplimab therapy (inclusive of cemiplimab received prior to the cemiplimab Extension Phase). These patients do not n eed to repeat screening procedures. 3. Total duration of cemiplimab therapy is up to 96 weeks, or PD, or unacceptable toxicity. 4. After the end of treatment , survival follow -up assessments will occur every 90 days (±10 days) until death or study termination per sponsor. Telephone assessments are acceptable. Regeneron may request that survival data be collected on all randomized participants outside of the 90 -day specified window. At the time of this request, each participant will be contacted to determine the ir survival status unless the patient has withdrawn consent for all contact. 7.2. Study Procedures 7.2.1. Procedures Performed at the Screening Visit The following procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of determining study eligibility or characterizing the baseline population: • Serum β -HCG (result must be ≤72 hours before first dose) • HBV, HCV, and HIV screening: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C positive RNA (positive hepatitis C antibody test will require hepatitis C RNA test to rule out active infec tion), HIV -1, or HIV -2 serum antibody VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
60,page_60,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 61 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL • Documentation of pathologic confirmation of cervical cancer (SCC or adenocarcinoma/AC prior to Amendment 5; squamous cell histology only starting with Amendment 5) • Pathology material (formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded [FFPE] block or 20 slides from the sample in the submitted pathology report). This material will be used for correlative science studies (Section 7.2.7 ). • Patients who fail screening may be screened one additional time and an ICF will need to be signed at the re -screen. Some procedures may not need to be repeated if they were previously completed within 28 days prior to cycle 1 day 1. 7.2.2. Efficacy Proced ures For all patients, disease will be measured radiologically according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix 1 ; Eisenhauer 2009 ). The CT or MRI for tumor assessment will be performed in screening, during treatment, and during follow -up, as detailed in Table 1 and Table 2. During the treatment period, tumor response assessments are performed a t end of cycles 1 through 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 (Table 1). During follow -up, tumor response assessments are performed at follow - up visits 1 and 2 (Table 2). The choice of whether the imaging is by CT or MRI is an investigator decision. Once the choice of CT scan or MRI has been made, subsequ ent assessments should be made using the same modality whenever possible. • Whole -body (chest/abdomen/pelvis) imaging is performed at the baseline assessment and is strongly recommended at each response assessment. A CT or MRI of the neck should be performe d in patients with metastases to neck. At a minimum, all radiologically measurable target lesions (RECIST 1.1) should be imaged at each response assessment. The same radiologic imaging modality should be used at each response assessment. • Brain imaging – MRI brain with gadolinium (or CT brain with contrast, if MRI is not feasible) will be performed in the screening period for patients with history of brain metastases, or for whom there is clinical suspicion of brain metastases. Patients with brain metasta ses that are “not active” (see Section 6.2.2 ) who are enrolled on the study should have brain imaging at each response assessment, or sooner if ther e is clinical suspicion of worsening brain metastases during treatment. All radiological scans will be submitted to central depository and may be reviewed centrally. 7.2.3. Survival Data Collection Every effort will be made to collect survival data on all patient s, including patients who withdraw from the study for any reason but have not withdrawn consent to collect survival information. If the death of a patient is not reported, the date of the last patient contact in this study will be used in the determinatio n of the patient’s last known date of being alive. 7.2.4. Quality of Life Questionnaires Patient -reported outcomes will be measured at a frequency indicated in Table 1 and Table 2 using the validated patient self -administered EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire.

Safety Procedures 7.2.5.1. Vital Signs Vital signs, including temperature, resting blood pressure, pulse, and respiration, will be collected at time points according to Table 1 and Table 2. NOTE : blood pressure should be measured after the pat ient has been resting quietly for at least 5 minutes. Only for patients assigned to cemiplimab: At cycle 1 day 1 and cycle 1 day 22, vital signs will be collected prior to infusion, and approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the infusion. For all other cemiplimab infusions, vital signs are collected prior to infusion, and approximately 15 minutes after the completion of the infusion. The allowable window for each specified time point is ±10 minutes. 7.2.5.2. Physical Examination A thorough complete or l imited physical examination will be performed at visits specified in Table 1 and Table 2. Care should be taken to examine and assess any abnormalities that may be present, as indicated by the patient’s medical history. Complete physical examination will include examination of head and neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and skin. A brief neurologic examination also should be performed. Limited physical examination will include lungs, heart, abdomen, and skin. 7.2.5.3. Electrocardiogram A 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed during the screening period. The patient should be relaxed and in a recumbent or semi -recumbent position at least 5 minutes before recording an ECG. The ECG strips or reports will be retained with the source. The ECG will be reviewed by the investigator (paper or electronic tracing) and will be available for comparison with subsequent ECGs by the investigator. The following will be recorded on the CRF: • PR interval (msec) • QRS interval (msec) • QT interval (msec) • Heart rate (beats per minute; recorded from the ventricular rate) There is not a required time window for ECGs; they may be performed at any time on the study days according to Table 1 and Table 2 (±3 days).

Tumor Sam ples On-treatment tumor biopsies for correlative science research purposes do not occur in this study. However, for all study patients, a pretreatment tumor sample (preferably a recent FFPE tissue block, or alternatively, 20 unstained FFPE slides) is requ ired. This should be provided in central lab in the screening period, but a patient’s enrollment would not be delayed if sample is not received in screening period. An archived tumor sample may satisfy this requirement. Tumor samples should be of suffic ient size to ensure an adequate amount of tissue for analysis (excisional, incisional, or core needle; fine needle aspirates are not acceptable). If sufficient archived material is not available, fresh biopsy (excisional, incisional, or core needle) shoul d be performed in the screening period to obtain adequate tumor material (preferably an FFPE tissue block, or alternatively, 20 unstained FFPE slides) if the investigator deems the biopsy can be safely performed. Invasive procedures that require general a nesthesia should not be performed to satisfy the biopsy requirement. However, if surgery is performed for a clinical indication, excess tumor material from the surgical procedure could be used to satisfy the required for pretreatment tumor material. Comp lete instructions on the collection, processing, handling, and shipment of all samples will be provided in the laboratory manual. Candidate biomarkers will be analyzed in archived (pretreatment) tumor samples. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be performed to determine PD -L1 expression levels in archived tumor specimens. This approach may provide a better understanding of the performance of PD - L1 expression level as a predictive biomarker of response to cemiplimab. Of special interest is PD-L1 expression a cross different cell types including tumor cells, stroma cells, and infiltrating immune cells. After completion of PD -L1 expression analysis, the remaining tumor tissue may be used to study candidate biomarkers associated with clinical response to cemipli mab, including characterization of expression of other immune -related or cervical cancer -related genes (DNA, RNA and/or protein), tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and other immune cell populations, HPV status and subtype, human leukocyte antigen variants and antigen processing components, tumor genetic mutation profile, and T cell receptor repertoire. Methodologies that may be employed include, but are not limited to, IHC, RNA sequencing, RNAscope®, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and whole exome DNA sequencing. 7.2.7.2. Serum/Plasma Samples Serum/plasma samples will be collected from all patients enrolled in this study at multiple time points to study the potential pharmacodynamics or predictive biomarkers of response to cemiplimab (refer to the laboratory manual ). 7.2.7.3. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (optional) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients receiving cemiplimab may be used for characterization of immune cell subsets including T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, and subsets of these cell types. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples may also be used to assess immune cell function, including T cell activation and proliferation. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Patients are not required to participate in the genomics sub -study in order to enroll in the primary study. Samples for DNA extraction should be collected on cycle 1 day 1 (baseline/predose) but may be collected at any stu dy visit. The DNA samples for the genomics sub -study will be double -coded as defined by the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guideline E15. Sub -study samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock and may be used for research purposes. The purpose of the genomic analyses is to identify genomic associations with clinical or biomarker response, other clinical outcome measures, and possible AEs. In addition, associations between genomic variants and prog nosis or progression of other diseases may also be studied. These data may be used or combined with data collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study treatment or other diseases. Analyses may include sequence determination or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions. Other methods, including whole -exome sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, and DNA copy number, may also be performed. The list of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during the course of this study or sample storage period. 8. STUDY TREATMENTS 8.1.

For pemetrexed, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine, instructions for storage, handling, and administration are to be found in the appropriate Summary of Product Characteristics or package insert or pharmacy reference sheets. For the IC options, doses are weight -based. For cycle 1/day 1, the investigator should use screening height and weight to calculate dose, but cycle 1/day 1weight is also allowed to be used, per investigator discretion. Weight is measured at start of each cycle. If there is a ≥10% change in weight, the IC chemotherapy dose should be re -calculated. 8.1.2.1. Pemetrexed, Alimta® Drug Class and Mechanism of Action Pemetrexed is a folate analogue that inhibits multiple enzymes involved in both purine and pyrimidine synthesis, including thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductases, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl transferase. Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent, and is primarily eliminated in the urine. Supplier/How Handled See p harmacy manual. Solution Preparation See pharmacy manual. Storage/Stability See pharmacy manual. Administration Pemetrexed will be administered at a dose of 500 mg/m2 as an IV infusion over 10 minutes (±5 minutes) on day 1 of each 21 -day cycle ( Lorusso 2010 ) for up to 96 weeks of treatment. See Section 3.2.3 for rationale in support of IC chemotherapy regimens. To reduce toxicity, patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to take a low dose oral folic acid preparation or multivitamin wi th folic acid on a daily basis (usual dose, 400 μg/day; range, 350 μg/day to 1000 μg/day). At least 5 daily doses of folic acid must be taken in the 7 -day period preceding the first dose of pemetrexed. Daily folic acid dosing should continue during the entire period of pemetrexed treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive 1 intramuscular injection of 1000 μg vitamin B 12 in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and with every third pemetrexed dose th ereafter (every 9 weeks, if no delays in pemetrexed dosing). Subsequent 1000 μg vitamin B 12 injections may be given on the same day as pemetrexed infusions. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Topotecan Drug Class and Mechanism of Action Topotecan is a cell cycle -specific inhibitor of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I. It has a mean half-life of approximately 3 hours. Topotecan’s metabolism and clearance are complex but it is estimated that approximately 40% of the drug undergoes renal clearance. Supplier/How Supplied See pharmacy manual. Solution Preparation See pharmacy manual. Storage/Stability See pharmacy manual. Administration Topotecan 1 mg/m2 will be administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes (±10 minutes) daily for 5 consecutive days, starting on day 1 of a 21 -day course ( Bookman 2000 ) for up to 96 weeks of treatment. See Se ction 3.2.3 for rationale in support of IC chemotherapy regimens. For patients who do not experience significant toxicity with the first course of topotecan, subsequent courses may be increased to topotecan 1.25 mg/m2 daily x 5 days, every 21 days. Adverse effects See FDA/EMA -approved (or local equivalent) topotecan prescribing information for a comprehensive list of AEs associated with topotecan. 8.1.2.3. Irinotecan Drug Class and Mechanism of Action Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase 1, which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single -strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN -38 bind to the topoisomerase 1 -DNA complex and prevent relegation of these single strand breaks. Cytotoxicity of irinotecan is thought be due to double -stranded damage during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interaction with ternary complex formed by DNA/topoisomerase 1/irinotecan or SN -38. Mammalian cells cannot efficient repair these double -strand breaks. Supplier/How Supplied See pharmacy manual. Stability/Storage See pharmacy manual.

Adverse Events See FDA/EMA -approved (or local equivalent) vinorelbine prescribing information for a comprehensive list of AEs associated with vinorelbine. 8.2. Pretreatments No premedicat ions are to be administered for the first dose of cemiplimab. If needed, premedication will be allowed for subsequent doses of cemiplimab to manage any observed low - grade infusion reactions. For the IC chemotherapy options, appropriate premedication for s tudy treatments may be administered at the investigator’s discretion as per usual clinical practice and in accordance with institutional guidelines. Premedications should be procured by the investigative sites where allowed by local regulations. In count ries in which local regulations do not allow premedications to be procured as local commercial product for the study, Regeneron may provide the premedications to the study sites. For patients who receive pemetrexed, premedications should include folate and vitamin B 12, per manufacturer’s instructions. At least 5 daily doses of folic acid (usual dose, 400 μg/day; range, 350 μg/day to 1000 μg/day) must be taken in the 7 -day period preceding the first dose of pemetrexed. Patients must also receive 1 intramuscular injection of 1000 μg vitamin B 12 in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed. Skin rashes have been reported to be more severe in patients not pretreated with corticosteroid prior to pemetrexed. Pretreatment with dexamethasone (or eq uivalent) reduces the incidence and severity of cutaneous reaction to pemetrexed. Dexamethasone 4 mg (or equivalent) should be given twice daily on the day before, the day of, and the day after pemetrexed infusion. 8.3. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Di scontinuation Rules for Cemiplimab Adverse events are to be reported according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) version 4.03.

Dose Modification The general approach regarding missed doses of cemipl imab (eg, due to AEs) is “time marches on.” Missed doses of systemic therapy will not be made up, unless ≤3 business days from the scheduled date. The planned dose and schedule is a 350 mg flat dose of cemiplimab IV over approximately 30 minutes (±10 minu tes) Q3W. Patients will generally remain on the assigned dosage of cemiplimab throughout the course of study treatment. The general approach to cemiplimab toxicity management is dose interruption rather than dose modification. Cemiplimab treatment may b e held at any time upon occurrence of a treatment -related AE. General guidelines for cemiplimab treatment modifications due to treatment -related AEs and irAEs are provided in Table 4 and Table 5. These recommendations should be seen as guidelines, and the treating physician should exercise clinical j udgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual patient.

For any severe (grade 3 -4) irAE, if symptoms worsen or do not improve on adequate corticosteroids within 48 to 72 hours, consider adding additional immunosuppressive agents (to be selected from agents such as infliximab, cyclophosphamide, cycl osporine, mycophenolate mofetil). Referral of the patient to a specialized unit for assessment and treatment should be considered. In the limited circumstances in which cemiplimab dose modifications are called for in the toxicity management guidelines, t he dose reductions will be as per Table 6. The medical monitor should be notified of dose reductions.

Immune -Related Adverse Events (irAEs) Investigators must be extremely vigilant and be ready to intervene early in the management of irAEs, as the onset of symptoms of irAEs (eg, pneumonitis) may be subtle. Detailed guidance of management of irAEs is provided in Appendix 2 . In the event of irAEs that are not addressed in Appendix 2, general guidance is provided in Table 5. The recommendations in Table 5 and Appendix 2 should be seen as guidelines, and the treating physician should exercise clinical judgment based on the symptoms and condition of the individual patient. NOTE: Regarding irAEs, for any AE that is of a type known to be potentially immune -related (eg, rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, endocrine), but is deemed not to be an irAE by the investigator, the sponsor may request additional information. Based on the emerging safety profile of cemiplimab and other antibodies targeting the PD -1/PD -L1 axis ( Weber 2015 ) (Naidoo 2015 ), the following working case definitions are provided to help VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
74,page_74,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 75 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL investigators distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs. These case definitions pertain to the more commonly reported irAEs associated with PD -1 inhibition ( Weber 2015 ) (Naidoo 2015 ), and is not exhaustive of all possible irAEs. Clinical presentations of less common irAEs, including neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, renal, a nd ocular events ( Zimmer 2016 ) (Hofmann 2016 ), should be reviewed in patients with concerning presentations. The case definitions below have not been validated, and are intended only as guidance for inves tigators to help distinguish irAEs from non -immune AEs. Investigators’ clinical judgment may include other factors when determining immune -relatedness. The case definitions for irAEs may evolve as clinical experience increases with cemiplimab and other a ntibodies targeting the PD-1/PD -L1 axis. a. Immune -related rash : Skin examination demonstrates a rash that is usually maculopapular, but other presentations may occur, including papulopustular, follicular, or urticarial dermatitis. Consider dermatologic con sultation and biopsy for atypical presentations. Exclude other cause such as virally -induced rash or contact dermatitis. b. Immune -related diarrhea/colitis : These events are on a continuum, with diarrhea defined as increased stool frequency, and colitis inv olves abdominal pain and/or radiologic evidence of colonic inflammation ( Naidoo 2015 ). Onset at 4 to 6 weeks is common ( Weber 2015 ). A CT scan usually demonstrates diffuse colitis ( Tirumani 2015 ). Exclude Clostridium difficile or other infectious etiologies and exclude laxative misuse. c. Immune -related hepatitis : Laboratory studies are notable for elevated ALT and/or AST that is usually asymptomatic. Viral or other drug -induced he patitis is excluded. Exclude alcohol -related liver toxicity. If clinically appropriate, consider radiologic imaging to exclude malignant causes. If clinically appropriate, exclude worsening of underlying cirrhosis. d. Immune -related hypothyroidism : Labora tory studies are notable for elevated TSH associated with low serum free thyroxine (free T4). If elevated TSH is detected, it is recommended that free T4 level also be tested. Elevated TSH with low free T4 establishes the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hy pothyroidism may be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, cold intolerance, dry skin, weight gain, and/or bradycardia. Exclude other causes of hypothyroidism, such as prior radiation therapy to the neck. In patients with prior history of hypothyroidism, exclude noncompliance with thyroid replacement medication. e. Immune -related hyperthyroidism : Hyperthyroidism should be managed with standard antithyroid pharmacotherapy, and consultation with an endocrinologist is recommend ed. f. Immune -related pneumonitis : Pneumonitis, defined as inflammation of the lung parenchyma, may present as shortness of breath, cough, fever, and/or chest pain. Median time from start of anti -PD-1 therapy to onset of pneumonitis is 2.6 months ( Nishino 2016 ), but delayed onset of pneumonitis has been reported. The most common radiologic pattern on CT chest has been described as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, but other radiographic patterns may occur ( Nishino 2016 ). If performed, biopsy may demonstrate lymphocyte -predominant interstitial pneumonitis with areas of organizing pneumonia (Nishino 2016 ). Exclude infectious causes of pneumonitis. Adverse events that meet the criter ia above should be entered using the appropriate terms (see Appendix 3 for terms corresponding to common potential irAEs), and attributing them as related to cemiplimab. Such related events will be assumed to be irAEs in the database (unless VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Page 76 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL medical review of d ata raises questions regarding the attribution and are queried). If AEs corresponding to the common terms are attributed as NOT related to (cemiplimab), additional information should be provided substantiating an alternative attribution (eg, infectious di arrhea). If not provided at the outset, this information may be requested by immediate edit checks or in subsequent queries. 8.3.3. Resumption of Cemiplimab After Treatment Hold, or Discontinuation Resumption of cemiplimab after resolution of adverse event to ≤g rade 1 (or baseline) is allowed at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with the toxicity management guidelines in this protocol if resumption of treatment is thought to be in best interest of the patient. Treatment after an AE may resume, at the discretion of the investigator, if the AE is felt to be manageable through supportive/medical therapy (eg, grade 3 hypertension that can be controlled with the addition of a second anti -hypertensive agent). However, cemiplimab treatment resumption is not allowed in the following circumstances: • Patients with events that require cemiplimab to be permanently discontinued or held for more than 84 days from last scheduled dose • Patients with ≥grade 2 uveitis. Patients with grade 2 uveitis will generally be discontinued from cemiplimab treatment, unless there is resolution to ≤grade 1 AND approval from the medical monitor at the sponsor prior to resumption of treatment. Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study should continue follow -up in the study without additional treatment until PD, completion of all study assessments, or closure of the study ( Section 6.3). After PD, all patients should be followed for survival. 8.4. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules for Investigator’s Choice Chemotherapy Adverse events are to be reported according to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. Dose adjust ments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir observed hematologic counts or maximum nonhematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery, patients should be retreated using guidelines in the following subsections. The general approach regarding missed doses of IC chemotherapy (eg, due to AEs) is ""time marches on.” Missed doses of IC chemotherapy will not be made up, unless ≤3 business days from the scheduled date. The following section provides toxicity management guidelines for selected AEs that are characteristic for the IC agents, pemetrexed, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine. For other chemotherapy -related AEs that are not spe cifically addressed in the following sections, the general approach for ≥ grade 3 chemotherapy treatment -related AEs is to hold chemotherapy until resolution of the event to ≤ grade 1 or baseline, and to reduce by one dose level on resumption of treatment. 8.4.1.

Renally impaired patients: In clinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance ≥45 mL/min required no dose adjustments other than those required for all patients. Insufficient numbers of patients with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min have been treated to make dosage recommendations for this group. Therefore, pemetrexed should not be administered to patients wi th creatinine clearance <45 mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula. Caution should be used in administering pemetrexed concurrently with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs to patients with creatinine clearance <80 mL/min.

In patients pres enting with neutropenia, fever, and a compatible pattern of abdominal pain, consider the possibility of neutropenic colitis. • For patients for whom dose was increased to 1.25 mg/m2 after the first course and then experienced any toxicity requiring dose redu ction, the recommended first dose reduction is to 1.0 mg/m2. • Topotecan can cause interstitial lung disease (ILD), which can be fatal. Monitor patients for symptoms indicative of interstitial lung disease (cough, fever, dyspnea, or/or hypoxia), and discontinue topotecan if a new diagnosis of ILD is confirmed. 8.4.3. Irinotecan Dose Modifications The starting dose for irinotecan is 100 mg/m2 weekly x 4, followed by 10 to 14 days of rest. Patients who experience toxicity at 100 mg/m2 will undergo a first dose reduction (dose level -1) to 75 mg/m2. Patients who experience toxicity at 75 mg/m2 will undergo a second dose reduction to dose level -2) of 50 mg/m2. For patients who experience toxicity with 125 mg/m2 after an increase from the starting dose of 100 mg/m2 (described in Section 8.1.2.3 ), the recommended first dose reduction is to 100 mg/m2. A new cycle of therapy should n ot begin until the granulocyte count has recovered to ≥1500/mm3, and the platelet count has recovered to ≥100,000/mm3, and treatment -related diarrhea has fully resolved. Treatment should be delayed for 1 to 2 weeks to allow for recovery of irinotecan -related toxicities. If the patient has not recovered after a 2 -week delay, consideration should be given to discontinuing irinotecan. Dose modifications of irinotecan for specific toxicities are provided in Table 10.

Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules, General Guidance Guidelines for discontinuation of cemiplimab or IC chemotherapy due to AEs are provided in Sections 8.3 and 8.4, respectively. This section provides general guidance on protocol requirements after discontinuation of either cemiplimab or IC chemotherapy. 8.5.1. Study Drug Discontinuation Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw fro m the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule. Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section 7.1.4 . Any patient currently receiving cemiplimab who was previously treated with a phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -K) inhibitor and who develops stomatitis or mucositis should temporarily suspend study treatment. If this or any other immune -related AE occurs among these patients, the sponsor should be informed as soon as possible to discuss further management of the patient. An irAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI 3 -K inhibitor should be reported as an AESI. 8.5.1.1. Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment Reasons for permanent discontinuation of study treatment may include, but are not limited to: • An infusion reaction of grade ≥3 severity during or directly following infusion • Patient withdrawal of consent at any time • Any medical condition that the investigator or sponsor determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study or conti nues treatment with study drug • The investigator or sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient • Patient noncompliance (eg, not complying with protocol required visits, assessments, and dosing instructions) • Evidence of pregnancy • Progression of disease • Unacceptable toxicity • Treatment delay of ≥84 consecutive days from last dose of cemiplimab or IC of chemotherapy due to toxicity 8.6. Treatment Beyond Progression in the Cemiplimab Treatment Group For a small percentage of cancer patients treated wi th anti -PD-1 therapy, unconventional responses may occur in which radiologic evidence of progression on therapy occurs before subsequent radiologic response. To account for this possibility in the cemiplimab treatment group, treatment beyond progression m ay be allowed after consultation with the medical monitor at Regeneron if the following conditions are met: VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Page 83 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL • The patient has stable performance status • The patient does not have rapid progression of disease • The patient has not experienced adverse events that would require permanent discontinuation of cemiplimab • The patient provides written informed consent prior to resuming treatment by signing the current version of the ICF (eg, the patient repeats the written informed consent that was done prior to initial study enrollment). • It is understood that, if there is further progression after resumption of treatment (≥30% increase in tumor burden from the time of initial progressive disease by RECIST criteria; this includes an increase in the sum of all target lesi ons and/or the development of new lesions), that cemiplimab will be discontinued. 8.7. Management of Acute Reactions 8.7.1. Acute Infusion Reactions Acute infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 hours after the infusion is completed. Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of infusion reactions must be available for immediate use. All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (as defined in Section 9.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section 9.5.1 . In the event of an infusio n reaction of grade 3 or greater severity during or directly following cemiplimab infusion, dosing should be stopped and the patient must be permanently discontinued from cemiplimab treatment. To assist investigators in identifying cemiplimab -related infus ion reactions, the following case definition is provided: • Typical symptoms may include fever, chills, rigors, skin flushing, dyspnea, back pain, abdominal pain, and nausea • Infusion reactions usually occur either during the infusion or within 2 hours after the infusion is completed • Vital signs may be notable for hypotension and/or tachycardia The investigator’s clinical judgment may include other factors when evaluating a possible cemiplimab -related infusion reaction. For example, rarely, an infusion reacti on may occur up to 24 hours after initiation of the infusion. Case report forms must capture start and stop time of the event, signs and symptoms, and management interventions (medications, interruption of infusion, rate reduction). Patients who experience grade ≥3 acute infusion reactions to IC chemotherapy should discontinue treatment. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
83,page_83,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 84 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL 8.7.1.1. Interruption of the Infusion The infusion should be interrupted if any of the following AEs are observed: • cough • rigors/chills • rash, pruritus (itching) • urticaria (hives, welts, wheals) • diaphoresis (sweating) • hypotension • dyspnea (shortness of breath) • vomiting • flushing The reaction(s) should be treated symptomatically, and the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the original rate. If investigators feel there is a medical need for treatment or discontinuation of the infusion other than described above, they should use clinical judgment to provide the appropriate response according to typical clinical practice. For patients who experience infusion -related hypersensitivity re actions that are less than grade 3 and who plan to continue treatment, premedication will be required for re -treatment. For grade 1 symptoms (mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated), the following prophylactic medica tions are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 mg to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes prior to subsequent cemiplimab infusions. For grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction that requires therap y or infusion interruption, but for which symptoms resolve promptly with appropriate treatment such as antihistamines, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, and/or IV fluids; prophylactic medications indicated ≤24 hours), the fo llowing prophylactic medications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 mg to 1000 mg at least 30 minutes prior to subsequent cemiplimab infusions. If necessary, corticosteroids (u p to 25 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 8.7.1.2. Termination of the Infusion The infusion should be terminated and NOT restarted if any of the following AEs occur: • anaphylaxis • laryngeal/pharyngeal edema • severe bronchospasm • chest pain VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Method of Treatment Assignment Approximat ely 590 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either cemiplimab or IC of chemotherapy, according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the designa ted study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization will be stratified according to: 1. Histology (squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma). Adenosquamous histology be considered adenocarcinoma for purposes of stratification. 2. Geographic Region: North America versus Asia versus Rest of World (ROW) 3. Prior bevacizumab (yes/no) 4. ECOG performance status (0,1) The stratification factors of “prior bevacizumab use” and “ECOG performance status” are used for balancing treatment assignment only and will no t be included in the statistical model for analysis of the primary endpoint. After it is confirmed that the patient meets all eligibility criteria, she will be enrolled in IVRS. The following information must be provided at time of enrollment, prior to ra ndomization: • Patient number • Date of birth • Histology (squamous cell carcinoma versus adenocarcinoma). Adenosquamous histology will be considered adenocarcinoma for purposes of stratification and analysis. Starting with Amendment 5, only squamous cell patien ts will be enrolled • Geographic region • Prior bevacizumab (yes/no) • ECOG performance status (0,1) • Choice of Investigator’s Choice treatment After a patient is enrolled in IWRS with this information, she will be randomized (1:1) to either cemiplimab or Investi gator’s Choice of chemotherapy. 8.8.1.

Patients using immunosuppressive doses (>10 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent) of systemic corticosteroids other than for corticosteroid replacement will not be eligible for the study. For patients on the cemiplimab arm, it is recommended that patients do not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu -Medrol®) or dexamet hasone (Decadron®) at any time throughout the study except in the case of a life - threatening emergency and/or to treat an irAE. NOTE : Bisphosphonates and denosumab are not prohibited. 8.10.2. Permitted Medications and Procedures Physiologic replacement doses of s ystemic corticosteroids are permitted, even if >10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non -autoimmune conditions (eg, delayed -type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted. NOTE : Bisphosphonates and denosumab are not prohibited. Radiation therapy is not part of the study regimen in either the experimental group or the control group. Patients for whom radiation therapy is planned are not e ligible. If, during the course of the study, a patient develops a symptomatic lesion for which palliative radiation therapy is deemed appropriate by the investigator, this will be deemed PD, and generally, the patient would be removed form study. Palliat ive radiation therapy may be allowed in certain circumstances in patients who have been on study for at least 24 weeks. Palliative radiation is only allowed to a non-target lesion in this study. If the investigator feels that palliative radiation therapy to a non -target lesion, followed by resumption of the assigned treatment (cemiplimab or IC of chemotherapy) after radiation is in the best interest of the patient, such cases must be discussed with and approved by the medical monitor prior to initiation of palliative radiation therapy. The patient will be deemed to have experienced PD if radiation therapy is instituted, but will be followed for OS. 9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, REPORTING, AND MONIT ORING 9.1. Obligations of Investigator The investigator must promptly repo rt to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) all unanticipated problems involving risks to patients according to local regulations. 9.2. Obligations of Sponsor During the course of the study, the sponsor will report in an expedited manner al l SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the study drug (suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction), to the health authorities, IRBs/ECs as appropriate, and to the investigators. Any AE not listed as an expected event in the Reference Safety Information section of the cemiplimab Investigator’s Brochure or in the reference safety document for the IC chemotherapy VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

In addition, the sponsor will report all other SAEs to the health authorities, according to local regulations. At the completion of the study, the sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clini cal study report to health authorities and IRB/EC as appropriate. 9.3. Definitions 9.3.1. Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug, which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered, related to the study drug. An AE also includes any worsening (i e, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug. Progression of underlying malignancy will not be considered an AE if it is clearly consistent with the typical progression pattern of the underlying cancer (including time course, affected organs, etc.). Similarly, death due to progression of malignancy will be considered a study endpoint but not an AE. Clinical symptoms of progression may be reported as AEs if the symptom cannot be determined as exclusively due to the progression of the underlying malignancy, or does not fit the expected pattern of progression for the disease under study. If there is any uncertainty about an AE being due only to progr ession of the underlying malignancy, it should be reported as an AE or SAE as outlined in Section 9.4. 9.3.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger). • Is life-threatening – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might ha ve caused death. • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).

Page 89 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospital ization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse). Hospitalization or death due solely to manifestations consistent with typical progression of underlying malignancy will not be considered an SAE. 9.3.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further investi gation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rapid communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (eg, regulators) might also be warranted (Section 9.4.3 ). 9.3.4. Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions are defined as any AE that occurs during the infusion or within 2 hours after the infusion is completed. All infusion reactions must be reported as AEs (see S ection 9.4.1 ) and graded using the grading scale as instructed in Section 9.5.1 . 9.4. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 9.4.1. Adverse Events The investigator (or designee) will seek information on AEs at each patient contact, and record all AEs that occur from the time the informed consent is signed until 90 days after the last study treatment, or until the patient commences another anticancer systemic therapy, whichever comes first. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only the following AEs should be repo rted: • SAEs • Non-SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (eg, non -SAEs related to invasive procedures such as biopsies) Other AEs that occur prior to the first treatment should be reported on the medical history CRF. All AEs after initiation of study treatment and until 90 days after the last study treatment, regardless of relationship to study treatment, will be reported on the AE CRF. Additionally, any SAE or other AE of concern that the investigator believes may be related to study treatment and that occurs later than 90 days after last study treatment, or after the patient has commenced another anticancer systemic therapy (whichever comes first) should be reported. Study treatment includes cemiplimab, pemetrexed, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, irinotec an, and topotecan. VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Serious Adverse Events All SAEs, regardless of assessment of causal relationship to study treatment must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours. Refer to the study reference manuals for the procedure to be followed. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -up report. Substantiating data such a s relevant hospital or medical records and diagnostic test reports may also be requested. In the event the investigator is informed of an SAE that occurs after 90 days after the last dose of study treatment, or after the patient commences another anticance r systemic therapy (whichever comes first), only those SAEs or other AEs of concern deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment will be reported to the sponsor. The investigator should make every effort to obtain follow -up information on t he outcome of a treatment -related SAE until the event is considered chronic and/or stable. 9.4.3. Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting to Sponsor The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the event: Symptomatic Overdose of Study Drug: Accidental or intentional overdose of at least 2 times the intended dose of study drug within the intended therapeutic window, if associated with an AE. Pregnancy: Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24 hours of identification, any pregnancy occurring in a female during the study or within 6 months of the last dose of study drug. Any complication of pregnancy affe cting a female study patient and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor. Adverse Events of Special Interest (applicable to cemiplimab only): All AESI, s erious and nonserious, must be reported within 24 hours of identification using the same reporting process as for SAE reporting, per Section 9.4.2 . Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: The following will be considered AESI for this study: • Grade ≥2 infusion related reactions • Grade ≥2 allergic/hyper sensitivity reaction • Grade ≥3 irAEs (see Section 8.3.2 ) • An irAE of any grade in a patient previously treated with a PI 3 -K inhibitor NOTE (Applicabl e to cemiplimab only): An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of treatment.

NOTE : Regarding irAEs, for any AE that is of a type known to be potentially immune -related (eg rash, colitis, elevated transaminases, or endocrine) but is deemed not to be an irAE by the investigator, the sponsor may request additional information. 9.4.4. Reporting Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from the Study All AEs that lead to a patient’s withdrawal from the st udy must be reported to the sponsor’s medical monitor within 30 days. 9.4.5. Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE include: • the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or • the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or • the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments), discontin uation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria. Repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormali ties will be assessed according to the scale outlined in Section 9.5.1 . 9.4.6. Follow -up Information for any non -SAE that starts during the treatment perio d or within 90 days after last treatment will be collected from the time of the event until resolution of the event, or until the patient’s last study visit, whichever comes first.

Adverse events not listed i n the NCI -CTCAE will be graded according to the following scale: 1 (Mild): Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 2 (Moderate): Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indic ated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)*. 3 (Severe): Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care AD L**. 4 (Life –threatening): Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 5 (Death): Death related to AE * Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL) refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managi ng money, etc. ** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of physiological impairm ent the value indicates. 9.5.2. Evaluation of Causality Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug: The relationship of AEs or SAEs to study drug will be assessed by the investigator, and will be a clinical decision based on all available information. The following question will be addressed: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE or SAE may have been caused by the study drug? The possible answers are: Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug A list of factors to consider when assessing the relationship of AEs or SAEs to study drug is provided in Appendix 4. The investigator should justify the causality assessment of each SAE. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Conduct: The relationship of AEs or SAEs to study conduct will be assessed b y the investigator, and will be a clinical decision based on all available information. The following question will be addressed: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE or SAE may have been caused by study conduct? VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

Safety Monitoring The in vestigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements of this protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion. The sponsor will monitor the safety data from across all study sites. The medical monitor will have primary responsibility for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments (eg, Pharmacovigilance and Risk Manageme nt; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on a periodic cumulative aggregate basis. 9.7. Investigator Alert Notification Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investiga tors participating in this clinical trial, as well as in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s Brochure or this protocol, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the medicinal/study drug). 10. STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to ac commodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked. Analysis variables are list ed in Section 4. Data collected regarding the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the patients will be summarized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). Any additional analyses and methods required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 on the efficacy (eg, missing data due to COVID -19) and safety evaluation will be specified in the SAP. 10.1. Statistical Hypothesis The primary analysis of OS will be performed for the following null (H 0) and alternative hypotheses (H 1): • H0: The survival curve of OS for cemiplimab is the same as that for IC chemotherapy VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
93,page_93,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 94 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL • H1: The survival curve of OS for cemiplimab is superior to that for IC chemotherapy. 10.2. Justification of Sample Size The primary endpoint will be overall survival among patients treated with cemiplimab versus IC of chemotherapy. After progression on platinum -taxane based chemotherapy, there is no standard of care. The median OS has been reported in rang e of 6.5 months to 8.1 months in the phase 2 setting ( Lorusso 2010 ) (Miller 2008 ) (Schilder 2005 ) (Bookman 2000 ). The primary OS endpoint will be tested in patients with SCC first. If the null hypothesis is rejected in SCC patients, then OS will be tested in the overall population. The sample size and power are calculated using East® version 6.4.1 statistical software. The sponsor assumes a median OS o f 7 months for SCC patients treated with IC chemotherapy and a median OS of 10 months for SCC patients treated with cemiplimab. The assumptions correspond to an approximately 42.8% increase in median OS and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.7 if OS is distributed exponentially in both treatment groups. Two interim efficacy analyses are planned using Lan -DeMets (O’Brien -Fleming) spending function at 70% and 85% of the total OS events, respectively. A total of 340 OS events in SCC patients will yield approximately 90% power to detect an HR of 0.7 with an overall type I error of 0.025 (1 -sided). The details of alpha spending at interim and final analyses based on the planned number of OS events are provided in Section 10.5. Considering the enrollment rate (2 patients/month for months 1 to 5, 9 patients/month for months 6 to 16, 20 patients/month for months 17 to 23, and 22 patients/month for month 24 and beyond) an d 10% dropout rate per year, enrollment of 460 randomized SCC patients will yield 340 OS events for analysis of OS around 42 months after the first SCC patient is randomized. At the time when 460 SCC patients are enrolled in the study, a total enrollment in the study of approximately 590 patients is projected (SCC plus non -SCC). The actual number of patients to be enrolled will depend on the proportion of adenocarcinoma patients in the patient population and the time when Amendment 5 is implemented at eac h of the study sites. If the HR is 0.7, the power for testing OS in the overall population will be higher than 90%. 10.3. Analysis Sets 10.3.1. Efficacy Analysis Sets The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. This is the intention to treat populat ion. The FAS is based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the FAS. 10.3.2. Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis set (SAF) includes all randomized patients who received any study drug. This population is b ased on the treatment received (as treated). Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables will be analyzed using the SAF.

Efficacy Analyses 10.4.5.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary anal ysis of OS will be implemented after the pre -specified numbers ( Table 15) of OS events have been reported in patients with SCC. The analyses will include all survival information available at the time. The primary endpoint of OS will be analyzed in SCC patients first by stratified log -rank test using geographic region (North America versus Asia -Pacific versus ROW) as a stratification factor. The HR an d its 95% CI will be estimated by a stratified Cox regression model using the treatment as covariate. If the analysis of OS is statistically significant in the SCC patients, then the analysis of OS will be performed in the overall population by stratified log-rank test using the following stratification factors: 1. Histology: SCC versus adenocarcinoma. Adenosquamous histology will be considered adenocarcinoma for the purpose of stratification. 2. Geographic Region: North America versus Asia Pacific versus ROW. The HR and its 95% CI will be estimated by a stratified Cox regression model using the treatment as covariate. 10.4.5.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis The multiplicity is controlled by a hierarchical testing procedure as follows: The primary endpoint OS will be teste d in SCC patients first. If statistically significant, OS will be tested in the overall population. If statistically significant, the secondary endpoints PFS and ORR will be tested.

Additional Statistical Data Handling Conventions The following analysis and data conventions will be followed: Definition of baseline: • Unless otherwise specified, the last assessment before the initial administration of cemiplimab will be considered the baseline evaluation for safety measure ments. And the last assessment before the randomization will be considered the baseline evaluation for efficacy measurements. General rules for handling missing data: • Unless otherwise specified, there will be no imputations for the missing data. • The pattern of missing data and potential prognostic factors for missing data (QOL, clinical neurologic assessment, and mental status) will be examined to guide the use of proper statistical models. • If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incom plete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study drug except if an incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to treatment. If the partial date indicates the same month or year of the intake of study drug date, then the start date by the study drug intake date will be imputed; otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed.

RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS: RECIST GUIDE LINE (VERSION 1.1) For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response at day 42 (±7 days) in cycles 1 through 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. Confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation of objective response. Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1; Eisenhauer 2009 ). Changes in the large st diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. Selection of Lesions • Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accur ately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm (≥2 cm) by chest x -ray or as ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) with CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). • Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm (≥1.5 cm) in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm [0.5 cm]). At basel ine and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. • Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm [<1 cm] or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm [≥1 to <1.5 cm] short axis), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable. NOTE: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ th ought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. • Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion do es not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesio ns will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"
112,page_112,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 113 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. • Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease All measurements should be taken a nd recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but ar e assessable by clinical exam. • Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm (≥1 cm) diameter as assessed using calipers (eg, skin nodules). In the ca se of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. • Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT is preferable. • Conventional CT and MRI . This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm (0.5 cm) or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm (0.5 cm), the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situation. • PET -CT. At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIS T measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data, which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or seriall y performed. • Ultrasound . Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are o perator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.

If there is con cern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances. • Endoscopy, Laparoscopy . The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following CR or surgical resection is an endpoint. • Tumor markers . Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above th e upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. • Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and CR in rare cases (eg, residual lesions in tumor t ypes, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease • 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) . While FDG -PET response assessments need ad ditional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to t he following algorithm: a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this is PD. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD wil l be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. c. FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a resp onse to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring. The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. NOTE: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is F DG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

114,page_114,"Clinical Study Protocol R2810 -ONC -1676 Amendment 7 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 115 of 145 CONFIDENTIAL Response Criteria Evaluation of Target Lesions • Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether t arget or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (<1 cm). • Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. • Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstra te an absolute increase of at least 5 mm (0.5 cm). NOTE: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). • Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as r eference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions • Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm [<1 cm] short axis). NOTE: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. • Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor mar ker level above the normal limits. • Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be representat ive of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase. Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status should be c onfirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator). Evaluation of Overall Response Criteria The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until PD/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the sm allest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer 2009 ) are summarized in the table: VV-RIM-00146791-1.0 Approved - 14 Apr 2021 GMT-5:00"

In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as PD. Missing Assessments and Inevaluable Designation When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of progre ssive disease. For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with 3 measured lesions and at follow -up only 2 lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved progressive disease status, regardless of the contrib ution of the missing lesion. Best Overall Response: All Time Points The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known. Best response determination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT requir ed: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and progressive disease on last assessment has a best overall response of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, progressive disease at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best response of progressive disease.
