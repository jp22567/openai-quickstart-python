As stated above, actual surgery is an important secondary efficacy endpoint .Evaluation of this key secondary endpoint will be based only on invasive procedures involving instruments resulting in incision and remo val of tissue (eg polypectomy).

Nasal obstruction is collected daily throughout the study via eDiary. Nasal obstruction at Week 52 will be calcu lated as the mean of all measurements made in the 4 weeks prior to the visit (excluding the day of the visit). The mean VAS score over the last 7 days before Visit 2 will be used to determine the baseline value. Each primary endpoint will be analysed using a categorical approach. The change from baseline in each endpoint at Week 52 will categorised by various levels of improvement (e.g. 1 point decrease, 2 point decrease, 3 point decrease, 4 point or greater decrease), no change or worsening in score, and a least favourable category of actual surgery by Week 52. Participants who withdraw prematurely from the study will be included in the lowest efficacy category (actual surgery). Each co -primary endpoint will be analysed using an ordinal logistic regressio n model (proportional odds model) with covariates of treatment group, baseline score and region. The comparison of mepolizumab with placebo will be expressed as an odds ratio and presented with corresponding 95% confidence interval and p -value.

For the proportional odds model, it is unnecessary to assign scores to the response categories, and if the model holds for a particular set of response categories, it holds with the same effects when the response scale is collapsed in any way (McCulla gh, 1980). In comparisons of two treatments with no adjustment for covariates, this approach becomes equivalent to the Wilcoxon test. Change to: Total endoscopic nasal polyp score is collected at each clinical visit, the primary assessment will be at week 52 (centrally read data). Nasal obstruction is collected daily throughout the study via eDiary. Nasal obstruction at Week 52 will be calculated as the mean of all measurements made in the 4 weeks prior to the visit (excluding the day of the visit). The me an VAS score over the last 7 days before Visit 2 will be used to determine the baseline value. Participants who undergo surgery/sinuplasty prior to Week 52 will be assigned their worst observed value prior to surgery/sinuplasty. Participants who withdraw from the study without having experienced surgery/sinuplasty will be assigned their worst observed score prior to study withdrawal. The comparison of mepolizumab with placebo will be expressed as a difference in median change from baseline presented with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, the p -value for the difference between treatment groups will be based on the non -parametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test . The difference in median change between placebo and mepolizumab with associated 95% confidence intervals will be assessed by quantile regression using a bootstrap approach ( Mehrotra DV 2017; Keene ON 2018), with covariates of treatment group, baseline score, baseline blood eosinophil count and region. 2020N427698_00"

SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: Arandomised, double -blind, parallel group PhIII study to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of 100 mg SC Mepolizumab as an add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral nasal polyps -SYNAPSE (StudY in NAsal Polyps patients to assess the Safet y and Efficacy of mepolizumab) Short Title: Effect of Mepolizumab in severe bilateral nasal poly ps Rationale: Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa, mAb) that blocks human interleukin -5 (hIL-5) from binding to the IL -5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling. Neutralization of IL -5 with mepolizumab has been shown to reduce blood, sputum and tissue eosinophils and this has led GSKto develop mepolizumab as a treatment option in a number of eosinophilic diseases including nasal poly ps (NP). NUCALA (mepolizumab) is currentl y approved in countries such as the United States (US), Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Switzerl and and Taiwan as an add - on maintenance treatment (100 mg subcutaneously [SC] once every 4 weeks [Q4W]) for patients with severe asthma, and with an eosinophilic phenoty pe. NUCALA is currentl y provided as a l yophilized powder in a vial requiring reconstit ution with sterile water for injection, however development of a liquid formulation is also underway . As of September 2016, approximately 3744 participants have been exposed to at least one dose of mepolizumab in clinical studies across various eosinophi lic-mediated indications. In addition, there are currently over 300 participants receiving mepolizumab as part of three long term access and compassionate use programs. All studies have shown that mepolizumab is well tolerated when administered by SC, intravenous (IV), or intramuscular (IM) routes. The highest dose administered in these studies was 750 mg IV. A total of 74 participants with NP have been treated with mepolizumab 750 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in two Phase II clinical studies ( CRT110178 and MPP111782). Both studies provided information to suggest potential for efficacy and that the overall safet y profile of mepolizumab in NP was similar to that observed in the mepolizumab clinical program in severe asthma and there were no kn own safet y concerns that would preclude developing mepolizumab in NP. Study CRT110178 was a n investigator -led, collaborative research study of randomised, double-blind, placebo -controlled design of mepolizumab versus placebo in participants with severe primary NPs (Grade 3 or 4) or NPs that were recurrent after surgery (Grade 1 to 4). Participants were randomized to receive two single IV injections (28 day s apart) of mepolizumab 750 mg IV (n=20) or placebo (n=10). The stud y was double blind up to 48weeks. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score (sum of left and right nostril scores) assessed by endoscopy at Week 8. There was a statistically significant difference between mepolizumab 750 mg IV compared to placebo at Week 8 ( -1.22, 90% CI: -2.28, -0.17; one –sided p=0.0258). 2020N427698_00"
22,page_22,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 23In the responder analy sis (last observation carried forward -LOCF), mepolizumab produced a significant reduction in NP score in 60% of participants versus 10% of participants who received placebo. These effects were confirmed b y changes on computed tomograph y (CT)scans. There were also significant improvements in symptoms such as loss of smell, postnasal drip, and obstruction at Week 8 with mepolizumab, but not in rhinorrhoea. Study MPP111782 was originall y designed as a two -part (Part A and Part B) randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi -centre study to investigate the use of mepolizumab 750 mg IV versus placebo in reducing the need for surgery in participants with severe bilat eral NP refractory to current standard of care (SoC). All participants were in need of surgery at the start of the study and had at least one prior surgery . One hundred and five participants were randomizedto receive either six 750 mg IV injections of mepolizumab (54 participants) or placebo (51 participants), every 4 weeks. Participants who no longer required surgery at the end of Part A had the option to enter Part B where they were followed up for a further 6 months with no treatment. L imited data are available for Part B of the stud y as only 7participants in the placebo group and 14 participants in the mepolizumab group entered before Part B was discontinued. The primary endpoint was reduction in the need for surgery at the end of Part A (4 weeks post last dose, Week 25), defined as both an improvement in overall visual analogue scale (VAS)symptom score and reduction in the endoscopic NP score. A significantly greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab group no longer required surgery at the end of Part A (p=0.003). A difference in mean change from baseline in total endoscopic NP score was observed between placebo and mepolizumab as early as Week 5, with a clear difference b y Week 9. The overall patient -reported VAS sy mptom scores also supported the efficacy of mepolizumab, with a treatment difference from placebo at Week 25 of - 1.78 (95% CI : -2.88, -0.68; p=0.002, PP Population). Statistically significant differences in favourof mepolizumab compared to placebo were also observed in W eek 25 for individual VAS sy mptom scores and Sino -Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT)-22 questionnaire. Taken together, the integrated evidence supports the proposition that mepolizumab may be effective in improving sy mptoms, reducing NP size and reducing the need for surgery in patients with recurrent disease despite current optimal medical management. 2020N427698_00"

Secondary  To evaluate the impact on actual nasal surgery of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placebo Time to first nasal surgery up t o Week 52.  To further evaluate the efficacy of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placebo Change from baseline in mean overall VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52 . To evaluate the impact on quality of life of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placeboChange from baseline in SNOT -22 total score at Week 52 . To fu rther evaluate the efficacy of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placeboProportion of participant srequiring systemic steroids for nasal polyps up to Week 52. To further evaluate the efficac y of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placeboChange from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52. To further evaluate t he efficacy of 100mg mepolizumab compared to placeboChange from baseline in mean individual VAS symptom score for loss of smell during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52. Overall Design: This is a randomized , double-blind, parallel group PhIII stud y to assess the clinical efficacy and safet y of 100 mg SC Mepolizumab as an add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral NP. The objective is to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of mepolizumab 100 mg, administered SC by the Investigator or delegate via a pre-filled safet y syringe every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Efficacy of mepolizumab will be assessed using co -primary endpoint sof change from baseline in endoscopic NP score (0 -8) at Week 52 and nasal obstruction VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52. Measurement of the co-primary endpoints will also be assessed throughout the study. 2020N427698_00"
24,page_24,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 25The key secondary endpoint is time to first actual surgery for NP by Week 52. Other secondary endpoints are the proportion of participant s requiring sy stemicsteroidsfor nasalpolyps, change from baseline in overall VAS sy mptom score, composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) and loss of smell VAS score, QoL (SNOT -22) at Week 52, w ith other time points being captured as “other” endpoints. The study population will consist of adult participants ( 18 years of age) with recurrent severe bilateral NP (defined as an average nasal obstruction VAS sy mptom score of >5 and an endoscopic NP score of at least 5 out of a maximum score of 8, with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavity ). Participants must also have a history of at least one prior surgery for NP, have recurrent NP despite treatment with current SoC and in need for NP surgery. The need for current NP surgery is defined when the participant has an overall VAS symptom score greater than 7 in addition to a NP score 3 in at least one nostril. Study Schematic The study will include a 4 week run in period followed b y randomisati on to a 52 -week treatment period. Throughout the entire study period (run in +treatment period + follow up), participants will be on the SoC for NP which consists of daily mometasone furorate nasal spray (MF), and if required, saline nasal douching, occa sional short courses of high dose OCS and/or antibiotics. At the start of run in and throughout the study , participants will be placed on MF at the maximum prescribed dose (if not alread y) according to local label, if available, or in line with local SoC. The maximum dose is 2 actuations (50 micrograms (μg)/actuation) in each nostril twice daily which equals a total daily dose of 400 μg. For participants intolerant to this dose, the lower dose of 200 g can be used (2 actuations (50 g /actuation) in each nostril once daily . The treatment period will consist of thirteen, 4 -weekly doses of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered b y SC injection. In addition, up to the first 200 randomized participants will be followed up every other month for up to a further 6 mo nths after the Visit 15 (7 months post last dose) in order to assess maintenance of response and to validate a phy siological model derived from the previous PhII study . 2020N427698_00"
25,page_25,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 26Number of Participant s: Assuming a screen fail rate of 30%, approximately 570 partici pants will need to be screened in order to allow for approximately 400 participants randomized (200 participants per arm). Treatment Groups and Duration: The currently marketed drug product, Nucala (mepolizumab), is supplied as a 100 mg single-dose vial containing a sterile, preservative -free, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and SC injection. A liquid formulation of mepolizumab is under development which will be provided as pre-filled syringes in a safety s yringe device for this study . The liquid f ormulation in a safety syringe device must be administered b y a health care professional in this study. There will also be a matched safet y syringe with placebo. Participants who are successfully enrolled into the study will be randomized into one of two treatment groups, receiving a total of thirteen doses (one every four weeks): • Group 1: 100 mg SC of mepolizumab on top of SoC which includes intranasal MF • Group 2: Placebo SC on top of SoC which includes intranasal MF A participant is considered to ha ve completed study treatment if he/she attends study Visit 15 (Week 52). For up to the first 200 randomized participants, the final study visit will be Week 76 (Visit 18). For the remainder of participants who are not participating in the 6 months no treatment follow up, the final study visit will be Week 52 (Visit 15). The end of the whole study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA for the last participant in the trial globally. 2020N427698_00"

Study Rationale Background on Nasal Polyposis Nasal pol yps (NP) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nasal mucosa, characterized by soft tissue growth in the upper nasal cavit y. The presence of pol yps can cause long term symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) such as prominent nasal obstruction, post-nasal drip, loss of smell, facial pain /pressure and nasal discharge. These s ymptoms can greatly impact a patient’s HR QoL. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and NP [EPOS, 2012] defines the severity of disease using a total severit y visual analog scale (VAS) in which a patient is asked to indicate on a 10 cm VAS how troublesome they consider their s ymptoms. An overall VAS s ymptom score of 0- 3 is defined as mild disease, >3 -7 as moderate and >7- 10 as severe [ Lim, 2007]. Sy mptoms are invariably accompanied with findings of inflammation of the na sal mucosa and the presence of a polyp seen through nasal endoscopy or positive imaging findings, for example using computerized tomography (CT). The etiology of NP is currentl y unknown. Current standard of care for patients with NP is treatment with intr anasal corticosteroids (INCS) followed b y short courses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) in severe cases when short term relief is required [ EPOS, 2012]. Antibiotic courses may also be required for intercurrent sinus infe ction, which often complicates severe NP. Although many patients with NP can be adequately controlled with simple medical care (INCS and OCS, occasional nasal douching and antibiotic courses) [ Alobid, 2012; Newton, 2008], progression to surgery as a result of severe s ymptoms and disruption to quality of life is common. Surgery , when ultimately indicated, involves the removal of the poly p tissue and diseased mucosa, restoring aer ation of the nasal passage and sinuses. Over 250,000 NP surgeries are performed in the US annuall y (Bhattacharyya , 2010). However, pol yps have a strong tendency to recur, often requiring repeat surgery [Levine, 1990; Larsen, 1997; Rucci, 2003; Wynn,2004; Jankowski , 2006, Philpott, 2015] with a timescale that can vary from a few months to y ears. Data suggests patients with NP associated with tissue eosinophilia constitute the majority of those who have a recurrence after surgery [Brescia, 2015]. Repeat (revision) surgery is associated with diminishing success and a higher potential for adverse effects [ Bhattacharyya , 2004; Chu , 1997], hence alternative treatment options are needed for this patient group. IL-5 is the predominant cy tokine in NP associated with tissue eosinophilia, promoting the activation and prolonged survival of eosinophils [ Bachert, 1997; Bachert , 1998]. IL -5 is increased in NP tissue compared with that in healthy controls, and correlates with the degree of tissue eosinophilia, strongl y suggesting a rationale for anti-IL-5 therapy in this condition [ Bachert, 1997]. While the recurrence of bilateral NP despite surgery is common and known to be associated with the IL -5/eosinophilic pathway in adults, this is less so for childre n [Jones, 1999; EPOS, 2012]. The number of eosinophils and cells expressing messenger RNA for IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 is higher in patients with CRS excluding cy stic fibrosis (CF) vers us those with CF and controls [ EPOS, 2012].

The role of mepolizumab in NP Mepolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa, mAb) that blocks human interleukin -5 (hIL-5) from binding to the IL -5 receptor complex expressed on the eosinophil cell surface and thus inhibits signaling. Neutralization of IL -5 with mepolizumab has been shown to reduce blood, sputum and tissue eosinophils and this has led GSK to develop mepolizumab as a treatment option in a number of eosinophilic diseases including NP. NUCALA (mepolizum ab) is currentl y approved in countries such as the United States (US), Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Switzerland and Taiwan as an add - on maintenance treatment (100 mg subcutaneously [SC] once every 4 weeks [Q4W]) for patients with severe a sthma, and with an eosinophilic phenoty pe. NUCALA is currentl y provided as a l yophilized powder in a vial requiring reconstitution with sterile water for injection, however development of a liquid formulation is also underway . As of September 2016, appr oximately 3744 participants have been exposed to at least one dose of mepolizumab in clinical studies across various eosinophilic -mediated indications. In addition, there are currently over 300 participants receiving mepolizumab as part of three long term access and compassionate use programs. All studies have shown that mepolizumab is well tolerated when administered by SC, IV, or intramuscular (IM) routes. The highest dose administered in these studies was 750 mg IV. A total of 74 participants with NP have been treated with mepolizumab 750 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in two Phase II clinical studies (CRT110178 and MPP111782). Both studies provided information to suggest some efficacy and that the overall safety profile of mepolizumab in NP was similar to that observed in the mepolizumab clinical program in severe asthma and there were no known safet y concerns that would preclude developing mepolizumab in NP. Study CRT110178 was a n investigator -led, collaborative research study of randomiz ed, double-blind, placebo -controlled design of mepolizumab versus placebo in participants with severe primary NPs (Grade 3 or 4) or NPs that were recurrent after surgery (Grade 1 to 4). Participants were randomized to receive two single intravenous (IV) i njections (28 days apart) of mepolizumab 750 mg IV (n=20) or placebo (n=10). The study was double blind up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was the difference in total endoscopic NP score which was the sum of left and right nostril scores assessed b y endoscopy at Week 8 versus baseline. Given the grading of each nostril ranged from 0 (no pol yp) to 4 (large polyp causing complete obstruction of the inferior meatus), a total score of up to 8 was possible. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed for the treatment comparison of mepolizumab 750 mg IV versus placebo at Week 8 ( -1.22, 90%CI: -2.28, -0.17; one –sided p=0.0258). These effects were confirmed by changes on CTscans. There were also significant improvements in sy mptoms su ch as loss of smell, postnasal drip, and obstruction at Week 8 with mepolizumab, but not in rhinorrhoea. A significant decrease in blood eosinophil counts (BEC) in the mepolizumab group compared with the placebo group was also observed. 2020N427698_00"
34,page_34,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 35Study MPP111782 w as originall y designed as a two -part (Part A and Part B) randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multi -centre study to investigate the use of mepolizumab 750 mg IV versus placebo in reducing the need for surgery in participants with severe bilateral NP refractory to current SoC. All participants were in need of surgery at the start of the study and had had at least one prior surgery . Participants were considered in need of surgery if they had an overall VAS sy mptom score of >7 and an endoscopic NP score of 3 in at least one nostril. One hundred and five participants were randomized to receive either six 750 mg IV injections of mepolizumab (54 participants) or placebo (51 participants), one injection every four weeks for up to a total of 6 doses in Part A. Participants who no longer required surgery at the end of Part A were given the chance to enter Part B where they were followed up for a further 6 months with no treatment. The primary endpoint was a reduction in the need for surgery at the end o f Part A (4weeks post last dose, Week 25). This was taken as a combination of reduced severity of the NP condition as defined by an improvement in overall VAS sy mptom score (a score of 7 or below) with at least a reduction in endoscopic NP score to less than 3 or if the overall VAS s ymptom score is still greater than 7 then an endoscopic NP score to 1 or less for the nostril which has the highest score at baseline. Investigators agreed that these thresholds would clearl y indicate that a participant had dr opped below the threshold at which surgery would normally be indicated. By these criteria, a significantly greater proportion of participants in the mepolizumab group no longer required surgery at the end of Part A (p=0.003). A difference in the mean cha nge from baseline in total endoscopic NP score between mepolizumab and placebo at Week 25 of -1.21 was demonstrated (95% CI: -1.92 to -0.50; p=0.001; ITT Population, L OCF). The overall patient -reported VAS sy mptom scores also supported the efficacy of mepolizumab, with a treatment difference from placebo at Week 25 of -1.78 (95% CI : - 2.88, -0.68; p=0.002, PP Population). For individual VAS sy mptom scores including rhinorrhoea, mucus in the throat, nasal obstruction and loss of smell, the treatment differ ences were statisticall y significant in favor of mepolizumab compared with placebo at Week 25 (p 0.002), and treatment differences could be observed as earl y as Week 9. Participants in the mepolizumab group had a greater clinical and statistical improvem ent in the SNOT- 22 questionnaire, a measure of HR QoL associated with CRS and NP, at Week 25, compared with participants who received placebo. There were 14 participants in the mepolizumab group and 7 participants in the placebo group that entered Part B before this part of the study was discontinued. Data from these participants suggest the beneficial effects of mepolizumab treatment on NP score and symptoms may persist after cessation of treatment. Taken together, the integrated evidence supports the p roposition that mepolizumab may be effective in improving symptoms, reducing NP size and reducing the need for surgery in patients with recurrent disease despite current optimal medical management. 2020N427698_00"

In addition, there are currently over 300 participants receiving mepolizumab as part of three long term access and compassionate use programs. All studies have shown that mepolizumab is well tolerated when administered by SC, IV, or intramuscular (IM) routes. The highest dose administered in these studies was 750 mg IV. Mepolizumab is currently appro ved for severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenoty pe at a dose of 100 mg SC every 4 weeks. In this population, over 1200 participants with severe asthma that have received at least one dose of mepolizumab, of which approximately 1000 have received mepoliz umab at 100 mg SC, either as part of a randomized placebo-controlled study or in open -label extensions studies. The total treatment exposure for the approximate 1000 participants who received mepolizumab 100 mg SC was equivalent to over 1000 participant years. In addition, over 914 participants have been treated with mepolizumab 100 mg SC up to 12 months and over 340 participants for approximately 3.5years. In studies of patients with severe asthma, 177 participants had concomitant diagnosis of NP and received mepolizumab with 143 participants receiving mepolizumab for ≥1 year. Given patients with severe asthma in general have higher morbidity and mortality than those with severe NP, the substantial long-termsafety information already collected in severe asthma could be considered relevant and informative for patients with NP. A total of 74 participants with NP have been treated with mepolizumab 750 mg IV every 4 weeks for up to 6 months in two Phase II clinical studies (CRT110178 and MPP111782). Both studies provided information to suggest that the overall safet y profile of mepolizumab in NP was similar to that observed in the mepolizumab clinical program in severe asthma and there were no known safet y concerns that would preclude developing mepoliz umab in NP. Of note, the dose of 750 mg IV every 4 weeks used in the two Phase II studies was significantly higher than the 100 mg SC every 4 weeks that is proposed for the two Phase III studies. 3.2.2. Benefit A ssessment In addition to asthma and NP, Mepolizu mab has demonstrated clinical benefit in other conditions where eosinophilia is considered to play an important part in the pathology , e.g., HES [ Rothenberg , 2008] and EGPA [ Kim, 2010; Moosig, 2011]. In the proposed stud y, benefit considerations for a participant may include: Potential to receive active drug during stud y conduct that may have clinical utility Contributing to the process of developing new therapies in an area of unmet need Medical evaluations/assessments associated with study procedures 2020N427698_00"
40,page_40,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 413.2.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Current data from mepolizumab preclinical and clinical development indicate the ability of mepolizumab to inhibit IL- 5 leading to consistent reduction in blo od eosinophils, with demonstration of clinical benefit in the treatment of conditions associated with eosinophilic inflammation. Data from Phase II studies in NP have shown efficacy in both NP score and s ymptoms as well as impact on the need for surgery . In addition, data from the Phase III asthma programme with mepolizumab demonstrate, compared to placebo, a reduction in asthma exacerbations, improvements in asthma control and quality of life (as measured b y the ACQ -5 and SGRQ, respectively ), improvements in lung function and a reduction in OCS use in those participants on chronic OCS treatment. The higher morbidity and mortality in severe asthma compared with NP and the substantial long -termsafety information already collected in severe asthma, suggest that to date, the safety profile of mepolizumab has been favourable and the benefit/risk profile supports ongoing development in patients with bilateral severe NP. The change in drug product presentation from a ly ophilised drug product to a liquid drug product in a safety syringe is not anticipated to alter the overall benefit: risk. Treatment will be administered b y a trained health care professional at the clinic and participants will be closely observed for at least 1 hr following administration of I P for the first 3 doses then per institutional guidelines. 4.

Overall Design This is a randomized , double-blind, parallel group PhIII study to assess the clinical efficacy and safet y of 100 mg SC Mepolizumab as an add on to maintenance treatment in adults with severe bilateral NP. The objective is to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of mepolizumab 100 mg, administered SC by the Investigator or delegate via a pre-filled safet y syringe every 4 weeks of a 52week treatment period. Efficacy of mepolizumab will be assessed using a co -primary endpointsof change from baseline in endoscopic NP score (0 -8) and nasal obstruction VAS symptom score during the 4 weeks prior to Week 52. Measurement of the co- primary endpoints will also be assessed at all other time points through the study . The key secondary endpoint is time to first actual surgery for NP by Week 52. Other secondary endpoints are the proportion of participants requiring s ystemic steroids for nasal poly ps, change from baseline in overall VAS sy mptom score, composite VAS score (combining VAS scores for nas al obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) and loss of smell VAS score, QoL (SNOT -22) at Week 52, with other time points being captured as “other” endpoints. For those participants who have a concomitant diagnosis of asthma, the level of asthma control as assessed b y Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ- 5) and the number of clinically significant asthma exacerbation will also be measured as “other” endpoint. The population will consist of adult participants ( 18 years of age) wit h recurrent severe bilateral NP ( defined as an average obstruction VAS sy mptom score of >5 and an endoscopic NP score of at least 5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with a minimum score of 2 in each nasal cavit y).

Participants must be in current need for NP surgery as defined b y an overall VAS sy mptom score greater than 7 in addition to a NP score 3 in at least one nostril. Forthe purpose of inclusion into this study , NP surgery is defined as an y procedure involving instruments with resulting incision (cutting open) and removal of the poly p tissue from the nasal cavity (polypectomy). An y procedure involving instrumentation in the nasal cavit y resulting in dilatation of the nasal passage such as balloon sinuplasty , insertion of coated stents or direct injection of steroids or other medication without any removal of NP tissue does not fulfil this criterion. This is because there is no significant reduction in overall eosinophilic load in the nasal cavity. Consequently ,it is difficult to discern whether an y recurrence of NP disease after such procedures is actually driven by eosinophilia or not. Any nasal surgical procedures can influence the co -primary endpoints, as can dilatation of the air passages (eg balloon sinuplasty ) in the nasal cavit y, therefore the impact of occurrence of either surgery or sinuplast y will be taken into consideration when assessing efficacy endpoints. As stated above, actual surgery is an important secondary efficacy endpoint.Evaluation of this key secondary endpoint will be based only on invasive procedures involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of tissue (eg polypectomy). Diagnosti c or investigative procedures such as nasal endoscopy would not be considered as surgery . To ensure that this study can detect a difference in surgical outcome between the two treatment arms, participants, whom in the opinion of the investigator are contr aindicated for NP surgery , will be excluded. Figure 1Study Schematic The study will include a 4 -week run in period followed by randomization to a 52 -week treatment period. Throughout the entire study period (run in + treatment period + follow up), participants will be on the SoC for NP which consists of daily MF, saline nasal douching as required and, if required, occasional short courses of high dose OCS and/or antibiotics. Patients who have NP surgery during the study are allowed to continue on study treatment till completion of the 52-week treatment period. This is to reflect the real 2020N427698_00"
45,page_45,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 46life circumstances in which mepolizumab is intended to be used as a concomitant therapy on top of SoC. During the run- in period, participants will complete baseline safet y evaluations, measures of NP status and be educated in the completion of participant eDiary. At the start of run in and throughout the study , participants will be placed on MF at the maximum prescribed dose (if not alread y) according to local label, if available, or in line with local SoC. The treatment period will consist of thirteen, 4 -weekly doses of mepolizumab or placebo, delivered b y SC injection on top of SoC. The previous phase II study suggests persistence of benefic ial effects after cessation of mepolizumab treatment. A physiological model linking mepolizumab binding to IL -5, IL-5 to blood eosinophil count, and blood eosinophil count to endoscopic NP score was used to describe the wash - out phase of the previous Phase II studies. This model was then used to predict the current proposed dose of 100 mg SC of mepolizumab. To validate this physiological model, the first 200 randomized participants will be followed up every other month for up to a further 6 months after the Week 52 visit (7 months post last dose). This number of participants is also thought to be sufficient to inform on the maintenance of response after cessation of treatment. 5.2. Number of Participants This study will investigate NP participants most like ly to benefit from mepolizumab treatment. GSK believes that a patient population with severe NP (as defined by an obstruction VAS assessment of symptoms >5 with recurrent bilateral NP, despite current SoC) is most likely to be associated with nasal tissue eosinophilia and therefore has the potential to benefit from treatment with anti- IL5 monoclonal antibody treatment. Assuming a screen fail rate of 30%, approximately 570 participants will need to be screened in order to allow for 400 participants randomiz ed(200 participants per arm). 5.3. Participant and Study Completion Final treatment visit: For all participants this will be Week 52 (Visit 15), 4 weeks after the last expected injection at Visit 14. Final study visit: for up to the first 200 randomized participants this will be Week 76 (Visit 18) and for the remainder will be Week 52 (Visit 15). The end of the whole study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or last scheduled procedure shown in the SoA for the last part icipant in the trial globally. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design GSK propose to assess the efficacy of mepolizumab by objectively measuring its ability to reduce the NP size and the effects of this reduction in improving the ty pical symptoms associated with NP. This study will use centrally read total endoscopic NP score by assessing the change from baseline at Week 52 as well as the patient assessed nasal obstruction VAS sy mptom score as the co primary outcome measures. In addition ,the key secondary endpoint of actual surgery will be assessed at 52 weeks as surgery is also of great importance to patients and phy sicians. 2020N427698_00"
46,page_46,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 47This study will recruit patients who have severe NP that are refractory to SoC medical treatment. In most cases these patients are at the stage of needing surgical intervention [EPOS, 2012]. By deactivating and reducing the survival time of eosinophils in NP through IL -5 inhibition, mepolizumab can potentially reduce inflammation of the mucosa, and restore aeration of the nasal passage and sinuses through pol yp volume reduction. Therefore ,assessment of NP size based on endoscopic NP score as a measure of efficacy is objective and reasonable when supported with data from a s ymptomatic endpoint such as nasal obstruction VAS score. The proposal is to have the co primaries of endoscopic score and nasal obstruction VAS score so as to capture both objective assessment of obstruction and sy mptoms. Other NP sy mptoms consisting of nasal discharge, mucus i n the throat, loss of smell, facial pain and overall VAS sy mptom score will be assessed throughout the duration of this Phase III study , including follow up. The severe s ymptoms of NP can result in significant disruption to quality of life and productivit y of patients. This Phase III stud y will utilize SNOT -22 and SF-36 questionnaires as measures of QoL. The WPAI questionnaire is also included to assess the impact of treatment on absenteeism, presenteeism, productivity loss, and activity impairment of par ticipants in this study . Participants are treated with mepolizumab for 13 doses at 28 day intervals. Therefore, assessment of the primary endpoint will be conducted 52 weeks after initiation of therapy. Two Phase II studies conducted with mepolizumab in severe NP suggest that although treatment with up to 6, 4- weekly doses, are sufficient to demonstrate efficacy of mepolizumab compared to placebo, the maximal effect may not have been achieved. Extending the exploration to thirteen 4 weekl y doses will therefore increase the knowledge on the time to potential maximal effect. In Study CRT110178 significant clinical improvement in NP score was observed after two doses of mepolizumab. The second study , MPP111782, also demonstrated a reduction in the need f or surgery , as assessed b y a pre-defined composite endpoint based on endoscopic NP score and overall VAS symptom score after 6 doses. A reduction in the number of participants undergoing surgery was also observed. Surgery is an important endpoint for patients and phy sicians as well as pay ors as it shows a direct cost burden. Given there is a potential for delay between the decision to have surgery and the actual surgical event, this study will also measure time to admission to a waiting list for NP surgery, a potential surrogate for actual surgery . Short courses of OCS are part of SoC for severe NP and are known to provide significant improvements in sy mptoms and reduction in NP size. However ,this form of treatment strategy is limited by the short-livedbeneficial effects and the significant sy stemic adverse events, which prevent prolonged and/or frequent use. If mepolizumab is 2020N427698_00"
47,page_47,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 48effective, it has the potential to reduce the overall exposure of patients to systemic steroid therapy, and this will be measur ed in the study . The target population for mepolizumab in NP is patients who are refractory to current SoC and highly symptomatic as a consequence. Mepolizumab is intended to be administered chronically on a background of INCS, and other medical therap y usually given as short courses as required (OCS, occasional nasal douching, antibiotic courses) before surgery is considered. There is currentl y no other chronic treatment that can be added to INCS that can be considered appropriate for an active contro l in this population. As such, placebo added to SoC will be utilizedas the appropriate control. Mometasone furoate (MF) is the onl y INCS currently approved for the treatment for NP both in Europe and US and will be part of the SoC in this study . All parti cipants will be provided and are required to take MF at the maximum prescribable dose according to local label, if available, or as per local SoC. Thi s is usually 400 micrograms (μg ) which equals 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice daily .For participants that are intolerant to this dose, the lower dose of 200 g can be used (2 actuations (50 g /actuation) in each nostril once dail y). All participants randomized to IP will have their co- primary endpoint and NP surgical status tracked for t he duration of the study . Participants may choose to discontinue use of IP at any time but full accountability of IP at the end of the study is required for all participants. To provide information on the durability and maintenance of mepolizumab effectafter cessation of treatment, up to the first 200 participants randomizedwill be followed for a further 6 months without treatment with I P. 5.5. Dose Justification To date the clinical pharmacology of mepolizumab, an IgG1 mAb, is wholly consistent with other m Abs targeting soluble ligands: the pharmacokinetics are linear, dose - proportional, and time-independent after both IV and SC administration. Of note, a population PK meta -analysis across studies and indications has not identified any covariates of particu lar clinical interest, mitigating the need for further investigations and dose adjustment in special populations. Mepolizumab’s potential for drug -drug interaction is deemed low in light of its elimination pathway s and because IL -5 does not signal via hep atocytes. Based on these clinical pharmacology findings and the results of study MPP111782, the clinical pharmacology of mepolizumab administered to participants with NP is considered similar to those with severe asthma. The proposed dose of 100 mg SC in NP in this study is supported b y data from several studies: Clinical efficacy of mepolizumab in participants with NP has only been investigated at a supra -pharmacological dose of 750 mg IV Q4W to date, although participants were followed for six months of washout. Two studies in participants with severe asthma MEA112997 and MEA114092 provided evidence of a dose response to suppression of blood eosinophil count. 2020N427698_00"
48,page_48,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 49In study MEA112997, the lowest dose of 75 mg IV (equivalent to the proposed 100mg SC dose) gave 78% inhibition. Higher doses of 250 mg IV and 750 mg IV provided only modest increases in suppression (86% and 88%, respectively ) indicating that the lowest dose provides approximately 90% of maximal pharmacological response attributable to drug. A subsequent clinical pharmacology study MEA114092 confirmed equivalence of the SC route of administration and identified the half- maximal pharmacological dose of 11 mg SC, consistent with study MEA112997. The approved severe asthma dosing regimen of 100 mg SC dose Q4W provides 55% overlap with 750 mg IV data when given 4 -weekly. Since initiation of the NP Phase II program, a meta- analysis of mepolizumab blood eosinophil exposure and dose response across all indications has been conducted to investigate the role dis ease plays in mepolizumab response. When examined, the distribution of baseline eosinophil count (BEC) in participants enrolled in the Phase II NP studies was broadl y similar to that seen in the severe asthma program after adjustment for inhaled and oral corticosteroid usage, and hence the exposure and dose responses for other diseases are predictive of NP. This finding was confirmed using BEC data from the Phase II NP study MPP111782. These data were predicted independentl y using a physiological exposur e-response model of mepolizumab binding to IL -5, coupled to IL -5 action on BEC. After validation, the model was used to simulate alternative dosing regimens of interest in patients with NP, and then estimate the degree of pharmacological overlap 100 mg an d 300 mg SC doses have with the tested 750 mg IV Q4W regimen for a range of dosing frequencies. Results show considerable overlap between monthly doses of 100 mg and 300 mg SC and the tested 750 mg IV Q4W. In addition, the Phase II studies assessing mepo lizumab safet y and efficacy in NP CRT110178 and MPP111782 both followed participants for periods bey ond treatment with mepolizumab 750 mg IV. During the six -month period following mepolizumab treatment, there was evidence of sustained treatment effect. The BEC suppression continues to correlate with a reduced clinical score until NP participants show evidence of blood eosinophil return to baseline after approximately three months (three mepolizumab half -lives). Although numbers are small in both studies, these consistent observations provide a qualitative guide to the degree of blood eosinophil suppression necessary for sustained chronic dosing. Simulations of blood eosinophil count for the two studies suggest that 100 mg Q4W will provide consistent bloo d eosinophil suppression to levels that were seen during the period of washout where efficacy was sustained. Given the considerable human safet y data in severe asthma, it would therefore seem reasonable to assess this dose for potential efficacy in the tar get population of patients with NP. Considering the observed IV similarity of clinical pharmacology between patients with severe asthma and NP, overlapping pharmacological response predicted from a model validated in participants with NP, and experiential safety data for the range of doses of mepolizumab in participants from a host of diseases, the assessment of 100 mg SC to provide safet y and efficacy information in this study is warranted. 2020N427698_00"

TREATMENTS Study treatment is defined as any investigational treatment( s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device(s) intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. The currently marketed drug product, Nucala (mepolizumab), is supplied as a 100 mg single-dose vial containing a ster ile, preservative -free, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and subcutaneous injection. A liquid formulation of mepolizumab is under development which will be provided as pre-filled syringes in a safety s yringe device for this study . The liquid formul ation has a distinct advantage over the ly ophilized product as it does not require reconstitution, and the devices (upon commercial registration) will simplify and facilitate administration. The liquid formulation in a safet y syringe device must be administered by a health care professional in this study. There will also be a matched safet y syringe with placebo. Both active and placebo drug products are stored at 2 -8°C condition, protected from light. The study treatment consists of up to 18 visits with a maximal total treatment duration of the study of approximately 52 weeks and maximum study duration of approximately 82 weeks. Screened participants will enter a 4 week run in period, followed b y up to 52 week treatment period. Up to the first 200 randomizedparticipants will be further followed up for a drug free period of up to 28 weeks with no injections. Participants who are successfully enrolled into the study will be randomized into one of two treatment groups, receiving a total of thirteen doses (on e every four weeks): Group 1: 100 mg SC of mepolizumab on top of SoC which includes intranasal mometasone furorate (MF) Group 2: Placebo SC on top of SoC which includes intranasal MF All participants will be provided and are required to take MF at the max imum prescribable dose according to local label, if available, or as per local SoC. This is usually 400 micrograms (μg), 2 actuations (50 μg/actuation) in each nostril twice dail y. For participants that are intolerant to this dose, the lower dose of 200 g can be used (2 actuations (50 g /actuation) i n each nostril once daily ). Study treatment completion is taken as Visit 15 which is Week 52 of the study for each individual participant. 2020N427698_00"

Once a randomization number has been assigned to a participant , it cannot be reassigned to any other participant in the study. Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in SoA Returned study treatment should not be re -dispensed to the participants. 7.3. Blinding The site staff and central study team will be blinded to eac h participant’s eosinophil count (including white blood count differential). RAMOS NG will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. The blind may be broken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the participant’s best interest for the investigator to know the study treatment assignment. GSKmust be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect t he immediate management of the participant’s condition (eg, antidote is available). In this case, GSK must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind.

STUDY WITHDRAWA L ANDIP DISCONTINUA TION CRITERIA At the point of informed consent prior to screening, participants will be requested to provide permission and agree to be contacted even after stud y withdrawal/ IP discontinuation to collect information relating to any surgical intervention to the NP. Every effort will be made to have all participants attend study visitseven if they discontinue study treatment in order to capture NP size scores, sy mptom score, any subsequent entry into a surgical wait ing list for NP surgery and actual surgical procedures. The following actions must be taken in relation to a participant who fails to attend the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and re- schedule the misse d visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . In cases where the participant is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary ,a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailing address or local equival ent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”. 8.1. Withdrawal from Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or if they are lost to follow -up. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to us e any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study withdrawal and follow - up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 2020N427698_00"

Early Withdrawal Visit The definition of an earl y participant withdrawal from the study will be an y participant who is randomized to blinded medication and, for any reason, is withdrawn prior to completion of the Visit 15 procedures. A participant may voluntarily discontinue participation in the study at any time. Participants that withdraw from the study should return to the clinic return to the clinic 28 days after the last dose for an Earl y Withdrawal Visit. I f possible, at the Early Withdrawal Visit, the following evaluations and procedures should be completed and recorded in the eCRF as required: Concomitant medication assessment Adverse event assessment 12 –lead ECG Physical examination (recorded in source documents only ) Collect/review electronic diary Urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential Assessment of endoscopic nasal pol ypscore Assessment of surgery Assessment of OCS use Assessment of INCS use Assessments of sy mptoms Assessment of QoL WPAI PK 2020N427698_00"

Premature Discontinuation of Study Treatment (investigational product -IP) 8.2.1. Discontinuation Criteria for IP A participant may discontinue from study treatment at any time at his/her own request, or at the discretion of the investigator. Participants who discontinue from study treatment prematurel y (for any reason) should, where possible, continue to be followed- up as per protocol until the completion of the follow-up Visit assessments. The participant’s NP surgical status will be tracked for the dura tion of the study . Participants may choose to discontinue use of IP at any time but full accountability of IP at the end of the study is required for all participants. All participants will be followed up for the stud y duration. However, given that actual NP surgery can distort the anatomical architecture of the nasal cavity nullifying the NP size score and VAS, participants who have had NP surgery prior to Week 52 will be considered as treatment failures in the anal ysis of the primary endpoints. Unlike the Phase II stud y, participants in the Phase III program will be allowed short courses of s ystemic OCS to control their NP sy mptoms during the study and as a consequence will help to minimize the overall withdrawal rates. 8.2.2. Study Specific IP Discontinuati on Criteria A participant must have IP discontinued if any of the following criteria are met: Pregnancy: Positive pregnancy test Liver Chemistry: Meets any of the protocol- defined liver chemistry stopping criteria. ECG:If a participant’s QTc interval extends beyond 500msec or uncorrected QT interval is > 600 msec or QTc is increased more than 60msec compared to baseline on two or more ECG tracings separated b y at least 5 minutes NB: Courses of OCS or Surgery are not a reason for Study withdrawal or IP discontinuation. 8.2.3.

67,page_67,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 688.2.3.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB, then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc > 500 msec OR Uncorrected QT > 600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec For participants with underly ing bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block < 450 msec > 500 msec 450 –480 msec ≥ 530 msec See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow - up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 9.

The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 9.1. Critical pre-Screening , Screening and Baseline Assessments 9.1.1. Pre screening Participants can perform the pre -screening Visit (Visit 0) up to 2 weeks prior (unless specificall y authorised by the medical monitor) to or on the same day as the Screening Visit (Visit 1). A participant number will be assigned at the time the ICF is signed. During the Pre -screening Visit, study designated personnel must provide informed consent to study participants. Once the informed consent document has been signed, pre -screening assessments can be conducted. The following demographic parameters will be captured: year of birth, sex, race and ethnicit y. From the pre -screening visit onwards concomitant medications, exacerbations and SAEs (considered as related to study participation) must be reported . 9.1.2. Screening At the screening visit NP and asthma therap y, NP surgery history, asthma and exacerbation history and concomitant medications will be assessed. Endoscopic NP score as well as VAS score for nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat, loss of smell, facial pain and overall VAS sy mptom score will be captured. 9.1.3.

Efficacy Assessments 9.2.1. Endoscopic NP score Endoscopic NP score will be performed at stud y visits as described in the SoA. This score is graded based on NP siz e Appendix 12 (recorded as the sum of the right and left nostril scores with a range of 0- 8; higher scores indicate worse status). Image recordings of endoscopies will be sent to an independent reviewer for centralized blinded data assessment. Endoscopic NP score will be performed at the site by trained heath care staff (usually ENT surgeon). The images of the assessment will be sent to central labs where there will be central scoring of the NP. The output from the central labs is considered final for the purpose of this study . Nasal endoscop y assessment can be carried out within a 3 day window prior to dosing for each stud y visit (apart from visit 2) but must not exceed the protocol defined windows of 7 days from the nominal st udy visit. 2020N427698_00"
72,page_72,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 739.2.2. Individual Symptoms Visual A nalogue Scale (VA S) All scales to be used in the study will be on the eDiary and will be collected daily in the morning from screening to the end of the stud y period. Every day, the participant will be asked to indic ate on a VAS the severit y of 5 nasal polyposis symptoms (one VAS for each s ymptom) and sy mptoms overall: Please rate your “___________ ”at its worst over the previous 24 hours 1. nasal obstruction; 2. nasal discharge; 3. mucus in the throat; 4. loss of sme ll; 5. facial pain; 6. overall VAS s ymptoms score . Participants will be instructed on how to use the scale prior to usi ng the scale. VAS is an instrument that measures a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. In this study patient reported s ymptom VAS will be collected using an eDiary. Given that there is no direct relationship between pixel size and mm, on electronic s ystems the key is that the line must (just like the paper version), have 101 individually selectable points. There are a number of publications which shows the applicability of VAS electronically and its comparability to traditional paper [ Hollen, 2013, Reips, 2008, Cook, 2004, Jamison, 2002]. In summary , the length of the VAS doesn’t matter, and participant’s responses are not altered by implementing the VAS electronically . For the purpose of this protocol a VAS score of 7 in the overall sy mptom score and 5 in NP obstruction sy mptoms score are equivalent to 70 units and 50 units in the electronic VAS as measured using the eDiary . 9.2.3. NP surgery At each visit it will be recorded whether the participant is on a waiti ng list for NP surgery and whether the participant has received actual documented surgery and/or sinuplasty . As an endpoint, for the purpose of this study , NP surgery is defined as an y procedure involving instruments resulting in incision and removal of ti ssue (poly pectomy) in the nasal cavit y. 9.2.4. Medication The number of courses of sy stemic steroids and OCS as well as the dose and duration of the courses will be recorded in the CRF. The dose for a course of OCS will be according to the participants SoC for O CS use for its NP condition. The dose and duration of the OCS taken will be recorded in the eCRF.

The methodology toconvert various doses of intravenous and oral steroids to prednisolone -equivalent OCS will be provided in the SPM. 9.2.5. Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PnIF) A PnIF Meter will be used to derive forced inspiratory peak flow through the nose during the study according to the SoA (Section 2).Please refer to the Study Procedures Manual for further details. PnIF will be measured using an IN -CHECK flow meter. After blowing their nose, participants inspired forcefully from the residual vol ume to total lung capacity with their mouth closed. All measurements were made in the sitting position and a good seal around the face mask was ensured. The highest value of three consecutive (maximal) readings was recorded. 9.2.6. Olfaction testing: University o f Pennsy lvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) UPSIT will be used at the time points indicated in the SoA (Section 2) to assess each participant ’s sense of smell. UPSIT test will be performed only in selected countries. UPSIT is a test that is commercially available for smell identification to test the function of an individual's olfactory system. It is the gold standard of smell identification tests for its reliability and practicality (Doty, 1989). This test is a measurement of the individual's ability to detect odours at a suprathreshold level. The test is usually administered in a waiting room and takes onl y a few minutes. The test consists of 4 different 10 page booklets, with a total of 40 questions ( Doty, 2007). On each page, there is a different ""scratch and sniff"" strip which are embedded with a microencapsulated odorant. There is also a four choice multiple choice question on each page. The sce nts are released using a pencil. After each scent is released, the patient smells the level and detects the odour from the four choices. There is an answer column on the back of the test booklet, and the test is scored out of 40 items. The score is compared to scores in a normative database from 4000 normal individuals, this tells the level of absolute smell function. The score also indicates how the patient does in accordance to their age group and gender. Please refer to the SPM for further details. 9.2.7. Health Related Quality of Life (HR QoL) assessments 9.2.7.1. Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-22) questionnaire SNOT-22 will be completed by the participant monthly at study visits according to the SoA (Section 2)under the supe rvision of the health care professional. The SNOT- 22 will be completed electronically at study visits. Patients are to be provided with a quiet location, free from distraction and instructed that to select the single response option fro each question that most closely reflects their health. 2020N427698_00"
74,page_74,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 75Participants will be asked to rate the severity of their condition on each of the 22 items over the previous 2 weeks using a [Hopkins, 2009]. The SNOT-22 has been shown to be a reliable outcome measure for successful septal surgery [Buckland, 2003]. I t is also recommended as a very suitablequestionnaire in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) management [ Morley, 2006] and its routine use is recommended as a tool to evaluate outcomes in nasal poly posis [Browne, 2006]. 9.2.8. Assessments for asthmatic participants only 9.2.8.1. Asthma Control Questionnaire (A CQ-5) ACQ-5 will be assessed at clinic visits under the supervision of the health care professional, during the study according to the SoA (Section 2). The ACQ -5 is a five - item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of patients’ asthma control that can be quickl y and easily completed ( Juniper, 1999) [Juniper, 2005]. The questions are designed to be self -completed by the participant. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severit y of symptoms over the previous week scale. Please refer to the SPM for further details. 9.3. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . The following adverse events of special interest will have a customized AE and SAE pages in the eCRF: Local injection site reactions Systemic reactions In addition, the information whether an event met the diagnostic criteria for anaph ylaxis as outlined by the Second Sy mposium on Anaphylaxis [ Sampson, 2006] and in Appendix 11will be collected on the AE and SAE CRF pages. The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to di scontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.3.1.

The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the stud y treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.3.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non serious AEs of special interest will be followed until the event is resolved, st abilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local r egulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwar ded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will 2020N427698_00"

Cardiovascular and Death Events For any cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in respons e to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms.The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.3.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SA Es The following disea se related events (DREs) are common in participants with Nasal Polyposis and can be serious/life threatening: Nasal pol yp surgery including sinuplasty Because these events are ty pically associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported acc ording to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of a SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page in the participant’s CRF within 2 months. These DREs will be monitored by a SCT on a routine basis. NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions apply, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than ex pected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product 9.3.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collect ed after the start of study treatment and until 4 months post last dose. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 2020N427698_00"

In order to fulfil regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the stud y with such devices (a s defined in Section 7.1.1). The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be found in Appendix 8 . NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Appendix 4 of the protocol. 9.3.8.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported du ring all periods of the study in which the GSK medical devices are available for use. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a GSKmedical device provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptly notify the sponsor. The method of documenting Medical Device Incidents is provided in Appendix 8 . 9.3.8.2. Follow-up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE, will be followed until resolution of the event, until the condition stabilizes, until the condition is otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 5.5). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as practical the nature and/or causalit y of the incident. New or updated information wil l be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. 9.3.8.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours once the investigator det ermines that the event meets the protocol definition of a medical device incident. Facsimile transmission of the ""Medical Device Incident Report Form"" is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Medical Monitor. In the absence of facsimil e equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable for incidents, with a cop y of the ""Medical Device Incident Report Form"" sent by overnight mail . The same individual will be the contact for the receipt of medical device reports and SAE. 2020N427698_00"

Treatment of Overdose The dose of mepolizumab considered to be an overdose has not been defined. There are no known antidotes and GSK does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. The investigator will use clinical judgment in treating the sy mptoms of a suspected overdose. 9.4. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations Acomplete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the Cardiovascular, Respiratory , Gastrointestinal and Neurological s ystems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded at Visit 1. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs As detailed in the SoA vital signs will be measured in semi- supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. Vital signs assess ments will be taken before measurement of any ECGs at the specified time point. 2020N427698_00"
79,page_79,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 809.4.3. Electrocardiograms A single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at each timepoint specified in the SoA using an ECG machine to assess heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc inte rvals. (for further details refer to SPM). If a routine single ECG after randomisation demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain two more ECGs over a brief period, and then use the averaged QTc values of the three ECGs to determine whether the patie nt should be discontinued from the study. ECG measurements will be made after the participant has rested in the supine position for 5 minutes. The ECG should be obtained after the vital signs assessments and followed b y other study procedures as described in the SPM . 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the tim ing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values consid ered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 28 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defin ed in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s l ocal laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples for anal ysis of mepolizumab plasma concentration will be obtained as per the SoA. Samples obtained at Visits 2, 3, and 15 should be drawn prior to dosing. Participants going into no treatment follow up will have additional sample at Visit 17. The date and exact time of collection for each sample will be documented in the eCRF. 2020N427698_00"

Pharmacody namics Blood eosinophil counts will be recorded as part of the standard haematological assessments performed at the visits specified in the SoA. From Visit 2 onwards, blood eosinophil counts will not be communicated to investigators, in order to maintain the blind. 9.7. Genetics Up to 6 mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from CRF participants who have consent ed to participate in the genetics anal ysis component of the study. Participation is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement gene tic blood sample may be requested from the participant. Signed informed consent will be required to obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original consent. See Appendix 6for Information regarding g enetic research. Details on processes for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in SPM. 9.8. Exploratory Biomarkers Blood samples will be collected during this study and may be used for the purposes of measuring novel biomarkers to identify factors that may influence severe NP, and/or medically related conditions, as well as the biological and clinical responses to mepolizumab. I f relevant, this approach will be extended to include the identification of biomarkers associated with adverse events. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in SoA. 9.9. Immunogenicity Assessments Blood samples will be collected for the determination of anti- mepolizumab antibodies, prior to dosing, as detailed in the SoA. Details for sample collection and processing may be found in the SPM. 9.10. Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are evaluated in this study by means of the Short Form -36 (SF-36) and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) questionnaires. 9.10.1. Short Form- 36 (SF-36) questionnaire SF-36 will be performed monthly by the participant at study visits (Section 2) under the supervision of the health care professional. 2020N427698_00"
81,page_81,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 82SF-36 is one of the most widely used generic questionnaires. I t consists of 36 self - administered questions that cover eight health domains: phy sical functioning (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), and general heal th (GH), vitality (VT), role emotional (RE), social functioning (SF), and mental health (MH) with a recall of 4 weeks. Scale In addition, the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Co mponent Score (MCS) scores can be derived following the original authors’ recommendations [ Ware, 1994]. Radenne et al. [Radenne, 1999] reported the unique study that has investiga ted the impact of NP demonstrating that NP impair QoL in all SF-36 domains. Using the SF -36 and compared with a health y population, other studies has also demonstrated that chronic rhinosinusitis has a considerable impact on all SF- 36 domains except for ph ysical functioning [ Gliklich, 1997; Winstead , 1998; Durr , 1999; Wang , 2003]. Participants with NP ha d lower scores in all SF- 36 domains except for phy sical functioning and general health than participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Alonso, 1998], coronary artery disease [Failde, 2000], and asthma [ Espinosa, 2002]. Alobid, 2005 showed that a significant improvement was observed in all domains of SF- 36 after medical and surgical treatm ent. Both mental and ph ysical health reached population levels. Combined steroid treatment and ESS had similar long -term outcomes on QoL. Radenne et al. [Radenne, 1999] showed that steroids and ESS improved the symptoms and the QoL in patients with NP especially in body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health domains with no significant differences between both treatment regimes. 9.10.2. Work Productivity and A ctivity Impairment Questionnaire (WP AI) WPAI will be assessed by the participant at study visits described in the SoA (Section 2) under the supervision of the health care professional. The WPAI questionnaire is an instrument to measure impairments in both paid work and unpaid work [ Reilly, 1993; Reilly Associates ]. It measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health problem during the past seven day s. It has been validated to quantify work impairments for numerous diseases such as asthma, psoriasis, irritable bowel s yndrome (IBS), ank ylosing spondy litis and Crohn's disease [ Reilly Associates ; Reilly, 2004; Reilly , 2010; Reilly , 2008]. In addition, the WPAI questionnaire has been used to compare work impairmen ts between treatment groups in clinical studies and trials or between participants with different disease severit y levels [Reilly, 2004; Reilly , 2010; Reilly , 2008; Revicki , 2007; Pearce , 2006; Chen, 2008). The WPAI -GH consists of six questions: [Reilly, 1993; Reilly Associates ]. The recall period for the questions 2 to 6 is seven day s. Four main outcomes can be generated from the WPAI : 1) percent work time missed due to health for those 2020N427698_00 CCI CCI CCI - This section contained Clinical Outcome Assessment data collection questionnaires or indices, which are protected by third party copyright laws and therefore have been excluded.

For those who missed work and did not actually work in the past seve n days, the percent overall work impairment due to health will be equal to the percent work time missed due to health. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The study is designed to test the superiority of mepolizumab 100mg SC vs. placebo. Significance tests will be performed at the two -sided 5% alpha level (one -sided 2.5%). 10.1. Sample Size Determination The sample size is based on the co- primary efficacy endpoints of total endoscopic nasal polyp score and nasal obstruction VAS score at Week 52 and the key secondary endpoint of time to actual surgery . A trial of 200 participants per treatment group is estimated to have over 90% power to observe statistical significance at the two sided 5% level for both co -primary endpoints and for the key secondary endpoint of time to act ual surgery . The calculation for the co -primary endpoints is based on anal ysis of study MPP111782. This analy sis showed 27% of placebo participants with a one -point improvement in NP score compared to 52% of mepolizumab participants. For nasal blockage , 39% of placebo participants showed a one -point improvement in NP score compared to 70% of mepolizumab participants. For surgery , 90% power to observe statistical significance at the two sided 5% level is based on a true reduction in the proportion of p articipants receiving surgery from 40% on placebo to 25% on mepolizumab. I n the six month study MPP111782, 20% of participants on placebo and 9% of participants on mepolizumab received surgery ; a greater proportion of participants receiving surgery is expected in this twelve month study. The smallest observed effect predicted to result in a statistically significant difference between treatment groups is a reduction in the proportion of participants receiving surgery from 40% on placebo to 30% on mepolizuma b. 10.2. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description All Participants Enrolled All participants enrolled and for whom a record exists on the study database Randomized All randomized particip ants 2020N427698_00"

Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they are allocated at randomisation. Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of stu dy treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received for more than 50% of treatment administrations. 10.3. Statistical A nalyses To strongl y control the t ype I error rate for the primary and secondary outcomes, adjustment for multiplicity will be performed based on a hierarchical testing of endpoints in a pre-defined order. The co- primary endpoints will be tested first and if these comparisons are both significant at the two -sided 5% level, the first of the secondary endpoints will be tested. Testing will continue in a similar manner for the remaining secondary endpoints dependent on statistical significance having been achieved for the previous endpoint in the hierarch y. The secondary endpoints will be tested in the follow ing pre-defined order: 1. Time to first nasal surgery 2. Change from baseline in overall VAS sy mptom score 3. Change from baseline in SNOT- 22 total score 4. Proportion of participants requiring s ystemic steroids for nasal pol yps 5. Change from baseline in the mean composite VAS score (nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, mucus in the throat and loss of smell) 6. Change from baseline in mean individual VAS sy mptom score for loss of smell 10.3.1. Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Co-Primar iesTotal endoscopic nasal polyp score is collected at each clinical visit, the primary assessment will be at week 52 (centrally read data) . Nasal obstruction is collected daily throughout the study via eDiary. Nasal obstruction at Week 52 will be calcula ted as the mean of all measurements made in the 4 weeks prior to the visit (excluding the day of the visit). The mean VAS score over the last 7 days before Visit 2 will be used to determine the baseline value. Participants who undergo surgery/sinuplasty p rior to Week 52 will be assigned their worst observed value prior to surgery/sinuplasty.

The comparis on of mepolizumab with placebo will be expressed as a difference in median change from baseline presented with corresponding 95% confidence interval s, the p- value for the difference between treatment groups will be based on the non -parametric Wilcoxon rank -sum test . The difference in median change between placebo and mepolizumab with associated 95% confidence intervals will be assessed by quantile regression using a bootstrap approach (Mehrotra DV 2017; Keene O.N2018), with covariates of treatment group, baseline score , baseline blood eosinophil count and region. SecondaryTime to actual NP surgery will be compared between treatment groups using a Cox’s proportional hazards mod el with covariates of treatment group, baseline NP score, baseline nasal obstruction score and region. Graphs of the Kaplan -Meir estimates of the proportion of participants with events over time will be produced by treatment group.

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reportin g Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investig ator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. 2020N427698_00"

Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are me t (eg, hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life-threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the def inition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypotheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prol ongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been app ropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disa bility means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influe nza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 2020N427698_00"
104,page_104,"2016N294302_ 04 CONFIDENTIA L 205687 105e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be ex ercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home f or allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrhythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2020N427698_00"

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi es of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will b e documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the partic ipant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relatio nship convey s that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 2020N427698_00"

However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recogn ized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of any post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originall y completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to t GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable , then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) and fax the form to GSK within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub- investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the 2020N427698_00"

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 month s of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Contraception Guidance Male participants Based on the absence of an identified reproductive hazard from preclinical studies, absence of a genotoxic potential, and very low levels of mepolizumab that might be present in semen, there is no recognized risk for mepolizumab to affect human sperm or the foetus if transferred to a female partner via semen. Therefore, the use of condoms or other methods of co ntraception in the male study participant is not required. Female participants Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly from the time of consent, for the duration of the trial, and for 4 months after the last mepolizumab administration as described in Table 2. 2020N427698_00"

Sexual abstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.) NOTES: a. Typical use failure rates may differ fro m those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants in clinical studies. b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, wh ich may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method.

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical d evice incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incidentassociated with a device happened and The incidentwas such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include any of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to bod y structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal distress, fetal death , or any congenital abnormality or birth defects Examples of incidents A participant, user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of a medical device failure or its misuse. A participant’s stud y treatment is interrupted or compromis ed by a medical device failure. A misdiagnosis due to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment. A participant’s health deteriorates due to medical device failure. 2020N427698_00"
