14,page_14,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 13 after appropriate training of subject and/or caregiver. Rationale for Dose and Schedule Selection A 20 mg weekly dose was selected as being the lowest dose that provided maximum TG lowering of approximately 60%, based on the TG lowering effect of ISIS 703802 observed in healthy volunteers with elevated TGs. Adjustment of Dose or Treatment Schedule Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose and dose frequency may be allowed for safety or tolerability after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Study Visit Schedule and Procedures Detailed information regarding the study procedures are outlined in Section 6 , Appendices A and C. The study for an individual subject will generally consist of the following periods: • A n up to 6- week Screening period , including a 4 -week diet stabilization phase for subjects not already on a stable diet • A 26-week treatment period during which Study Drug will be administered weekly by SC injection • A 13-week post -treatment follow -up period During the Screening period , subject will be advised to maintain diet and exercise routines, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). As part of the Screening period , subjects may have 4 weeks of diet run-in and final eligibility will be determined during qualification . Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4 -week diet run- in. TGs will be measured and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. F or subjects who are already on a s table diet and are known to the site, the diet stabilization period can be omitted and subject can move directly to qualification. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at Screening and having a qualifying MRI, defined as having at least 6.4 % liver fat assessed by MRI-PDFF (via central reviewer) will return to the clinic on Day 1. In addition, TG will be measured at qualification and results of TG and MRI must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug . Blood and urine samples will be collected regularly throughout the study for safety, efficacy, and PK analysis. Appendix B shows a list of analytes required for the study and Appendix C details the PK sample schedules. The Mixed Meal Test (MMT) will be done at Baseline , at week 13 and at week 27. This test consists of having the subject cons ume a standardized meal in the evening and fast overnight for at least 8 hours. The following morning, before the test , fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids ( FFA), C-peptide, insulin, serum ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1 and PYY as well as incretin hormones are measured . The subject then consumes a liquid standard meal (such as Optifast®) and the same metabolic parameters are measured again over the course of 300 minutes at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 minutes . In addition, a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used to measure the subject’s perception of hunger . Safety and Tolerability Evaluations Safety and tolerability assessments include: AEs, vital signs and weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, use of concomitant medications ."

OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ISIS 703802 on reduction in fasting triglycerides (TG) . 1.2 Secondary Objective (s) The secondary objectives are: • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ISIS 703802 • To evaluate the effect of ISIS 703802 on changes from Baseline to end of treatment on: o Plasma glucose, serum insulin, serum C-peptide and free fatty acid (FFA) in responses to a mixed meal test (MMT) o Lipids, lipoproteins and lipid metabolism o Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) o Liver fat and body fat distribution o Quality of life and pain score • To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of ISIS 703802. 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Overview of Disease Lipodystrophy syndromes are a group of rare metabolic diseases characterized by selective loss of adipose tissue that leads to ectopic fat deposition in liver and muscle and the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease (Garg 2004; Chan and Oral 2010; Garg et al. 2011; Shulman et al. 2014) . These syndromes are categorized according to the distribution of fat loss into generalized or partial and according to the underlying etiology as inherited or acquired (Garg 2004; Chan and Oral 2010; Garg et al. 2011) . These syndromes constitute a significant medical unmet need as these patients are refractory to current therapies, mainly used to treat diabetes and elevated TG levels, in an attempt to reduce the risk of serious associated complications (coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy, cirrhosis and pancreatitis). As such, in February 2014, the FDA approved Myalept (metreleptin) as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in addition to diet in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. The safety and effectiveness of Myalept was evaluated in 2 open-label studies conducted at the NIH, which included 72 patients (48 with generalized lipodystrophy and 24 with partial lipodystrophy [PL]) with diabetes, high TG, and elevated levels of fasting insulin. The best results were achieved in patients with generalized lipodystrophy who had low leptin levels (mean [SD]: 1.3 [1.1] ng/mL), while patients with"
23,page_23,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 22 partial lipodystrophy who had a wider range of baseline leptin values (mean [SD]: 4.9 [3.1] ng/mL) had a more varied and attenuated response. Because of the risks associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies and lymphoma, Myalept is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program, which requires prescriber and pharmacy certification and special documentation ( Chan et al. 2011; Myalept PI ). At the present time, the Sponsor does not intend to study the generalized forms for which a specific therapy exists (metreleptin) nor the acquired forms of the partial lipodystrophy disorders because of the heterogeneity of etiologies, some iatrogenic, and the high incidence of associated immune disorders in these populations. Therefore, this study will focus only on patients with the congenital form of the partial lipodystrophy disorders and, among those, on the most severe subtype, patients with familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPL) is an orphan disease for which no specific pharmacologic treatment currently exists. FPL was described in the 1970s independently by Köbberling and Dunnigan (Dunnigan et al. 1974; Köbberling et al. 1975) , and is the most common subtype of inherited PL (National Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD] 2012) . It has been estimated that FPL affects approximately 0.2 in 10,000 people in the European Union, which is equivalent to a total of around 10,000 people (Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products 2012) . FPL encompasses several subtypes differentiated by the underlying genetic mutation (6 FPL subtypes and mutations in 5 genes have been identified). FPL type 1, Köbberling variety has been reported in a handful of individuals and its molecular basis is unknown. FPL type 2, Dunnigan variety is the most common form and the most well characterized disorder and is due to missense mutations in the A and C LMNA gene. FPL type 3 has been reported in 30 patients and is due to mutations in the PPAR g gene. FPL type 4 has been reported in 5 patients and is due to mutations in the PLIN1 gene. FPL type 5 has been reported in 4 members of a family who presented with insulin resistance and diabetes and is due to mutations in the AKT2 gene. The last subtype, Autosomal Recessive FPL has been identified recently in 1 patient with homozygous mutations in CIDEC. Some individuals with FPL do not have mutations in any of these genes, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified genes can cause the disorder ( Hegele et al. 2007; Garg et al. 2011; National Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD] 2012) . The diagnosis of FPL is mainly clinical and needs to be considered in patients presenting with the triad of insulin resistance (with or without overt diabetes), significant dyslipidemia in the form of hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver (Huang-Doran et al. 2010) . Patients often present with diabetes and severe insulin resistance requiring high doses of insulin. Other evidence of severe insulin resistance is provided by the presence of acanthosis nigricans and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (with symptoms like hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea). Some patients develop severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting in episodes of pancreatitis. In many patients, the TG levels remain persistently elevated despite fully optimized therapy or diet modifications. Radiographic evidence of hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis with hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases is common (Handelsman et al. 2013) . Patients with the Dunnigan variety have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (Hegele 2001) . Although very rare, patients with a specific mutation in the LMNA gene are at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy and its associated complications, congestive heart failure and conduction defects."
24,page_24,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 23 There is limited natural history data, mostly cross-sectional and derived from publication of baseline characteristics of patients entering a clinical trial (Diker-Cohen CE et al. 2015; Ajluni N et al. 2016; Akinci B et al. 2017; Ahmed Z et al. 2013; Bidault G. et al. 2013) . The evidence that FPL progresses over time comes from a prospective, open-label NIH study with ongoing enrollment since 2000 (N = 87). Data analyzed in 2014 showed that metabolic manifestations of the cohort of 32 partial lipodystrophy patients (including 25 FPL) were as severe as those of the cohort of generalized lipodystrophy (N = 55), which is recognized as a more severe form of lipodystrophy (Diker-Cohen CE et al. 2015) . Patients with FPL have both a partial loss and maldistribution of adipose tissue leading to their distinct phenotype. In many of these patients mutations in proteins involved in adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid uptake by adipocytes, triglyceride synthesis, or lipid droplet formation have been identified (Garg et al. 2011, Handelsman et al. 2013) . Due to this severe dysfunction of adipose tissue FPL patients have much lower TG storage capacity than patients with hypertriglyceridemia without FPL, highlighting the importance of TGs in the pathophysiology of FPL. Plasma TG levels in FPL patients varied across studies from mean (25-75 percentile) 483 mg/dL (232, 856) (Diker-Cohen CE et al. 2015) , median (25-75 percentile) 342 mg/dL (279, 801) (Akinci B et al. 2017) , mean 383 mg/dL (Bidault G et al. 2013) , median 389 mg/dL (155- 3455) (Ahmed Z et al. 2013) and mean 1058 mg/dL (Ajluni N et al. 2016). It is estimated that 1/4 to 1/5 of patients with FPL may have TG levels > 500 m g/dL. Due to inability of adipose tissue to accommodate excess TGs, TGs are deposited in higher amounts in organs other than adipose tissue that are less well adapted to excess lipid storage (“ectopic fat”) (Garg et al. 2011, Handelsman et al. 2013; Robbins et al. 2015; Nolis 2014; Huang-Doram et al. 2010) . This ectopic fat accumulation has been found in and around many organs and is most clearly associated with metabolic abnormalities in the liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle contributing to severe insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia and increased risk of pancreatitis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis (Robbins et al. 2015; Nolis 2014; Huang-Doram et al. 2010; Vatier et al. 2013; Sleigh A et al. 2012) . Careful clinical assessment of fat distribution through visual and physical examination can confirm the diagnosis. Patients with FPL have reduced subcutaneous fat in the limbs and truncal regions and may have excess subcutaneous fat deposition in neck, face and intra-abdominal regions. Patients with the Dunnigan variety have normal body fat distribution in childhood and gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the extremities and trunk around the time of puberty. In women, the loss of fat may be most striking in the buttocks and hips. At the same time these patients accumulate fat on the face (“double chin”), neck and upper back (“Cushingoid appearance with buffalo hump”). The extent of adipose tissue loss usually determines the severity of the metabolic abnormalities. Patients display prominent muscularity and phlebomegaly (enlarged veins) in the extremities and complain of disproportionate hyperphagia. The condition in females is more easily recognized than in men, and so is reported more often. Patients may also have a family history of similar physical appearance and/or fat loss. Genetic testing, when available, is confirmatory. (Hegele et al. 2007; Huang-Doram et al. 2010; Garg et al. 2011) ."
25,page_25,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 24 Current treatment includes lifestyle modification such as reducing caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure via exercise. Conventional therapies used to treat severe insulin resistance (metformin, thiazolidinediones, Glucagon-like peptide 1s [ GLP -1], insulin), and/or high TGs (dietary fat restriction, fibrates, fish oils) are not very efficacious in these patients (Chan and Oral 2010) . Familial Partial Lipodystrophy is an ultra-orphan indication for which there is a significant unmet medical need. Diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and hypertriglyceridemia associated with this condition can lead to serious complications (Handelsman et al. 2013) such as: • Acute pancreatitis, especially when triglyceride levels are > 1,000 mg/dL • Accelerated microvascular complications from uncontrolled diabetes • Accelerated cardiovascular disease from lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance • Steatohepatitis that can progress to cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma • Proteinuric nephropathies which can progress to end stage renal disease In patients with Generalized Lipodystrophy the metabolic complications are partially related to leptin deficiency, and can be ameliorated in part by leptin replacement. However, leptin deficiency alone cannot explain the severity of metabolic disease in patients with PL who have variable leptin levels. By reducing ANGPTL3 and TG levels, ISIS 703802 may improve the metabolic profile of patients with FPL and reduce their risk of acute pancreatitis. In addition, reductions in TG could improve hepatic steatosis and reduce cirrhosis risk. Furthermore, this mechanism may also improve insulin sensitivity in these patients and potentially lead to a reduction in the complications associated with diabetes. 2.2 Therapeutic Rationale In humans, loss of function mutations within the ANGPTL3 gene give rise to familial combined hypolipidemia (FHBL2), characterized by low plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL- C (Minicocci et al. 2012) . Homozygous individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency showed the full combined hypolipidemic phenotype while individuals with more partial ANGPTL3 deficiency showed a more attenuated phenotype. Of note, FHBL2 homozygous were not affected by diabetes, showed lower plasma levels of insulin and lower degree of insulin resistance as estimated by HOMA-IR (Robciuc et al. 2013). ANGPTL3 protein is produced exclusively in liver, where its expression is downregulated by leptin and insulin (Inukai et al. 2004) . Hepatic specific knock-down of ANGPTL3 mRNA is associated with reduction in plasma triglycerides due to increased lipoprotein lipase activity as well as decreased hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion. Because ANGPTL3 is produced by the liver only, which does not express LPL, it is thought to function as an endocrine rather than paracrine factor with insulin sensitizing effects that go beyond the liver. In fact, insulin sensitization has been shown in patients with ANGPTL3 gene mutations as well as in ANGPTL3 -deficient mice, in which increased uptake of fatty acids into oxidative tissues such as"
26,page_26,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 25 muscle and brown adipose tissue led to decreased uptake of fatty acids and increased uptake of glucose in white adipose tissue (Wang et al. 2015) . Suppression of hepatic ANGPTL3 protein production in mice resulted in significant reductions in levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol and these favorable effects were associated with decreased liver triglyceride content, increases in insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in atherosclerosis progression (Graham et al. 2017) . Treatment with ISIS 703802 would be expected to lower the hepatic expression of ANGPTL3 protein and result in lowering of the levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL-C, increased HDL -C, improved glycemic control and ameliorated insulin resistance in T2DM patients, leading to decreased liver fat content in NAFLD and ultimately, reduced overall risk of coronary artery disease. 2.3 ISIS 703802 2.3.1 Mechanism of Action ISIS 703802 is a second-generation ASO drug targeted to ANGPTL3 that has been covalently bonded to triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), a high-affinity ligand for the hepatocyte-specific asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) to form an ASO-GalNAc conjugate. This GalNAc-conjugate approach results in enhanced ASO delivery to hepatocytes versus non-parenchymal cells and has increased ASO potency by approximately 10-fold in mice (Prakash et al. 2014) . The ASO portion of ISIS 703802 is complementary to a region within the ANGPTL3 messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) (mRNA) coding sequence, and binds to the mRNA via Watson and Crick base pairing. The hybridization (binding) of ISIS 703802 to the cognate mRNA results in the Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1)-mediated degradation of the ANGPTL3 mRNA, thus preventing production of the ANGPTL3 protein. Maximal antisense-mediated reduction of target mRNA levels is typically greater than 90% of control levels in sensitive tissues ( Crooke and Bennett 1996; Zhang et al. 2010) . Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels using this approach correlates directly with a subsequent reduction in target protein levels. 2.3.2 Chemistry Chemically, ISIS 703802 is a synthetic oligomer of 20 nucleotides (i.e., a 20-mer) that are connected sequentially by phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages (mixed backbone design). The mixed backbone design reduces the total number of phosphorothioate linkages in the MOE-modified regions, which reduces non-specific interactions with proteins and further enhances potency of GalNAc conjugated ASOs. The nucleotide sequence of ISIS 703802 (Figure 1) is complementary to a 20-nucleotide stretch within Exon 6 of the ANGPTL3 mRNA coding sequence at position 1169-1188 bp. Structurally, the oligonucleotide has 4 regions. Two (2) of them, the 5 nucleotides at the 5′ end and the 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end, are composed of 2′- O-(2-methoxyethyl) ( 2′-MOE) -modified ribonucleotides. These MOE-modified nucleotides confer (1) increased affinity for the target mRNA (Altmann et al. 1996; McKay et al. 1999) , (2) increased resistance to exonucleases and endonucleases (thereby increasing stability in tissue) (Geary et al. 2003) , and (3) amelioration of some of the high dose toxicities thereby resulting in an improved safety profile compared to first"
27,page_27,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 26 generation antisense drugs containing phosphorothioate modified oligodeoxynucleotides (DNA) (Henry et al. 2000) . The third region, the central portion of the oligonucleotide, is composed of 10 oligodeoxynucleotides. This chimeric design is called a MOE-Gapmer, and ISIS 703802 employs this chimeric structure to enable use of the RNase H1 mechanism for antisense activity. This is because while the 2′-MOE modification confers increased stability and affinity, it does not support RNase H1 catalyzed cleavage of RNA hybridized to 2′- MOE -modified nucleotides (McKay et al. 1999) . This is caused by conformational changes induced in the heteroduplex by 2′-alkoxy:RNA hybrids that are not recognized by RNase H enzymes (Inoue et al. 1987; Monia et al. 1993) . By limiting the 2′-MOE modification to nucleotides flanking the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide core, the beneficial attributes of the 2′-MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase H1 recognition. The fourth region is comprised of a triantennary cluster of N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) sugars which is linked to the 5ʹ end of ISIS 703802 via a phosphodiester linkage. The GalNAc cluster is a high affinity ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a receptor expressed primarily on the surface of liver hepatocytes (Stockert 1995) . The GalNAc cluster enhances delivery of ISIS 703802 to liver hepatocytes over other cell types and enhances potency. After internalization into cells, the GalNAc cluster is metabolized to release ‘free ASO’ inside the cell (Prakash et al. 2014) .

A summary is included below. 2.3.3.1 Preclinical Pharmacology The pharmacology of ANGPTL3 ASOs has been examined in multiple in vitro cell lines where specific and dose-dependent reduction of ANGPTL3 mRNA and protein was clearly demonstrated, resulting in reductions in apoB secreted protein.

28,page_28,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 27 ISIS 563580 has been explored in human ANGPTL3 transgenic mice, wherein liver mRNA and plasma ANGPTL3 protein levels were reduced upon treatment with ISIS 563580. Reductions in murine ANGPTL3 mRNA and protein were routinely observed in all mouse models treated with a murine-specific ANGPTL3 ASO. Pharmacology studies were done with Ldlr -/- mice fed a hypercholesterolemic diet known to develop elevated LDL-C, TG, and atherosclerosis, as well as features of metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia) (Huszar et al. 2000; Schreyer et al. 2002; Tsuchiya et al. 2012) . Treatment of mice with a murine-specific ANGPTL3 ASO resulted in improvement in all of the aforementioned lipid and metabolic endpoints compared to controls. In all mouse models tested, total plasma cholesterol, LDL-C, TG, and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) have been shown to be consistently reduced upon treatment with ANGPTL3 ASOs, while HDL-C is modestly decreased in wild type mice (- 22%), and either stable or increased in others. While a clear mechanistic understanding of HDL -C reductions has not been elucidated, results from in vitro reverse cholesterol transport assays suggest that HDL function is maintained. Administration of ISIS 703802, a human specific, GalNAc conjugated, ANGPTL3 ASO, to human AN GPTL3 transgenic mice led to significant, dose-dependent reductions in hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA. In diet challenged mice, administration of ISIS 731875, a mouse-specific and GalNAc-modified ASO targeting ANGPTL3, led to dose-dependent reductions in both hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA and plasma ANGPTL3 with concomitant reductions in plasma TG and cholesterol. Importantly, the potency and the lipid-lowering effects of the ANGPTL3 ASO were independent of diet. Finally, administration of a mouse-specific ANGPTL3 ASO to western diet fed Ldlr -/-, a mouse model of FH, also led to significant reductions in hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA and plasma ANGPTL3 protein with concomitant reductions in plasma TG and LDL-C that were similar to what was observed in wild type western diet fed mice, indicating that the absence of Ldlr does not affect the ASOs potency or lipid-lowering effects. This suggests that administration of ANGPTL3 ASO administration is a promising target for clinical study in familial hypercholesterolemia patients. While formal pharmacology studies have not been conducted in the monkey with the human ANGPTL3 ASO, hepatic mRNA expression has been shown to be reduced by more than 60% in cynomolgus monkeys, the same model used to conduct the toxicology evaluation. 2.3.3.2 Preclinical Toxicology General toxicology studies for ISIS 703802 consisted of sub-chronic (16-week) and chronic (26- or 39-week) toxicity studies CD-1 in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Since ISIS 703802 is not fully complementary to the mouse ANGPTL3 transcript, treatment group receiving a mouse-specific inhibitor (ISIS 731875) was also included in the mouse study. Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for a detailed description of the preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetics with ISIS 703802. Pharmacokinetic data confirmed continuous and dose-dependent exposure to ISIS 703802. An estimated liver and plasma terminal elimination half-life values of approximately 1 week and 3-4 weeks for 2 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg, respectively, were observed in monkeys. The most"
29,page_29,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 28 noteworthy findings observed in mice and monkeys following ISIS 703802 treatment were, in general, non-specific class effects related to the uptake and accumulation of ASO and no toxicologically relevant findings were considered related to the pharmacologic inhibition of hepatic ANGPTL3 expression, either with the present series of studies or with the former development candidate targeting ANGPTL3. There were no test-article related changes in PLT count in either mouse or monkey in both sub-chronic and chronic studies. The most noteworthy finding in the monkey was the kidney alteration (hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria) seen in one early-sacrifice animal from the 16-week study at 35 mg/kg/week, a dose equivalent to at least ~190-fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical doses by plasma AUC. Non-dose dependent increases in renal protein excretion (up to 2.2-fold in quantitative urine protein, protein/creatinine ratio or urine albumin) were also observed at 8 and/or 35 mg/kg/week (> ~30 to 190-fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical doses by plasma AUC ) at the 16-week scheduled terminal necropsy. However, Similar kidney alterations were not seen at the 6-week interim at any doses or in the 39-week chronic monkey study up to 12 mg/kg/week (> ~200-fold of the 20 mg weekly clinical dose by plasma AUC). Additional findings related to ASO liver accumulation included increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at ≥ 8 mg/kg/week in the 16- and 26-week mouse studies, and were correlated with individual hepatocyte necrosis (minimal to mild) in mouse liver. Those changes were most prominent in the high dose groups (50 and 24 mg/kg/week for the 16- and 26-week studies, respectively). Conversely, no changes in liver enzymes were observed in monkeys from the 39-week toxicity study up to 12 mg/kg/week. In the 16-week monkeys study, increase in ALT was only evident in one early-sacrifice animal at 35 mg/kg/week, and non-statistically significant increases in ALT (< 2-fold of the prestudy baseline) were also observed in the interim- and terminal- sacrifice animals at ≥ 8 mg/kg/week but showed no microscopic correlates or dose-dependency. Given the spectrum and severity of the test article-related clinicopathologic alterations present in monkeys at doses ≤ 12mg/kg/week (> ~100-fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical dose by plasma AUC) during the 39-week treatment phase, none would be regarded to represent an adverse effect (Dorato and Engelhardt 2005; Everds et al. 2013). Considering the monkey to be the most relevant species, these data have characterized the safety profile and established appropriate therapeutic margins for the clinical evaluation of ISIS 703802 in humans. 2.3.4 Clinical Experience Detailed information concerning the clinical studies conducted with ISIS 703802 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. A summary is included below. The study drug, ISIS 703802, is being evaluated in Phase 1 in the clinical setting with single doses up to 120 mg and multiple doses up to 60 mg (once per week for 6 weeks). The parent drug ISIS 563580, an unconjugated 2′-MOE modified ASO that has the same base sequence as ISIS 703802, was also evaluated in a blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study. An interim analysis of ISIS 703802 Phase 1 SAD/MAD Study (ISIS 703802-CS1) was performed in 44 subjects administered single ascending (20, 40 and 80 mg) or multiple ascending doses (10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/week for 6 weeks). Twelve participants were randomly"
30,page_30,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 29 assigned to single-dose groups (9 to active-agent dose groups and 3 to the placebo group) and 32 were randomly assigned to multiple-dose groups (24 to active-agent dose groups and 8 to the placebo group). The main endpoints of the study were safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and changes in lipids and lipoproteins. After 6 weeks of treatment, persons in the multiple dose groups treated with ISIS 703802 had dose-dependent reductions in levels of ANGPTL3 protein (reductions of 46.6 to 84.5% from Baseline, P < 0.01 for all doses vs. placebo 1.6%) and in levels of triglycerides (reductions of 33.2 to 63.1% vs placebo 11.4%), LDL cholesterol (1.3 to 32.9% vs placebo 13.6%), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27.9 to 60.0% vs placebo 4.0%), non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.0 to 36.6% vs placebo 9.1%), apolipoprotein B (3.4 to 25.7% vs placebo 11.0%), and apolipoprotein C-III (18.9 to 58.8% vs placebo 3.1%). There were no serious adverse events documented during the trial. No protocol-defined injection-site reactions were reported. Of those participants who received the multiple-dose regimen, three reported headache (one who received placebo and two who received ISIS 703802) and three reported dizziness (two who received placebo and one who received ISIS 703802). There was no clinical evidence of prothrombotic effects, bleeding episodes, significant decreases in platelet count or thrombocytopenia, or significant changes in renal function. One subject in the 60 mg weekly dose cohort had an approximately 5 x ULN increase of ALT, without increase in bilirubin and a second subject had an ALT of 88 U/L on Day 36 post treatment which returned to normal range by Day 50 and remained normal until the end of the study. One subject in the 20 mg MAD group was lost to follow-up after 5 doses. There were no other discontinuations during the treatment period (Graham et al. 2017 and data on file ). The pharmacokinetics of ISIS 703802 evaluated in Study ISIS 703802-CS1 showed rapid absorption following SC administration, with median time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max) ranging from 1 to 6 hours. Similar T max values were observed at all dose levels. After reaching C max, plasma concentrations of ISIS 703802 declined in a multi-phasic fashion with a rapid disposition phase, followed by a slower elimination phase with terminal elimination half-life of 3 to 5 weeks. The peak (C max) and total exposure (AUC) after a single SC dose increased approximately dose proportionally from 20 to 40 mg, and greater than dose proportionally from 40 to 80 mg, suggesting more efficient tissue uptake at lower doses. After single and multiple SC doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg, the C max and AUC increased approximately dose proportionally. No accumulation based on C max or AUC was observed after 6 weekly doses. 2.3.4.1 ISIS 563580-CS1 Phase 1 SAD/MAD In a Phase 1 study, ISIS 563580-CS1, healthy volunteers received subcutaneous administration of ISIS 563580, an unconjugated 2′-MOE modified ASO that has the same base sequence as ISIS 703802, from 50 to 400 mg as a single dose, or 100 to 400 mg as multiple doses (8 doses in 36 days). Overall, the safety findings from this study suggest that ISIS 563580 was not associated with any safety concerns. There were 383 adverse events (AE) reported in the ISIS 563580-treated subjects of which 363 (95%) were mild in severity. For the multiple-dose subjects, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events were AEs at the injection site. There was 1 serious adverse event (SAE) in the study of periorbital cellulitis which was considered a medically important event by the Investigator and was also considered unlikely related to Study Drug by the Investigator. Together, the above suggest that ISIS 563580 was well-tolerated at the doses and regimen given, which exceed the dose levels and cumulative exposures to be tested in"
31,page_31,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 30 the current study. There were no clinically-relevant changes in laboratory assessments and the heparin dose of 80 U/kg was well-tolerated in support of the post-heparin procedures. ISIS 563580 produced dose-dependent reductions in plasma ANGPTL3 (up to 93%; group means up to 84%), TG (up to 63%; group means up to 49%) and TC (up to 46%; group means up to 28%) at Day 36 (Brandt et al. 2015) . 2.4 Rationale for Dose and Schedule of Administration The Phase 1 program evaluated ISIS 703802 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg given weekly for 6 weeks that were found to be generally well-tolerated and to induce clinically-relevant reductions in lipid biomarkers. The dose proposed for the present study will provide the equivalent drug exposure of 20 mg weekly (80 mg monthly) and is predicted (based on modelling of PK/PD data obtained in Phase 1 study) to result in mean reductions from Baseline in TGs of approximately 63% at steady- state. Safety data from the available chronic mouse (26-week) and monkey (39-week) studies support once-weekly dosing for chronic administration. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for ISIS 703802 in chronic monkey study was determined to be 12 mg/kg/wk. In healthy volunteers, 703802 achieved an equivalent reduction in ANGPTL3 plasma concentration to that of the unconjugated form, at approximately 1/10 th of the unconjugated ASO (ISIS 563580) dose (Brandt et al. 2015) . 2.5 Benefit -Risk Assessment The current study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of ISIS 703802 in patients with FPL. The dose selected is expected to substantially reduce ANGPTL3 and result in a reduction of triglyceride levels, reduction of fat content of the liver and improvement of glycemic control. We do not know if subjects participating in this study would necessarily benefit from the treatment. However, the increased understanding of the effects of ISIS 703802 in this population may potentially result in new treatment options that would ultimately benefit FPL patients. Due to the short duration of this trial any benefit observed is not expected to persist beyond the end of the study. 2.5.2 Risk Assessment The known potential risks to study participants associated with ISIS 703802 are elaborated on in the Guidance to Investigator section of the Investigator’s Brochure. • In preclinical mouse studies, there were increases in ALT and AST and were correlated with increased incidence and/or severity of necrosis of individual hepatocytes (minimal to mild in severity). Those changes were most prominent in the high dose groups and showed no clear progression over time. No increases in liver enzymes were observed in monkeys from the 39-week toxicity study up to 12 mg/kg/week (~200-fold of the 20 mg/week clinical dose by plasma AUC). In the 16-week monkey study, increase in ALT was only evident in 1 early-sacrifice animal at 35 mg/kg/week, no meaningful increase in ALT was observed in the schedule sacrificed animals. • In the Phase 1 study, there was no elevations in ALT at single dose cohorts up to 120 mg. In multiple dose cohorts, two out of six subjects in the 60 mg weekly dose cohort had a"
32,page_32,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 31 > 2 x ULN increase of ALT, without increase in bilirubin, which was considered a treatment related adverse event (AE) for one by Principal Investigator (PI). There were no other observed clinically significant changes in ALT and liver function in Phase 1 human study (data on file). However, to evaluate and mitigate the potential for liver enzyme abnormalities, regular liver chemistry monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6. • Injection site adverse events, while not considered safety issues, may affect the ability of the subject to tolerate dosing. Injection site adverse events are the most common side effects observed following SC administration of unconjugated 2 ¢-MOE ASOs and are dose and concentration dependent. Erythema is the most prevalent characteristic. Generally, these events are mild and reversible, resolve spontaneously and do not worsen with time. The histologic findings are consistent with a local inflammatory response. Subjects should be informed of the possibility of occurrence of injection site adverse events. Symptomatic interventions such as icing of the injection site or administration of NSAIDs prior to and/or after the SC dosing have been utilized. • Although no changes in platelet (PLT) counts have been observed in healthy volunteers, mouse or monkey in both sub-chronic and chronic studies with ISIS 703802, reductions in platelet counts to below the lower limit of normal have been observed after administration of other ASOs and some subjects have experienced severe thrombocytopenia following administration of unconjugated 2 ¢-MOE ASOs. To evaluate and mitigate the potential for a reduction in PLT count, monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 (Safety Monitoring Rules and Stopping Rules). • No significant changes in serum creatinine, electrolytes, BUN, or urinalysis were reported from the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 1 study (data on file). To evaluate and mitigate the potential for a reduction in renal function, since kidneys are an organ of high distribution for the studied ASO, monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 (Safety Monitoring Rules and Stopping Rules). While the long term effects of reducing ANGPTL3 as a target with the study drug are not known at this time, there is evidence in literature in humans in whom ANGPTL3 is absent from plasma, due to homozygous or compound heterozygous ANGPTL3 mutations, present a pan-hypobetalipoproteinemia phenotype, with generalized and marked decreases (~50% to 70%) in all apoB-100 containing lipoproteins, including VLDL and LDL, as well as HDL. This clinical phenotype has been termed familial combined hypolipidemia or FHBL2 (Romeo et al. 2009; Musunuru et al. 2010; Martin -Campos et al. 2012; Minicocci et al. 2012; Noto et al. 2012; Pisciotta et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2015) . Clinical studies in FHBL2 suggest a trend toward lower glucose and insulin levels and reported decrease in VLDL. Remarkably, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are reportedly absent from those with homozygous FHBL2 and no adverse clinical phenotype has been reported to date. 2.5.3 Overall Assessment of Benefit: Risk ISIS 703802 has demonstrated the ability to reduce ANGPTL3, APOCIII, and TGs by greater than 60% and LDL-C by more than 30% in the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The"
33,page_33,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 32 objective of this study is to assess the effect of TG lowering in FPL patients. This study will also investigate the potential of ISIS 703802 in improving the insulin resistance and glucose profile, and decreasing liver and visceral fat content in these patients. Alth ough the subjects enrolled in this study will not derive long term benefits due to the short duration of the study, they may derive some short term benefit from improved metabolic health and dietary counselling. The information obtained in the course of this study is critical to further development of ISIS 703802 for FPL patients. The protocol identifies that potential risks associated with ISIS 703802 treatment will be mitigated by routine monitoring. Thus, exposure of subjects in this study is justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to the wider population of patients by continued development of ISIS 703802. 3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is a Phase 2 open-label multiple-dose study of approximately 3 subjects with FPL that will be treated with ISIS 703802. Initially, 3 subject will be enrolled, but enrollment could be increased to 6 subjects, based on safety profile and efficacy observations. Subjects will be evaluated for study eligibility during Screening and Qualification, which takes place up to 6 weeks prior to Day 1 (the first day of Study Drug administration). During the Screening period, subjects will be advised to maintain routine diet and exercise routines, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). As part of the Screening period, following 4 weeks of diet run- in, subjects will have a qualification visit and final eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4-week diet run-in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured to qualify and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at qualification will return to the clinic on Day 1 for their first dose of ISIS 703802 by subcutaneous (SC) injection. During the treatment period subjects will receive ISIS 703802 (20 mg) administered every week for 26 weeks. Subjects will return regularly for outpatient visits throughout the treatment period according to the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) . The primary safety and efficacy analysis time point is at Week 27. Subjects will then enter a 13 week Post-Treatment Follow-up Period and will return to the study center for outpatient evaluations according to the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) . Blood and urine samples will be collected regularly throughout the study for safety, efficacy, and PK analysis. Appendix B shows a list of analytes required for the study and Appendix C details the PK sample schedule."

Initially, 3 subject will be enrolled, but enrollment could be increased to 6 subjects, based on safety profile and efficacy observations. 3.4 Overall Study Duration and Follow- up The length of subjects’ participation in the study may be up to 45 weeks. This includes an up to 5-week screening period, that includes a 4-week diet stabilization / run-in period, a 1-week qualification period, a 26-week treatment period, and a 13-week post-treatment evaluation period. Subjects may be required to attend additional visits for monitoring of adverse events or abnormal investigation results. The frequency of additional monitoring will be determined by the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with the Investigator. 3.4.1 Screening /Qualification Subject eligibility for the study will be determined within 42 days/6 weeks prior to study entry. Potential subjects will report to the Study Center for screening assessments at specified intervals within the 6-week screening period as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A. As part of the screening period, subjects will have a 4-week diet stabilization/run-in period followed by a up to 2-week qualification period. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4-week diet run-in. At the qualification visit subjects will have a baseline DEXA scan and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug . 3.4.2 Treatment Eligible subjects will receive the first dose of study drug at the Study Center, at which time they will also be trained on s elf-administration of Study drug. Subsequent administrations of study drug may occur at home or in the Study Center. Eligible subjects will report to the Study Center for assessments at specified intervals throughout the 26 week treatment period as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A. 3.4.3 Post-Treatment Subjects are to return to the Study Center for follow-up visits. These visits will take place at 4, 8 and 13 weeks after the last dose. Refer to Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A. 4.

STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1 Study Schedule The study will consist of a Screening period, a Treatment period and a Post-treatment Follow-up period. These periods are described below. All required study procedures are outlined in Appendix A. 6.1.1 Screening /Qualification Written informed consent for the study will be obtained prior to the performance of any study-related procedures including screening procedures. A 5-week period is provided for completing screening assessments and determining subject eligibility for the study. During the screening period, subject will be advised to maintain diet and exercise routines, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). Subjects will undergo a medical history and physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG , and have blood and urine samples taken for clinical laboratory testing. Subjects will be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Safety labs may be re-tested for determination of subject eligibility after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. As part of the screening period, subjects not already on a stable diet will have 4 weeks of diet run-in, followed by a qualification visit, during which final eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4-week diet run-in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. 6.1.2 Treatment Period Subjects will be managed on an outpatient basis. Safety and clinical laboratory evaluations as well as blood sampling for PK analysis will be performed periodically throughout the treatment period. Any AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded. Collection and measurement of vital signs, physical examination results, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters (Appendix B) , ISIS 703802 plasma concentrations, immunogenicity, MRI, AEs and concomitant medication/procedure information will be performed according to the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A."
40,page_40,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 39 6.1.4 Post-Treatment Period Each subject will be followed for safety assessments for 13 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug. During the post-treatment evaluation period, subjects will return to the Study Center for outpatient visits for safety and clinical laboratory evaluations. A ± 3-day excursion from the scheduled visit date is permitted for this time period. 6.2 Study/Laboratory Assessments Laboratory analyte samples will be collected throughout the Study. A list of these analytes is contained in Appendix B. Blood chemistry and urine samples (excluding 24-hour urine collection) should be taken after fasting for at least 10 hours. During this time subjects can drink water and should ensure that they consume sufficient water to not become dehydrated. If tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumping, hemolysis or quantity not sufficient) or missing, a repeat blood or urine specimen should be re-drawn as soon as possible (ideally within 1 week). While on treatment hematology samples will be collected every 14 days. Each time a hematology lab is drawn and sent to the central laboratory for analysis, an additional sample should be collected in parallel and analyzed locally. In the event that both the central and local samples are unreportable (e.g., due to hemolyzed or clumped blood samples), subject dosing cannot continue until another sample is repeated and determined not to have met a platelet stopping rule. If there is no reportable platelet count within 14 days of the last platelet count, the Investigator will contact the subject to hold dosing until a new platelet count is obtained and reviewed. While on treatment blood samples for liver function testing will also be collected every 14 days and sent to the central laboratory for analysis for the first 3 months of the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section 8.5.1. While on treatment blood and urine samples for renal function testing will also be collected every 14 days and sent to the central laboratory for analysis per for the first 3 months of the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section 8.5.2. All lab samples sent to the central laboratory are received on the next day and processed. Lab Alerts issued as per protocol safety monitoring requirements or stopping rules will indicate the applicable protocol section to facilitate review and will be immediately and simultaneously sent by email to the Investigator, the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors, the Sponsor D rug Safety Physician, and the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), and should be received by them within 2 days from sample collection. Hematology results from the site’s local laboratories are received by the study center staff on the day of sample collection, and should be entered as soon as possible into the eCRF to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring teams. All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator, or designee, to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the subject could be approaching the dose"

Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and must be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Section 9.4.1. All liver and renal function tests must also be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator, or designee, to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rule. Any event meeting renal stopping rules criteria described in Section 8.6.2 is considered an adverse event of special interest and must be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Section 9.4.1. All lab alerts received, including those related to platelet, liver, or renal function monitoring/stopping rules, are also reviewed promptly by the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors who will agree on actions to be taken. Within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab alert the CRO Medical Monitor will communicate instructions to the Investigator and the study personnel by emailing them the Safety Surveillance Form that needs to be signed by the Investigator/study personnel and promptly returned to the Sponsor and CRO Medical Monitor. In urgent cases, such as platelets results below 50,000/mm 3, or liver or renal test results reaching a critical stopping rule the Investigator must also be contacted by phone. Further information on safety monitoring and actions to be taken by the Study Investigator in the event of reduced platelet count are provided in Sections 8.5.3 and 8.6.3. 6.2.1 Physical Exams and Vital Signs Physical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) . Vital signs should include weight, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. BP and pulse rate will be recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. BP should always be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm). Height will be measured at Screening . 6.2.2 DEXA Scan Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scans will be conducted prior to administration of the first dose of Study Drug and repeated at Week 27 using standardized procedures and settings. 6.2.3 Electrocardiography Electrocardiography (ECG) will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) at Screening, Day 1 (prior to the first dose of Study Drug), and during the treatment period. ECGs will be conducted during the post-treatment follow-up period at scheduled visits. ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be performed in triplicate. 6.2.4 PK Sampling Blood samples for the determination of plasma ISIS 703802 concentrations will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and at various times throughout the treatment and post-treatment follow-up periods as noted in the tables in Appendix C."
42,page_42,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 41 6.2.5 Mixed Meal Test The Mixed Meal Test (MMT) (Appendix E) will be done at baseline, at week 13 and at week 27. This test consists of having the subject consume a standardized meal in the evening and fast overnight for at least 8 hours. The following morning, before the test, fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids ( FFA), C-peptide, insulin, serum ghrelin, GIP, G LP-1 and PYY as well as incretin hormones are measured. The subject then consumes a liquid standard meal (such as Optifast ®) and the same metabolic parameters are measured again over the course of 300 minutes at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 minutes. In addition, a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) will be used to measure the subject’s perception of hunger. 6.2.6 MRI An MRI to determine liver fat fraction will be done at Qualification, Week 13 and Week 27. 6.3 Restriction on the Lifestyle of Subjects 6.3.1 Contraception Requirements All male subjects and women of childbearing potential must refrain from sperm/egg donation and either be abstinent † or practice effective contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form until at least a period of 13 weeks after their last dose of study treatment. Male subjects engaged in sexual relations with a female of child-bearing potential must also encourage their female partner to use effective contraception from the time of signing the informed consent until a period of 13 weeks after the subject’s last dose of study treatment. For the purposes of this study, women of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has experienced menarche, and who does not meet one of the following conditions: • Postmenopausal: 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in females > 55 years of age or, in females ≤ 55 years, 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea without an alternative medical cause and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range for the laboratory involved • 6 weeks after surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy • Post hysterectomy For the purposes of the study, effective contraception is defined as follows: For male subjects: • Effective male contraception includes a vasectomy with negative semen analysis at follow-up, or the use of condoms together with spermicidal foam/gel/film/ cream/suppository • Male subjects with partners that are pregnant must use condoms as contraception to ensure that the fetus is not exposed to the Study Drug For female subjects and female partners of male subjects: • Using 2 of the following acceptable methods of contraception: surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation), hormonal contraception, intrauterine contraception/device, or any"

Study staff will administer the first dose of Study Drug. Doses will be administered by SC injection, patients or their caregivers may self-administer the study drug following the training given by the study center staff. Subjects will receive treatment weekly with weeks always defined relative to Study Day 1. For example if a subject receives the first dose on a Monday, subsequent doses should be given on Mondays according to the respective dosing schedule, if possible. If a subject misses an injection, or if dosing on the usual day is not possible, the subject can reschedule the injection provided that 2 doses are administered at least 2 days apart. Every effort should be made to ensure the previous dose is given 7 days prior to a scheduled clinic visit. Volumes to be administered are shown in Table 2. Please refer to the Study Drug Manual provided by the Sponsor or designee for more detailed instructions for Study Drug preparation and/or administration.

Subjects will continue their lipid-lowering therapy on a stable regimen from the signing of informed consent at Screening through the end of the post-treatment evaluation period. 8.3 Other Protocol-Required Treatment Procedures There are no other protocol-required treatment procedures other than those outlined in the schedule of procedures. 8.4 Treatment Precautions No specific treatment precautions are required. 8.5 Safety Monitoring Rules Please refer also to the “Guidance for Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure. For the purposes of safety monitoring Baseline is defined as the average of the pre-dose test closest to Day 1 and Day 1. In addition to the standard monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following guidelines are provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical observations."
45,page_45,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 44 In case of discrepancy between the test results from 2 sources, safety-mandated action must be initiated based on the more critical (lower or higher, as relevant) of the 2 values. Confirmation Guidance: At any time during the Study (Treatment or Post-Treatment Periods), the initial clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must be confirmed by performing measurements (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the initial measurement) on new specimens prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug. All new specimen collections should take place as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection). Stopping Rule Guidance: The Investigator may interrupt or permanently discontinue study treatment for any safety reason including clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory results. In the event of an initial clinical laboratory result that meets a stopping criterion, subjects must not be re-dosed until a confirmatory test result has been reviewed by the Study Medical Monitor. If any of the stopping criteria described below are met and are confirmed, the subject will be permanently discontinued from further treatment with Study Drug (ISIS 703802), evaluated fully as outlined below and in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be entered into the post-treatment evaluation portion of the study. In general, subjects who do not meet the stopping rules based upon retest may continue dosing. However, the Investigator and the Study Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) should confer as to whether additional close monitoring of the subject is appropriate. Additional Guidance: If possible, a PK sample should be collected as soon as possible after a SAE has occurred (preferably within 2 weeks). In addition, if a subject is asked to return to the clinic for additional evaluations due to an AE, then a PK sample should be taken at the time of the unscheduled visit. 8.5.1 Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests The following rules are adapted from the FDA guidance for industry, “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009 and adopted to meet the requirements of this protocol and compound to ensure safety of the subjects. While on treatment, all subjects will have liver chemistry tests monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3-months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. Upon completion of the study treatment period, liver chemistry tests should be monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A. In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, abnormal bleeding or bruising, or eosinophilia > ULN) liver enzymes and bilirubin should be tested as soon as possible. Testing at a lab that is local to the subject is permissible for this purpose. In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (treatment or post-treatment period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed."
46,page_46,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 45 Subjects with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 x ULN should have their liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, ALP, international normalized ratio [INR] and total bilirubin) retested at least once-weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.5 x ULN. All results of liver function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules. Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations: For subjects with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 x ULN, the following evaluations should be performed: 1. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases 2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets 3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel 4. Serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus [HAV] immunoglobulin M [IgM], hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody, Cytomegalovirus [CMV] IgM, and EBV antibody panel) 5. Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA]) Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Repetition of the above evaluations should be considered if a subject’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 x ULN. All routine liver function test results will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Medical Monitor. All lab alerts for abnormal liver function tests must be promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) reviewed by the Investigator and Medical Monitors. Lab alerts for abnormal liver chemistry tests will be issued for: 1) ALT or AST > 3 x ULN; 2) ALT or AST > 2 x baseline; 3) total bilirubin > ULN; 4) ALP > ULN. These alert levels are set to anticipate the risk of a combined elevation of aminotransferases and bilirubin as per the FDA Guidance. 8.5.2 Safety Monitoring for Renal Function While on treatment all subjects will have renal function tests monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. Upon completion of the study treatment period, urine renal biomarkers should be monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A. In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs consistent with renal dysfunction such as hematuria, polyuria, anuria, flank pain, new-onset hypertension, nausea and/or anorexia, renal function should be tested as soon as possible. Testing at a lab that is local to the subject is permissible for this purpose."
47,page_47,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 46 While on treatment during the course of the study, urinary surveillance may include urinalysis to include urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) and urinary red blood cells (RBCs), as well as serum creatinine and cystatin-C to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which will be monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3-months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. In addition, other biomarkers of acute renal injury may also be measured if a safety signal is seen that warrants further testing. (Appendix B). The assessment of serum creatinine, cystatin-C, and urinalysis more frequently than per the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A will be guided by consultation with the medical monitor. Any decision taken by the Investigator to discontinue study medication will be made taking into account all available and relevant data. In addition, the decision to discontinue Study Drug may also be based on lesser changes in these parameters observed in isolation or in association with other renal-related abnormalities. Any decision taken to restart study medication will be made in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor taking into account all available and relevant data. All results of renal function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules. Lab alerts for abnormal renal tests will be issued for: Creatinine clearance (by CKD- EPI formula) decrease from Baseline > 25%, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) > 250 mg/g, urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 0.5 mg/mg, or an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline > 0.3 mg/dL). These alert levels are set to anticipate and prevent the risk of a medically significant change in renal function while receiving Study Drug. In the event of a confirmed laboratory result meeting one or more of the above criteria, the following supplemental renal tests should be immediately obtained: Serum creatinine, urine culture, 24-hour urine sample for creatinine clearance, urine albumin and urine protein, urine microscopy sample with inspection of sediment. The Investigator should also review the subject’s concomitant medications for potentially nephrotoxic agents, and, with the results of these evaluations, review any decision to continue or discontinue the subject in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor. 8.5.3 Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results All subjects will have platelet counts monitored every 2 weeks for the duration of the study treatment period and must not receive Study Drug without an interpretable platelet count result in the prior 2 weeks. Upon completion of study drug dosing, platelets should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then at 8 and 13 weeks post last dose (as per visit schedule). All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the subject could be approaching the dose interruption rule of 75,000/mm 3."
48,page_48,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 47 Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor. Lab alerts related to platelet monitoring/stopping rules are issued when: 1) platelet counts are < 140,000 mm3; 2) when platelet count is ≥ 30% decreased from Baseline, or 3) when the hematology sample is unreportable. All these lab alerts, are reviewed promptly by the Medical Monitor and instructions are communicated to the Investigator and the study personnel within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab alert. Actions to be taken in the event of reduced platelet count are shown in Table 3. In the event of a platelet count ˂ 100,000/mm 3 the laboratory tests outlined in Table 3, should be performed as soon as possible. Additional lab tests will be determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee in consultation with the Investigator. 8.5.4 Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events Subjects will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study Drug treatment (Day 1). Patients will be instructed to promptly report any signs or symptoms of bleeding. Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically-relevant, non-major bleeding events (which are defined in Section 8.6.3) , for example excess bruising, petechiae, or gingival bleeding on brushing teeth. If a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor and additional testing of coagulation parameters activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), INR, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin and platelet count may be performed. 8.5.5 Safety Monitoring for Constitutional Symptoms Subjects will be instructed to promptly report any signs or symptoms of fever, constitutional symptoms, rash, arthralgia or joint swelling that may arise during the study and the Investigator should closely evaluate all potential causes, including concomitant illness. Subjects who experience persistent symptoms should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee to determine whether additional monitoring or laboratory tests are required. 8.5.6 Safety Monitoring for Hypoglycemia Subjects will be instructed to monitor and manage hypoglycemic episodes. Subjects will be provided with glucometer and asked to record Self Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) levels and report back alert values to the site. Subjects will be instructed to promptly report symptoms of hypoglycemia: headache, heart pounding, confusion, disorientation, numbness or tingling, pale skin, shakiness or tremulousness, increased appetite, anxiousness or nervousness, lightheadedness or dizziness, sweating and weakness. If subjects suspect they might be having a hypoglycemia reaction, they should check their blood glucose using their meters as soon as possible, before treatment if possible, provided they feel it is safe to do so. If there is doubt about safety they should treat the event first, using some sugar, milk, or juice for example, then obtain and record a blood glucose value as soon as possible thereafter. The time and nature of treatment should be noted, and especially if any blood glucose result was before or after treatment. If a subject presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia, the Investigator will need to"
49,page_49,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 48 take immediate action to confirm the subject’s glucose level and treat the subject accordingly. Severe hypoglycemia will be qualified as a SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria. Classification of Hypoglycemia The alert value for hypoglycemia is ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) plasma concentration. Severe Hypoglycemia Requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event. Neurological recovery following plasma glucose levels returning to normal considered sufficient evidence that event was induced by low plasma glucose concentration. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms accompanied by measured plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia Not accompanied by typical hypoglycemia symptoms but with measured plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but likely caused by plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). A documented severe hypoglycemic event is defined as one in which the subject requires assistance of another person to obtain treatment for the event and has a plasma glucose level ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). The rescue treatment of hypoglycemia may include IV glucose or buccal or intramuscular glucagon. The definition of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia includes all episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent self-treatment and which were thus thought to place subjects at risk for injury to themselves or others. 8.5.7 Safety Monitoring for Documented Hyperglycemia Subjects will be asked to self-monitor their glucose at least once a week and reviewed by Investigator at each Study Center visit. If the value exceeds the specific glycemic limit specified below, the subject will be instructed to check again during the 2 following days. If all values in 3 consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the subject should contact the Investigator and a central laboratory FPG measurement will be performed). The threshold values are defined as follows, depending on study period: From baseline visit to Week 13 (including value at Week 13) of Randomized Treatment period:"
50,page_50,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 49 • FPG > 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) From Week 13 to Week 25/27/ET (including value at Week 25/27/ET) of Randomized Treatment period: • FPG > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) or • HbA1c > 9% (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c < 8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 1% from Baseline (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c ≥ 8%) In case of FPG/HbA1c above the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that: • Plasma glucose was actually measured in the fasting condition • Absence of intercurrent disease which may jeopardize glycemic control. In case of an emergency such as unplanned hospitalization (e.g., surgery, infection), the Investigator can take appropriate measures for glycemic control. If the measure does not exceed 7 days, then it will not be considered a rescue. If the measure lasts beyond 7 days then it will be treated as a rescue • Compliance to treatment is appropriate • Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic control, the Investigator should undertake appropriate action, i.e.: • Investigation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in AE/concomitant medication parts of the eCRF) • Stress on the absolute need to be compliant to treatment • Organize a specific interview with a Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition professional and stress on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendations • Schedule a FPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit If none from the above-mentioned reason can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease FPG/H bA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced at the Investigator discretion and according to local guidelines. All assessments for primary and secondary efficacy and safety parameters planned in final primary endpoint assessment visit should be performed before adding the rescue medication if possible. Then the subject continues the study treatment and stays in the study in order to collect safety information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the last scheduled visit. (See more details in Appendix A) . Note: After Study Drug discontinuation any treatments are permitted, as deemed necessary by the Investigator."
51,page_51,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 50 8.6 Stopping Rules For the purposes of stopping rules, Baseline is defined as the average of Day 1 pre-dose assessment and the last measurement prior to Day 1. 8.6.1 Stopping Rules for Liver Chemistry Elevations In the event of confirmed laboratory results meeting any of the following criteria, dosing of a patient with Study Drug will be stopped permanently: 1. ALT or AST > 8 x ULN, which is confirmed 2. ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ 2 weeks 3. ALT or AST > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5 4. ALT or AST > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN), which is confirmed, and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides with the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (> ULN) felt by the Investigator to be potentially related to hepatic inflammation. Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose or dose frequency will be allowed for safety. Any proposed adjustments to treatment schedule must be discussed with, and approved by, the Study Medical monitor prior to initiation. 8.6.2 Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results / Temporary Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results In the event of an estimated creatinine clearance (by CKD-EPI formula) meeting any of the following criteria, or any change in renal biomarkers deemed by the nephrologist to require further evaluation, a serum creatinine and 24-hour urine sample for creatinine clearance and protein should be obtained: 1. CKD -EPI decrease of > 40% from Baseline 2. CKD -EPI value < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Dosing of a patient with Study Drug (ISIS 703802) will be stopped permanently if 24-hour urine testing confirms any of the following values in the absence of an alternative explanation: 1. Urine protein is > 1.0 g 2. Creatinine clearance decrease of > 40% from Baseline 3. Creatinine clearance < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Irrespective of whether the stopping rule is confirmed or not, the follow-up schedule and frequency of renal function monitoring after the initial event will be determined by the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with the Investigator. The Investigator should consider consulting a local nephrologist for any change of renal function that presents a concern. If a renal biopsy is performed, a sample specimen should be made available for examination by an independent renal pathologist who has been engaged by the Sponsor to review such specimens."
52,page_52,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 51 Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose or dose frequency will be allowed for safety. Any proposed adjustments to treatment schedule must be discussed with, and approved by, the Study Medical monitor prior to initiation. 8.6.3 Stopping Rule for Platelet Count Results Actions to be taken in the event of a low platelet count are summarized in Table 3 below. In the event of any platelet count less than 50,000/mm3, or a platelet count less than 75,000/mm3 that occurs while the subject is already on reduced dose, dosing of the subject with Study Drug will be stopped permanently (Table 3) . Platelet count will be monitored daily until 2 successive values show improvement then monitored every 2-3 days until platelet count is stable. Administration of steroids is recommended for subjects whose platelet count is less than 25,000/mm3. Recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by administration of high dose steroids. Treatment guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (Provan et al. 2010) recommend Dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days every 2-4 weeks for 1-4 cycles; Prednis(ol)one 0.5-2 mg/kg/d for 2-4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days (note: may require continuation with oral steroids after methylprednisolone). In the event of a platelet count ˂ 75,000/mm 3 and > 50,000/mm3, dosing of a subject with Study Drug should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered to > 100,000/mm3. If dosing is continued, it must be at a reduced dose as shown in Table 1. The suitability of the subject for continued dosing will be determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor and will be based on factors such as the original rate of decline in the subject’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by the subject, and the speed of recovery of platelet count after interruption of dosing. If, after reintroduction of Study Drug, the platelet count again falls below 75,000/mm 3, then dosing of the subject with Study Drug will be stopped permanently. Once a subject commences weekly monitoring, this frequency of monitoring should continue irrespective of whether the platelet count rises into the normal range. Any unreportable platelet count result must be rechecked and determined not to have met a stopping rule before dosing can continue. Bleeding events that are either major or clinically-relevant non-major bleeding (as defined below) will need to be monitored and treated immediately. Subjects with a suspected bleeding event will undergo additional testing if deemed appropriate by the treating physician and an (S)AE case report form will be completed. In addition, if bleeding is considered significant, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), aPTT, PT, INR, and platelet count are to be obtained. In addition, approximately 2 mL of K2EDTA anticoagulated blood will be collected and resulting plasma must be stored allowing for a centralized assessment of ISIS 703802 concentrations. In addition, if a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or designee) and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, prothrombin time [PT], INR), platelet count, and platelet volume may be performed."
53,page_53,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 52 Definitions : Major bleeding (MB) is defined as one of the following (Büller et al. 2007) : 1. Fatal bleeding 2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular if in a major joint, or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome 3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours Clinically-relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had clinical consequences for a subject (Büller et al. 2007) . Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically-relevant, non-major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruising, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth."

Subjects may have their dose interrupted in response to AEs in consultation with Study Medical Monitor . 8.8 Discontinuation of Study Drug/Treatment A subject must permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following: • The subject becomes pregnant. Report the pregnancy according to instructions in Section 9.5.4 • The subject withdraws consent • The subject experiences an adverse event (AE) that necessitates permanent discontinuation of Study Drug • The subject develops laboratory test abnormalities that meet any of the stopping rules listed in Sections 8.6.1 t o 8.6.3 • When a platelet count of less than 50,000/mm3, or a platelet count less than 75,000/mm3 while the patient is on a reduced dose. The reason for discontinuation of Study Drug Treatment must be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and source documentation. For subjects who discontinue treatment early every effort should be made to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix A) . Subjects should then be entered into the post-treatment evaluation period. If a subject discontinues treatment after only 1 dose, then the post-treatment evaluation procedures should be followed. 8.8.1 Follow-up Visits for Early Termination from Treatment Period or from Post-Treatment Follow-up Period Any subject who discontinues early from the treatment period or from post-treatment follow-up period should be followed as per the platelet monitoring rules shown in Table 3, Section 8.6.3 for the first 6 weeks after discontinuing Study Drug. Following this period, if the platelet count is stable (at least 3 consecutive values that are stable as determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor and > 100,000/mm 3), the next platelet count should be taken within at least 6 weeks so that patients are monitored for at least 13 weeks after discontinuing Study Drug. If the subject declines or is unable to participate in the above, the early termination visit procedures should be performed at the time of withdrawal, at a minimum, and ideally within 2 weeks from the last dose of Study Drug. In addition, the investigator should clarify what type of follow-up the subject is agreeable to: in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from review of the medical records. Wherever possible these subjects should continue to be followed up via the agreed means to collect information on adverse events, concomitant medications and survival status. At"

All information, including the reason for withdrawal from Study, mus t be recorded in the eCRF. Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the Study will be removed from further treatment and study observation immediately upon the date of request. These subjects should be encouraged to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (Appendix A) . For subjects withdrawn for reasons other than withdrawal of consent every effort should be made to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix A) . The Investigator should clarify what type of follow- up the subject is agreeable to: in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from review of the medical records. Wherever possible these subjects should continue to be followed up via the agreed means to collect information on adverse events, concomitant medications and survival status.

Subjects taking over the counter (OTC) omega-3 fatty acids should make every effort to remain on the same brand throughout the study. Allowed Concomitant Therapy Ibuprofen may be used for symptomatic pain relief. Any other therapy (including OTC medications) should be approved by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee. Any medications deemed necessary by the Investigator are allowed except those listed in the disallowed concomitant therapy. Disallowed Concomitant Therapy The use of prescription and OTC medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (with the exception of occasional ibuprofen) is prohibited during this study unless the occurrence of an AE requires a drug therapy. In such cases, the Investigator must consult the Sponsor Medical Monitor to decide on subject continuation or withdrawal from the study. The medications and therapy identified in exclusion criteria, Section 5.2 are also disallowed concomitant medications and are prohibited during the course of study, unless there is a safety concern. In those cases the Medical Monitor needs to be notified and rationale provided by the Investigator. Concomitant therapy with oral corticosteroids used as replacement therapy for pituitary adrenal disease as well as inhaled steroid therapy (e.g., Pulmicort®), or intra-articular, or topical may be acceptable; however, the subject must be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. All exceptions should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Subject should consult with the Site Investigator or designee prior to initiating any new medication, including non-prescription or herbal compounds or any other non-drug therapy. 8.10.2 Concomitant Procedures A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between Screening and the end of the post-treatment evaluation period. 8.11 Treatment Compliance Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded by Study Center staff. The Study Center staff is required to document the receipt, dispensing, and return/destruction of study medication. Subjects that are self-administering study medication at home must record treatment in a dosing diary that will be reviewed periodically by Study Center staff and the Clinical Monitor. 9. SERIOUS AND NON-SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 9.1 Sponsor Review of Safety Information Safety information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by the Sponsor or designee in accordance with the Safety Management Plan throughout the conduct of the clinical trial."
58,page_58,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 57 9.2 Regulatory Requirements The Sponsor or designee is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the Investigators of serious adverse events (SAEs) including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines E2A and ICH E6. Country-specific regulatory requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines. Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) will be notified of any SAE according to applicable regulations. In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the Sponsor or designee will evaluate the available information and perform an independent assessment of relatedness. While the Sponsor may upgrade an Investigator’s decision it is not permissible to downgrade the Investigator’s opinion for the purposes of determining whether the SAE meets the definition of a SUSAR. For the purpose of regulatory reporting of SUSARs, there are no “expected” AEs in this study population. 9.3 Defini tions 9.3.1 Adverse Event An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically-significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the Study or use of investigational drug product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the investigational drug product. 9.3.2 Adverse Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction An adverse reaction is any AE caused by the Study Drug. A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction. 9.3.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death • Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an admission of greater than 24 hours to a medical facility and does not always qualify as an AE • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions"
59,page_59,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 58 • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female) • Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may also be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 9.3.3.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest For the purpose of this study severe reductions in platelet count < 50,000 mm 3 are considered as an AE of special interest and should be subject to expediting reporting to the Sponsor following the same requirements as for SAE reporting (Section 9.4.1) . 9.4 Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the Study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as AEs unless the pre-existing condition worsened. The Investigator should always group signs and symptoms into a single term that constitutes a single unifying diagnosis if possible. 9.4.1 Serious Adverse Events In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs (regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the event. The collection of SAEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the subject’s follow-up period. When the Investigator is reporting by telephone, it is important to speak to someone in person versus leaving a message. An Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be completed and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or designee. The contact information for reporting SAEs is as follows: Attention: INC Research, LLC Email: INCDrugSafety@INCResearch.com Fax: 1-877-464-7787 Detailed information should be actively sought and included on Follow-Up Serious Adverse Event Forms as soon as additional information becomes available. All SAEs will be followed until resolution. SAEs that remain ongoing past the subject’s last protocol-specified follow-up visit will be evaluated by the Investigator and Sponsor. If the Investigator and Sponsor agree the subject’s condition is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and Sponsor will determine the follow-up requirement."
60,page_60,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 59 9.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Events The recording of non-serious AEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and will stop at the end of the subject’s follow-up period. The Investigator will monitor each subject closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. 9.4.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non-Serious) The Investigator’s opinion of the following should be documented on the Adverse Event Case Report Form: 9.4.3.1 Relationship to the Study Drug The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 703802) is characterized by 1 of the following: • Related: There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug, e.g., confirmation by positive re-challenge test • Possible: The event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 703802) administration • Unlikely/Remote: An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal relationship to Study Drug (ISIS 703802) administration and/or exposure suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely (For reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be grouped together with Not Related) • Not Related: The event can be readily explained by the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug 9.4.3.2 Severity The severity of AEs and SAEs will be graded based on criteria from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, June 2010 (refer to Appendix D) . Any AE not listed in Appendix D will be graded as follows: • Mild: The event is easily tolerated by the subject and does not affect the subject’s usual daily activities • Moderate: The event causes the subject more discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual daily activities • Severe: The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual daily activities If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria must be indicated (criteria listed in Section 9.3.3) ."

Treatment should also be recorded on the concomitant treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate . 9.4.3.5 Outcome of the Adverse Event If the event is a non-serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following: AE Persists: Subject terminates from the trial and the AE continues : • Recovered: Subject recovered completely from the AE • Became Serious: The event became serious (the date that the event became serious should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the corresponding SAE) • Change in Severity (if applicable): AE severity changed If the event is an SAE , then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following: Ongoing: SAE continuing: • Persists (as non-serious AE): Subject has not fully recovered but the event no longer meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non-serious AE eCRF (the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE) • Recovered: Subject recovered completely from the SAE (the date of recovery should be entered as the SAE resolution date) • Fatal: Subject died (the date of death should be ente red as the SAE resolution date) 9.5 Procedures for Handling Special Situations 9.5.1 Abnormalities of Laboratory Tests Clinically-significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opinion of the Investigator, constitute or be associated with an AE. Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment (e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia,"
62,page_62,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 09 November 2017 61 tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia). Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs. Clinically-significant abnormalities will be monitored by the Investigator until the parameter returns to its baseline value or until agreement is reached between the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor. Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically-significant (NCS) by the Investigator should not be reported as AEs. Similarly, laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs by the Investigator should not be deemed NCS on the laboratory sheet. The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports. The signed clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents and should include the Investigator’s assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values. All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the patient could be approaching the dose interruption rule of 75,000/mm 3 as specified in Section 8.6.3. Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Sections 9.3.3.1 and 9.4.1) . All results of liver function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules per Section 8.6.1. All results of renal function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules per Section 8.6.2. 9.5.2 Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized; the Study Center must document all of the following: • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate in the Study • The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion of the Investigator between the subject’s consent to participate in the Study and the timing of the procedure or treatment • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole reason for the intervention or hospital admission 9.5.3 Dosing Errors Study Drug (ISIS 703802) errors should be documented as Protocol Deviations. A brief description should be provided in the deviation, including whether the subject was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional. Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing eCRF . If the subject takes a dose of Study Drug that exceeds protocol specifications and the subject is symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an"

Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the Guidance to Investigator’s section of the Investigator’s Brochure and contact the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours. 9.5.4 Contraception and Pregnancy Subjects must continue to use appropriate contraception with their partners, or refrain from sexual activity, as described in Section 6.3.1. If a subject becomes pregnant or a pregnancy is suspected, or if a male subject makes or believes that he has made someone pregnant during the Study, then the Study Center staff must be informed immediately. An Initial Pregnancy Form should be submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first learning of the occurrence of pregnancy. Follow-up information including delivery or termination is reported by designating as ‘Follow-up’ on the Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours. Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the subject’s responsibility. Female subjects: If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the Study (including follow-up), a pregnancy test will be performed. The subject with a confirmed pregnancy will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug. However, the subject will be encouraged to complete the post-treatment follow-up portion of the Study to the extent that study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy. Regardless of continued study participation, the study physician will assist the subject in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the pregnancy will be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth. Follow-up will be performed to the extent permitted by the applicable regulations and privacy considerations. Male subjects: The progress of the pregnancy of a male subject’s partner should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth. Follow-up will be performed to the extent permitted by the applicable regulations and privacy considerations. 10.

INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS 11.1 Informed Consent The written informed consent document should be prepared in the language(s) of the potential patient population, based on an English version provided by the Sponsor or designee. Before a subject’s participation in the trial, the Investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study and before any protocol-specific screening procedures or any Study Drug ISIS 703802 are administered. The subject or legally acceptable representative must be given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in the study. The acquisition of informed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal to notify his/her primary care physician should be documented in the subject’s medical records and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by the subject or a legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion (not necessarily an Investigator).

88,page_88,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Original Protocol 07 November 2017 87 Appendix E Mixed Meal T est At Baseline, 3 months and end of study, subjects enrolled will undergo a meal tolerance test (MTT) as follows: subjects will consume a standardized meal the evening before the test (750 kcal; 20% of energy from protein, 30% from fat, and 50% from carbohydrate) and refrain from consuming alcohol for 72 h. A cannula will be inserted into a forearm vein, and an overnight fasting venous blood sample will be taken between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM for measurement of plasma glucose, FFA, C-peptide and insulin concentrations and serum ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, and PYY. Incretin hormones will be measured using a multiplex assay (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The tubes for the incretin hormones will contain Pefabloc SC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and DPP- IV inhibitor (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) to inhibit DPP-IV and other proteases. The change in ratings from Baseline will be quantified. Subjects will then consume a liquid load of Optifast (Optifast; Novartis, Minneapolis, MN; 474 ml, 320 kcal, 50% carbohydrate, 35% protein, 15% fa t) within a 15-min period. Additional blood samples will be taken at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 min after meal consumption. VAS will be completed at 180 minutes and 300 min. To calculate the insulin sensitivity index (S I), the oral minimal model for glucose will be used; and to calculate the hepatic insulin extraction, oral minimal model for insulin and c-peptide will be used [Cobelli et al, 2007; Cobelli et al, 2005]. Subjects will complete a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire to assess subjective hunger at 0, 180 and 300 minutes [Luscombe-Marsh et al, 2005; Moran et al, 2005]."

The following administrative updates have been made: Akcea Therapeutics, Inc. now appears as the Sponsor and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. now appears as the Collaborator; ISIS 703802- CS05 is being updated to ISIS 703802- CS5. In addition, the reference list has been upda ted. The tables being updated are not shown in this summary of changes. Finally, minor updates noted as inconsistencies have been made throughout the document. Note that language in the Was section that is being deleted appears as strikethrough and new lan guage in the Update section appears as bold: 1. Synopsis and Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria number 6 Was: 6. History of heart failure with New York Heart Association functional classification (NYHA) greater than Class II or unstable congestive cardiac failure requiring a change in medication Update: 6.

For subjects who are already on a stable diet and are known to the site, the diet stabilization period can be omitted and subject can mo ve directly to qualification. Update: Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4- week diet run-in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured . MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver fat content. Section 3.1 Study Design end of paragraph two Was: At the qualification visit TGs will be measured to qualify and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Update: At the qualification visit TGs will be measured. MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Section 3.4.1 Screening/Qualification end of paragraph one Was: At the qualification visit subjects will have a baseline DEXA scan and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Update: At the qualification visit TGs will be measured . A baseline DEXA scan and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content once all other eligibility has been confirmed . MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Section 6.1.1 Screening/Qualification end of paragraph three Was: At the qualification visit TGs will be measured and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Update: At the qualification visit TGs will be measured. MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Section 6.2.6 MRI Was: An MRI to determine liver fat fraction will be done at Qualification , Week 13 and Week 27."
99,page_99,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 11 Update: An MRI to determine liver fat fraction will be done during Screening after all other eligibility criteria are met , and again at Week 13 and Week 27. Appendix A Footnote d Was: d MRI and DEXA scan will only be performed after subjects have met initial screening eligibility . MRI and DEXA scan should be performed as close to anticipated Day 1 date as possible and to allow time for result reporting and analysis. Update: d MR I and DEXA scan will only be performed during Screening after all other eligibility criteria are met . MRI should be performed 10 days (+/ - 2 days) prior to anticipated Day 1 date to allow time for result reporting and analysis . DEXA scan should be perfor med as close to anticipated Day 1 date as possible. Rationale: The MRI and DEXA scan should be performed after all other eligibility criteria are met and as close to day 1 as possible, allowing for sufficient time to turn around results. 3. Section 4 Subject Enrollment A. Was: Subjects must sign the consent form before any screening tests or assessments are performed. At the time of consent, the subject will be considered enrolled into the Study and will be assigned a unique subject identification number before any study procedures, including screening procedures, are performed. A. Update: Subjects must sign the consent form before any screening tests or assessments are performed. At the time of consent, the subject will be considered screened into the Study and will be assigned a unique subject identification number before any study procedures, including screening procedures, are performed. B. Was: Subjects will be registered after all screening assessments have been completed and after the Investigator has verified that they are eligible per criteria in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. No subject may begin treatment prior to assignment of a unique subject identification number. B.

Rationale: These changes are meant to clarify screening and enrollment into the st udy. 4. Section 6.2 Study/Laboratory Assessments paragraph eight Was: All lab samples sent to the central laboratory are received on the next day and processed. Lab Alerts issued as per protocol safety monitoring requirements or stopping rules will indicate the applicable protocol section to facilitate review and will be immediately and simultaneously sent by email to the Investigator, the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors, the Sponsor Drug Safety Physician, and the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), and should be received by them within 2 days from sample collection. Hematology results from the site’s local laboratories are received by the study ce nter staff on the day of sample collection , and should be entered as soon as possible into the eCRF to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring teams. Update: All lab samples are to be sent to the central laboratory by overnight courier and processed. Lab Alerts issued as per protocol safety monitoring requirements or stopping rules will indicate the applicable protocol section to facilitate review and will be immediately and simultaneously sent by email to the Investigator, the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors, the Sponsor Drug Safety Physician, and the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), and should be received by them within 2 days from sample collection. Hematology results from the site’s local laboratories are received by the study center staff per the local laboratory’s standard reporting time, and should be entered as soon as possible into the eCRF to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring teams. Rationale: There could be reasons why samples sent to the central lab are not rece ived the following day. The local laboratory will provide results on specimens tested within its standard timeframe. 5. The following changes have been made to several sections with respect to renal function Section 8.5.2 Safety Monitoring for Renal Function paragraph three and six A. Was: While on treatment during the course of the study, urinary surveillance may include urinalysis to include urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) and urinary red blood cells (RBCs), as wel l as serum creatinine and cystatin -C to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which will be monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3 -months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. In addition, other biomarkers of acute renal injury m ay also be measured if a safety signal is seen that warrants further testing. (Appendix B ). A.

In a ddition, other biomarkers of acute renal injury may also be measured if a safety signal is seen that warrants further testing. (Appendix B ). B. Was: Lab alerts for abnormal renal tests will be issued for: Creatinine clearance (by CK D-EPI formula) decrease from Baseline > 25%, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) > 250 mg/g, urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 0.5 mg/mg, or an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline > 0.3 mg/dL). B. Update: Lab alerts for abnormal renal tests wil l be issued for: eGFR (by CKD -EPI formula) decrease from Baseline > 25%, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) > 250 mg/g, urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 0.5 mg/mg, or an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline > 0.3 mg/dL). Section 8.6.2 Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results/Temporary Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results Was: In the event of an estimated creatinine clearance (by CKD -EPI formula) meeting any of the following criteria, or any change in renal biomarkers deemed by the nephrologist to require further evaluation, a serum creatinine and 24 -hour urine sample for creatinine clearance and protein should be obtained: 1. CKD-EPI decrease of > 40% from Baseline 2. CKD-EPI value < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Update: In the event of an eGFR (by CKD -EPI formula) meeting any of the following criteria, or any change in renal biomarkers deemed by the nephrologist to require further evaluation, a serum creatinine and 24-hour urine sample for creatinine clearance and protein should be obtained: 1. eGFR ( CKD -EPI) decrease of > 40% from Baseline 2. eGFR ( CKD -EPI) value < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Synopsis and Section 5.2 Exclusion Criteria number 8 paragraph b Was: Estimated GFR ˂ 60 mL/min (as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD -EPI) Equation for creatinine clearance Update: Estimated GFR ˂ 60 mL/min /1.73 m2 (as determined by the Chronic Kidney Disease- Epidemiological Collaboration (CKD -EPI) Equation"
102,page_102,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 14 Rationale: These changes are made to consistently identify estimated glomerular filtration rate as measured by CKD- EPI formula and avoid confusion with creatinine clearance in the protocol. 6. The following changes have been made to several sections with respect to platelet monitoring Section 8.5.3 Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results paragraph three and six A. Was: Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor. A. Update: Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator should refer the subject to a hematologist to provide diagnostic and therapeutic management. B. Was: In the event of a platelet count ˂ 100,000/mm3 the laboratory tests outlined in Table 3, should be performed as soon as possible. Additional lab tests will be determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee in consultation with the Investigator. B. Update: In the event of a platelet count ˂ 100,000/mm3, the laboratory tests outlined in Table 3 should be performed as soon as possible. In addition to action taken as outlin ed in Table 3 , in the event of a platelet count <100,000/mm3, tests outlined in Appendix F should be performed as soon as possible. Additional lab tests, if warranted , will be determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee in consultation with the Investigator. Section 8.6.3 Stopping Rule for Platelet Count Results The greater than or equal sign ( >) has been added to a couple of places in the fourth paragraph in order to align with updates in Table 3. In addition, paragraph six: Was: Once a subject commences weekly monitoring, this frequency of monitoring should continue irrespective of whether the platelet count rises into the normal range. Update: Once a subject commences weekly monitoring, this frequency of monitoring should continue until the platelet count returns to the normal range ( >140,000/mm3) for 2 successive values."
103,page_103,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 15 Table 3 Actions in Subjects with Low Platelet Count during Treatment or Post -Treatment Period Was: Footnote: Once a subject commences weekly monitoring this frequency of monitoring should continue irrespective of whether the platelet count rises into the normal range. Update: Footnote: Once a subject commences weekly monitoring this frequency of monitoring should continue until the platelet count returns to the normal range ( > 140,000/mm3) for 2 successive values. Rationale: Several changes have been made to Table 3 in order to clarify normal ranges, to clarify the need to refer Grade 3 and 4 low platelet counts to a hematologist and to clarify when to start and when to discontinue weekly platelet monitoring. Appendix F Addit ional testing for low platelet count Addition of a table outlining tests to be performed on patients that experience a single occurrence of platelets <100,000/mm 3. Rationale: Changes have been made in order to clarify normal ranges, to clarify the need to refer Grade 3 and 4 low platelet counts to a hematologist, and to clarify when to start and when to discontinue weekly platelet monitoring. These changes are expected to help better understand the reasons for platelet count reductions, were they to occur, and ensure close monitoring of subjects if a single platelet count reduction <100,000/mm 3 is observed. These changes are also expected to ensure continuity of safety monitorin g for subjects with a decreased platelet count. 7. Section 8.5.4 Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events and Section 8.6.3 Stopping Rule for Platelet Count Results These sections have been re -arranged in such a way that monitoring of bleeding events has been taken out of Section 8.6.3 and added to Section 8.5.4. The following has been deleted from Section 8.5.4 due to the redundancy resulting from the re- arrangement above: Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically - relevant, non- major bleeding events (which are defined in Section 8.6.3 ), for example, excess bruising, petechiae, or gingival bleeding on brushing teeth. If a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor and additional testing of coagulation parameters activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), INR, hepatic enzymes, bilirubin and platelet count may be performed. The following w as deleted from Section 8.5.4 to avoid protocol deviations: Patients will be instructed to promptly report any signs or symptoms of bleeding."
104,page_104,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 16 In addition, Section 8.5.4 has an additional phrase and sentence: Was: Subjects will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study Drug treatment (Day 1) Update: Subjects will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study Drug treatment (Day 1) up to the end of the follow -up period fo r all cohorts. All bleeding events are considered adverse events and reported on adverse event case report form. Rationale: Monitoring and the monitoring period have been clarified and clarification that bleeding events are to be considered adverse events has been added. 8. Section 8.5.6 Safety Monitoring for Hypoglycemia Was: The alert value for hypoglycemia is ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) plasma concentration. Severe Hypoglycemia Requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentrations may not be available during an event. Neurological recovery following plasma glucose levels returning to normal considered sufficient evidence that event was induced by low plasma glucose concentration. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms accompanied by measured plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia Not accompanied by typical hypoglycemia symptoms but with measured plasma glucose≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) . Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms not accompanied by plasma glucose determination but likely caused by plasma glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). A documented severe hypoglycemic event is defined as one in which the subject requires assistance of another person to obtain treatment for the event and has a plasma glucose level ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). The rescue treatmen t of hypoglycemia may include IV glucose or buccal or intramuscular glucagon."
105,page_105,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 17 Update: The alert value for hypoglycemia is ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) blood glucose concentration. Severe Hypoglycemia Requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Glucose concentrations may not be available during an event. Neurological recovery following glucose levels returning to normal considered sufficient evidence that event was induced by l ow glucose concentration. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms accompanied by measured blood glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L).

A documented severe hypoglycemic event is defined as one in which the subject requires assistance of another person to obtain treatment for the event and has a blood glucose level ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). The rescue treatment of hypoglycemia may include IV glucose or buccal or intramuscular gluc agon. Rationale: Determination of severe hypoglycemia can be measured by glucometer. Therefore, the language has been made more generic. 9. Section 8.5.7 Safety Monitoring for Documented Hyperglycemia A. Was: From baseline visit to Week 13 (including value at Week 13) of Randomized Treatment period: • FPG > 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) From Week 13 to Week 25/27/ET (including value at Week 25/27/ET) of Randomized Treatment period : • FPG > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) or • HbA1c > 9% (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c < 8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 1% from Baseline (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c ≥ 8%)"
106,page_106,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 18 In case of FPL/HbA1c above the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular th at: • Plasma glucose was actually measured in the fasting condition A. Update: From baseline visit to Week 13 (including value at Week 13) of Randomized Treatment period: • Blood glucose > 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) From Week 13 to Post-treatment Follow -up (Week 4, 8 and 13 post end of treatment period): • Blood glucose > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) or • HbA1c > 9% (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c < 8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 1% from Baseline (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c ≥ 8%) In case of blood glucose /HbA1c a bove the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that: • Blood glucose was actually measured in the fasting condition B. Was: If none from the above-mentioned reason can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue B. Update: If none from the above-mentioned reason can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease blood glu cose/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue Rationale: Monitoring for hyperglycemia did not include the post -treatment period. This change now incorporates that period. Fasting plasma glucose(FPG) has been updated to the more generic term “blood glucose ” for this section to allow for measurements made with a glucometer. 10. Follow -up Period Post -Treatment Section 3.4.3 Post-Treatment Was: Subjects are to return to the Study Center for fol low-up visits. These visits will take place at 4, 8 and 13 weeks after the last dose. Refer to Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A . Update: Subjects are to return to the Study Center for fol low-up visits. These visits will take p lace at 4, 8 and 13 weeks after the Treatment Period (last dose through one dosing interval post last dose). Refer to Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A ."
107,page_107,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 19 Section 6.1.3 Post- Treatment Period Was: Each subject will be followed for safety assessments for 13 weeks after the last dose of Study Drug. Update: Each subject will be followed for safety assessments for 13 weeks after the Treatment Period (last dose through one dosing interval post last dos e). Section 8.8.1 Follow -up Visits for Early Termination from Treatment Period or from Post -Treatment Follow-up Period Was: Any subject who discontinues early from the treatment period or from post- treatment follow -up period should be followed as per the platelet monitoring rules shown in, Section 8.6.3 for the first 6 weeks after discont inuing Study Drug. Following this period, if the platelet count is stable (at least 3 consecutive values that are stable as determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor and > 100,000/mm3), the next platelet count should be taken within at least 6 weeks so that subjects are monitored for at least 13 weeks after discontinuing Study Drug. Update: Any subject who discontinues early from the treatment period or from post- treatment follow -up period should be followed as per the platelet monitoring rules shown in Section 8.6.3 for the first 6 weeks after discontinuing Study Drug and then at 8 and 13 weeks post end of treatment period (as per visit schedule). Appendix A Schedule of Procedures and Appendix C PK Sampling Sche dule The follow -up period after treatment period has been clarified in both tables and a footnote has been added to both appendices. Rationale: The follow -up period is meant to start after the last dose through one dosing interval post last dose. The prior language could be interpreted to not include the dosing interval post last dose. 11. Section 9.4.1 Serious Adverse Events Was: In the interest o f subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs (regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the event. The collection o f SAEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the subject’s follow- up period . When the Investigator is reporting by telephone, it is important to speak to someone in person versus leaving a message. An Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be completed and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or designee."

The study dose of 20 mg (0.2 mL) of ISIS 703802 will be administered every week during the treatment period for a total of 26 weekly doses. All doses will be given by SC injection . Self -administration will be allowed after appropriate training of subject and/or caregiver. Rationale for Dose and S chedule Selection A 20 mg weekly dose was selected as being the lowest dose that provided maximum TG lowering of approximately 60%, based on the TG lowering effect of ISIS 703802 observed in healthy volunteers with elevated TGs. Adjustment of Dose or Treatment Schedule Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose and dose frequency may be allowed for safety or tolerability after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor . Study Visit Schedule and Procedures Detailed information regarding the study procedures are outlined in Section 6 , Appendices A and C. The study for an individual subject will generally consist of the following periods: • An up to 6-week Screening period, including a 4-week diet stabilization phase for subjects not already on a stable diet • A 26-week treatment period during which Study Drug will be administered weekly by SC injection • A 13-week post -treatment follow -up period During the Screening period, subject will be advised to maintain diet and exercise routines, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). As part of the Screening period, subjects may have 4 weeks of diet run-in and final eligibility will be determined during qualification . Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4-week diet run- in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured. MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver fat content. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at Screening and having a qualifying MRI, defined as having at least 6.4% liver fat assessed by MRI -PDFF (via central reviewer) will return to the clinic on Day 1. In addition, TG will be measured at qualification and results of TG and MRI must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Blood and urine samples will be collected regularly throughout the study for safety, efficacy, and PK analysis. Appendix B shows a list of analytes required for the study and Appendix C details the PK sample schedules. The Mixed Meal Test (MMT) will be done at Baseline , at week 13 and at week 27. This test consists of having the subject cons ume a standardized meal in the evening and fast overnight for at least 8 hours. The following morning, before the test , fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids ( FFA), C-peptide, insulin, serum ghrelin, GIP, GLP -1 and PYY as well as incretin hormones are measured . The subject then consumes a liquid standard meal (such as Optifast®) and the same metabolic parameters are measured again over the course of 300 minutes at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300"

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Overview of D isease Lipodystrophy syndromes are a group of rare metabolic diseases characterized by selective loss of adipose tissue that leads to ectopic fat deposition in liver and muscle and the development of insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipidemia and fatty liver disease (Garg 2004 ; Chan and Oral 2010; Garg et al. 2011; Shulman et al. 2014). These syndromes are categorized according to the distribution of fat loss into generalized or partial and according to the underlying etiology as inherited or acquired ( Garg 2004; Chan and Oral 2010 ; Garg et al. 2011). These syndromes constitute a significant medical unmet need as these patients are refractory to current therapies, mainly used to treat diabetes and elevated TG levels, in an attempt to reduce the risk of serious associated complications (coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy, c irrhosis and pancreatitis). As such, in February 2014, the FDA approved Myalept (metreleptin) as replacement therapy to treat the complications of leptin deficiency in addition to diet in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. The safety and effectiveness of Myalept was evaluated in 2 open -label studies conducted at the NIH, which included 72 patients (48 with generalized lipodystrophy and 24 with partial lipodystrophy [PL]) with diabetes, high TG, and elevated levels of fasting insulin. The best results were achieved in patients with generalized lipodystrophy who had low leptin levels (mean [SD]: 1.3 [1.1] ng/mL), while patients with partial lipodystrophy who had a wider range of baseline leptin values (mean [SD]: 4.9 [3.1] ng/mL) had a more varied and attenuated response. Because of the risks associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies and lymphoma, Myalept is available only through a risk"
121,page_121,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 33 evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program, which requires prescriber and pharmacy certification and special documentation ( Chan et al. 2011; Myalept PI). At the present time, the Sponsor does not intend to study the generalized forms for which a specific therapy exists (metreleptin) nor the acqu ired forms of the partial lipodystrophy disorders because of the heterogeneity of etiologies, some iatrogenic, and the high incidence of associated immune disorders in these populations. Therefore, this study will focus only on patients with the congenita l form of the partial lipodystrophy disorders and, among those, on the most severe subtype, patients with familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Familial Partial Lipodystrophy (FPL) is an orphan disease for which no specific pharmacologic treatment currently exists. FPL was described in the 1970s independently by Köbberling and Dunnigan (Dunnigan et al. 1974; Köbberling et al. 1975 ), and is the most common subtype of inherited PL ( National Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD] 2012 ). It has been estimated that FPL affects approximately 0.2 in 10,000 people in the European Union, which is equivalent to a total of around 10,000 people (Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products 2012 ). FPL encompasses several subtypes differentiated by the underlying genetic mutation (6 FPL subtypes and mutations in 5 genes have been identified). FPL type 1, Köbberling variety has been reported in a handful of individuals and its molecular basis is unknown. FPL type 2, Dunnigan variety is the most common form and the most well characterized disor der and is due to missense mutations in the A and C LMNA gene. FPL type 3 has been reported in 30 patients and is due to mutations in the PPAR γ gene. FPL type 4 has been reported in 5 patients and is due to mutations in the PLIN1 gene. FPL type 5 has been reported in 4 members of a family who presented with insulin resistance and diabetes and is due to mutations in the AKT2 gene. The last subtype, Autosomal Recessive FPL has been identified recently in 1 patient with homozygous mutations in CIDEC. Some individuals with FPL do not have mutations in any of these genes, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified genes can cause the disorder (Hegele et al. 2007 ; Garg et al. 2011 ; National Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD] 2012 ). The diagnosis of FPL is mainly clinical and needs to be considered in patients presenting with the triad of insulin resistance (with or without overt diabetes), sig nificant dyslipidemia in the form of hypertriglyceridemia, and fatty liver (Huang-Doran et al. 2010) . Patients often present with diabetes and severe insulin resistance requiring high doses of insulin. Other evidence of severe insulin resistance is provided by the presence of acanthosis nigricans and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (with symptoms like hyperandrogenism and oligomenorrhea). Some patients develop severe hypertriglyceridemia resulting in episodes of pancreatitis. In many patients, the TG levels remain persistently elevated despite fully optimized therapy or diet modifications. Radiogra phic evidence of hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis with hepatomegaly and/or elevated transaminases is common (Handelsman et al. 2013 ). Patients with the Dunnigan variety have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (Hegele 2001 ). Although very rare, patients with a specific mutation in the LMNA gene are at an increased risk of cardiomyopathy and its associated complications, congestive heart failure and conduction defects. There is limite d natural history data, mostly cross-sectional and derived from publication of baseline characteristics of patients entering a clinical trial (Diker -Cohen CE et al. 2015 ; Ajluni N et al. 2016 ; Akinci B et al. 2017 ; Ahm ad Z et al. 2013; Bidault G. et al. 2013) . The evidence that FPL progresses over time comes from a prospective, open-label NIH study with ongoing enrollment since 2000 (N = 87). Data analyzed in 2014 showed that metabolic manifestations of the cohort of 32 partial lipodystrophy patients (including 25 FPL) were as severe as those of the cohort of generalized lipodystrophy (N = 55), which is recognized as a more severe form of lipodystrophy ( Diker -Cohen CE et al. 2015 )."
122,page_122,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 34 Patients with FPL have both a partial loss and maldistribution of adipose tissue leading to their di stinct phenotype. In many of these patients mutations in proteins involved in adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid uptake by adipocytes, triglyceride synthesis, or lipid droplet formation have been identified (Garg et al. 2011, Handelsman et al. 2013) . Due to this severe dysfunction of adipose tissue FPL patients have much lower TG storage capacity than patients with hypertriglyceridemia without FPL, highlighting the importance of TGs in the pathophysiology of FPL. Plasma TG levels in FPL patients varied across studies from mean (25 -75 percentile) 483 mg/dL (232, 856) (Diker -Cohen CE et al. 2015) , median (25-75 percentile) 342 mg/dL (279, 801) (Akinci B et al. 2017 ), mean 383 mg/dL ( Bidault G et al. 2013 ), median 389 mg/dL (155-3455) ( Ahm ad Z et al. 2013) and mean 1058 mg/dL ( Ajluni N et al. 2016 ). It is estimated that 1/4 to 1/5 of patients with FPL may have TG levels > 500 mg/dL. Due to inability of adipose tissue to accommodate excess TGs, TGs are deposited in higher amounts in organs other than adipose tissue that are less well adapted to excess lipid storage (“ectopic fat”) (Garg et al. 2011, Handelsman et al. 2013; Robbins et al. 2015 ; Nolis 2014 ; Huang- Dora n et al. 2010 ). This ectopic fat accumulation has been found in and around many organs and is most clearly associated with metabolic abnormalities in the liver, pancreas and skeletal muscle contributing to severe insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia and increased risk of pancreatitis, non - alcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis (Robbins et al. 2015; Nolis 2014 ; Huang-Doran et al. 2010; Vatier et al. 2013; Sleigh A et al. 2012). Careful clinical assessment of fat distribution through visual and physical examination can confirm the diagnosis. Patients with FPL have reduced subcutaneous fat in the limbs and truncal regions and may have excess subcutaneous fat deposition in neck, fa ce and intra-abdominal regions. Patients with the Dunnigan variety have normal body fat distribution in childhood and gradually lose subcutaneous fat from the extremities and trunk around the time of puberty. In women, the loss of fat may be most striking in the buttocks and hips. At the same time these patients accumulate fat on the face (“double chin”), neck and upper back (“Cushingoid appearance with buffalo hump”). The extent of adipose tissue loss usually determines the severity of the metabolic abnormalities. Patients display prominent muscularity and phlebomegaly (enlarged veins) in the extremities and complain of disproportionate hyperphagia. The condition in females is more easily recognized than in men, and so is reported more often. Patient s may also have a family history of similar physical appearance and/or fat loss. Genetic testing, when available, is confirmatory. (Hegele et al. 2007 ; Huang -Dora n et al. 2010; Garg et al. 2011). Current treatment includes lifestyle modification such as reducing caloric intake and increasing energy expenditure via exercise. Conventional therapies used to treat severe insulin resistance (metf ormin, thiazolidinediones, Glucagon- like peptide 1s [GLP -1], insulin), and/or high TGs (dietary fat restriction, fibrates, fish oils) are not very efficacious in these patients (Chan and Oral 2010). Familial Partial Lipodystroph y is an ultra -orphan indication for which there is a significant unmet medical need. Diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and hypertriglyceridemia associated with this condition can lead to serious complications (Handelsman et al. 2013 ) such as: • Acute pancreatitis, especially when triglyceride levels are > 1,000 mg/dL • Accelerated microvascular complications from uncontrolled diabetes • Accelerated cardiovascular disease from lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance"
123,page_123,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 35 • Steatohepatitis that can progress to cirrhosis and an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma • Proteinuric nephropathies which can progress to end stage renal disease In patients with Generalized Lipodystrophy the metabolic complications are partially re lated to leptin deficiency, and can be ameliorated in part by leptin replacement. However, leptin deficiency alone cannot explain the severity of metabolic disease in patients with PL who have variable leptin levels. By reducing ANGPTL3 and TG levels, I SIS 703802 may improve the metabolic profile of patients with FPL and reduce their risk of acute pancreatitis. In addition, reductions in TG could improve hepatic steatosis and reduce cirrhosis risk. Furthermore, this mechanism may also improve insulin se nsitivity in these patients and potentially lead to a reduction in the complications associated with diabetes. 2.2 T herapeutic Rationale In humans, loss of function mutations within the ANGPTL3 gene give rise to familial combined hypolipidemia (FHBL2), characterized by low plasma levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL -C, and HDL -C (Minicocci et al. 2012 ). Homozygous individuals with complete ANGPTL3 deficiency showed the full combined hypolipidemic phe notype while individuals with more partial ANGPTL3 deficiency showed a more attenuated phenotype. Of note, FHBL2 homozygous were not affected by diabetes, showed lower plasma levels of insulin and lower degree of insulin resistance as estimated by HOMA -IR (Robciuc et al. 2013). ANGPTL3 protein is produced exclusively in liver, where its expression is downregulated by leptin and insulin (Inukai et al. 2004 ). Hepatic specific knock -down of ANGPTL3 mRNA is associated with reduction in plasma triglycerides due to increased lipoprotein lipase activity as well as decreased hepatic VLDL triglyceride secretion. Because ANGPTL3 is produced by the liver only, which does not express LPL, it is thought to function as an endocrine rather than paracrine factor with insulin sensitizing effects that go beyond the liver. In fact, insulin sensitization has been shown in patients with ANGPTL3 gene mutations as well as in ANGPTL3 -deficient mice, in which increased uptake of fatty acids into o xidative tissues such as muscle and brown adipose tissue led to decreased uptake of fatty acids and increased uptake of glucose in white adipose tissue (Wang et al. 2015) . Suppression of hepatic ANGPTL3 protein production in mi ce resulted in significant reductions in levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, non -HDL cholesterol, and VLDL cholesterol and these favorable effects were associated with decreased liver triglyceride content, increases in insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in atherosclerosis progression (Graham et al. 2017 ). Treatment with ISIS 703802 would be expected to lower the hepatic expression of ANGPTL3 protein and result in lowering of the levels of triglyceride -rich lipoproteins and LDL- C, increased HDL -C, improved glycemic control and ameliorated insulin resistance in T2DM patients, leading to decreas ed liver fat content in NAFLD and ultimately, reduced overall risk of coronary artery disease. 2.3 ISIS 703802 2.3.1 Mechanism of Action ISIS 703802 is a second -generation ASO drug targeted to ANGPTL3 that has been covalently bonded to triantennary N -acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc), a high -affinity ligand for the hepatocyte -specific asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) to f orm an ASO- GalNAc conjugate. This GalNAc-conjugate approach results in enhanced ASO delivery to hepatocytes versus non -parenchymal cells and has"
124,page_124,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 36 increased ASO potency by approximately 10- fold in mice (Prakash et al. 2014 ). The ASO portion of ISIS 703802 is complementary to a region within the ANGPTL3 messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) (mRNA) coding sequence, and binds to the mRNA via Watson and Crick base pairing. The hybridization (binding) of ISIS 703802 to the cognate mRNA results in the Ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) -mediated degradation of the ANGPTL3 mRNA, thus preventing production of the ANGPTL3 protein. Maximal antisense- mediated reduction of target mRNA levels is typically greater than 90% of control levels in sensitive tissues ( Crooke and Bennett 1996; Zhang et al. 2010) . Furthermore, reduction in target mRNA levels using this approach correlates directly with a subsequent reduction in target protein levels. 2.3.2 Chemistry Chemically, ISIS 703802 is a synthetic oligomer of 20 nucleotides (i.e., a 20- mer) that are connected sequentially by phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages (mixed backbone design). The mixed backbone design reduces the total number of phosphorothioate linkages in the MOE -modified regions, which reduces non-specific interactions with proteins and further enhances potency of GalNAc conjugated ASOs. The nucleotide sequence of ISIS 703802 (Figure 1 ) is complementary to a 20- nucleotide stretch within Exon 6 of the ANGPTL3 mRNA coding sequence at position 1169-1188 bp. Structurally, the oligonucleotide has 4 regions. Two (2) of them, the 5 nucleotides at the 5′ end and the 5 nucleotides at the 3′ end, are composed of 2′- O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2′- MOE) -modified ribonucleotides. These MOE -modified nucleotides confer (1) increased affinity for the target mRNA (Altmann et al. 1996 ; McKay et al. 1999) , (2) increased resistance to exonucleases and endonucleases (thereby increasing stability in tissue) (Geary et al. 2003) , and (3) amelioration of some of the high do se toxicities thereby resulting in an improved safety profile compared to first g eneration antisense drugs containing phosphorothioate modified oligodeoxynucleotides (DNA) ( Henry et al. 2000 ). The third region, the central portion of the oligonucleotide, is composed of 10 oligodeoxynucleotides. This chimeric design is called a MOE -Gapmer, and ISIS 703802 employs this chimeric structure to enable use of the RNase H1 mechanism for antisense activity. This is because while the 2 ′-MOE modification confers increased stability and affinity, it does not support RNase H1 catalyzed cleavage of RNA hybridized to 2′- MOE - modified nucleotides ( McKay et al. 1999 ). This is caused by conformational changes induced in the heteroduplex by 2′- alkoxy:RNA hybrids that are not recognized by RNase H enzymes (Inoue et al. 1987; Monia et al. 1993 ). By limiting the 2′-MOE modification to nucleotides flanking the phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide core, the beneficial attributes of the 2′- MOE chemistry are preserved while also retaining RNase H1 recognition. The fourth region is comprised of a triantennary cluster of N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) sugars which is linked to the 5ʹ end of ISIS 703802 via a phosphodiester linkage. The GalNAc cluster is a high affinity ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a receptor expressed primarily on the surface of liver hepatocytes (Stockert 1995) . The GalNAc cluster enhances delivery of ISIS 703802 to liver hepatocytes over other cell types and enhances potency. After internalization into cells, the GalNAc cluster is metabolized to release ‘free ASO’ inside the cell (Prakash et al. 2014)."

A summary is included below. 2.3.3.1 Preclinical Pharmacology The pharmacology of ANGPTL3 ASOs has been examined in multiple in vitro cell lines where specific and dose-dependent reduction of ANGPTL3 mRNA and protein was clearly demonstrated, resulting in reductions in apoB secreted protein. The pharmacology of ISIS 563580, an unconjugated 2′- MOE modified ASO that has the same base sequence as ISIS 703802, at doses higher than planned for ISIS 703802. ISIS 563580 has been explored in human ANGPTL3 transgenic mice, wherein liver mRNA and plasma ANGPTL3 protein levels were reduced upon treatment with ISIS 563580. Reductions in murine ANGPTL3 mRNA and protein were routinely observed in all mouse models treated with a murine-specific ANGPTL3 ASO. Pharmacology studies were done with Ldlr-/- mice fed a hypercholesterolemic diet known to develop elevated LDL- C, TG, and atherosclerosis, as well as features of metabolic syndrome (hyper glycemia and hyperinsulinemia) (Huszar et al. 2000 ; Schreyer et al. 2002 ; Tsuchiya et al. 2012) . Treatment of mice with a murine- specific ANGPTL3 ASO resulted in improvement in all of the aforementioned lipid and metabolic endpoints compared to controls. In all mouse models tested, total plasma cholesterol, LDL -C, TG, and non- esterified fatty acids (NEFA) have been shown to be consistently reduced upon treatment with ANGPTL3 ASOs, while HDL -C is modestly decreased in wild type mice ( - 22%), and either stable or increased in others. While a clear mechanistic understanding of HDL- C reductions has not been elucidated, results from in vitro reverse cholesterol transport assays suggest that HDL function is maintained. Administration of ISIS 703802, a human specific, GalNAc conjugated, ANGPTL3 ASO, to human ANGPTL3 transgenic mice led to significant, dose-dependent reductions in hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA. In diet challenged mice, administration of ISIS 731875, a mouse- specific and GalNAc-modified ASO targeting ANGPTL3, led to dose-dependent reductions in both hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA and plasma 2′-MOE 2′-MOE 2′-Deoxy GalNAc = THA -GalNAc cluster 2′-MOE = 2 ′-methoxylethyl RNA 2′-Deoxy = DNA s = phosphorothioate linkage o = phosphodiester linkage (RNase H1 sensitive) GalNAc GsGoAoCoAo TsTsGsCsCsAsGsTsAsAs ToCoGsCsA"

Importantly, the potency and the lipid-lowering effects of the ANGPTL3 ASO were independent of diet. Finally, administration of a mouse- specific ANGPTL3 ASO to western diet fed Ldlr-/-, a mouse model of FH, also led to significant reductions in hepatic ANGPTL3 mRNA and plasma ANGPTL3 protein with concomitant reductions in plasma TG and LDL- C that were similar to what was observed in wild type western diet fed mice, indicating that the a bsence of Ldlr does not affect the ASOs potency or lipid - lowering effects. This suggests that administration of ANGPTL3 ASO administration is a promising target for clinical study in familial hypercholesterolemia patients. While formal pharmacology studies have not been conducted in the monkey with the human ANGPTL3 ASO, hepatic mRNA expression has been shown to be reduced by more than 60% in cynomolgus monkeys, the same model used to conduct the toxicology evaluation. 2.3.3.2 Preclinical Toxicology Genera l toxicology studies for ISIS 703802 consisted of sub- chronic (16-week) and chronic (26- or 39- week) toxicity studies CD -1 in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Since ISIS 703802 is not fully complementary to the mouse ANGPTL3 transcript, treatment group receiving a mouse- specific inhibitor (ISIS 731875) was also included in the mouse study. Please refer to the Investigator Brochure for a detailed description of the preclinical toxicology and pharmacokinetics with ISIS 703802. Pharmacokinetic data confirmed con tinuous and dose -dependent exposure to ISIS 703802. An estimated liver and plasma terminal elimination half -life values of approximately 1 week and 3 -4 weeks for 2 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg, respectively, were observed in monkeys. The most noteworthy findings observed in mice and monkeys following ISIS 703802 treatment were, in general, non- specific class effects related to the uptake and accumulation of ASO and no toxicologically relevant findings were considered related to the pharmacologic inhibition of hepat ic ANGPTL3 expression, either with the present series of studies or with the former development candidate targeting ANGPTL3. There were no test -article related changes in PLT count in either mouse or monkey in both sub-chronic and chronic studies. The most noteworthy finding in the monkey was the kidney alteration (hypoalbuminemia and proteinuria) seen in one early -sacrifice animal from the 16 -week study at 35 mg/kg/week, a dose equivalent to at least ~190-fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical doses by plasma AUC. Non -dose dependent increases in renal protein excretion (up to 2.2 -fold in quantitative urine protein, protein/creatinine ratio or urine albumin) were also observed at 8 and/or 35 mg/kg/week (> ~30 to 190-fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical doses by plasma AUC ) at the 16- week scheduled terminal necropsy . However, Similar kidney alterations were not seen at the 6 -week interim at any doses or in the 39 -week chronic monkey study up to 12 mg/kg/week (> ~200-fold of the 20 mg weekly clinical dose by plasma AUC). Additional findings related to ASO liver accumulation included increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at ≥ 8 mg/kg/week in the 16- and 26- week mouse studies, and were correlated with individual hepatocyte necrosis (minimal to mild) in mouse liver. Those changes were most prominent in the high dose groups (50 and 24 mg/kg/week for the 16- and 26- week studies, respectively). Conversely, no changes in liver enzymes were observed in monkeys from the 39-week toxicity study up to 12 mg/kg/week. In the 16- week monkeys study, increase in ALT was only evident in one early- sacrifice animal at 35 mg/kg/week, and non -statistically significant increases in ALT (< 2-fold of the prestudy baseline) were also observed in the interim - and terminal- sacrifice animals at ≥ 8 mg/kg/week but showed no microscopic correlates or dose-dependency."
127,page_127,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 39 Given the spectrum and severity of the test article- related clinicopathologic alterations present in monkeys at do ses ≤ 12mg/kg/week (> ~100- fold of the 40 mg weekly clinical dose by plasma AUC) during the 39- week treatment phase, none would be regarded to represent an adverse effect (Dorato and Engelhardt 2005; Everds et al. 201 3). Considering the monkey to be the most relevant species, these data have characterized the safety profile and established appropriate therapeutic margins for the clinical evaluation of ISIS 703802 in humans. 2.3.4 Clinical Experience Detailed information concerning the clinical studies conducted with ISIS 703802 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. A summary is included below. The study drug, ISIS 703802, is being evaluated in Phase 1 in the clinical setting with single doses up to 120 mg and multiple doses up to 60 mg (once per week for 6 weeks). The parent drug ISIS 563580, an unconjugated 2′- MOE modified ASO that has the same base sequence as ISIS 703802, was also evaluated in a blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 study. An interim analysis of ISIS 703802 Phase 1 SAD/MAD Study (ISIS 703802-CS1) was performed in 44 subjects administered single ascending (20, 40 and 80 mg) or multiple ascending doses (10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/week for 6 weeks). Twelve participants were randomly assigned to single-dose groups (9 to active- agent dose groups and 3 to the placebo group) and 32 were randomly assigned to multiple-dose groups (24 to active-agent dose groups and 8 to the placebo group). The main endpoints of the study were saf ety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and changes in lipids and lipoproteins. After 6 weeks of treatment, persons in the multiple dose groups treated with ISIS 703802 had dose- dependent reductions in levels of ANGPTL3 protein (reductions of 46.6 to 84.5% from Baseline, P < 0.01 for all doses vs. placebo 1.6%) and in levels of triglycerides (reductions of 33.2 to 63.1% vs placebo 11.4%), LDL cholesterol (1.3 to 32.9% vs placebo 13.6%), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27.9 to 60.0% vs placebo 4.0%), non– high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (10.0 to 36.6% vs placebo 9.1%), apolipoprotein B (3.4 to 25.7% vs placebo 11.0%), and apolipoprotein C-III (18.9 to 58.8% vs placebo 3.1%). There were no serious adverse events documented during the trial. No protocol- defined injection -site reactions were reported . Of those participants who received the multiple -dose regimen, three reported headache (one who received placebo and two who received ISIS 703802) and three reported dizziness (two who received placebo and one who received ISIS 703802). There was no clinical evidence of prothrombotic effects, bleeding episodes, significant decreases in platelet count or thrombocytopenia, or significant changes in renal function. One subject in the 60 mg weekly dose cohort had an approximately 5 x ULN increase of ALT, without increase in bilirubin and a second subject had an ALT of 88 U/L on Day 36 post treatment which returned to normal range by Day 50 and remained normal until the end of the study. One subject in the 20 mg MAD group was lost to follow-up after 5 doses. There were no other discontinuations during the treatment period ( Graham et al. 2017 and data on file). The pharmacokinetics of ISIS 703802 evaluated in Study ISIS 703802-CS1 showed rapid absorption following SC administration, with median time to maximum plasma concentrations (T max) ranging from 1 to 6 hours. Similar T max values were observed at all dose levels. After reaching C max, plasma concentratio ns of ISIS 703802 declined in a multi-phasic fashion with a rapid disposition phase, followed by a slower elimination phase with terminal elimination half -life of 3 to 5 weeks. The peak (C max) and total exposure (AUC) after a single SC dose increased appr oximately dose proportionally from 20 to 40 mg, and greater than dose proportionally from 40 to 80 mg, suggesting more efficient tissue uptake at lower doses. After single and multiple SC doses in the range of 10 to 60 mg, the C max and AUC increased"
128,page_128,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 40 approximately dose proportionally. No accumulation based on C max or AUC was observed after 6 weekly doses. 2.3.4.1 ISIS 563580- CS1 Phase 1 SAD/MAD In a Phase 1 study, ISIS 563580-CS1, healthy volunteers received subcutaneous administration of ISIS 563580, an unconjugated 2′- MOE modified ASO that has the same base sequence as ISIS 703802, from 50 to 400 mg as a single dose, or 100 to 400 mg as multiple doses (8 doses in 36 days). Overall, the safety findings from this study suggest that ISIS 563580 was not associated with any safety concerns. There were 383 adverse events (AE) reported in the ISIS 563580-treated subjects of which 363 (95%) were mild in severity. For the multiple -dose subjects, the most common treatment- emergent adverse events were AEs at the injection site. There was 1 serious adverse event (SAE) in the study of periorbital cellulitis which was considered a medically important event by the Investigator and was also considered unlikely related to Study Drug by the Investigator. Together, the above suggest that ISIS 563580 was well-tolerated at the doses and regimen given, which exceed the dose levels and cumulative exposures to be tested in the current study. There were no clinically -relevant changes in laboratory assessments and the heparin dose of 80 U/kg was well -tolerated in support of the post-heparin procedures. ISIS 563580 produced dose-dependent reductions in plasma ANGPTL3 (up to 93%; group means up to 84%), TG (up to 63%; group means up to 49%) and TC (up to 46%; group means up to 28%) at Day 36 (Brandt et al. 2015). 2.4 Rationale for Dose and S chedule of Administration The Phase 1 program evaluated ISIS 703802 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg given weekly for 6 weeks that were found to be generally well -tolerated and to induce clinically -relevant reductions in lipid biomarkers. The dos e proposed for the present study will provide the equivalent drug exposure of 20 mg weekly (80 mg monthly) and is predicted (based on modelling of PK/PD data obtained in Phase 1 study) to result in mean reductions from Baseline in TGs of approximately 63% at steady -state. Safety data from the available chronic mouse (26 -week) and monkey (39-week) studies support once-weekly dosing for chronic administration. The No Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for ISIS 703802 in chronic monkey study was determined to be 12 mg/kg/wk. In healthy volunteers, 703802 achieved an equivalent reduction in ANGPTL3 plasma concentration to that of the unconjugated form, at approximately 1/10 th of the unconjugated ASO (ISIS 563580) dose (Brandt et al. 2015). 2.5 Benefit -Risk Assessment The current study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerance of ISIS 703 802 in patients with FPL. The dose selected is expected to substantially reduce ANGPTL3 and result in a reduction of triglyceride levels, reduction of fat content of the liver and improvement of glycemic control. We do not know if subjects participating in this study would necessarily benefit from the treatment. However, the increased understanding of the effects of ISIS 703802 in this population may potentially result in new treatment options that would ultimately benefit FPL patients . Due to the short duration of this trial any benefit observed is not expected to persist be yond the end of the study. 2.5.2 Risk Assessment The known potential risks to study participants associated with ISIS 703802 are elaborated on in the Guidance to Investigator section of the Investigator’s Brochure."
129,page_129,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 41 • In preclinical mouse studies, there were increases in ALT and AST and were correlated with increased incidence and/or severity of necrosis of individual hepatocytes (minimal to mild in severity). Those changes were most prominent in the high dose groups and showed no clear progression over time. No increases in liver enzymes were observed in monkeys from the 39 - week toxicity study up to 12 mg/kg/week (~200-fold of the 20 mg /week clinical dose by plasma AUC). In the 16-week monkey study, increase in ALT was only evident in 1 early- sacrifice animal at 35 mg/kg/week, no meaningful increase in ALT was observed in the schedule sacrificed animals. • In the Phase 1 study, there was no elevations in ALT at single dose cohorts up to 120 mg. In multiple dose cohorts, two out of six subjects in the 60 mg weekly dose cohort had a > 2 x ULN increase of ALT, without increase in bilirubin, which was considered a treatment related adverse event (AE) for one by Principal Investigator (PI). There were no other observed clinically significant changes in ALT an d liver function in Phase 1 human study ( data on file ). However, to evaluate and mitigate the potential for liver enzyme abnormalities, r egular liver chemistry monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6. • Injection site adverse events, while not considered safety issues, may affect the ability of the subject to tolerate dosing. Injection site adverse events are the most common side effects observed following SC administration of unconjugated 2′ -MOE ASOs and are dose and concentration dependent. Erythema is the most prevalent characteristic. Generally, these events are mild and reversible, resolve spontaneously and do not worsen with time. The histologic findings are consistent with a local inflammatory response. Subjects should be informed of the possibility of occurrence of injection site adverse events. Symptomatic interventions such as icing of the injection site or administration of NSAIDs prior to and/or after the SC dosing have been utilized. • Although no changes in platelet (PLT) counts have been observed in healthy volunteers, mouse or monkey in both sub-chronic and chronic studies with ISIS 703802, reductions in platelet counts to below the lower limit of normal have been observed after administration of other ASOs and some subjects have experienced severe thrombocytopenia following administration of unconjugated 2 ′-MOE ASOs. To evaluate and mitigate the potentia l for a reduction in PLT count, monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 (Safety Mon itoring Rules and Stopping Rules) . • No significant changes in serum creatinine, electrolytes, BUN, or urinalysis were reported from the interim analysis of the ongoing Phase 1 study (data on file). To evaluate and mitigate the potential for a reduction in renal function, since kidneys are an organ of high distribution for the studied ASO, monitoring and stopping rules are included in the study as specified in Sections 8.5 and 8.6 (Safety Monitoring Rules and Stopping Rules) . While the long term effects of reducing ANGPTL3 as a target with the study drug are not known at this time, there is evidence in literature in humans in whom ANGPTL3 is absent from plasma, due to homozygous or compound heterozygous ANGPTL3 mutations, present a pan-hypobetalipoproteinemia phenotype, with generalized and marked decreases (~50% to 70%) in all apoB-100 containing lipoproteins, including VLDL and LDL, as well as HDL. This clinical phenotype has been termed familial combined hypolipidemia or FHBL2 ( Romeo et al. 2009 ; Musunuru et al. 2010; Martin -Campos et al. 2012; Minicocci et al. 2012 ; Noto et al. 2012; Pisciotta et al. 2012 ; Wang et al. 2015). Clinical studies in FHBL2 suggest a trend toward low er glucose and insulin levels and reported decrease in"
130,page_130,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 42 VLDL. Remarkably, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are reportedly absent from those with homozygous FHBL2 and no adverse clinical phenotype has been reported to date. 2.5.3 Overall Assessment of Benefit: Risk ISIS 703802 has demonstrated the ability to reduce ANGPTL3, APOCIII, and TGs by greater than 60% and LDL-C by more than 30% in the Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of TG lowering in FPL p atients . This study will also investigate the potential of ISIS 703802 in improving the insulin resistance and glucose profile, and decreasing liver and visceral fat content in these patients. Although the subjects enrolled in this study will not derive long term benefits due to the short duration of the study, they may derive some short term benefit from improved metabolic health and dietary counselling. The information obtained in the course of this study is critical to further development of ISIS 703802 for FPL patients . The protocol identifies that potential risks associated with ISIS 703802 treatment will be mitigated by routine monitoring. Thus, exposure of subjects in this study is justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to the wider population of patients by continued development of ISIS 703802. 3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is a Phase 2 open -label multiple -dose study of approximately 3 subjects with FPL that will be treated with ISIS 703802. Initially, 3 subject will be enrolled, but enrollment could be increased to 6 subjects, based on safety profile and efficacy observations. Subjects will be evaluated f or study eligibility during Screening and Qualification , which takes place up to 6 weeks prior to Day 1 (the first day of Study Drug administration). During the Screening period, subjects will be advised to maintain routine diet, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). As part of the Screening period , following 4 weeks of diet run-in, subjects will have a qualification visit a nd final eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4- week diet run -in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured . MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during Screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver fat content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at qualificati on will return to the clinic on Day 1 for their first dose of ISIS 703802 by subcutaneous (SC) injection. During the treatment period subjects will receive ISIS 703802 (20 mg) administered every week for 26 weeks. Subjects will return regularly for outpatient visits throughout the treatment period according to the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A ). The primary safety and efficacy analysis time point is at Week 27. Subjects will then enter a 13 week Post -Treatment Follow -up Period and will return to the study center for outpatient evaluations according to the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ). Blood and urine samples will be collected regularly throughout the study for safety, efficacy, and PK analysis. Appendix B shows a list of analytes required for the study and Appendix C details the PK sample schedule."

Initially, 3 subject will be enro lled, but enrollment could be increased to 6 subjects, based on safety profile and efficacy observations. 3.4 Overall Study Duration and Follow -up The length of subjects’ participation in the study may be up to 45 weeks. This includes a n up to 6- week screening period, that includes a 4 -week diet stabilization / run -in period, a 2- week qualification period, a 26-week treatment period, and a 13- week post -treatment evaluation period. Subjects may be required to attend additional visits for monitoring of adverse events or abnormal investigation results. The frequency of additional monitoring will be determined by the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with the Investigator. 3.4.1 Screening /Qualification Subject eligibility for the study will be determ ined within 42 days/ 6 weeks prior to study entry. Potential subjects will report to the Study Center for screening assessments at specified intervals within the 6-week screening period as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A . As part of the screening period, subjects will have a 4 -week diet stabilization/run -in period followed by a up to 2- week qualification period. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4 -week diet run -in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured. A baseline DEXA scan and MRI will be obtained to assess liver fat content once all other eligibility has been confirmed . MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. 3.4.2 Treatment Eligible subjects will receive the first dose of study drug at the Study Center, at which time they will also be trained on self-administration of Study drug. Subsequent administrations of study drug may occur at home or in the Study Center. Eligible subjects will report to the Study Center for assessments at specified intervals throughout the 26 week treatment period as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A . 3.4.3 Post-Treatment Subjects are to return to the Study Center for follow-up visits. These visits will take place at 4, 8 and 13 weeks after the Treatment Period (last dose through one dosing interval post last dose) . Refer to Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A . 4. SUBJECT ENROL LMENT 4.1 Screening Before subjects may be enrolled into the Study, the Sponsor or designee requires a copy of the Study Center’s written independent ethics committee/institutional review board (IEC/IRB) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment material."

STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1 Study Schedule The study will consist of a Screening period, a Treatmen t period and a Post -treatment Follow -up period. These periods are described below. All required study procedures are outlined in Appendix A . 6.1.1 Screening /Qualification Written informed consent for the study will be obtained prior to the performance of any study- related procedures including screening procedures. A 6-week period is provided for completing screening assessments and determining subject eligibility for the study. During the screening period, subject will be advised to maintain diet and exercise routines, and remain on a stable regimen of diabetes and lipid medications (if they are already taking any). Subjects will undergo a medical history and physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and have blood and urine samples taken for clinical laboratory testing. Subjects will be screened for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Safety labs may be re- tested for determination of subject eligibility after consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. As part of the screening period, subjects not already on a stable diet will have 4 weeks of diet run-in, followed by a qualification visit, during which final eligibility assessments will be performed. Subjects on stable diet known to the investigator and followed at the site may go from Screening to qualification without a 4 -week diet run -in. At the qualification visit TGs will be measured . MRI and DEXA scan will be obtained during screening once all other eligibility criteria are met to assess liver f at content. MRI results must be available prior to registration and administration of the first dose of study drug. 6.1.2 Treatment Period Subjects will be managed on an outpatient basis. Safety and clinical laboratory evaluations as well as blood sampling for PK analysis will be performed periodically throughout the treatment period. Any AEs and concomitant medications will be recorded. Collection and measurement of vital signs, physical examination results, ECGs, clinical laboratory parameters (Appendix B ), ISIS 703802 plasma concentrations, immunogenicity, MRI, AEs and concomitant medication/procedure information will be performed according to the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A ."
137,page_137,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 49 6.1.3 Post-Treatment Period Each subject will be followed for safety assessments for 13 weeks after the Treatment Period (last dose through one dosing interval post last dose). During the post-treatment evaluation period, subjects will return to the Study Center for outpatient visits for safety and clinical laboratory evaluations. A ± 3- day excursion from the scheduled visit date is per mitted for this time period. 6.2 Study/Laboratory Assessments Laboratory analyte samples will be collected throughout the Study. A list of these analytes is contained in Appendix B . Blood chemistry and urine samples (excluding 24-hour urine collection) should be taken after fasting for at least 10 hours. During this time subjects can drink water and should ensure that they consume sufficient water to not become dehydrated. If tests are uninterpretable (e.g., due to clumping, hemolysis or quantity not sufficient) or missing, a repeat blood or urine specimen should be re-drawn as soon as possible (ideally within 1 week). While on treatment hematology samples will be collected every 14 days. Each time a hematology lab is drawn and sent to the central laboratory for analysis, an additional sample should be collected in parallel and analyzed locally. In the event that both the central and local samples are unreportable (e.g., due to hemolyzed or clumped blood samples), subject dosing cannot continue until another sample is repeated and determined not to have met a platelet stopping rule. If there is no reportable platelet count within 14 days of the last platelet count, the Investigator will contact the subject to hold dosing until a new platelet count is obtained and reviewed. While on treatment blood samples for liver function testing will also be collected every 14 days and sent to the central laboratory for analysis for the first 3 months of the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section 8.5.1. While on treatment blood and urine samples for renal function testing will also be collected every 14 days and sent to the central laboratory for analysis per for the first 3 months of the study treatment, and monthly thereafter during the Treatment Period per Section 8.5.2 . All lab samples are to be sent to the centr al laboratory by overnight courier and processed. Lab Alerts issued as per protocol safety monitoring requirements or stopping rules will indicate the applicable protocol section to facilitate review and will be immediately and simultaneously sent by email to the Investigator, the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors, the Sponsor Drug Safety Physician, and the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), and should be received by them within 2 days from sample collection. Hematology results from the site’s local laboratories are received by the study center staff per the local laboratory’s standard reporting time, and should be entered as soon as possible into the eCRF to inform the Sponsor and CRO study monitoring teams. All platelet coun t results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator, or designee, to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the subject could be approaching the d ose interruption rule of 75,000/mm 3 as specified in Section 8.6.3. Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and must b e reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Section 9.4.1."

Any event meeting renal stopping rules criteria described in Section 8.6.2 is considered an adverse event of special interest and must be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Section 9.4.1. All lab alerts received, including those related to platelet, liver, or renal function monitoring/stopping rules, are also reviewed promptly by the Sponsor and the CRO Medical Monitors who will agree on actions to be taken. Within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab alert the CRO Medical Monitor will communicate instructions to the Investigator and the study personnel by emailing them the Safety Surveillance Form that needs to be signed by the Investigator/study personnel and promptly returned to the Sponsor and CRO Medical Monitor. In urgent cases, such as platelets results below 50,000/mm 3, or liver or renal test results reaching a critical stopping rule the Investigator must also be contacted by phone. Further information on safety monitoring and actions to be taken by the Study Investigator in the event of reduced platelet count are provided in Sections 8.5.3 and 8.6.3. 6.2.1 Physical Exams and Vital Signs Physical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A). Vital signs should include weight, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. BP and pulse rate will be recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. BP should always be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm). Height will be measured at Screening . 6.2.2 DEXA Scan Dual -energy X -ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA) scans will be conducted prior to administration of the first dose of Study Drug and repeated at Week 13 and 27 using standardized procedures and settings. 6.2.3 Electrocardiography Electrocardiography (ECG) will be conducted as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures ( Appendix A ) at Screening, Day 1 (prior to the first dose of Study Drug), and during the treatment period. ECGs will be conducted during the post- treatment follow -up period at scheduled visits. ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been resting in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. ECGs will be performed in triplicate. 6.2.4 PK Sampling Blood sam ples for the determination of plasma ISIS 703802 concentrations will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 and at various times throughout the treatment and post- treatment follow -up periods as noted in the tables in Appendix C . 6.2.5 Mixed Meal Test The Mixed Meal Test (MMT) (Appendix E ) will be done at baseline, at week 13 and at week 27. This test consists of having the subject consume a standardized meal in the evening and fast overnight for at least 8 hours. The following morning, before the test , fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids ( FFA), C- peptide, insulin, serum ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1 and PYY as well as incretin hormones are measured .

Study staff will adm inister the first dose of Study Drug. Doses will be administered by SC injection, patients or their caregivers may self -administer the study drug following the training given by the study center staff. Subjects will receive treatment weekly with weeks always defined relative to Study Day 1. For example if a subject receives the first dose on a Monday, subsequent doses should be given on Mondays according to the respective dosing schedule, if possible. If a subject misses an injection, or if dosing on t he usual day is not possible, the subject can reschedule the injection provided that 2 doses are administered at least 2 days apart. Every effort should be made to ensure the previous dose is given 7 days prior to a scheduled clinic visit. Volumes to be administered are shown in Table 2. Please refer to the Study Drug Manual provided by the Sponsor or designee for more detailed instructions for Study Drug preparation and/or administration.

Subjects will continue their lipid -lowering therapy on a stable regimen from the signing of informed consent at Screening through the end of the post- treatment evaluation period. 8.3 Other Protocol -Required Treatment Procedures There are no other protocol-required treatment procedures other than those outlined in the schedule of procedures. 8.4 Treatment Precautions No specific treatment precautions are required. 8.5 Safety Monitoring Rules Please refer also to the “Guidance for Investigator” section of the Investigator’s Brochure. For the purposes of safety monitoring Baseline is defined as the average of the pre- dose test closest to Day 1 and Day 1. In addition to the standard monitoring of clinical safety parameters, the following guidelines are provided for the monitoring of selected parameters chosen based on preclinical and clinical observations. In case of discrepancy between the test results from 2 sources, safety -mandated action mus t be initiated based on the more critical (lower or higher, as relevant) of the 2 values."
142,page_142,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 54 Confirmation Guidance: At any time during the Study (Treatment or Post- Treatment Periods), the initial clinical laboratory results meeting the safety monitoring criteria presented below must be confirmed by performing measurements (ideally in the same laboratory that performed the initial measurement) on new specimens prior to administering the next dose of Study Drug. All new specimen collections should take place as soon as possible (ideally within 3 days of the initial collection). Stopping Rule Guidance: The Investigator may interrupt or permanently discontinue study treatment for any safety reason including clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory results. In the event of an initial clinical laboratory result that meets a stopping criterion, subjects must not be re-dosed until a confirmatory test result has been reviewed by the Study Medical Monitor. If any of the stopping criteria described below are met and are confirmed, the subject will be permanently discontinued from further treatment with Study Drug (ISIS 703802), evaluated fully as outlined below and in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor or appropriately qualified designee, and will be entered into the post-treatment evaluation portion of the study. In general, subjects who do not meet the stopping rules based upon retest may continue dosing. However, the Investigator and the Study Medical Monitor (or appropriately qualified designee) shoul d confer as to whether additional close monitoring of the subject is appropriate. Additional Guidance: If possible, a PK sample should be collected as soon as possible after a SAE has occurred (preferably within 2 weeks). In addition, if a subject is asked to return to the clinic for additional evaluations due to an AE, then a PK sample should be taken at the time of the unscheduled visit. 8.5.1 Safety Monitoring Rules for Liver Chemistry Tests The following rules are adapted from the FDA guidance for industry, “Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation,” issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, July 2009 and adopted to meet the requirements of this protocol and compound to ensure safety of the subjects. While on treatment, all subjects will have liver chemistry tests monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3 - months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. Upon completion of the study treatment period, liver chemistry tests should be monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A . In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs of hepatic injury (jaundice, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, abnormal bleeding or bruising, or eosinophilia > ULN) liver enzymes and bilirubin should be tested as soon as possible. Testing at a lab that is local to the subject is permissible for this purpose. In the event of an ALT or AST measurement that is > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x baseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN) at any time during the study (treatment or post-treatment period), the initial measurement(s) should be confirmed. Subjects with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 x ULN should have their liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, ALP, international normalized ratio [INR] and total bilirubin) retested at least once- weekly until ALT and AST levels become ≤ 1.5 x ULN. All results of liver function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules."
143,page_143,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 55 Further Investigation into Liver Chemistry Elevations : For subjects with confirmed ALT or AST levels > 3 x ULN, the following evaluations should be performed: 1. Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior and concurrent diseases 2. Obtain further history for concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications, herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, an d special diets 3. Obtain a history for exposure to environmental chemical agents and travel 4. Serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis A virus [HAV] immunoglobulin M [IgM], hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibody, Cytomegalovirus [ CMV] IgM, and EBV antibody panel) 5. Serology for autoimmune hepatitis (e.g., antinuclear antibody [ANA]) Additional liver evaluations, including gastroenterology/hepatology consultations, hepatic CT or MRI scans, may be performed at the discretion of the Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Repetition of the above evaluations should be considered if a subject’s ALT and/or AST levels reach 5 x ULN. All routine liver function test results will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Medical Monitor. All lab alerts for abnormal liver function tests must be promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) reviewed by the Investigator and Medical Monitors. Lab alerts for abnormal liver chemistry tests will be issued for: 1) ALT or AST > 3 x ULN; 2 ) ALT or AST > 2 x baseline; 3) total bilirubin > ULN; 4) ALP > ULN. These alert levels are set to anticipate the risk of a combined elevation of aminotransferases and bilirubin as per the FDA Guidance. 8.5.2 Safety Monitoring for Renal Function While on treatment all subjects will have renal function tests monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3 months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. Upon completion of the study treatment period, urine renal biomarkers should be monitored as per visit schedule in Appendix A . In the event of appearance of symptoms or signs consistent with renal dysfunction such as hematuria, polyuria, anuria, flank pain, new-onset hypertension, nausea and/or anorexia, renal function should be tested as soon as possible. Testing at a lab that is local to the subject is permissible for this purpose. While on treatment during the course of the study, urinary surveillance may include urinalysis to include urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR), urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) and urinary red blood cells (RBCs), as well as serum creatinine and cystatin -C which will be monitored every 2 weeks during the first 3 -months of the study treatment period, and monthly thereafter. In addition, other biomarkers of acute renal injury may also be measured if a safety signal is seen that warrants further testing. (Appendix B). The assessment of serum creatinine, cystatin -C, and urinalysis more frequently than per the Schedule of Procedures in Appendix A will be guided by consultation with the medical monitor. Any decision taken by the Investigator to dis continue study medication will be made taking into account all available and relevant data. In addition, the decision to discontinue Study Drug may also be based on lesser changes in these parameters observed in isolation or in association with other renal- related abnormalities. Any"
144,page_144,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 56 decision taken to restart study medication will be made in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor taking into account all available and relevant data. All results of renal function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules. Lab alerts for abnormal renal tests will be issued for: eGFR (by CKD -EPI formula) decrease from Baseline > 25%, urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) > 250 mg/g, urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 0.5 mg/mg, or an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline > 0.3 mg/dL). These alert levels are set to anticipate and prevent the risk of a medically significant change in renal function while receiving Study Drug. In the event of a confirmed laboratory result meeting one or more of the above criteria, the following supplemental renal tests should be immediately obtained: Serum creatinine, urine culture, 24-hour urine sample for creatinine clearance, urine albumin and urine protein, urine microscopy sample with inspection of sediment. The Investigator should also review the subject’s concomitant medications for potentially nephrotoxic agents, and, with the resul ts of these evaluations, review any decision to continue or discontinue the subject in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor. 8.5.3 Safety Monitoring Rules for Platelet Count Results All subjects will have platelet counts monitored every 2 weeks for the duration of the study treatment period and must not receive Study Drug without an interpretable platelet count result in the prior 2 wee ks. Upon completion of study drug dosing, platelets should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 6 weeks and then at 8 and 13 weeks post last dose (as per visit schedule). All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the subject could be approaching the dose interruption rule of 75,000/mm 3. Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator should refer the subject to a hematologist to provide diagnostic and therapeutic management. Lab alerts related to platelet monitoring/stopping rules are issued when: 1) platelet counts are < 140,000 mm 3; 2) when platelet count is ≥ 30% decreased from Baseline, or 3) when the hematology sample is unreportable. All these lab alerts, are reviewed promptly by the Medical Monitor and instructions are communicated to the Investigator and the study personnel within 24 hours of receiving an actionable lab alert. Actions to be taken in the event of reduced platelet count are shown in Table 3. In the event of a platelet count ˂ 100,000/mm 3 the laboratory tests outlined in Table 3, should be performed as soon as possible. In addition to action taken as outlined in Table 3, in the event of a platelet count <100,000/mm3, tests outlined in Appe ndix F should be performed as soon as possible. Additional lab tests , if warranted, will be determined by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee in consultation with the Investigator."
145,page_145,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 57 8.5.4 Safety Monitoring for Bleeding Events Subjects will be evaluated for occurrence of bleeding events continuously after the start of Study Drug treatment (Day 1 ) up to the end of the follow -up period for all cohorts. All bleedin g events are considered adverse events and reported on adverse event case report form . Bleeding events that are either major or clinically -relevant non-major bleeding (as defined below) will need to be monitored and treated immediately. Subjects with a suspected bleeding event will undergo additional testing if deemed appropriate by the treating physician and an (S)AE case report form will be completed. In addition, if bleeding is considered significant, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), aPTT, PT, INR, and platelet count are to be obtained. In addition, approximately 2 mL of K2EDTA anticoagulated blood will be collected and resulting plasma must be stored allowing for a centralized assessment of ISIS 703802 concentrations. In addition, if a minor bleeding event occurs, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor Medical Monitor (or designee) and additional testing of coagulation parameters (aPTT, prothrombin time [PT], INR), platelet count, and platelet volume may be performed. Definitions : Major bleeding (MB) is defined as one of the following (Büller et al. 2007 ): 1. Fatal bleeding 2. Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intracranial, intraspinal , intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular if in a major joint, or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome 3. Clinically overt bleeding leading to transfusion of ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood or a fall in hemoglobin of 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more within 24 hours Clinically -relevant non- major bleeding (CRNMB) is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major bleeding but that resulted, for example, in medical examination, intervention, or had clinical consequences for a subject (Büller et al. 2007). Minor bleeding events are those that do not fulfill the criteria for major bleeding or clinically -relevant, non-major bleeding events (defined above), for example excess bruisin g, petechiae, gingival bleeding on brushing teeth. 8.5.5 Safety Monitoring for Constitutional Symptoms Subjects will be instructed to promptly report any signs or symptoms of fever, constitutional symptoms, rash, arthralgia or joint swelling that may arise during the study and the Investigator should closely evaluate all potential causes, including concomitant illness. Subjects who experience persistent symptoms should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee to determine whether additional monitoring or laboratory tests are required. 8.5.6 Safety Monitoring for Hypoglycemia Subjects will be instructed to monitor and manage hypoglycemic episodes. Subjects will be provided with glucometer and asked to record Self Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) levels and report back alert values to the site. Subjects will be instructed to promptly report symptoms of hypoglycemia: headache, heart pounding, confusion, disorientation, numbness or tingling, pale skin, shakiness or tremulousness,"
146,page_146,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 58 increased appetite, anxiousness or nervousness, lightheadedness or dizziness, sweating and weakness. If subjects suspect they might be having a hypoglycemia reaction, they should check their blood glucose using their meters as soon as possible, before treatment if possible, provided they feel it is safe to do so. If there is doubt about safety they should treat the event first, using some sugar, milk, or juice for example, then obtain and record a blood glucose value as soon as possible thereafter. The time and nature of treatment should be noted, and especially if any blood glucose result was before or after treatment. If a subject presents with symptoms of hypoglycemia, the Investigator will need to take immediate action to confirm the subject ’s glucose level and treat the subject accordingly. Severe hypoglycemia will be qualified as a SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria. Classification of Hypoglycemia The alert value for hypoglycemia is ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) blood glucose concentration. Severe Hypoglycemia Requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Glucose concentrations may not be available during an event. Neurological recovery following glucose levels returning to normal considered sufficient evidence that event was induced by low glucose concentration. Documented Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms accompanied by measured blood glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). Asymptomatic Hypoglycemia Not accompanied by typical hypoglycemia symptoms but with measured blood glucose≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L) . Probable Symptomatic Hypoglycemia Typical hypoglycemia symptoms not accompanied by blood glucose determination but likely caused by blood glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). A documented severe hypoglycemic event is defined as one in which the subject requires assistance of another person to obtain treatment for the event and h as a blood glucose level ≤ 70 mg/dL (≤ 3.9 mmol/L). The rescue treatment of hypoglycemia may include IV glucose or buccal or intramuscular glucagon. The definition of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia includes all episodes in which neurological impairment was severe enough to prevent self -treatment and which were thus thought to place subjects at risk for injury to themselves or others. 8.5.7 Safety Moni toring for Documented Hyperglycemia Subjects will be asked to self -monitor their glucose at least once a week and reviewed by Investigator at each Study Center visit. If the value exceeds the specific glycemic limit specified below, the subject will be instructed to check again during the 2 following days. If all values in 3 consecutive days exceed the specific limit, the subject should contact the Investigator and a central laboratory FPG measurement will be performed)."
147,page_147,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 59 The threshold values are defined as follows, depending on study period: From baseline visit to Week 13 (including value at Week 13) of Randomized Treatment period: • Blood glucose > 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) From Week 13 to Post -treatment Follow -up (Week 4, 8 and 13 post end of treatment period): • Blood glucose > 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) or • HbA1c > 9% (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c < 8%) and HbA1c increase of more than 1% from Baseline (for subjects with Baseline HbA1c ≥ 8%) In case of blood glucose /HbA1c above the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that: • Blood g lucose was actually measured in the fasting condition • Absence of intercurrent disease which may jeopardize glycemic control. In case of an emergency such as unplanned hospitalization (e.g., surgery, infection), the Investigator can take appropriate measures for glycemic control. If the measure does not exceed 7 days, then it will not be considered a rescue. If the measure lasts beyond 7 days then it will be treated as a rescue • Compliance to treatment is appropriate • Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic control, the Investigator should undertake appropriate action, i.e.: • Investigation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in AE/concomitant medication parts of the eCRF) • Stress on the absolute need to be compliant to treatment • Organize a specific interview with a Registered Dietician or o ther qualified nutrition professional and stress on the absolute need to be compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendations • Schedule a FPG/ HbA1c assessment at the next visit If none from the above-mentioned reason can be found, or if appropriate action fails to decrease blood glucose/HbA1c under the threshold values, rescue medication may be introduced at the Investigator discretion and according to local guidelines. All assessments for primary and secondary efficacy and safety parameters planned in final primary endpoi nt assessment visit should be performed before adding the rescue medication if possible. Then the subject continues the study treatment and stays in the study in order to collect safety information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the last scheduled visit. (See more details in Appendix A). Note: After Study Drug discontinuation any treatments are permitted, as deemed necessary by the Investigator."
148,page_148,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 60 8.6 Stopping Rules For the purposes of st opping rules, Baseline is defined as the average of Day 1 pre -dose assessment and the last measurement prior to Day 1. 8.6.1 Stopping Rules for Liver Chemistry Elevations In the event of confirmed laboratory results meeting any of the following criteria, dosing of a patient with Study Drug will be stopped permanently: 1. ALT or AST > 8 x ULN, which is confirmed 2. ALT or AST > 5 x ULN, which is confirmed and persists for ≥ 2 weeks 3. ALT or AST > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x b aseline value or 3 x ULN if the baseline value was > ULN), which is confirmed and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5 4. ALT or AST > 3 x ULN (or the greater of 2 x b aseline value o r 3 x ULN if the b aseline value was > ULN), which is confirmed, and the new appearance (i.e., onset coincides wit h the changes in hepatic enzymes) of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (> ULN) felt by the Investigator to be potentially related to hepatic inflammation . Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose or dose frequency will be allowed for safety. Any proposed adjustments to treatment schedule must be discussed with, and approved by, the Study Medical monitor prior to initiation. 8.6.2 Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results / Temporary Stopping Rules for Renal Function Test Results In the event of an eGFR (by CKD -EPI formula) meeting any of the following criteria, or any change in renal biomarkers deemed by the nephrologist to require further evaluation, a serum creatinine and 24 -hour urine sample for creatinine clearance and protein should be obtained: 1. eGFR (CKD- EPI) decrease of > 40% from Baseline 2. eGFR (CKD- EPI) value < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Dosing of a patient with Study Drug (ISIS 703802) will be stopped permanently if 24- hour urine testing confirms any of the following values in the absence of an alternative explanation: 1. Urine protein is > 1.0 g 2. Creatinine clearance decrease of > 40% from Baseline 3. Creatinine clearance < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 Irrespective of whether the stopping rule is confirmed or not, the follow-up schedule and frequency of renal function monitoring after the initial event will be determined by the Study Medical Monitor in consultation with the Investigator. The Investigator should consider consulting a local nephrologist for any change of renal function that presents a concern. If a renal biopsy is performed, a sample specimen should be made available for examination by an independent renal pathologist who has been engaged by the Sponsor to review such specimens. Dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose or dose frequency will be allowed for safety. Any proposed adjustments to treatment schedule must be discussed with, and approved by, the Study Medical monitor prior to initiation."

In the event of any platelet count less than 50,000/mm3, or a platelet count less than 75,000/ mm3 that occurs while the subject is already on reduced dose, dosing of the subject with Study Drug will be stopped permanently ( Table 3). Platelet count will be mon itored daily until 2 successive values show improvement then monitored every 2- 3 days until platelet count is stable. Administration of steroids is recommended for subjects whose platelet count is less than 25,000/mm3. Recovery in platelet count may be accelerated by administration of high dose steroids. Treatment guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia ( Provan et al. 2010) recommend Dexamethasone 40 mg daily for 4 days every 2 -4 weeks for 1-4 cycles; Prednis(ol)one 0.5-2 mg/kg/d for 2- 4 weeks then taper; or methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days (note: may require continuation with oral steroids after methylprednisolone). In the event of a platelet count ˂ 75,000/mm3 and > 50,000/mm3, dosing of a subject with Study Drug should be suspended temporarily until the platelet count has recovered to > 100,000/mm3. If dosing is continued, it must be at a reduced dose as shown in Table 3. The suitability of the subject for continued dosing will be determined by the Investigator in consultation with the Study Medical Monitor and will be based on factors such as the original r ate of decline in the subject’s platelet count, whether any bleeding events were experienced by the subject, and the speed of recovery of platelet count after interruption of dosing. If, after reintroduction of Study Drug, the platelet count again falls below 75,000/mm 3, then dosing of the subject with Study Drug will be stopped permanently. Once a subject commences weekly monitoring, this frequency of monitoring should continue until the platelet count returns to the normal range (≥140,000/mm3) for 2 successive values . Any unreportable platelet count result must be rechecked and determined not to have met a stopping rule before dosing can continue."

Other dose adjustments, including dose interruptions, and/or decreasing the dose will be allowed for safety or tolerability in consultation with the S ponsor Medi cal Monitor. Subjects may have their dose interrupted in response to AEs in consultation with Study Medical Monitor . 8.8 Discontinuation of Study Drug/ Treatment A subject must permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following: • The subject becomes pregnant. Report the pregnancy according to instructions in Section 9.5.4 • The subject withdraws consent • The subject experiences an adverse event (AE) that necessitates permanent discontinuatio n of Study Drug • The subject develops laboratory test abnormalities that meet any of the stopping rules listed in Sections 8.6.1 to 8.6.3 • When a platelet count of less than 50,000/mm3, or a platelet count less than 75,000/mm3 while the patient is on a reduced dose . The reason for discontinuation of Study Drug Treatment must be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and source documentation. For subject s who discontinue treatment early every effort should be made to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix A ). Subjects should then be entered into the post- treatment e valuation period. If a subject discontinues treatment after only 1 dose, then the post- treatment evaluation procedures should be followed. 8.8.1 Follow- up Visits for Early Termination from Treatment Period or from Post- Treatment Follow- up Period Any subject who discontinues early from the treatment period or from post- treatment follow -up period should be followed as per the platelet monitoring rules shown in, Section 8.6.3 for the first 6 weeks after discontinuing Study Drug and then at 8 and 13 weeks post end of treatment period (as per visit schedule) . If the subject declines or is unable to participate in the above, the early termination visit procedures should be performed at the time of withdrawal, at a minimum, and ideally within 2 weeks from the last dose of Study Drug. In addition, the investigator should clarify what type of follow-up the subject is agreeable to: in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from review of the medical records. Wherever possible these subjects should continue to be followed up via the agreed means to collect information on adverse events, concomitant medications and survival status. At the very least, the patient’s status at the end of the protocol def ined study period should be ascertained and documented."
152,page_152,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 64 8.9 Withdrawal of Subjects from the S tudy Subjects must be withdrawn from the Study for any of the following: • Withdrawal of consent • The subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol • The subject meets any of the Exclusion Criteria (see Section 5.2 ) after enrolling in the study that in the opinion of the Investigator represents a safety ri sk to the subject Other reasons for withdrawal of subjects from the Study might include: • At the discretion of the Investigator for medical reasons • At the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor for noncompliance • Significant protocol deviation All efforts will be made to com plete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal. All information, including the reason for withdrawal from Study, must be recorded in the eCRF. Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the Study will be removed from further treatment and study observation immediately upon the date of request. These subjects should be encouraged to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal ( Appendix A). For subjects withdrawn for reasons other than withdrawal of consent every effort should be made to complete the early termination study procedures and observations at the time of withdrawal (see Appendix A ). The I nvestigator should clarify what type of follow- up the subject is agreeable to: in person, by phone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, and/or from review of the medical records. Wherever possible these subjects should continue to be followed up via the agreed means to collect information on adverse events, concomitant medications and survival status. At the very least, the patient’s status at the end of the protocol defined study period should be ascertained and documented. 8.10 Concomitant Therapy and Procedures The use of concomitant therapies or procedures defined below must be recorded on the subject’s eCRF. Adverse events related to administration of these therapies or procedures must also be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 8.10.1 Concomitant Therapy A concomitant therapy is any non-protocol specified drug or substance (including over-the-counter medic ations, herbal medications and vitamin supplements) administered between Screening and the end of the post-treatment evaluation period. All concomitant medications/treatments and significant non-drug therapies (including supplements and assistive devices) received by a subject, including changes in the subject’s current medications, must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and CRF. Subjects taking over the counter (OTC) omega- 3 fatty acids should make every effort to remain on the same brand throughout the study."
153,page_153,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 65 Allowed Concomitant Therapy Ibuprofen may be used for symptomatic pain relief. Any other therapy for pain (including OTC medications such as acetaminophen) should be approved by the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee. Disallowed Concomitant Therapy The use of prescription and OTC medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (with the exception of occasional ibuprofen) is prohibited during this study unless the occurrence of an AE requires a drug therapy. In cases when there is no AE, the Investigator must consult the Sponsor Medical Monitor to decide on s ubject continuation or withdrawal from the study. The medications and therapy identified in exclusion criteria, Section 5.2 are also d isallowed concomitant medications and are prohibited during the course of s tudy, unless there is a safety concern. In those cases the Medical Monitor needs to be notified and rationale provided by the Investigator. Concomitant therapy with oral corticosteroids used as replacement therapy for pituitary adrenal disease as well as inhaled steroid therapy (e.g., Pulmicort®), or intra -articular, or topical may be acceptable; however, the subject must be on a stable regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening. All exceptions should be discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor. Subject should consult with the Site Investigator or designee prior to initiating any new medication, including non-prescription or herbal compounds or any other non-drug therapy. 8.10.2 Concomitant Procedures A concomitant procedure is any therapeutic intervention (e.g., surgery/biopsy, physical therapy) or diagnostic assessment (e.g., blood gas measurement, bacterial cultures) performed between Screening and the end of the post- treatment evaluation period . 8.11 Treatment Compliance Compliance with treatment dosing is to be monitored and recorded by Study Center staff. The Study Center staff is required to document the receipt, dispensing, and return/destruction of study medication. Subjects that are self -admi nistering study medication at home must record treatment in a dosing diary that will be reviewed periodically by Study Center staff and the Clinical Monitor. 9. SERIOUS AND NON- SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 9.1 Sponsor Review of Safety Information Safet y information will be collected, reviewed, and evaluated by the Sponsor or designee in accordance with the Safety Management Plan throughout the conduct of the clinical trial. 9.2 Regulatory Requirements The Sponsor or designee is responsible for regulatory submissions and reporting to the Investigators of serious adverse events (SAEs) including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines E2A and ICH E6. Country- specific regulat ory requirements will be followed in accordance with local country regulations and guidelines. Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC) will be notified of any SAE according to applicable regulations. In addition to the Investigator’s assessment of relatedness, the Sponsor or designee will evaluate the available information and perform an independent assessment of"
154,page_154,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 66 relatedness. While the Sponsor may upgrade an Investigator’s decision it is not permissible to downgrade the Investigator’s opinion for the purposes of determining whether the SAE meets the definition of a SUSAR. For the purpose of regulatory reporting of SUSARs, there are no “expected” AEs in this study population. 9.3 Definitions 9.3.1 Adverse Event An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically- significant abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the Study or use of investigational drug product, whether or not the AE is considered related to the investigational drug product. 9.3.2 Adverse Reaction and Suspected Adverse Reaction An adverse reaction is any AE caused by the Study Drug. A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug ca used the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction. 9.3.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death • Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death at the time of the event An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occur red in a more severe form, might have caused death • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an admission of greater than 24 hours to a medical facility and does not always qualify as an AE • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female) • Impor tant medical events that may not result in death, are not life- threatening, or do not require hospitalization may also be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse."
155,page_155,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 67 9.3.3.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest For the purpose of this study severe reductions in platelet count < 50,000 mm3 are considered as an AE of special interest and should be subject to expediting reporting to the Sponsor following the same requirements as for SAE reporting ( Section 9.4.1 ). 9.4 Monitoring and Recording Adverse Events Any pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms presen t in a subject prior to the start of the Study (i.e., before informed consent) should be recorded as Medical History and not recorded as AEs unless the pre-existing condition worsened. The Investigator should always group signs and symptoms into a s ingle term that constitutes a single unifying diagnosis if possible. 9.4.1 Serious Adverse Events In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs (regardless of their relationship to Study Drug) should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of the event. The collection of SAEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and stop at the end of the subject’s follow -up period. An Initial Serious Adverse Event Form should be completed and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or designee. The contact information for reporting SAEs is as follows: Attention: INC Research, LLC Email: INCDrugSafety@INCResearch.com Fax: 1-877-464-7787 Detailed information should be actively sought and included on Follow- Up Serious Adverse Event Forms as soon as additional information be comes available. All SAEs will be followed until resolution. SAEs that remain ongoing past the subject’s last protocol- specified follow -up visit will be evaluated by the Investigator and Sponsor. If the Investigator and Sponsor agree the subject’s condi tion is unlikely to resolve, the Investigator and Sponsor will determine the follow -up requirement. 9.4.2 Non-Serious Adverse Events The recording of non- serious AEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and will stop at the end of t he subject’s follow -up period. The Investigator will monitor each subject closely and record all observed or volunteered AEs on the Adverse Event Case Report Form. 9.4.3 Evaluation of Adverse Events (Serious and Non- Serious) The Investigator’s opinion of the following should be documented on the Adverse Event Case Report Form :"
156,page_156,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 68 9.4.3.1 Relationship to the Study Drug The event’s relationship to the Study Drug (ISIS 703802) is characterized by 1 of the following: • Related: There is clear evidence that the event is related to the use of Study Drug, e.g., confirmation by positive re- challenge test • Possible: The event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and there is a plausible temporal relationship between the event and Study Drug (ISIS 703802) administration • Unlikely/Remote: An event for which an alternative explanation is more likely (e.g., concomitant medications or ongoing medical conditions) or the temporal relationship to Study Drug ( ISIS 703802) administration and/or exposure suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely (For reporting purposes, Unlikely/Remote will be grouped together with Not Related) • Not Related: The event can be readily explained by th e subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or other causes, and therefore, the Investigator believes no relationship exists between the event and Study Drug 9.4.3.2 Severity The severit y of AEs and SAEs will be graded based on criteria from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03, June 2010 (refer to Appendix D ). Any AE not listed in Appendix D will be graded as follows: • Mild: The event is easily tolerated by the subject and does not affect the subject’s usual daily activities • Moderate: The event causes the subject more discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual daily activities • Severe: The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual daily activities If the event is an SAE, then all applicable seriousness criteria must be indicated (criteria listed in Secti on 9.3.3). 9.4.3.3 Action Taken with Study Drug Action taken with Study Drug (ISIS 703802) due to the event is characterized by 1 of the following: • None: No changes were made to Study Drug ( ISIS 703802) administration and dose • Permanently Discontinued: Study drug was discontinued and not restarted • Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted – Same Dose: Dosing was temporarily interrupted or delayed due to the AE and restarted at the same dose • Temporarily Interrupted, Restarted Reduced Dose: Dosing was tempora rily interrupted or delayed due to the AE and restarted at the next lower dose"

Treatment should also be recorded on the concomitant treatment or ancillary procedures eCRF , as appropriate . 9.4.3.5 Outcome of the Adverse Event If the event is a non -serious AE, then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following: AE Persists: Subject terminates from the trial and the AE continues : • Recovered: Subject recovered completely from the AE • Became Serious: The event became serious (the date that the event became serious should be recorded as the Resolution Date of that AE and the Onset Date of the corresponding SAE) • Change in Severity (if applicable): AE severity changed If the event is an SAE , then the event’s outcome is characterized by 1 of the following: Ongoing: SAE continuing: • Persists (as non -serious AE): Subject has not fully recovered but the event no longer meets serious criteria and should be captured as an AE on the non -serious AE eCRF (the SAE resolution date should be entered as the date of onset of that AE) • Recovered: Subject recovered completely from the SAE (the date of recovery should be entered as the SAE resolution date) • Fatal: Subject died (the date of death should be ente red as the SAE resolution date) 9.5 Procedures for Handling Special Situations 9.5.1 Abnormalities of Laboratory Tests Clinically -significant abnormal laboratory test results may, in the opinion of the Investigator, constitute or be associated with an AE. Examples of these include abnormal laboratory results that are associated with symptoms, or require treatment (e.g., bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, tetany due to hypocalcemia, or cardiac arrhythmias due to hyperkalemia). Whenever possible, the underlying diagnosis should be listed in preference to abnormal laboratory values as AEs. Clinically -significant abnormalities will be monitore d by the Investigator until the parameter returns to its baseline value or until agreement is reached between the Investigator and Sponsor Medical Monitor. Laboratory abnormalities deemed not clinically -significant (NCS) by the Investigator should not be reported as AEs. Similarly, laboratory abnormalities reported as AEs by the Investigator should not be deemed NCS on the laboratory sheet. The Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports. The signed clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents and should include the Investigator’s assessment of clinical significance of out of range/abnormal laboratory values. All platelet count results must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the count has not met the stopping rule and to determine whether the rate of decline is suggestive that the patient could be approaching the dose interruption rule of 75,000/mm 3 as specified in Section 8.6.3. Any case of a platelet count reduction to levels below 50,000/mm3 (Grade 3 or Grade 4) is considered an adverse event of"
158,page_158,"ISIS 703802 -CS5 CONFIDENTIAL Amendment 1 Protocol 16 February 2018 70 special interest and should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor as per Sections 9.3.3.1 and 9.4.1). All results of liver function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that th e result has not met the stopping rules per Section 8.6.1. All results of renal function tests must be reviewed promptly (within 48 hours of receipt) by the Investigator or the designee to ensure that the result has not met the stopping rules per Section 8.6.2. 9.5.2 Prescheduled or Elective Procedures or Routinely Scheduled Treatments A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be consider ed an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized; the Study Center must document all of the following: • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or was on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the sub ject’s consent to participate in the Study • The condition that required the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress in the opinion of the Investigator between the subject’s consen t to participate in the Study and the timing of the procedure or treatment • The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment is the sole reason for the intervention or hospital admission 9.5.3 Dosing Errors Study Drug (ISIS 703802) errors should be documented as Protocol Deviations. A brief description should be provided in the deviation, including whether the subject was symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic, and the event accidental or intentional. Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing eCRF . If the subject takes a dose of Study Drug that exceeds protocol specifications and the subject is symptomatic, then the symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported per Section 9.4. Should an overdose occur , the Investigator or designee should refer to the Guidance to Investigator’s section of the Investigator’s Brochure and contact the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours. 9.5.4 Contraception and Pregnancy Subjects must continue to use appropriate contraception with their partners, or refrain from sexual activity, as described in Section 6.3.1 . If a subject becomes pregnant or a pregnancy is suspected, or if a male subject makes or believes that he has made someone pregnant during the Study, then the Study Center staff must be informed immediately. An Initial Pregnancy Form should be submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of first learning of the occurren ce of pregnancy. Follow-up information including delivery or termination is reported by designating as ‘Follow-up’ on the Pregnancy Forms and reported within 24 hours. Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child or related care will be the subject’s responsibility. Female subjects: If a suspected pregnancy occurs while on the Study (including follow-up), a pregnancy test will be performed. The subject with a confirmed pregnancy will be immediately withdrawn from treatment with Study Drug. However, the subject will be encouraged to complete the post-treatment follow-up portion of the Study to the extent that study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy. Regardless of continued study participation, the study physician will assist the subject in getting obstetrical care and the progress of the pregnancy will be followed until the outcome"

If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may require access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth. Follow-up will be performed to the extent permitted by the applicable regulations and privacy considerations. Male subjects: The progress of the pregnancy of a male subject’s partner should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (i.e., delivery, elective termination, or spontaneous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, the Study Center and Sponsor may request access to the mother and infant’s medical records for an additional 8 weeks after birth. Follow -up will be performed to the extent permitted by the applicabl e regulations and privacy considerations . 10.

A cannula will be inserted into a forearm vein, and an overnight fasting (minimum 10 hours ) venous blood sample will be taken between 8:00 AM and 10:00 AM for measurement of plasma glucose, FFA, C-peptide and insulin concentrations and serum ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1, and PYY. Incretin hormones will be measured using a multiplex assay (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The tubes for the incretin hormones will contain Pefabloc SC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and DPP- IV inhibitor (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) to inhibit DPP-IV and other proteases. The change in ratings from Baseline will be quantified. Subjects will then consume a liquid load of Optifast (Optifast; Novartis, Minneapolis, MN; 474 ml, 320 kcal, 50% carbohydrate, 35% protein, 15% fat) within a 15 -min period. Additional blood samples will be taken at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240 and 300 min after meal consumption. VAS will be completed at 180 minutes and 300 min. To calculate the insulin sensitivity ind ex (S I), the oral minimal model for glucose will be used; and to calculate the hepatic insulin extraction, oral minimal model for insulin and c -peptide will be used [Cobelli et al, 2007] . Subjects will complete a validated visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire to assess subjectiv e hunger at 0, 180 and 300 minutes [ Luscombe- Marsh et al, 2005; Moran et al, 2005] ."

Administrative Clarification 1 – Section 6.2.1 Physical Exams and Vital Signs Current Text : Physical exams and vital signs will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A). Vital signs should include weight, blood pre ssure (BP), pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. BP and pulse rate will be recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. BP should always be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm). Height will be measured at Screening. Clarification : (new text indicated in bold) Physical exams, vital sign s, and skin fold measurements will be performed as indicated in the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A). Vital signs should include weight, blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, respiratory rate and body temperature. BP and pulse rate will be recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes. BP should always be measured on the same arm (preferentially on the left arm). Height will be measured at Screening. Skinfold measurements will be recorded as per the Schedule of Procedures (Appendix A) starting at Day 1 Pre -dose . Skinfold measurements will be collected from each subject’s right mid anterior thigh and right tricep. Rationale: The secondary endpoints include “ Changes from Baseline in body fat distribution for various areas in the body as measured by skinfold thickness and DEXA .” The purpose of this clarification it to provide omitted details regarding the collection of skinfold measurements that were missing from Section 6: Study Procedures. This measurement will occur at every visit in which a physical exam (full or abbreviated) occurs.
