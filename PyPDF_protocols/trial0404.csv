Approximately 600 subjects will b e randomized to EV (Arm A) or chemotherapy (Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified according to the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), regions of the world and liver metastasis. OS is the primary endpoint. OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Secondary endpoints include PFS1, ORR, DOR, DCR, safety and QOL/PRO. Subjects in Arm A will receive EV on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. Subjects in arm B will receive docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine (as decided by the investigator prior to randomization: vinflunine is a choice of comparator only in countries where it is approved for urothelial cancer) on Day 1 of every 21 -day cycle. Within the contro l arm, the overall proportion of subjects receiving vinflunine will be capped at approximately 35%. Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until radiological disease progression as determined per investigator assessment or other discontinuation criteria are met or upon study termination, or study completion, whichever occurs first . No on -study crossover will be allowed other than as allowed in [Appendix 12.10 ].This study will consist of 3 phases: screening, treatment and follow -up. Screening will take place up to 28 days prior to randomization. Subjects will start with cycle 1 and continue on to subsequent 21 -day or 28 -day cycles until one of the discontinua tion criteria are met. A treatment cycle is defined as 28 days for Arm A and 21 days for Arm B. Subjects randomized to Arm A (EV) will receive treatment and evaluation on Days 1, 8 and 15 of all treatment cycles. Subjects randomized to Arm B (docetaxel, pa clitaxel or vinflunine) will receive treatment and evaluation on Day 1 of all treatment cycles. Subjects will be evaluated for response according to the RECIST V1.1. Imaging for both arms will be performed at baseline and every 56 days (± 7 days) from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until PFS1 is documented by radiological disease progression or the subject is lost to follow -up, death, withdraws study consent or starts a subsequent anti -cancer therapy. Baseline imaging performed prior to informed consent as standard of care may be used so long as it is performed within 28 days prior to randomization. All subjects will have a bone scan (scintigraphy) performed at screening/baseline. Subjects with positive bone scans at baseline will have a bone scan performed every 56 days (± 7 days) throughout the study or more frequently if clinically indicated. Subjects should have a follow -up bone scan performed if clinically indicated regardless of baseline status. Brain scans ( computed tomography with contrast/ magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will only be performed if clinically indicated at screening/baseline and repeated as clinically indicated or per standard of care throughout the study. QOL assessments and PRO will be collected at protocol -specified time points from all randomized subjects. The following validated tools will be used: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and EuroQOL 5 -dimensions (EQ -5D-5L). Healthcare Resou rce Utilization (HRU) information will be collected at protocol -specified time points with particular focus on the number of subjects who have an unplanned use of healthcare resources related to clinical or AEs from subjects assigned to treatment arms A an d B."

Validated assays will be used to measure the concentrations of EV ADC and MMAE in serum or plasma and to assess ATA. Pharmacokinet ic samples will not be collected from subjects randomized into Arm B. Samples for exploratory biomarkers will be collected at protocol -specified time points. Biomarker assessments will not be used for subject selection. Following discontinuation from stu dy drug, subjects will have a follow -up visit 30 days (+ 7 days) after their last dose of drug for safety assessments. If a subject discontinues study drug prior to radiographic disease progression (i.e., PFS1), the subject should enter the post treatment follow -up period and continue to undergo imaging assessments every 56 days (± 7 days) until PFS1 is documented or the subject starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. Following PFS1, subjects will enter the long -term follow -up perio d and be followed per institutional guidelines, but not less than every 3 months from the date of the follow -up visit for survival status and progression status on subsequent therapy (i.e., PFS2). Subjects will be followed until PFS2 is documented or the subject starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. All subsequent anticancer therapy including date and site of progression for PFS2 will be recorded on the case report form. Following PFS2, subjects will enter the survival follow -up period and be followed every 3 months for survival status until death, lost to follow -up, withdrawal of study consent, or study termination by sponsor. This study is expected to end once final survival analysis is complete. An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (IDMC) will be chartered to oversee safety and the planned interim efficacy analysis, which will occur after at least 285 OS events (about 65% of the total planned events) are observed. The primary analysis will occur at 439 OS events. The IDMC mayrecommend to the sponsor whether the trial should be terminated, modified or continue unchanged based on ongoing reviews of safety data and interim efficacy analysis. Further details will be outlined in the IDMC charter. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Inclusion: Subject is eligible for the study if all of the following apply: 1.Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approved written informed consent and privacy language as per national regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Porta bility and Accountability Act [HIPAA] Authorization for US sites) must be obtained from the subject prior to any study -related procedures (including withdrawal of prohibited medication, if applicable). 2.Subject is legally an adult according to local regulat ion at the time of signing informed consent. 3.Subject has histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma (i.e., cancer of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra).

Investigational Product: Enfortumab Vedotin Dose, Mode of Administration and Dose Modification: EV 1.25 mg/kg will be administered on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28 -day cycle. The investigational product will be administered intravenously over a 30 -minute period. EV will be administered based on the subject’s actual body weight on Day 1 of every cycl e except for subjects weighing greater than 100 kg; in such cases, the dose will be calculated based on a maximum weight of 100 kg. The dose does not need to be re -calculated based on actual weight on Day 8 and 15 of each cycle for Arm A unless it is requi red by institutional standards. Dose reduction to 1 mg/kg (dose level -1) and to 0.75 mg/kg (dose level -2) will be allowed depending on the type and severity of toxicity. Subjects requiring a dose reduction may be re - escalated by 1 dose level (i.e., sub jects reduced to 0.75 mg/kg may only be re -escalated to 1 mg/kg) provided the toxicity does not require study drug discontinuation and has returned to baseline or ≤Grade 1. If the toxicity recurs, re -escalation will not be permitted. Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 corneal AEs will not be permitted to dose re -escalate. EV should not be administered to subjects with CrCl < 30mL/min. Dose modification recommendations for EV associated toxicity are presented in [ Table A] and [ Table B]. Dose interruptions for other EV associated toxicity is permitted at the discretion of the site investigator. Dose interruptions may last up to 8 weeks (2 cycles). Dose interruptions for subjects who are deriving clinical benefit from treatment may be extended beyond 8 weeks, if the subject’s toxicity does not otherwise require permanent discontinuation. If there is a dose interruption, the schedule for response assessments will not be adjusted."

Recommended dose modification guidelines specific for subjects receiving docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine are detailed below. Dose modifications should also be considered according to local product labels or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and institutional guidel ines. For docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine associated hematologic toxi cities ≥ Grade 3, t ransfusions or growth factors may be used as indicated per institutional guidelines . Docetaxel Dose, Mode of Administration and Dose Modification: Docetaxel will be administered intravenously on Day 1 of every 21 -day cycle. The starting dose of docetaxel 75mg/m2will be administered over 60 -minute period or per local requirement. Refer to local product label or SmPC and institution guidelines for docetaxel for further guidance on docetaxel dosing. Docetaxel should not be given to subjec ts with total bilirubin > ULN, or to subjects wi th AST and/or ALT > 1.5×ULN with concomit ant alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 ×ULN. Subjects with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased ri sk for the development of Grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, infections, severe thrombocytopenia, severe stomatitis, severe skin toxicity, and toxic death. Docetaxel should also not be given to subjects with a neutrophil count of < 1500 cells/mm3. Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel therapy. Subjects should be premedicated with corticosteroids per institutional guidelines prior to each docetaxel administration. Subjects with pre -existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions. Subjects developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures, e.g., salt restriction, oral diuretic(s). Dose interruptions may last up to 6 weeks (2 cycles). Dose interruptions for subjects who are deriving clinical benefit from treatment may be extended beyond 6 weeks, if the subject’s toxicity does not otherwise require permanent discontinuation.

The starting dose of vinflunine 320 mg/m2 will be administered over a 20-minute period (or per local requirement) unless otherwise specified below . In case of WHO/ECOG PS of ≥ 1 or ECOG PS of 0 and prior pelvic irradiation, vinflunine treatment should be started at the dose of 280 mg/m². In the absence of any hematological t oxicity during the first cycle causing treatment delay or dose reduction, the dose may be increased to 320 mg/m² every 21 -days for the subsequent cycles. In subjects with moderate renal impairment (40 mL/min ≤CrCl ≤60 mL/min), the recommended dose is 280mg/m² given once every 21 -day cycle. In subjects with renal impairment (30mL/min ≤CrCl <40mL/min), the recommended dose is 250 mg/m² given once every 21 -day cycle. The recommended dose of vinflunine is 250 mg/m² given once every 21 -day cycle in subjec ts with mild liver impairment (Child -Pugh grade A). The doses recommended in subjects ≥75 years old are as follows: in subjects at least 75 years old but less than 80 years, the dose of vinflunine to be given is 280mg/m² every 21 -day cycle. in subjects 80 years old and beyond, the dose of vinflunine to be given is 250 mg/m² every 21-day cycle. Refer to local product label or SmPC and institution guidelines for vinflunine for further guidance on vinflunine dosing. Dose interruptions may last up to 6 weeks (2 cycles). Dose interruptions for subjects who are deriving clinical benefit from treatment may be extended beyond 6 weeks, if the subject’s toxicity does not otherwise require permanent discontinuation. Please refer to the approved product label for spe cific dose modifications for subjects receiving vinflunine. Paclitaxel Dose, Mode of Administration and Dose Modification: Study treatment of paclitaxel should be administered intravenously on Day 1 of every 21 -day cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed. The starting dose of paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 will be administered as an intravenous infusion administered over 3 hours or per local requirement See guidelines on adjustment of initial dose. Refer to local product label or SmPC and institution guidelines for paclitaxel for further guidance on paclitaxel dosing. All subjects should be premedicated prior to paclitaxel administration per institutional guidelines in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Such premedication may consist of dexamethasone 20 mg orally administered approximately 12 and 6 hour s before paclitaxel, diphenhydramine (or its equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 to60minutes prior to paclitaxel, and cimetidine (300 mg) or ranitidine (50 mg) IV 30 to 60 minutes before paclitaxel. The appropriate premedication regimen may be determined by the inve stigator. Paclitaxel should not be administered to subjects with baseline neutrophil counts of less than 1500 cells/mm3. Subjects should not be re -treated with subsequent cycles of paclitaxel until neutrophils recover to a level > 1500 cells/mm3and platel ets recover to a level > 100000/mm3. Severe conduction abnormalities have been documented in < 1% of subjects during paclitaxel therap y and in some cases requiring pacemaker placement. If subjects develop significant conduction abnormalities during paclita xel infusion, appropriate therap y should be administered and continuous cardiac monitoring should be performed during subsequent therap y with paclitaxel."

The subject is free to withdraw from the study treatment and/or study for any reason and at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice. The investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from study treatment or to terminate a subject's involvement in the study at any time if the subject's clinical condition warrants it. If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event (AE) or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes o r no longer is clinically significant. The following are discontinuation criteria from treatment for individual subjects: Subject develops radiological disease progression. Subject is required to receive another systemic anti -cancer treatment for underlying or new cancer. Subject develops unacceptable toxicity. Female subject becomes pregnant. Investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue. Subject declines further treatment. Subject is noncompliant with the protocol base d on the investigator or medical monitor assessment."

Subjects who discontinue treatment prior to radiological disease progression will enter the post treatment follow -up period and continue to undergo imaging assessments every 56 days (± 7 days) until PFS1 is documented by radiological disease progression or the subject starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. Following PFS1, subj ects will enter the long -term follow up period and be followed per institutional guidelines but not less than every 3 months from the date of the follow -up visit for survival status and progression on next line therapy until PFS2 is documented or the subje ct starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. Subjects will then enter the survival follow -up period. Subjects will be followed every 3 months for survival status until any of the discontinuation criteria for OS are met. The subject wil l be discontinued from the OS post treatment follow -up period if any of the following occur: Subject declines further study participation (i.e., withdraws consent). Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by the investigator to locate the subject. Death. Study termination. Concomitant Medication Restrictions or Requirements: If the investigator determines that any of the following medications are deemed necessary to provide adequate medical support to the subject, the subject must be withdrawn from further administration of the study treatment: Other investigational drugs Chemotherapy or other medications intended for antitumor activity. This does not apply to subjects with a history of breast cancer on adjuvant endocrine therapy, or t o subjects on agents intended for the treatment of bone metastasis (e.g., bisphosphonates, or RANK ligand inhibitors). Radiation therapy Note: Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the bone may be considered on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with Sponsor. The radiated lesion must be a non -target lesion per RECIST V1.1 and the subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field. Arm A (Enfortumab vedotin) Subjects who are receiving strong cytochrom e P450 (CYP)3A4 inhibitors or P -pg inhibitors concomitantly with EV should be closely monitored for adverse reactions. Arm B (Docetaxel) Concomitant use of drugs that strongly inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. Arm B (Vinflunine) Strong inhibitors or inducers of the CYP3A4 enzymes for subjects receiving vinflunine should be avoided. QT/QTc interval prolonging medicinal products should be avoided. Arm B (Paclitaxel) Caution should be exercised when paclitaxel is administered with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8."

Approximately 151000 new cases of urotheli al cancer are diagnosed annually in Europe, with 52000 deaths per year. Over 22000 new cases are diagnosed annuall y in Japan, with 7600 deaths per year [Cancer Fact Sheets, 2017]. According to National Cancer Institute estimates, over 79000 new cases of ur othelial cancer were diagnosed in 2017, and more than 16000 people died from the disease in the United States (US) [SEER Cancer Stat Facts, 2017]. First-line therapy for metastatic urothelial cancer in patients with sufficient renal function consists of c isplatin -based combinations, like methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, which demonstrate overall response rates up to 50%, including approximately 10–15% complete responses (CRs) [Bellmunt et al, 2011]. Despite initial chemosensitivity , patients are not cured and the outcome of metastatic urothelial cancer after these regimens is poor: median time to progression is only 7 months and median overall survival (OS) is 14 months. Approximately 15% of patie nts survive at least 5 years and the prognosis is particularly poor among patients with visceral metastases for whom the 5 -year OS rate is 7% [von der Maase, 2005]. For second line treatment, the small -molecule tubulin inhibitor vinflunine (Javlor®) is approved onl y in Europe. The median OS is 6.9 months compared to a median OS of 4.6months for best supportive care [Bellmunt et al, 2009]. For decades, there were no major changes to the treatment landscape with onl y cytotoxic chemotherapies available, until the recent approvals of immune check point inhibitors (CPI )targeting the programmed death 1/programmed death -ligand 1 (PD -1/PD -L1). As of May 2016, starting with the PD -L1 inhibitor atezolizumab, several CPIs have received FDA approval for urothelial can cer for platinum -pretreated patients in the United States. Most approvals have been based on single arm phase II data [Tecentriq Prescribing Information, Genentech, Apr 2017], [Opdivo Prescribing Information, Bristol -Myers Squibb, September 2017], [I mfinzi Prescribing Information, AstraZeneca, May 2017] and [Bavencio Prescribing Information, EMD Serono, Mar 2017]. However, in 2017, results from the phase III trial KEYNOTE -045 demonstrated that patients treated with pembrolizumab had significantly longer sur vival when compared with the standard second -line chemotherap y [Bellmunt et al, 2017]. This led to the regular approval of pembrolizumab as second line treatment for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC; [Key truda Prescribing Information, Merck, Sep 2017]). The approval was based on a median OS of 10.3 months for pembrolizumab compared with 7.4 months with taxane chemotherap y or vinflunine [Bellmunt et al, 2017]. Marketing approval of CPIs in Europe have followed and approvals in Asia are expected. Other PD -1 and PD -L1 inhibitors are currentl y being evaluated in clinical trials for urothelial cancer, as first and second line therapy [Mullane & Bellmunt, 2016]."

The amino acid sequence of this antibod y is identical to that of enfortumab vedotin (EV), the final product used for clinical development that is derived from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. In addition to having identical amino acid sequences, these 2 antibodies also have comparable pharmacological characteristics, such as binding affinity to Nectin -4, in vitro cy totoxicity , and in vivo antitumor activity [RD12 -001, RD12 -002, RD12 -003, RD12 -004]. Both A GS-22M6E and EV are ADCs comprised of a full y human IgG1 Κ antibody conjugated to the microtubule -disrupting agent MMAE, which targets human Nectin -4, a member of the Nectin family of adhesion molecules. Nectin -4 has been identified as one of the genes mark edly upregulated in bladder cancer tissue [ES10 -005, ES10 -007]. AGS -22M6E specifically binds to human Nectin -4 with high affinity and cross -reacts with cynomolgus monkey and rat orthologs of Nectin -4 [RD10 -013, RD10 -018]. AGS -22M6E does not cross -react wi th other Nectin family members, such as Nectin -1, -2, and -3 [RD10 -015]. In in vitro pharmacology studies, AGS -22M6E inhibited cell survival in a cell line engineered to express human Nectin -4. It was observed that AGS -22M6E was internalized after binding to Nectin -4 on the surface of cells [ES10 -006]. I ntracellular release of MMAE by proteol ytic cleavage induced cell death. Antitumor activity of AGS -22M6E was evaluated in a panel of tumor xenograft models and significantly inhibited the tumor growth in a xenograft model of human bladder cancer [RD10 -009]. 1.2.2 Enfortumab Vedotin Toxicokinetics, immunogenicity and comparability of AGS -22M6E and AGS -22C3E bulk drug substance were evaluated in a 4 -week study comparing AGS -22M6E and AGS -22C3E administered b y intr avenous infusion in cy nomolgus monkey s with a 6 -week recovery period [CRL Study No. 20021751]. The toxicokinetics of the 2 materials, AGS -22M6E and AGS -22C3E were considered to be comparable. Please refer to the I nvestigator’s Brochure for further details . 1.2.3 Enfortumab Vedotin Nonclinical Toxicology In a 4 -week GLP toxicity study in rats [CRL Study No. 20005662], AGS -22M6E (ADC: 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) and AGS -22M6 (unconjugated antibody : 10 mg/kg) were intravenously administered once every week for a total of 4 doses. One animal administered AGS -22M6E at 10 mg/kg was noted with severe abrasions and had loss of body weight, and was found dead on Day 27. AGS -22M6E -related changes mainly included skin abrasion at 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg,"

Decreased indicators of red cell mass (red blood cell [RBC], hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit) and increased reticulocy te count at 5 and 10 mg/kg, were also observed. Increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate amin otransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma -glutamy l transferase (GGT) levels at 5 and 10 mg/kg, decreased testis weight with histopathological changes (tubular epithelial degeneration), and epididy mides (h ypospermia/abnormal spermatids in th e ducts) were observed at all dose levels. Femur bone marrow hy pocellularit y, and skin ulceration and/or epidermal inflammation were seen at 5 and 10 mg/kg dosing. After the 6 -week recovery period, the testicular and epididy mal findings were more severe. B one marrow h ypocellularity and skin ulcers/inflammation resolved in the recovery animals. There were no adverse AGS -22M6 -related findings. A no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) following administration of AGS -22M6E for four weekl y intravenous injectio ns in rats was not established due to the findings noted in the testis. In a 4 -week GLP toxicity study in cy nomolgus monkey s [CRL Study No. 200056640, AGS -22M6E (1, 3 and 6 mg/kg) and AGS -22M6 (6 mg/kg) were administered by intravenous infusion once weekl y for a total of 4 doses. Administration of AGS -22M6E at 1 and 3 mg/kg was generall y well tolerated, however doses of 6 mg/kg led to the unscheduled euthanasia of 3animals on Day 11-13 due to severe dry skin/reddened skin and abrasions. These findings are considered a target -related effect based on the known expression of Nectin -4 in the epidermis of the skin. AGS -22M6E -related findings mainl y included dry /reddened areas on the skin at all dose groups with ulceration, inflammation and hyperkeratosis in the skin at doses 3 mg/kg or more. Bone marrow suppression associated with MMAE toxicity included decreased reticulocy te count and red cell parameters, increased platelet counts, decreased neutrophils, eosinophils, and leukocy te counts at doses 3 mg/kg or mor e. All changes noted showed reversibility after a 6 -week non -treatment period. There were no adverse AGS -22M6 -related findings. The NOAEL for once weekly administration of AGS -22M6E in cy nomolgus monkey s was considered to be 3 mg/kg per day . A 4-week GL Pbridging study in cy nomolgus monkey s [CRL Study No. 20021751] was conducted to evaluate comparability of the hy bridoma cell line -derived product (AGS -22M6E) and the CHO cell line -derived product (AGS -22C3E) when given at the same dose of 3 mg/kg per week . All test article -related effects identified in both AGS -22M6E and AGS -22C3E -dosed animals were at similar incidence and severit y. After a 6 -week non -treatment period, all test article -related effects returned to normal. The data support the conclusion t hat AGS -22M6E and AGS -22C3E demonstrate comparable toxicity profiles and toxicokinetic characteristics, when given at the same 3 mg/kg dose b y intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks to cynomolgus monkey s. In genotoxic studies performed with other in vestigational compounds containing MMAE [ADCETRI S package insert] the MMAE was found to be genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay through an aneugenic mechanism. This effect is consistent with the"

MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) or mouse l ymphoma assay [ADCETRI S package insert]. Maleimide, which is a component of the linker, is reported to be mutagenic in Ames test and mouse ly mphoma ass ay. 1.2.4 Clinical Data A phase 1 dose escalation and expansion study with EV monotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer and other malignant solid tumors is ongoing [Study ASG -22CE - 13-2]. In this study , patients received doses of EV ranging from 0 .5 to 1.25 mg/kg on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. As of the data cut -off date of 02 Oct 2017, 140 metastatic urothelial cancer patients had been enrolled in the phase 1 study . Interim data suggest that EV is generall y well tolerated at doses up t o 1.25 mg/kg. Among metastatic urothelial cancer patients, 137 (98%) experienced a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 122 (87%) of these patients’ TEAEs were deemed possibly or probably related to study drug b y the investigator. The most common TEAEs among metastatic urothelial cancer patients were fatigue (49%), nausea (45%), decreased appetite (39%), alopecia (37%), diarrhea (36%), d ysgeusia (31%), pruritus (29%), anemia (26%), abdominal pain (24%), constipation (24%), vomiting (24%) and weight decreased (20%). Drug doses were reduced in 18 out of 140 metastatic urothelial cancer patients (13%) due to adverse events (AEs), including 16 out of 97 patients (17%) in the 1.25 mg/kg dose group. Drug was withdrawn in 26 out of 140 (19%) metastatic ur othelial cancer patients due to AEs, including 13 out of 97 (13%) from the 1.25 mg/kg dose group. Across all dose levels, drug was withdrawn from 12 out of 140 (8.6%) metastatic urothelial cancer patients due to AEs deemed possibly or probably related to E V. In the 1.25 mg/kg dose group, drug was withdrawn from 6 out of 97 (6%) metastatic urothelial cancer patients due to AEs deemed as possibly or probabl y related to EV. TEAEs leading to stud y drug discontinuation in more than 1 urothelial cancer patient in cluded urosepsis, AST increased, blood creatinine increased, neuropathy peripheral and acute kidney injury (all events occurred in 2 subjects). Fifty -five out of 140 (39%) metastatic urothelial cancer patients experienced at least one treatment emergent serious adverse event (SAE). Sixteen out of 140 (11%) patients had SAEs that were deemed b y the investigator to be possibly or probabl y related to treatment. At the 1.25 mg/kg dose level, 31 out of 97 patients (32%) had at least one treatment emergent SAE. Nine patients (9%) at the 1.25 mg/kg dose level had SAEs that were deemed by the investigator to be possibly or probabl y related to treatment. As of the 02 Oct 2017 data cut - off date, there were 6 fatal TEAEs in 6 out of 140 (4%) metastatic urothelial can cer patients during this study , and 2 events were deemed to be drug -related (1 event of urinary tract obstruction and 1 event of respiratory failure). One patient experienced a serious adverse event of h yperglycemia in conjunction with a drug -related fatal event. Following the data cut -off date, 2 additional treatment -related fatal events were reported in metastatic urothelial patients; 1 patient died of diabetic ketoacidosis and hypergly cemia and the other patient died of multi -organ failure in conjunction with a serious adverse event of"

All active EV study protocols (including the current study ) were amended to address this new safet y information. Preliminary EVdata show encouraging antitumor activity in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer with either post -baseline imaging or who had discontinued treatment before imaging. As of the data cut -off date of 02 Oct 2017, there were 4 CRs and 29 partial responses (PRs) (ORR=27.3%, 33 of 121 patients) across dose levels. The ORR at 1.25 mg/kg (the dose level for the present study ) was 32.1% (25 out of 78 patients). EValso shows promising antitumor activity in metastatic urothelial cancer patients previously treated with CPI s who had either post -baseline imaging or had discontinued treatment before imaging. At the 1.25 mg/kg dose level, the ORR was 31% (17 of 55 patients). A complete summary of the clinical and nonclinical data relevant to the investigational product and its study in hum an subjects is provided in the EV Investigator’s Brochure . 1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Enfortumab Vedotin Overall (data cutoff date 02 Oct 2017), 198 patients received at le ast 1 dose of EV across all studies (Study AGS -22M6E -11-1, Study ASG -22CE -13-2, Study 7465 -CL-0101). AEs of interest for EV are ba sed on current safet y data from clinical studies and known risks with similar ADCs. Among them, the risks i dentified for EV are extravasation site reactions (important identified risk); rash, peripheral neuropathy , diarrhea, nausea and vomiting (identified risks); antitherapeutic antibodies (ATAs ), infusion -related reactions ( IRRs)other than extravasation, anemia and neutropenia, gastrointestinal disorders other than diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, ocular toxicity (corneal disorders), and hy pergl ycemia (pot ential risks). Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for further details. 1.4 Risk Benefit Assessment Subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer that has recurred or progressed following platinum -based chemotherap y present a challeng e. While CPI s offer a new approach to treatment of metastatic urothelial cancer, tumor responses have occurred in a minority of patients and the improvement in long -term survival is only a few months. Most patients with locally advanced or metastatic uroth elial cancer do not respond to CPI s and many who do respond ultimately develop disease progression [Rosenberg, 2016]. Currently , no therapies are approved for patients previousl y treated with a CPI. Although taxanes are not approved in this setting; they are a common choice for third line treatment (and were a standard second line treatment before atezolizumab was approved). Taxanes have response rates of approximately 10% as second line therapy , with progression -free survival (PFS) and OS of only 3.3 month s and 7.4 months, respectively [Bellmunt et al, 2017]. Vinflunine is approved onl y in Europe and has an equally low response rate of 9% and a trend toward survival benefit when compared with best supportive care [Bellmunt et al, 2009]. No data are currentl y available regarding the clinical activity of taxanes or vinflunine in the third line setting after CPI therapy . The lack of approved therapies for patients with mUC after"

The potential risks associated with EV are outlined in [Sections 1.2.3 , 1.2.4 , and 1.3], and in the Investigator’s Brochure. The potential risks associated with the chemotherapy comparators are well characterized and are outlined in [Section 5.1Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other Medication(s) ], for more detailed information, please refer to their respective local product label. Clinical data to date support a favorable benefit -risk ratio for EV in patients with local ly advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who previously received CPI therapy .Evidence of clinical activit y has been observed in other single arm studies of EV (described in [Section 1.2.4 Clinical Data ]) and this may translate into an improvement in effectiveness over the control arm. However, there may still be no direct benefit to subjects participating in the current clinical trial. To assur e an ongoing favorable risk/benefit assessment for subjects enrolled into the study , an I ndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be utilized to monitor safety data and interim efficacy analy sis. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS 2.1 Study Objec tive(s) 2.1.1 Primary Objective To compare the OS of subjects with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with EV to the OS of patients treated with chemotherap y. 2.1.2 Secondary Objectives ●To compare progression free survival on study therapy (PFS1) perResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) V1.1 of subjects treated with EV to patients treated with chemotherap y ●To compare the overall response rate (ORR) per RECI ST V1.1 of EV to chemotherapy ●To evaluate the duration of response (DOR) per RECI ST V1.1 of EV and chemotherap y ●To compare the disease control rate (DCR) per RECI ST V1.1 of EV to chemotherapy ●To assess the safet y and tolerability of EV ●To assess quality of life (QOL) and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) parameters 2.1.3 Exploratory Objectives ●Exploratory genomic and/or other biomarkers in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood that may correlate with treatment outcome, including Nectin -4 expression ●To assessthe pharmacokinetics of EV (TAb, ADC and MMAE) ●To assess the incidence of ATA ●To evaluate PFS as assessed by RECIST V1.1 by investigator review in the next line of therap y (PFS2) in subjects treated with EV compared to docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflun ine. ●Healthcare resources utilization (HRU)"

Subjects who discontinued CPI treatment due to toxicity are eligible provided that they have evidence of disease progression following discontinuation. Approximately 600 subjects will be randomized to EV (Arm A) or chemotherapy (Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified according to the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), region s of the world and liver metastasis. OS is the primary endpoint. OS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of death. Secondary endpoints include PFS1, ORR, DOR, DCR, safet y and QOL/PRO. Subjects in Arm A will receive EV on Day s 1, 8 and 15 of each 28 -day cycle. Subjects in arm B will receive docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine as decided b y the investigator prior to randomization, (vinflunine is a choice of comparator only in countries where it is approved for urothelial cancer) on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle. Within the control arm, the overall proportion of subjects receiving vinflunine will be capped at approximately 35%. Subjects will continue to receive study treatment until radiological disease progression as determined per investigator assessment or other discontinuation criteria are met or upon study termination, or study completion, whichever occurs first. No on -study crossover will be allowed other than as allowed in [Appendix 12.10 ].Subjects assigned to the chemotherap y arm will not be allowed to switch to a different chemotherap y treatment during stud y treatment. This study will consist of three phases: screening, treatment and follow -up. Screening will take place up to 28 day s prior to randomization. Screening assessments may be repeated within the 28 -day screening period. Subjects do not need to be “screen failed” in IRT and re -entered in screening with a new subject ID as long as the subje ct is enrolled within the 28 -day window from signing of the informed consent. If more than 28 day s elapses from the date of signing the informed consent, the subject must be screen failed in IRT. A new consent must be signed and the subject entered into sc reening with a new subject ID. Subjects may only be rescreened once. Subjects will start with cy cle1 and continue on to subsequent 21 -day or 28 -day cycles until one of the discontinuation criteria are met or upon study termination, or study completion, whichever occurs first. A treatment cy cle is defined as 28 day s for Arm A and 21 days for Arm B. Subjects will be evaluated for response according to RECI ST V1.1. Imaging for both arms will be performed at baseline and every 56 day s (± 7 day s) from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study until PFS1 is documented by radiological disease progression or the subject is lost to follow -up, death, withdraws study consent or starts a subsequent anti - cancer therap y. Baseline imaging performed prior to informed consent as standard of care"

All subjects will have a bone scan (scintigraph y) performed at screening/baseline. Subjects with positive bone scans at baseline will have a bone scan performed every 56 day s (±7 day s) throughout the study or more frequently if clinical ly indicated. Subjects should have a follow -up bone scan performed if clinically indicated regardless of baseline status. Brain scans (computed tomograph y [CT] with contrast/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ]) will only be performed if clinically indicated a t screening/baseline and repeated as clinically indicated or per standard of care throughout the study . QOL assessments and PRO will be collected at protocol -specified time points from all randomized subjects. The following validated tools will be used: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ -C30) and EuroQOL 5 -dimension 5 -Level Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L). HRU information will be collected at protocol -specified time points with particular focus o n the number of subjects who have an unplanned use of healthcare resources related to clinical or AEs from subjects assigned to treatment arms A and B. Blood samples for pharmacokinetics and ATA will be collected throughout the study for subjects randomize d into Arm A. Validated assays will be used to measure the concentrations of EV ADC and monomethy lauristatin E (MMAE) in serum or plasma and to assess ATA. Pharmacokinetic samples will not be collected from subjects randomized into Arm B. Samples for explo ratory biomarkers will be collected at protocol -specified time points. Biomarker assessments will not be used for subject selection. Following discontinuation from study drug, subjects will have a follow -up visit 30 day s (+7days) after their last dose of drug for safety assessments. If a subject discontinues study drug prior to radiographic disease progression (i.e., PFS1), the subject should enter the post - treatment follow -up period and continue to undergo imaging assessments every 56 day s (±7days) until PFS1 is documented, or the subject starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. Following PFS1, subjects will enter the long -term follow -up period and be followed per institutional guidelines but not less than every 3months from th e date of the follow -up visit for survival status and progression status on subsequent therap y (i.e., PFS2). Subjects will be followed until PFS2 is documented or the subject starts another anticancer treatment, whichever occurs earlier. All subsequent an ticancer therap y including date and site of progression for PFS2 will be recorded on the case report form. Following PFS2, subjects will enter the survival follow -up period and be followed every 3months for survival status until death, lost to follow -up,withdrawal of study consent, or study termination by sponsor. This study is expected to end once final survival anal ysis is complete. Subjects will be eligible to continue receiving treatment in this study until they meet a discontinuation criterion as ou tlined in [Section 6Discontinuation] or upon study termination, or study completion, whichever occurs first."

This dose and regimen has demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile and encouraging clinical activity in the phase 1 study [Study ASG -22CE -13-2], whic h evaluated escalating dose levels of 0.5, 0.75, 1 and 1.25 mg/kg, with expansion cohorts at the 0.75, 1, and 1.25 mg/kg dose levels. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in this study . At the 1 mg/kg dose level, 2 dose- limiting toxicities (DL Ts)were observed: Grade 3 proctalgia (later changed to grade 2 by the investigator) thought related to radiation recall and Grade 4 h yperuricemia without clinical sequelae. No DLT was observed at 1.25 mg/kg and doses above 1.25 mg/kg were not tested. Inciden ce of some of the most frequent drug -related AEs, such as diarrhea and rash, although primarily Grades 1 –2 and clinically manageable, increased with increasing dose levels. Moreover, dose reductions due to AEs were more frequent for the 1.25 mg/kg vs lower dose levels. Safet y assessments of both metastatic urothelial cancer patients and non -metastatic urothelial cancer patients showed that frequency of all TEAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, and Grade 3 –4 TEAEs were comparable across all dose levels. While al l doses of EV demonstrated activity , the 1.25 mg/kg dose was associated with the highest activity and had an acceptable safet y profile. Based on pharmacokinetic data from the phase 1 study [Study ASG -22CE -13-2], the half -life of EV is ~ 1–2 day s. No not able (< 30%) intra -cycle accumulation of ADC was observed with the current dosing regimen (on Day s 1, 8 and 15 of every 28-day cycle) at an y dose level. Minimal (< 50%) intra -cycle accumulation of MMAE was observed. I t is anticipated that the dosing schedu le in the study will maintain ADC exposures over each 28 -day cycle, contributing to a favorable balance of activity and safet y, as observed in the phase 1 trial [Study ASG -22CE -13-2]. In summary , the dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg on Day s 1, 8 and 15 of each 2 8-day cycle proposed for this study has demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile and encouraging clinical activity that was higher than at lower dose levels. Comparators There is no accepted standard of care following CPI treatment for locally advanced or mUC; however, prior to CPI approvals, taxanes were commonly used following platinum -based therap y as recommended in the treatment guidelines [NCCN, 2017; ESMO, 2017].

KEYNOTE -045, a multicenter, randomized, active -controlled trial in patients with locally advanced or mUC with disease progression on or after platinum -containing chemotherap y, compared pembrolizumab to in vestigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine every 3 weeks [Bellmunt et al, 2017]. Although no labeled dosing guidelines for taxanes are available in this setting, this is the only large randomized trial that has reported combined survival d ata for these agents, as such the current phase 3 stud y of enfortumab vs chemotherapy will use the same choice of comparators and their corresponding doses. Patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm in the KEYNOTE -045 study were treated with paclitaxel ( 175 mg/m2), docetaxel (75 mg/m2) or vinflunine (320 mg/m2), administered intravenously every 3 weeks. The overall proportion of subjects receiving vinflunine in the control arm was capped at approximately 35% (KEYNOTE protocol). 2.3 Endpoints 2.3.1 Primary Endpoint s ●OS 2.3.2 Secondary Endpoints ●PFS1 by RECI ST V1.1 ●ORR (CR + PR) by RECIST V1.1 ●DCR (CR +PR+SD) by RECI ST V1.1 ●DOR by RECIST V1.1 ●Safety variables (e.g., AEs, laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG and ECOG PS) ●QOL and PRO parameters (QLQ -C30 and EQ -5D-5L) 2.3.3 Exploratory Endpoints ●Exploratory genomic and/or other biomarkers in tumor tissue and in peripheral blood that may correlate with treatment outcome, including Nectin -4 expression ●Plasma or serum concentrations of TAb, ADC and MMAE ●Incidence of ATA to EV ●PFS2 ●HRU"

Although the exact etiology of dermatologic toxicities associated with EV is unclear at this time, due to the expression of nectin -4 in the skin, rash may be an on target toxicity . The most common ty pe of dermatological AE reported in ASG -22CE -13-2 was maculo -papular rash, rash, skin exfoliation, and skin pigmentation disorder. Most occurred earl y on (during cycle1), and some were associated with pruritus. Mild rash due to EV should be treated using local supportive care as needed. Topical corticosteroids have been used along with antihistamines for pruritus as needed. Grade 3 rash that is not limiting self-care activities of daily living or associated with infection requiring sy stemic antibiotics does not require treatment interruption, provided sy mptoms are not severe and can be managed with supportive treatment. Management of Hyperglycemia Investiga tors should monitor blood glucose levels and are advised to perform additional assessments if an y symptoms of hy pergl ycemia are observed, including a thorough evaluation for infection. In addition, if steroids are used to treat an y other condition, blood glucose levels may require additional monitoring. If elevated blood glucose levels are observed, subjects should be treated according to local standard of care and referral to endocrinology may be considered. Subjects, especiall y those with a history of or ongoing diabetes mellitus or hy pergly cemia, should be advised to immediately notify their phy sician if their glucose level becomes difficult to control or if they experience s ymptoms suggestive of hy pergl ycemia such as frequent urination, increased thirst, blurred vision, fatigue, and headache. Subjects who enter the study with an elevated HbA1c (≥ 6.5%) at baseline should be referred to an appropriate provider during C ycle 1 for glucose management. Blood glucose should be checked prior to each dosing and d ose should be withheld for blood glucose > 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L ) (Grade 3 or higher). Dosing may continue once the subject’s blood glucose has improved to ≤ Grade 2 and subject is clinically and metabolicall y stable. Blood glucose >500mg/dL (27.8 mmol/ L) (Grade 4) considered related to EV requires treatment discontinuation. I f a subject experiences new onset diabetes mellitus, evaluate subjects with a metabolic panel, urine ketones, gl ycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide to assess for new onset ty pe 1 d iabetes in the setting of prior CPI . Management of Enfortumab Vedotin Infusion Related Reactions (IRR) An IRR may occur during the infusion of study treatment. The infusion should be administered at a site properly equipped and staffed to manage anaphy laxis should it occur. All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care should be given throughout the study according to institutional standards. Supportive measures may include administering medications for IRRs."

Imaging for both Arms will be performed at screening/baseline and every 56 day s (±7days) from the first dose of study treatment throughout the study . Baseline imaging performed prior to informed consent as standard of care may be used so long as it is pe rformed within 28 days prior to randomization. All subjects will have a bone scan (scintigraphy ) performed at screening/baseline. Subjects with positive bone scans at baseline will have a bone scan performed every 56days (±7days) throughout the study ormore frequently if clinically indicated. Subjects with negative bone scans at baseline should have a bone scan performed if clinically indicated throughout the study even if not positive at baseline. Brain scans (CTwith contrast/MRI) will only be perform ed if clinically indicated at screening/baseline and repeated as clinicall y indicated or per standard of care throughout the study. If a subject discontinues study drug prior to radiological disease progression, the subject should continue to undergo imagi ng assessments every 56 day s (±7days) until disease progression is documented, or the subject starts another anticancer treatment whichever occurs earlier. A CT scan with contrast (chest and abdomen) is the preferred modality for tumor assessment. Magne tic resonance imaging is acceptable if local standard practice or if CT scans are contraindicated in a subject (e.g., subject is allergic to contrast media). All other RECI ST- approved scanning methods such as x -ray are optional. Additional instructions for imaging assessments can be found in the study procedures manual. The assessment will include tumor measurements for target lesions, nontarget lesions and an y new lesions. An overall assessment will be characterized for a given time point evaluation. At the end of stud y for that subject, the best overall response to the study regimen will be characterized. To ensure comparability , the screening and subsequent assessment of response should be performed using identical techniques. The same individual should a ssess images for an y 1 subject for the duration of the study if possible. For subjects with known brain metastases at stud y entr y, it is recommended that repeat imaging also include the brain and the same methods used to detect brain lesions at Baseline ar e to be used to follow the lesions throughout the stud y.

An y pathological l ymph nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm from baseline measurement. 5.3.1.2 Partial Response PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesio ns, short axis for nodal lesions) of target lesions taking as reference to the baseline sum of diameters. 5.3.1.3 Stable Disease SD is defined as neither sufficient decrease to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease taking as ref erence the smallest sum of diameters while on study drug. 5.3.1.4 Progressive Disease PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) of the target lesions taking as reference the smalle st sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study ). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. The appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression. 5.3.2 Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions To achieve unequivocal progression on the basis of nontarget lesions, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in nontarget disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR of target lesions, the o verall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy . A modest increase in the size of 1 or more nontarget lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression. 5.3.2.1 Complete Response For CR of nontarget lesions , subjects must have disappearance of all nontarget lesions and all lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). 5.3.2.2 NonCR/NonPD NonCR/NonPD of nontarget lesions is defined as persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesions."

Biochemistry Sodium (Na), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Chloride (Cl), Phosphate (P), Serum Creatinine, Glucose (Gl), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), ALP, AST, ALT, Lactate Dehydrogenase ( LDH), Bilirubin (total and direct), Total Protein (TP), Albumin (Alb), Bicarbonate (HCO3), Amylase, Lipase, Uric Acid, Hemoglobin A1c (screening only), Serum HCG for female subjects of childbearing potential Hematology Red Blood Cell Count (RBC), Hematocrit (Hct), Hemoglobin (Hgb), Platelets, white blood cell count (WBC)/differential (Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes), Urinalysis Pregnancy HbA1c Laboratory tests will be performed predose according to the Schedule of Assessments and sent to a central laboratory for anal ysis. All screening labs must be sent to the central laboratory , but local laboratory results may be used to determine eligibility if the screening results from the central l aboratory are not available in time for planned randomization. I n the event that the central laboratory results received after randomization are not within eligibility parameters, the subject will still be considered eligible if local labs met the eligibil ity criteria and will not be considered a protocol deviation. Local laboratory results that support eligibility and dosing decisions must be entered into the clinical database. If local laboratory is to be used to support dosing decisions, local laboratory tests will include complete blood count with differential, glucose, serum creatinine, AL T and AST. In case of multiple laboratory data within this period, the most recent data should be used. Laboratory assessments collected outside of -7 day s of randomiz ation should be repeated. Additional assessments may be done centrall y or locally to monitor AEs or as required by dose modification requirements. Assessment of creatinine clearance or estimation of GFR per institutional guidelines should be performed pri or to administration of vinflunine and EV as recommended in [Section 5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s) ]. Additional laborato ry tests should be performed according to institutional standard of care. Clinical significance of out -of-range laboratory findings is to be determined and documented by the investigator/sub -investigator who is a qualified phy sician."

For subsequent and end of treatment (EOT) visits, phy sical examinations may be more directed but should include examination of lungs, abdomen, skin, and cardiovascular s ystem. Phy sical examinations will be conducted at visits as outlined in the Schedule of Asse ssments ( Table 1). Each ph ysical examination will include weight; height is only required at Screening. If clinically significant worsening of findings from Baseline is noted at any study visit, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. Clinical significance is defined as an y variation in physical findings that has medical relevance that could result in an alteration in medical care. The investigator will continue to monitor the subject until the parameter returns to Grade ≤1, or to the Baseline condition, or until the investigator determines that follow up is no longer medically necessary . 5.5.5 Ophthalmology Examination Ophthalmologic assessment for subjects with recent ocular complaints (within 3 months of screening) are required. Assessments should include the following: visual acuity , slit lamp, tonometry examination, and dilated fundus examination. Prior ophthalmologic exam done within 3 months of screening is acceptable provided sy mptoms are not new since the exam. Ophthalmology assessments during treatment should be performed per standard of care or if clinically indicated (e.g., subject develops new or worsening ocular sy mptoms). EOT slit lamp examinations are required for subjects who experience corneal adverse events during the study . EOT slit lamp examinations must be performed ≥ 4 weeks from last dose. Additional ey e examinations are to be conducted as clinically indicated. 5.5.6 Electrocardiogram A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed and assessed using local standard procedures according to the schedule of assessments in Table 1. Clinically significant abnormal findings at screening should be recorded as medical history . 5.6 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects 5.6.1 Definition of Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product. In order to identify any events that may be associated with study procedures and could lead to a change in the conduct of the study , Astellas collects AEs even if the subject has not received study drug treatment. AE collect ion begins after the signing of the informed consent and will be collected until 30 day s after the last dose of study drug."

Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safet y assessment which is associated with the underl ying disease does not require reporting as an (S)AE, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition. Repeating an abnormal laboratory test or other safety assessment, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determi ned to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. 5.6.1.2 Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury Refer to [Appendix 12.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment] for detailed instructions on Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI). Abnormal values in AST and/or ALT concurrent or with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin that meet the criteria outlined in [Appendix 12.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment] ,in the absence of other causes of liver injury , are considered potential cases of drug -induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and are always to be considered important medical events and reported per [Section 5.6.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events]. 5.6.1.3 Disease Progression and Study Endpoints Under this protocol, the following event(s) will not be considered as an(S)AE: ●Disease Progression: events including defined study endpoints that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease are not to be recorded as AEs unless resulting in death. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data as outli ned in [Section 5.3Efficacy Assessments ]. If there is an y uncertainty as to whether an event is due to anticipated disease progression and/or if t here is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the stud y drug and the event, it should be reported as an (S)AE. All deaths within 30 day s of the last dose of study drug must be reported as SAEs. ●Pre-planned and elective hospitalizations or pro cedures for diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the course of the clinical trial. These procedures are collected per the eCRFs Completion Guidelines."

It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) ●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions ●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect ●Requires inpatient hospitalization (except for planned procedures as allowed per study ) or leads to prolongation of hospitalization (except if prolongation of planned hospitalization is not caused by an AE). Hospitalization for treatment/observation/examin ation caused b y AE is to be considered as serious.) ●Other medicall y important events (defined in paragraph below) Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as impor tant medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These events, including t hose that may result in disability /incapacit y, usually are considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The sponsor has a list of events that they classify as “alway s serious” events. I f an AE is reported that is considered to be an event per this classification as “alway s serious”, additional information on the event may be requested. 5.6.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to Study Drug The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the stud y drug and each occurrence of each (S)AE. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. The investigator should also use the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products. The investigator is requested to provide an explanation for the causality assessment for each SAE and must document this on the SAE worksheet. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The investigator may revise his/her assessment of causality in light of new information regarding the SAE and shall send an SAE follow -up report and update the eCRF with the new information and updated causality assessment. Following a review of the relevant data, the causal relationship between the study drug and each (S)AE will be assessed by answering ‘ yes’ or ‘ no’ to the question “ Do you consider"

When making an assessment of causalit y, the following factors are to be considered when deciding if there is evidence and/or arguments to suggest there is a ‘reasonable possibility ’ that an (S)AE may have been caused by the study drug (rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out) or if there is evidence to reasonabl y deny a causal relationship: ●Plausible temporal relationship between exposure to the study drug and (S)AE onset and/or resolution. Has the subject actually received the study drug? Did the (S)AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the study drug? ●Plausibility ; i.e., could the event been caused by the study drug? Consider biologic and/or pharmacologic mechanism, half -life, literature evidence, drug class, preclinical and clinical study data, etc. ●Dechallenge/Dose reduction/Rechallenge: ○Did the (S)AE resolve or improve after stopping or reducing the dos e of the suspect drug? Also consider the impact of treatment for the event when evaluating a dechallenge experience. ○Did the (S)AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? ●Laboratory or other test results; a specific lab investigation supports the assessment of the relationship between the (S)AE and the stud y drug (e.g., based on values pre -, during and post -treatment) ●Available alternative explanations independent of study drug exposure; such as other concomitant drugs, past medical history , concurrent or underl ying disease, risk factors including medical and family history , season, location, etc. and strength of the alternative explanation There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has mini mal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor. With limited or insu fficient information about the event to make an informed judgment and in absence of any indication or evidence to establish a causal relationship, a causalit y assessment of ‘no’ is to be considered. In such instance, the investigator is expected to obtain additional information regarding the event as soon as possible and to re -evaluate the causality upon receipt of additional information. 5.6.4 Criteria for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be grad ed using the NCI -CTCAE guidelines (Version 4.03). The items that are not stipulated in the NCI -CTCAE Version 4.03 will be assessed according to the criteria below and entered into the eCRF."

The current version of the core instrument (QLQ -C30, Version 3) is a 30 -item questionnaire consisting of the following: ●functional domains (ph ysical, role, cognitive, emotional, social); ●3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea & vomiting); ●Single items for s ymptoms (shortness of breath, loss of appetite, sleep disturbance, constipation, diarrhea) and financial impact of the disease; and ●2 global items (health, overall QOL). 5.8.6 EuroQOL -5 Dimensions The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQOL Group for use as a generic, preference -based measure of health outcomes. I t is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatmen ts and provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for health status. The EQ -5D-5L is a 5 -item self -reported measure of functioning and well-being, which assesses 5 dimensions of health, including mobility , self -care, usual activities, p ain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression. Each dimension comprises 5 levels (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems). A unique EQ -5D-5L health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5dimensions. Th is questionnaire also records the respondent’s self -rated health status on a vertical graduated (0 to 100) visual analogue scale. Responses to the 5 items will also be converted to a weighted health state index (utility score) based on values derived from general population samples [Herdman, 2011]. 5.8.7 Healthcare Resource Utilization (HRU) HRU information will be collected with particular focus on the number of subjects who have an unplanned use of healthcare resources related to clinical events or AEs from al l subjects [Appendix 12.7]. 5.9 Total Amount of Blood The total amount of blood collected for study assessments for each subject will vary depending on how long the subject stay s on treatment. At any time during the study , if an y laboratory abnormalities are found for a subject or for disease assessment, additional blood may be drawn for monitoring."

The maximum amount of blood collected is approximately 130.0 mL in Cycle 1 for subjects randomized to Arm A and 37.0 mL in Cy cle 1 for subjects randomized to Arm B. The maximum amount of blood collected for subjects that participate from Cy cle 2 up to Cy cle 6 and complete the EOT visit is 219.0 mL for subjects rand omized to Arm A and 164.0 mL for subjects randomized to Arm B. 6 DISCONTINUATION 6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s) A discontinuation from treatment is a subject who enrolled in the study and for whom study treatment is permanently discontinued for an y reason. The subject is free to discontinue from study treatment and/or withdraw from the study for any reason and at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice. The investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from study treatment or to terminate a subject 's involvement in the study at any time if the subject 's clinical condition warrants it. All subjects who discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol speci fic follow up procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) until the subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will att empt to provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically significant. The following are discontinuation criteria from treatment for individual subjects: ●Subject develops radiological disease progression. ●Subject is required to receive another s ystemic anti -cancer treatment for underly ing or new cancer. ●Subject develops unacceptable toxicity . ●Female subject becomes pregnant. ●Investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue. ●Subject declines further treatment. ●Subject is noncompliant with the protocol based on the investigator or medical monitor assessment. ●Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by the investigator to locate the subject. ●Death."

The SAP will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled. Any changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be justified in the Clinical Study Report. In general, continuous data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, minimum, median and maximum), and frequency and percentage for categorical data. 7.1 Sample Size Approximately 600 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment arms: EV (Arm A) and chemotherapy (Arm B). Randomization will be stratified by baseline ECOG PS (0 vs 1), regions of the world (Western EU, US or the rest of world) and liver metastasis (y es or no). Assuming HR =0.75 (median OS in Arm A and Arm B are 10.7 months and 8months, respectivel y) drop -out rate of 10%, the final anal ysis at the pla nned 439 death events and 1 interim analysis at 65% of the total planned events (285 death events), this sample size will provide 85% power to detect a statistically significant difference at overall type I error rate of 1 -sided 0.025. Sample size is deter mined by primary endpoint OS; the 600 subjects will provide more than 90% power to detect statistically significant differences on selected secondary endpoints: PFS1(assuming median PFS1 in Arm A and Arm B are 6 months and 4 months, respectivel y), ORR and DCR (assuming 15% treatment difference between Arm A and Arm B for both ORR and DCR). 7.2 Analysis Sets Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in SAP or Classification Specifications and the allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determi ned prior to database hard -lock. 7.2.1 Full Analysis Set The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all subjects who are randomized. This analy sis set is in compliance with the intent to treat (ITT) principle that includes all randomized subjects, the FAS is e quivalent to the ITT population. This will be the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses except for response related efficacy endpoints . 7.2.2 Safety Analysis Set The safet y analysis set (SAF), which consists of all subjects who received any amount of study drug, will be used for safet y anal yses. 7.2.3 Response Evaluable Set The response evaluable set (RES) is defined as all subjects in FAS and with measurable disease (per RECI ST V1.1) at baseline . RES will be used for primary efficacy anal ysis of response related endpoints, e.g., ORR and DCR."

Ethnic origin wi ll only be summarized in demographic table. Descriptive statistics will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum for continuous endpoints, and frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints. 7.3.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects who completed and discontinued treatment and reasons for treatment discontinuation will be presented for all randomized subjects and for subjects in the SAF b y treatment group and overall. Similar tables for screenin g disposition, investigational period disposition and follow -up disposition will also be presented for all randomized subjects by treatment group and overall. All disposition details and dates of first and last evaluations for each subject will be listed. 7.3.2 Previous and Concomitant Medications All previous and concomitant medications will be presented in a listing. The frequency of concomitant medications (prescription, over -the-counter and nutritional supplements) will be summarized by treatment group and p referred term (PT) for SAF. Medications will be coded using the WHO drug dictionary . Medications will be counted by the number of subjects who took each medication. A subject taking the same medication multiple times will only be counted once for that medi cation. Medications will be presented in decreasing order of frequency based on the total number of subjects who took each medication. 7.3.3 Medical History Medical history for each subject will be presented in a listing. A detailed medical history for each sub ject will be obtained during screening period and will be summarized by treatment group and overall. 7.4 Analysis of Efficacy Efficacy anal ysis for OS and PFS will be conducted on the FAS. The interpretation of results from statistical tests will be based on the FAS. Efficacy anal ysis for response related endpoints, e.g., ORR and DCR will be conducted on RES. Thefamil y-wise t ype I error rate for this study is strongl y controlled at 2.5% (one -sided) that allows the study to declare positive on primary endpoint OS on the FAS population. OS will be formall y tested at both interim analysis and final analysis.

ORR and DCR will be tested only once after both OS and PFS1 are rejected (at either interim analysisor final analy sis) and the test statistics will be computed from the interim data. DCR will be tested after ORR is rejected. The details about the significance levels at interim analysis and final analy sis for each efficacy endp oints (OS, PFS1, ORR and DCR) are specified in SAP. 7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint of OS will be analyzed using the log -rank test stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), regions of the world (Western EU, US or the rest of world) and liver metastasis (y es or no). Randomized treatment and the strata used for randomization will be used for the anal ysis. In addition, the stratified Cox prop ortional hazard model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval .The median OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and will be reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval b y treatm ent arm. The primary anal ysis will be performed using the FAS. 7.4.1.2 Sensitivity Analysis Additional analy ses such as unstratified log -rank test and OS anal yses adjusting the crossover effect may be conducted, if appropriate. Details will be specified in the SA P. 7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 7.4.2.1 Progression Free Survival For each subject, PFS1 is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of radiological disease progression ( per RECIST V1.1) , or until death due to any cause. If a subject h as neither progressed nor died, the subject will be censored at the date of last radiological assessment. Subjects who receive an y further anticancer therapy for the disease before radiological progression will be censored at the date of the last radiologi cal assessment before the anticancer therap y started. In addition, subject s who have PD or death after 2 or more missed disease assessments willbe censored at the last disease assessment prior to the 2 or more missed disease assessments . The efficacy endp oint of PFS1 will be analy zed using the log -rank test stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), regions of the world (Western EU, US or the rest of world) and liver metastasis (yes or no). Randomized treatment and the strata used for randomization will be used for t he analysis. In addition, stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

The stud y ma y be closed within a participating country per local regulations once the study has completed, if all subjects enrolled in the country are no longer receiving study treatment and once final survival anal ysis is completed. 8.2 Ethics and Protection of Subject Confidentiality 8.2.1 Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics Committee /Comp etent Authorities Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, an y protocol amendments, the Investigator’s Brochure, the informed consent and all o ther forms of subject information related to the stud y (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and an y other necessary documents be reviewed by an IEC/I RB. The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted. IEC/I RB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site. Any substantial amendments to the protocol will r equire IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation of the changes made to the stud y design at the site. The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive stud y essential documents according to ICH GCP. Any SAEs that meet reporting criteria, as dictated by local regulations, will be reported to both responsible ethics committees and regulatory agencies, as required. During the conduct of the study , the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., I CH Expedited Reports, and an y add itional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of an y changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects. Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/I RB should also be provided to sponsor."

Testing should be repeated within 72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for which a central laboratory is used, alerts will be generated b y the central laboratory regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality to inform the investigator, study monitor and study team. Subjects should be asked if they have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction. Definition of Liver Abnormalities Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN: ALT or AST Total Bilirubin Moderate >3 ×ULN (in patients without liver metastases), > 5 ×ULN (in patients with liver metastases)or >2 ×ULN Severe >3 ×ULN and >2 ×ULN In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for an y of the following: ●ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN. ●ALTor AST > 5 ×ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metastases). ●ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN and International Normalized Ratio (I NR) > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated). ●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). The inves tigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described above, may qualify as moderate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and follow -up. Follow -up Procedures Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , phy sical examination and laboratory tests. The site should complete the liver abnormality case report form (LA -CRF) that has bee n developed globall y and can be activated for any study or appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should be followed as described below. Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 to 3 times weekly then weekl y or less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic."

The sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe hepatic liver function abnormalities possibly attributable to study drug are observed. To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the investigator is expected to: ●Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms and new -onset diseases is to be recorded as “AEs” in the (e)CRF. I llnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and decompensated card iac disease that may lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients and may be associated with fluctuating AT levels. The investigator should ensure that t he medical history form captures an y illness that predates stud y enrollment that may be relevant in assessing hepatic function. ●Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, complementary and alternative medications), alco hol use, recreational drug use and special diets. Medications, including dose, is to be entered in the (e)CRF. Information on alcohol, other substance use and diet should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document. ●Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. ●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may be appropriate including: oAcute viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E or other infectious agents), oUltrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease, oOther laboratory tests including INR, direct bilirubin. ●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. ●Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document. Study Discontinuation In the absence of an explanation f or increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, preexisting or acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may be discontinued from the study . The investigator may determine that it i s not in the subject’s best interest to continue study enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: ●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN. ●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metastases). ●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated). ●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 ×ULN in patients with liver metastases). ●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or ten derness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%)."

Evidence that a drug can cause hepatoc ellular -type injury , generally shown by a higher rate than control of people with 3 ×and greater transaminase elevations over the upper limit of normal (2 ×elevations are too common in treated and untreated patients to be discriminating). 2. Cases of inc reased bilirubin (to at least 2 ×ULN) in people with concomitant transaminase elevation to at least 3 ×ULN (but it is almost invariabl y higher) and no evidence of intra -or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated alkaline phosphatase) or Gilbert’s s yndrome. [Temple, 2006] 1. The drug causes hepatocellular injury , generally shown by a higher incidence of 3 -fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (nonhepatotoxic) control drug or placebo. 2. Among trial subjects showing such AT e levations, often with ATs much greater than 3×ULN, one or more also show elevation of serum TBL to > 2 ×ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum ALP). 3. No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased AT and TBL , such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; preexisting or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury [Guidance for Industry, 2009 ].

Through investigation of PGx by technologies such as genot yping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies, the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy or toxicity may be better understood. As man y diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic variations, PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determini ng the way a subject may or may not respo nd to a drug. OBJECTIVES The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance to clinical response, pharmacokinetics and toxicity /safet y issues. By anal yzing genetic variations, it may be possible to predict an individual subject’s response to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity . SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N Subjects who have consented to participate in this study may participate in this PGx sub - study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide written consent prior to providing an y blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analy sis. SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE Subjects who consent to participate in this s ub-study will provide one approximately 4-6 mL tube of whole blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by the unique subject number (first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly from site or via a central laboratory as directed b y Astellas. PGxANALYSIS Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may initiate the PGx analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing the drug’s kinetics, efficacy and/or safety. DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES / DATA All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y database hardlock. If ther e is no requirement for analy sis, the whole blood sample will be destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be destroy ed. Th e results of any PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will be retained at Astellas indefinitely ."

Amylase and lipase will only be collected at COE Day 1 of each Cycle. All biochemistry laboratory tests should be collected at the start of the following COE time points: C1D1 , C1D8, C1D15 and D1of each subsequent cycle. If all biochemistry laboratory tests were performed within 7 days prior to the first day of dosing, they do not need to be repeated at C1D1 . Biochemistry tests will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local laboratory results may be used to determine eligibility if the C1D1 results from the central laboratory are not available in time for planned C1D1 dosing . In the event that the central laboratory results received after C1D1 dosing are not w ithin eligibility parameters, the subject w ill still be considered eligible, if local labs met the eligibility criteria, and will n ot be considered a protocol deviation. Local laboratory results that support eligibility and dosing decisions must be entere d into the clinical database. If local laboratory is to be used to support dosing decisions, local laboratory tests will include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, glucose, serum creatinine , ALT and AST. Additional assessments may be done centra lly or locally to monitor AEs or as required by dose modification requirements. 10. If HbA1c was performed within 7 days prior to the first day of COE C1D1 dosing, it does not need to be repeated at COE C1D1. If HbA1c is elevated (≥ 6.5%), refer subject to a ppropriate provider during Cycle 1 for glucose management. 11.Hem atology: See [Section 5.5.3 Laboratory Assessments ]. Hematology tests should be collected at the following COE time points: C1D1, C1D8, C1D15 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle. If hematology tests were performed within 7 days prior to the first day of dosing , they do not need to be repeated on C1D1 . Hematology tests will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local laboratory results may be used to determine eligi bility if the C1D1 results from the central laborat ory are not available in time for planned dosing . In the event that the central laboratory results received after C1D1 dosing are not within eligibility parameters, the subject w ill still be considered eligible if local laboratory results met the eligibili ty criteria; such even ts will not be considered protocol deviations. Local laboratory results that support eligibility and dosing decisions must be entered into t he clinical database. If local laboratory is to be used to support dosing decisions, local lab oratory tests will include CBC with differential, glucose, serum creatinine, ALT and AST. Additional assessments may be done centrally or locally to monitor AEs or as required by dose modification requirements . 12.ECGs will be read locally. If there is no rea son to suspect cardiac issue s, ECG will not be required . 13.Ophthalmologic assessment sfor subjects w ith recent ocular complaints (within 3 months of COE consent) are required. Assessments should include the following: visual acuity, slit lamp, tonometry exam ination and dilated fundus examination. Prior ophthalmologic exam done within 3 months of COE consent is acceptable provided symptoms are not new since the exam. Ophthalmology assessments should be performed per standar d of care or if clinically indicated (e.g., subject develops new or w orsening ocular symptoms). EOT slit lamp examinations are required for subjects who experienc e corneal adverse events during the study. EOT slit lamp examinations must be performed ≥ 4 weeks from last dose. Additional eye ex aminations are to be conducted as clinically indicated. 14.Imaging will be evaluated within 28 days prior to COE C1D1 dosing and every 56 days (± 7 days) throughout the study. CT scan with contrast (chest, abdomen and pelvis) is the preferred modality for tumor assessment. MRI is acceptable if local standard practice or if CT sca ns are contraindicated in a subject (e.g., subject is allergic to contrast media). All other RECIST a pproved scanning methods such as x -ray are optional. To ensure comparability, the COE eligibility scan and subsequent assessment of response should be performed using identical techniques as were performed during Arm B participation . The same method should be em ployed and assessed by the same individual on each occasion if possible. Imaging assessments methods used at Baseline of the main study are to continue to be used throughout the study. Footnotes continued on next page"

The subject is free to discontinue from study treatment and/or withdraw from the COE study for an y reason and at an y time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudic e. The investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from COE study treatment or to terminate a subject's involvement in the study at an y time if the subject's clinical condition warrants it. All subjects who discontinue COE study treatment will rem ain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specific follow up procedures as outlined in the COE Schedule of Assessments [Table 11]until the subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previousl y authorized by the participant to provide this information. If a subject is disconti nued from the study with an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantl y outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically significant. The f ollowing are discontinuation criteria from treatment for individual subjects: ●Subject develops radiological disease progression relative to scan performed within 28 days of COE C1D1 dose. ●Subject is required to receive another s ystemic anti -cancer treatmen t for underly ing or new cancer ●Subject develops unacceptable toxicity ●Female subject becomes pregnant ●Investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue. ●Subject declines further treatment ●Subject is noncompliant with the protocol bas ed on the investigator or medical monitor assessment. ●Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by the investigator to locate the subject. ●Death.

RATIONALE: This revision is made based on regulatory agency feedback. Add Clarification to Efficacy Analysis DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: Additional text is added to clarify when progression -free survival on stud y therap y (PFS1), overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate ( DCR) can be tested. RATIONALE: This revision is made due to enrollment completion earlier. The multiplicity strategy was updated accordingl y. Update Duration of Response DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: Additional text is added to clarify when radiological progression will be censored. RATIONALE: This revision is made to update the censor rules for PFS1 and duration of response (DOR) to also censor the progressive disease (PD) or death after 2 or more missed disease assessments based on regulatory agency feedback. Clarify Progression Free Survival DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: Additional text is added to clarify the requirements for progression free survival. RATIONALE: This revision is made to update the censor rules for PFS1 and DOR to also censor the PD or death after 2 or more missed disease assessments based on regulatory agency feedback. Minor Administrative -type Changes DESCRI PTION OF CHANGE: Include mi nor administrative -type changes (e.g., ty pos, format, numbering and consistency throughout the protocol ), add COE to the list of abbreviations and update an exploratory endpoint in the sy nopsis to match the same endpoint in the body of the protocol. RATIONALE: To provide clarificati ons to the protocol and to ensure complete understanding of stud y procedures."

Refer to the main protocol for any study details not contained i n the supplemental COE appendix . 12.10.1 Rationale Upon decision to stop the study for efficacy based on statistically significant OS result favoring EV, all eligible Arm B subjects can be evaluated for eligibility for COE EV treatment at the discretion of the subject and investigator. Day 1 of the COE will occur after COE informed consent form is signed and eligibility is confirmed. Treatment with EV will be stopped upon disease progression and/or when discontinuation criteria are met [Section 12.10.5 Duration of Treatment and Criteria for Discontinuation]. Arm B Subjects who do not participate in the COE will continue to follow Arm B protocol proc edures. 12.10.2 Inclusion Criteria Subject is eligible for the COE if they continue to meet all inclusion criteria from the main protocol in addition to the following when the patient is evaluated for eligibility to participate in the COE portion of the s tudy: 1.IRB/IEC approved written COE informed consent and privacy language as per national regulations (e.g., HIPAA Authorization for US sites) must be obtained from the subject prior to any study -related procedures (including withdrawal of prohibited medication, if applicable). 2.Subject was randomized to Arm B and is either currently on study treatment or has discontinued study treatment due to intolerance, AE or progression of disease, has not started a new systemic anticancer treatment and is still pa rticipating in the follow up phase of the study. Waivers to the COE inclusion criteria will NOT be provided. 12.10.3 Exclusion Criteria Subject will be excluded from participation in the COE if they meet any of the exclusion criteria listed in the main p rotocol or if any of the following apply when the patient is evaluated for eligibility to participate in the COE portion of the study: 1.Subject has been diagnosed with a new malignancy while on Arm B in the EV -301 study. Subjects with nonmelanoma skin cance r, localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent with no evidence of progression, low -risk or very low -risk (per standard guidelines) localized prostate cancer under active"

All biochemistry laboratory tests should be collected at the start of the following COE time points: C1D1, C1D8, C1D15 and D1 of each subsequent cycle. If all biochemistry laboratory tests were perform ed within 7 days prior to the first day of dosing, they do not need to be repeated at C1D1. Biochem istry tests will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local laboratory results may be used to determ ine eligibility if the C1D1 results from the central labor atory are not available in tim e for planned C1D1 dosing. In the event that the central laboratory results received after C1D1 dosing are not within eligibility param eters, the subject will still be considered eli gible, if local labs met the eligibility cri teria, and will not be considered a protocol deviation. Local laboratory results that support eligibility and dosing decisions must be entered into the clinical database. If local l aboratory is to be used to support dosing decisions, local laboratory test s will include complete blood count (CBC) with differential, glucose, serum creatinine, ALT and AST. Additional assessments may be done centrally or locally to m onitor AEs or as required by dose modification requi rements. 10. If HbA1c was perform ed within 7 days prior to the first day of COE C1D1 dosing, it does not need to be repeated at COE C1D1. If HbA1c is elevated (≥ 6.5%), refer subject to appropriate provider during Cycle 1 for glucose managem ent. 11.Hem atology: See [Section 5.5.3 Laboratory Assessments]. Hem atology tests should be collected at the following COE time points: C1D1, C1D8, C1D15 and Day 1 of each subsequent cycle. If hematology tests were perform ed within 7 days prior to the first day of do sing, they do not need to be repeated on C1D1. Hem atology tests will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Local laboratory results m ay be used to determine eligibility if the C1D1 results from the central laboratory are not available in time for planned dosing. In the ev ent that the central laboratory results received after C1D1 dosing are not within eligibility param eters, the subject will still be considered eli gible if local laboratory results met the eligibility criteria; such events will not be considered protocol deviat ions. Local laboratory results that support eligibility and dosing decisions must be entered into the clinical database. If local laboratory is to be used to support dos ing decisions, local laboratory tests will include CBC with differential, glucose, seru m creatinine, ALT and AST. Additional assessments m ay be done centrally or locally to m onitor AEs or as required by dose modification requirements. 12.ECGs will be read locally. If there is no reason to suspect cardiac issues, ECG will not be required. 13.Ophtha lmologic assessments for subjects with recent ocular com plaints (within 3 m onths of COE consent) are required. Assessments sh ould include the following: visual acuity, slit lam p, tonometry examination and dilated fundus examination. Prior ophthalm ologic e xam done within 3 m onths of COE consent is acceptable provided sym ptoms are not new since the exam. Ophthalmology assessments should b e perform ed per standard of care or if clinically indicated (e.g., subject develops new or worsening ocular sym ptoms). EOT slit lamp examinations are required for subjects who experience corneal adverse events during the study. EOT slit lamp examinations must be perform ed ≥ 4 weeks from last dose. Additional eye examinations are to be conducted as clinically indicated. 14.Imaging will be evaluated within 28 days prior to COE C1D1 dosing and every 56 days (± 7 days) throughout the study. CT scan with con trast (chest, abdom en and pelvis) is the preferred modality for tum or assessment. MRI is acceptable if local standard practice or if CT scans are contraindicated in a subject (e.g., subject is allergic to contrast m edia). All other RECIST approved scanning m ethods such a s x-ray are optional. To ensure comparability, the COE eligibility scan and subsequent assessment of response shoul d be perform ed using identical techniques as were perform ed during Arm B participation. The same method should be employed and assessed by the sam e individu al on each occasion if possible. Im aging assessments methods used at Baseline of the m ain study are to continue to be used throughout the study."

Phone contact is sufficient for follow up. Additional follow up contacts m ay be required per sponsor request for analysis purposes. 18.Contact subjects in the survival follow -up period approximately every 3 m onths to collect survival status until subj ect death or study closure. Additional follow -up contacts m ay be required per sponsor request for analysis purposes. 19.ATA will be collected at COE Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 10 predose within 24 hrs of the start of the infusion EOT (Date of l ast dose + 7 d ays) and follow -up (Date of last dose +30 days)."

The subject is free to discontinue from study treatment and/or withdraw from the COE study for any reason and at any time without giving reason for doing so and without penalty or prejudice. The investigator is also free to discontinue the subject from COE study treatment or to terminate a subject's involvement in the study at any time if the subject's clinical condition warrants it. All subjects who discontinue COE study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specific follow up procedure s as outlined in the COE Schedule of Assessments [ Table 11 ] until the subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing AE or an unresolved laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinically significant. The follow ing are discontinuation criteria from treatment for individual subjects: ●Subject develops radiological disease progression relative to scan performed within 28 days of COE C1D1 dose. ●Subject is required to receive another systemic anti -cancer treatment for underlying or new cancer ●Subject develops unacceptable toxicity ●Female subject becomes pregnant ●Investigator decides it is in the subject’s best interest to discontinue. ●Subject declines further treatment ●Subject is noncompliant with the protocol based on the investigator or medical monitor assessment. ●Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by the investigator to locate the subject. ●Death. The subject will be discontinued from the long -term PFS2 follow -up period if any of the following occ ur: ●Subject initiates a new systemic anticancer treatment ●Subject exhibits evidence of PD based on investigator assessment ●Subject declines further study participation (i.e., withdraws consent) ●Subject is lost to follow -up despite reasonable efforts by th e investigator to locate the subject ●Death ●Sponsor ends long -term follow -up collection period The subject will be discontinued from the survival follow -up period if any of the following occur: ●Subject declines further study participation (i.e., withdraws consent)"
