The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline through the Day 29 Visit for ppFEV 1 All ppFEV 1hypothesis tests will be performed within the mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) framework at a 5% alpha level, with appropriate adjustment for baseline covariates. The null within-gr oup hypothesis of no difference in t he mean absolute change from baseline through the Day 29 Visit for ppFEV 1in all treatment groups, by part, will be tested using MMRM. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through the Day 29 Visit for all within -group and between -group comparisons will be estimated within MMRM. Secondary Objectives The PD endpoint is the absolute change in sweat chloride f rom baseline through the Day 29Visit. In Part 1, the null hypothesis of the lack of a decreasing dose -response trend in the mean absolute change from baseline through the Day 29 Visit for sweat chloride between the TC dose groups and placebo will be tested using a multiple comparisons procedure based on the 1-sided maximum t-statistic. The adjusted means and 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through the Day 29 Visit, for all within -group and between -group comparisons, will be estimated within MMRM. Interim AnalysesInterim analyses (IAs) may be conducted for any part of the study after at least 50% of subjects in the part have completed the Day 15 Visit. Each IA will only include data for a single part of the study . IDMC Reviews An independent monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter."

23,page_23,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 24of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information5 INTRODUCTION 5.1 Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive chronic disease with serious morbidit ies and frequent premature mortalit y. At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide1(approximately 30,000 in the US1,2and 32,000 in the European Unio n3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease.4, 5 CF is caused by reduced quant ity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulat ing salt and water absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and mult iple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiot ics and muco lytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.2,6Progressive loss o f lung funct ion is the leading cause of mortalit y.7 More effective treatments are needed for CF. More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been ident ified.8Most of these mutations are not associ ated wi th CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database contains inform ation on only 322 of these i dentified mutat ions, with sufficient evidence to define 281mutations as disease -causing.9The m ost comm on disease -causing CFTR mutation, F508del , accounts for 70% of the ident ified alleles in people with CF, with nearly half o f all peopl e with CF are ho mozygous f or F508del . Based on the understanding of the mo lecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantit y and/or funct ion of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in pat ients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quant ity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiator s increase the channel open probabilit y of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance i on transport . Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activit y in the m embrane, and the pathophy siology of that activit y (reflect ing the CFTR genotype of the pati ent and possibly other factors), both approaches may be requi red. The therapeutic act ivity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products that were developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco®), and l umacaftor (LUM) in combinat ion with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genoty pes. Tezacaftor (TEZ; VX -661) i s a first -generation CFTR corrector that improves the processing and trafficking of the F508del -CFTR protein, result ing in an increase in the quant ity of F508del -CFTR protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the open -channel probabilit y of the F508del -CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surfac e by TEZ, thereby enhancing total chloride transport. The combined effect of TEZ and IVA is increased quant ity and funct ion of F508del -CFTR at the cell surface."
24,page_24,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 25of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationVX-659 is a next -generat ion CFTR corrector. In vitro, VX -659 improves the processing and traffi cking of F508del -CFTR, thereby increasing the quant ity of functional F508del -CFTR protein at the cell surface.10The effect of VX -659 was addit ive to the effect of TEZ. The CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by VX -659 al one or in combinat ion with TEZ (VX-659/TEZ) was potentiated by IVA.10In human bronchi al epi thelial (HBE) cells studied in vitro, the tri ple combinat ion (TC) of VX -659, TEZ, and IVA (VX -659/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any o f the dual combinations (VX -659/TEZ, VX -659/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual co mponents (VX -659, TEZ, and IVA) under most condit ions studi ed.10 VX-561 (also known as CTP-656and C -10355 ) is a deuterated isotope of IVA wit h a specific pattern of 9 subst ituted deuteriums. In vitro data indicate similar potency o f VX-561in HBE cells relat ive to IVA .11Safet y pharmaco logy and nonclinical toxicology studi es of VX-561 demonstrate a similar safet y profi le rel ative to IVA. Phase 1 clinical studies in healt hy subjects have shown that VX-561 had a reduced rate of clearance, increased exposure, greater plasma levels at 24 hours, and a longer half -life compared to IVA, thereby supporting once daily dosing. 5.2 Rationale for This Study This is the second clinical study of VX-659 and is designed to evaluate the safet y and efficacy of VX-659 in TC with TEZ and either IVA or VX-561in subjects with CF who are heterozy gous for F508del with a second CFTR allele carrying a minimal funct ion (MF) mutation that is not expected to respond to TEZ, IVA, orTEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes) and ho mozygous f or F508del (F/F genoty pe). Data from nonclinical studies of VX -659, TEZ, IVA , and VX -561 and the current unmet medica l need for new treatments for CF support clinical development of VX -659 in combinat ion with other CFTR modulators for the treatment of CF. 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 6.1 Primary Objectives Parts 1 and 2 : To evaluate the safet y and tol erabili ty of VX-659 in TC wi th TEZ a nd IVA Part 3 (optional) : To eval uate the safet y and tol erabili ty of VX-659 in TC with TEZ and VX -561 All parts : To evaluate the efficacy o f VX-659 in TC with TEZ and either IVA or VX -561 6.2 Secondary Objectives Parts 1 and 2 : To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of VX -659 in TC with TEZ and IVA on CFTR funct ion Part 3 (optional) : To eval uate the PD effects of VX -659 in TC with TEZ and VX -561 on CFTR funct ion All parts : To evaluate the pharmacokinet ics (PK) of VX -659 when administered in TC with TEZ and either IVA or VX -561 To evaluate the PK of TEZ, IVA, VX -561 and their respective metabo lites when administered with VX -659 (as applicable)"

Repeat ing individual screening assessment(s) that did not meet eligibilit y criteria is not permitted, with the fo llowing except ions that require the approval of the m edical m onitor: If there is clear evidence of a damaged sample, laboratory error, or equi pment m alfunct ion, collect ion of a repeat sample for the appropriate laboratory test or assessment may be permitted. Exclusio nary liver funct ion tests result s, which may be retested once within 14 days o f the original screening date. Assessments required for eligibilit y that m ay be repeated as described in Sections 8.1 and8.2. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibilit y criteria and com pleted within the screening wi ndow, then the subject is eligible for the study . 9.1.1.2 Rescreening Subjects m ay only be rescreened wit h the approval of the medical mo nitor. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated except for CFTR genotyping, FSH level (if serum FSH level was ≥40mIU/mL during prior screening), G6PD activit y test, and sweat chloride level. If a subject is rescreened, the new screening window will begin once the first rescreening assessment has been init iated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject m ay have the Screening Peri od window extended by 2weeks, wi thout m edical m onitor approval , for the fo llowing reasons: Repetit ion of Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1 ) Unexpected operational or logist ic delays, or to meet the eligibilit y criteria To enable a subject ’s eligibilit y for this study to be determined before the subject discontinues previous CFTR modulator treatment (e.g., so that subjects can have screening assessments done while they are continuing to receive CFTR modulator treatment but have a washout period of at least 2 weeks before performing spiro metry for stratificat ion of rando mizat ion inthis study and a washout peri od of at l east 4 weeks before the Day 1 Vi sit in Part 1 and Part 3) (see Section 9.1.3 and Section 9.1.4 ). A subject m ay have the Screening Peri od window extended for an addit ional 2 weeks (total of 4weeks) with medical mo nitor approval. 9.1.2 Run-in Period (Part 2) The Run-in Period will have a total duration o f 4 weeks and i s desi gned to establish a reliable on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of TEZ/IVA will be administered in the morning at the Day -28 Vi sit. The l ast dose of IVA w ithin the Run -in Period will be administered in the evening of Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Vi sit)."
31,page_31,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 32of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationStudy eligibilit y for Part 2 subjects will be confirmed before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in the Run-in Period (on the Day -28 Vi sit). Study visit s during the Run -in Period will occur as shown in Table 3-2. All visit s will occur within the windows specified. 9.1.3 Randomization For all parts, randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1values (<70 vs ≥70). For subjects in Part 1 and Part 3, the spiro metry assessment used for stratificat ion must be perform ed at l east 14 days after the last dose of any previ ous CFTR m odulator treatment. Therefore, subjects being treated with 1 or more CFTR modulators (invest igational or approved) within 14 days of the Sc reening Visit must have a separate Stratificat ion Visit at least 14 day s after the subject ’s last CFTR m odulator dose. For subjects not being treated with any CFTR modulators wi thin 14 days of the Screening Visit, the Screening Visit spiro metry assessment can be used for stratificat ion. For subjects in Part 2, the ppFEV 1assessment for stratificat ion of randomizat ion will be done at the Day -14 Visit. See Section 9.3.1 . Randomization will occur before the first dose of VX -659/control and may be done on ei ther Day -1 or the Day 1 Vi sit, after all inclusio n and exclusion criteria have been sat isfied and the criteria for entry into the Treatment Period have been confirmed (see Sect ion9.1.4 ). For Part 2, subjects who prematurely discontinue TEZ/IVA during the Run -in Period will not be rando mized or participate in the Treatment Period, unless they rescreen and complete a 4 -week Run-in Period (Section 9.1.2 ). 9.1.4 Treatment Period To be eligible to continue into the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease (consistent with the inclusio n and exclusio n criteria) and have remained on stable CF medicat ion regimen during the 28 days before the Day 1 Vi sit AND must not have had an acute non -CF illness within 14 days before the Day 1 Visi t. The total duration of treatment with study drug is approximately 5 weeks for Part 1 (Peri od 1 + Period 2), 12 weeks for Part 2 (Run -in + Period 1 + Period 2), and 4 weeks for Part 3 (Period 1 only). The duration of treatment with TCor placebo ( Parts 1 and 3, Period 1) or TC or TEZ/IVA (Part 2, Period 1) is approximately 4 weeks. Study drug administrati on details are provided in Secti on9.7. 9.1.5 Follow -up There will be an outpatient Safet y Follow-up Visi t occurring approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prem aturely discontinue study drug dosing. A subject who was enrolled in Study VX14 -661-110 and then enrolled in Part 2 of this study can re-enroll in Study 661-110 after c ompleting this study . If the subject com pletes the Day 57 Visi t of this study and then re -enters Study 661-110, the subject will not have a Safet y Follow-up Vi sit in this study ."

Subj ects who prem aturely discontinue t reatment will also be requi red to com plete the Safety Follow-up Vi sit, approximately 28days after thei r last dose of study drug. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later fo llowing the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safet y Follow-up Vi sit, and a separate Safet y Follow-up Visi t will not be requi red. If a subject withdraws fro m the study and also wi thdraws consent for disclo sure of future inform ation, no further evaluat ions shoul d be perform ed and no addit ional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.1.7 Independent Data Monitoring Committee This study will be m onitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct reviews of safet y data fro m all parts of the study as outlined in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter, which will be finalized before the first subject is screened, will include procedural details o f the IDMC structure and function, triggers for meet ings, and plans for dat a to be reviewed. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The rando mizat ion code list will be produced by Vertex Bi ometrics or a qualified randomizat ion vendor . 9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design Stratificat ion of Rando mizat ion The extent of response to CFTR modulator treatment may depend on the subject ’s ppFEV 1value (an index o f disease severi ty) before the start of study drug dosi ng. Therefore, randomizat ion in all parts will be stratified by pretreatment ppFEV 1values , defined as the last ppFEV 1 measurement before treatment with VX -659. For Part s1and 3 , this value is determined at screening, except for those subjects who require a Stratificat ion Visit, in which case the value is determined at that visit. For Part 2, the pretreatment ppFEV 1value is determined at the Day -14 Visit during the Run -In Peri od. Control Treatm ents Part 1 and Part 3: Efficacy has not been demo nstrated for a corrector, potentiator, or any corrector/potentiator combinat ion in subjects wi th F/MF genoty pes. A Phase 3 study of TEZ/IVA in subjects with F/MF genoty pes (Study VX14 -661-107) was terminated fo llowing a planned interim fut ility analysis, which showed that the combinat ion of TEZ/IVA did not result in a prespecified improvement in ppFEV 1. Because there is no effect ive treatment for this popul ation, a placebo arm will be included as the control in Part 1 and Part 3."
33,page_33,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 34of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationPart 2: A Phase 3 study of TEZ/ IVA (Study VX14 -661-106) demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit in subjects with the F/F genotype16; therefore, TEZ/IVA is the act ive control. Run-in Period Part 2 will have a 4 -week run -in period to establish a reliable on -treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for com parison to Peri od 1, when subjects will addit ionally receive VX -659 or pl acebo. Period 2 Part 1 and Part 2 include a second dosing period (Period 2), during which subjects will be administered TEZ/IVA. In Part 1, Period 2 is4 days and is included to enable a more thorough evaluat ion of VX -659 exposure -response relationships by conducting PK and PD assessments during the VX -659 washout. In Part 2, Period 2 is 4 weeks to enable an assessment of PD and efficacy endpoints after VX-659 i s washed out. 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration VX-659 Dosage Part 1 will evaluate 3 dose levels of VX -659 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with F/MF genoty pes. The high dose of VX -659 to be evaluated as part of the TC is 400 mg qd. In healt hy subjects in Study VX16 -659-001, VX -659 m onotherapy was shown to be safe and well tolerated at multiple doses up to 400 m g qd for 10 days, and VX -659 was safe and well tolerated at multiple doses up to 200 mg q12h in TC wit h TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h for 14 days . The dose levels evaluated in Part 1 are expected to provide clinical benefit (based on in vitro data) and will provide a range of exposure for exposure -response analyses of efficacy and safet y. The TC -high dose will also be used in Part 2 and Part 3. Dos e-and exposure -response inform ation obtained for the TC in Part 1 (subjects with F/MF genoty pes) is expected to be applicable to other populations with F508del , including F/F, based on the similar potency of the TC in HBE cells that have 1 copy or 2 copies of F508del .10 TEZ Dosage In all study parts, the TEZ dosage will be 100 mg qd, which is the same total dosage evaluated in Phase 3 studies o f TEZ/IVA. IVA Dosage When administered in co mbinat ion with VX-659, the IVA dosage will be 150 mg q12h. A dosage of 150 mg q12h is being used in Pha se 3 studi es of TEZ/IVA and is also the approved IVA m onotherapy dosage for pati ents aged 12 y ears and ol der (150 mg q12h). VX-561Dosage The VX-561 dosage will be 200 mg qd, based on preliminary PK and safet y resul ts for VX-561 from Study VX16 -770-018, which evaluated the relat ive bioavailabit y of the 50 -mg tablet of VX-561 being used in the current study , and Study VX16 -659-001, which is evaluat ing VX -561 200 m g qd in combinat ion with VX-659 (400 m g qd) and TEZ (100 mg qd). A VX-561 dose of 200 m g qd in TC wi th VX-659 and TEZ i s predi cted to provi de similar exposure of deuterated IVA rel ative to that of IVA fo llowing a dose of 150 mg q12h."

Study drug administration must be discontinued , if eit her of the fo llowing criteria is met: Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the init ial el evation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etio logy (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatit is, or alcoho l ingest ion) is i dentified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved Subsequent indirect bilirubin values confirm the init ial value as >2 ×ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct bilirubin), in associat ion with decreased haptogl obin If an alternat ive, reversible cause of transaminase elevat ion and/or increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been ident ified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases or bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2×ULN, whic hever is higher. Approval o f the medical monitor is requi red before resum ption of study drug. Upon resum ption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase or bilirubin elevat ion interruption thresho ld recurs during Period 1 or Period 2 (with confi rmation of the init ial elevat ion by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then study drugs must be permanent ly discont inued, regardless of the presumed etio logy.

The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject ’s treatm ent by the investi gator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject ’s study treatm ent is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best j udgment as to"
42,page_42,"Proto col VX16 -659- 101, Version 3.0 Page 43of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Informationwhether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical mo nitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medi cal monitor to di scuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If invest igators have tried but are unable to reach the medical mo nitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and m ay proceed wi th unblind ing without having successfully reached and discussed the situation wit h the m edical monitor. Contact informat ion for the m edical m onitor (or appropri ate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addit ion, the Vertex Medical Informat ion Call Cent er will answer calls 24hours a day , 7 day s a week, 365 days of the y ear, and will triage these calls to the study medical mo nitor or appropriate backup. If a subject ’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgen t clinical situat ion, the medical mo nitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject ’s study file. Inform ation about the treatment assignment obtained fro m the unblinding will be maintained in a secure l ocati on wi th controlled access and will not be shared wit h the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the invest igator will consider whether t he clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory defini tions or cri teria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2 . Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Vertex GPS or Designee for SAEs or Safety Concerns Vertex GPS or designee will unblind any SAE reports in co mpliance wit h regulatory reporti ng requi rements. In addit ion, Vertex may , for matters rel ating to safet y concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time. Unblinded Reviews of Data by Vertex for Administrative Purposes (Planning, Decision -making, and Regulatory Submission) A limited Vertex team will be unblinded and have access to safet y, efficacy , and PD data for the purpose of conducting ongoing reviews o f safety and efficacy data for planning and enabling clinical development. Members of the limited unblinded Vertex team will no t be part of the Vertex study team and will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the study .

Serum FSH levels must be within the postmenopausal reference r ange of the performing laboratory to be consi dered postm enopausal . CFTR genoty pe (Screening Period only): CFTR genoty ping will be performed for all subjects. If the screening CFTR genoty pe resul t is not received before randomization, a previous CFTR genoty pe laboratory report m ay be used to establish eligibilit y. Subjects who have been rando mized and whose screening genotype does not confirm study eligibilit y must be discontinued fro m the study (Secti on 9.10). G6PD Act ivity Test (Screening Period only) : Blood sam ples will be collected for the G6PD activit y test, whi ch will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay routi nely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs quant itative G6PD activit y assays is acceptable as an alternat ive to the central laboratory. Addit ional Evaluat ions:Addit ional clinical laboratory eval uations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For purposes of study conduct, the central laboratory must be used for all laboratory tests wi th the except ion of the G6PD activit y test. Local laboratori es may be used at the di scret ion of the local invest igator for management of urgent m edical issues. If a local laboratory test val ue is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not poss ible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the invest igator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems will be done at screening and select study visits. At other visits, symptom -directed PEs can be done at the discret ion of the invest igator or healthcare provider. A co mplete PE includes a review of the fo llowing system s: head/neck/thyroi d; eyes/ears/nose/throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdo men; skin; musculoskeletal; and neuro logical. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinat ions will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the fo llowing body system s: EENT, cardi ovascular system , respi ratory system , abdom en, and skin. Vital signs include blood pressure (sy stolic and di astolic), tem perature (oral ), pul se rate, and respi ration rate.

At visits when study drug i s taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before the morning dose. Thi s is a noninvasive measure of oxy gen delivery to the ti ssues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung funct ion. 11.7.5 Electrocardiograms Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine wit h printout according to the Table 3-1, Table 3-2, and Table 3-3. Addi tional standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. A subject should be rested for at least 5 minutes before an ECG is performed. The ECG tra ces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safet y Follow-up Vi sit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safet y review by the invest igator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalit ies occurring during the study through the Safet y Follow-up Vi sit will be recorded as AEs. Study sites shoul d use QTcF unless they receive approval from the medical monitor to use QTcB. To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make com parisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec fro m the baseline or an abso lute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be perform ed approximately 2to 4minutes apart to confirm the or iginal measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the thresho ld value (>60 msec fro m baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly unt il QTcF values fro m 2successive ECGs fall below the thresho ld value that triggered the repeat measurement. A subject with a QTcF value above the thresho ld will discontinue dosing.

Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been entered in the clinical study database, and the database has been locked. 12.1 Sample Si ze and Power 12.1.1 Primary Objectives The primary object ives of the study are the evaluatio n of safet y and tol erabili ty, and efficacy of VX-659 in TC with TEZ and either IVA or VX-561. The sam ple size calculat ions described below are deemed adequate to evaluate the objectives of the study, based on clinical and statist ical considerat ions. 12.1.1.1 Safety and Tolerability The primary safety endpo int is the incidence of AEs. Approximately 105 subjects will be rando mized in the study with approximately 81 subjects receiving VX-659 in TC. The sample size for each treatment group will provide sufficient data for a descript ive analysis o f AEs. 12.1.1.2 Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint i s the abso lute change fro m baseline in ppFEV 1through the Day 29 Visi t in all parts. A sample size o f 18subjects per treatment group provides at least 90% power to detect a mean within -group change of 7 percentage points."
51,page_51,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 52of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information12.1.2 Secondary Objectives A secondary object ive of the study is the evaluat ion of the PD effect of VX -659 in TC with TEZ and eit her IVA or VX-561. The abso lute change fro m baseline through the Day 29 Visit in sweat chloride concentrations is a secondary endpoint used to evaluate the PD object ive of the study . In Part 1, a test for a decreasing dose -response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using a mult iple co mpar isons procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null hypothesis of the lack of a decreasing dose -response trend versus a decreasing tr end using the 1-sided maximum t-statistic that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a family o f candi date dose -response models to be prespecified, that covers the range of plausible and diverse dose -response profiles. The candid ate m odels that best describe the expected decreasing dose -response profile of the TC groups com pared to pl acebo include a linear model, a maximum effect (E max) model, and a sigmoid E maxmodel. The contrasts (i.e., linear combinat ions of the treatment grou p means through the Day 29 Vi sit) selected to perform the MCP and that capture the shape of these candidate models are described in Table 12-1.

The analysis will be performed using a mixed -effects m odel for repeated m easures (MMRM) with change from baseline as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as rando m effect, and the continuous baseline ppFEV 1as a covariate. The model will be est imated using restri cted m aximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedo m for the F test for fixed effects will be est imated using the Kenward -Roger approximat ion. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors to account for repeated measures within a subject. If the model est imation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used. Condit ional on observe d data and covari ates, missing data due to treatment or study discontinuat ion will be assumed to be missing at random. Adjusted m eans and 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through the Day 29 Visi t, as applicable, wi th 2-sided Pvalues, will be estimated wi thin MMRM using Least Squares Means via PROC MIXED in SAS, for all within -group and between -group com parisons. Sensit ivity analyses for handling missing data due to treatment or study discont inuat ion will be described in the SAP.

This includes any newly occurring event or worsen ing of a pre -exist ing condit ion (e.g., increase in its severit y or frequency ) after the ICF i s signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definit ion in Sect ion13.1.2.1 . 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnorm al test resul t alone (e.g., urinary tract infectio n, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment i tself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglo bin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment Further di agnosti ctesting or m edical/surgical intervent ion A change in the dose of study drug or di scontinuat ion fro m the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically sig nificant criteria. The determinat ion of whether the study assessment resul ts are clinically significant will be made by the invest igator. A laboratory value that i s Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject ’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be co llected fro m the time ICF is signed until the fo llowing time points: For subjects who do not enroll: unt il time of screen failure (e.g., screen fai lure, wi thdrawal of consent) For enrolled subjects who have a Safet y Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up Vi sit"

All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questi ons, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellat ion of signs and/or symptoms will be ident ified as 1overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for s ubjects who are screened but not subsequently enro lled in the study will be recorded only in the subject ’s source documents. The fo llowing data will be documented for each AE: Descript ion of the event Classificat ion of “serious”or “nonseri ous” Date of first occurrence and date of reso lution (if applicable) Severit y Causal relat ionship to study drug(s) Action taken Outcom e Concomitant medicat ion or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The invest igator will determine and record the severit y of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Commo n Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03, Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program , http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm (Accessed August 2015 ). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening. ”In considering the severit y of an AE in a pediat ric subject, the invest igator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory param eters m ay differ f rom those given in the CTCAE. The severit y of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definit ionsin Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death"

Causalit y will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and cau ses other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/o r the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject ’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative et iology will be documented in the study subject ’s medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The invest igator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable ”will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE bega n and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

61,page_61,"Proto col VX16 -659-101, Version 3.0 Page 62of 74 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential InformationTable 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal ”will be used when death is at least possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) AE: adverse event 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The invest igator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values rel ated to study drug. In addi tion, the invest igator will describe whether any treatm ent was given for the AE. “Yes”is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medicat ions, hospitalization, surgery , or physical therapy. “No”indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that m eets any of the f ollowing outcom es: Fatal (death, regardl ess of cause, that occurs during participat ion in the study or occurs after participat ion in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicit y due to administration of the study drug) Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred Inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion Persi stent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y (disabi lity is defined as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person ’s abili ty to conduct norm al life f unctions) Congenital ano maly or bi rth defect Important m edical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgi cal interventi on to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring int ensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e) If a subject has a hospitalizat ion or procedure (e.g., surgery ) for an event or condit ion tha t occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalizat ion or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalizat ion or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedu re to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relat ive to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizat ions clearly not associ ated wi th an AE (e.g., social hospi talizati on for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarificat ion will be made between the terms “serious ”and “severe ”because they are not synonymous. The term “severe ”is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe my ocardial infarcti on. The event i tself, howe ver, may be of relatively minor m edical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as"

Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligat ions. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through the Safet y Follow-up Visi t, regardless of causalit y, will be reported by the investi gator to Vertex GPS. In addit ion, all SAEs that occur after the Safet y Follow-up Vi sit and are considered rel ated to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safet y Inform ation Co llection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form ”) using a recogni zed medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investi gator f or rel ationship to the invest igational study drug(s) and possible et iologies. On the SAE Form, relat ionship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as rel ated (incl udes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severit y assessment will not be required. For the purpos es of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporti ng period, i t will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regul atory safety monitoring, the invest igator is required to fo llow the event to resolut ion and report to Verte x the outcome o f the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The invest igator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of i dentifying an SAE, regardl ess of the presumed relationship to the investigat ional study drug.

It is the invest igator ’s responsibilit y to ensure the accuracy , com pleteness, clari ty, and t imeliness of the data reported in the subject ’s CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject ’s parti cipat ion in the study and will document the dates and details of study proce dures, AEs, other observat ions, and subject status. The invest igator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after inform ation is collected. The audit trail entry will show the user ’s ident ification information and the dat e and time of any correcti on. The invest igator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator i s responsible. Vertex w ill retain the CRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the invest igator ’s study file. 13.6 Publications and Clinical Study Report 13.6.1 Publication of Study Results Any and all scient ific, commercial, and technical informat ion disclo sed by Vertex in this protocol or elsewhere will be considered the confident ial and proprietary property of Vertex. The investigator shall ho ld such informat ion in confidence and shall not dis close the inform ation to any third party except to such of the investigator ’s employees and staff as have been made aware that the informat ion is confident ial and who are bound to treat it as such and to whom disclosure is necessary to eval uate that i nform ation. The investigator shall not use such informat ion for any purpose other than determining mutual interest in performing the study and, if the parti es decide to proceed with the study , for the purpose of conducting the study ."

These CFTR mutati ons were defined using 3 major sources: biological plausibili ty for the m utation to respond (i.e., mutation class) evidence of clinical severit y on a popul ation basis (per CFTR2 patient registry; accessed on 15 February 2016) oaverage sweat chloride >86 mmo l/L, and oprevalence o f pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% in vitro testing omutati ons result ing in baseline chloride transport <10% of wild -type CFTR were considered minimal funct ion omutati ons result ing in chloride transport <10% of wild -type CFTR following the addit ion of TEZ and/or IVA were considered nonresponsive The clinical severit y criteria (average sweat chloride >86 mmo l/L and %PI >50%) do not appl y to the individual subjects to be enro lled in this study, but were used to classify the mutation status on a population level. The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by an FDA -cleared genoty ping assay; however, this list may not include every eligible mutati on, and investi gators shoul d contact the m edical monitor regarding other m utations that m ay also m eet study eligibilit y criteria."
