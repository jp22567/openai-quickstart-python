9,page_9,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 9 LY30091041.Synopsis Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib in Adult Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Rationale : Atopic dermatitis ( AD) is a pruritic, chronic or chronically relapsing, highly symptomatic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive T cell activation leading to significant skin in filtration by T cells and dendritic cells (Bieber 2010) . Presentation is varied but includes skin manifestations and prurit us, with associated sleep disturbances and subsequent skin infections. The course of disease includes relapses of varying duratio n and severity . Baricitinib is an orally available, selective Janus kinase ( JAK) inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2 ) (Fridman et al. 2010 ). The pathogenesis of AD is thought to be modulated through t hymic stromal ly mphopoietin (TSLP ) , interleukin ( IL)-13, IL-4,IL-5, IL-22, and IL-31, many of which activate receptors with downstream signaling t hrough intracellular JAK1/JAK2 /TYK2 (Nomura and Kabashima 2015 ). This activity profile suggests that baricitinib would inhibit many of the cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis . Clinical studies have established that baricitinib is effective in a utoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints, kidneys, and skin. Baricitinib was effective at reducing swollen and tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)(Genovese et al .2016; Dougados et al .2017; Fleischmann et al .2017; Taylor et al .2017); was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Papp et al .2016 ); was effective at reducing the urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio in patients with dia betic kidney disease (Tuttle et al. 2015); and in a recently completed Phase 2 study ( Study I4V-MC -JAHG) was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe AD. The mechanism of action, combined with demonstration of clinical benefit in inflammatory diseases involving joints, kidneys, and skin, provides the rationale for evaluating ba ricitinib in moderate to severe AD ."

The study duration will be up to 113 weeks (Screening Period: up to 5 weeks before randomization; Double -Blind edTreatment Period: 104weeks; Post - Treatment Follow -up Period: approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of investigational product). Number of Patients: This study will include approximately 450 patients with AD who will be randomized 1:1:1 to placebo QD, baricitinib 1 -mg QD, or baricitinib 2 - mg QD (150 patients per arm) . Statistical Analysis: Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and health outcome analy ses will be conducted on the intent -to-treat populatio n,and safety analyses will be conducted on those patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables will be made using a logistic regression analysis with treatment , baseline disease severity (IGA) and baseline score in the model. Region may be adde d to the model if patient numbers allow. The proportions and 95% CI will be reported. If a patient needs to use rescue medication, the data after rescue onward will be considered missing, and missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI ) method. All patients who discontinue the study or study treatment at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables after discontinuatio n onward. Additional analy ses will be done using all observed data whether rescue medication was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects model ofrepeated measures (MMRM ) with treatment, baseline disease severity (IGA) ,, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline and baseline -by-visit interaction as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient variance –covariance errors. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs )will be used for the statistical comparison ,and c ontrasts will be set up within the model to compare treatment groups at specific time points of intere st. Fisher ’sexact test will be used for all adverse event (AE ), baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analyzed by an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) with treatment and baseline values in the model."

Background AD, also known as eczema or atopic eczema, is a commo n, chronic, relapsing, highly symptom aticinflammatory skin disease (Bieber 2010 ). Patients with AD may present with skin lesions that can be acute with oozing, crusted, eroded vesicles or papules on ery thematous plaques. Pati ents m ay also present with lesio ns that have a subacute appearance, with thick and excori ated pl aques, or chronic appearance, with lichenified, sl ightly pigmented, excoriated plaques (Bi eber 2010 ). ADcauses pruritus attacks throughout the day, which is the primary source of morbidi ty in this disorder (Simpson 2012 ).Pruritus often leads to an “itch –scratch ” cycle,further compromising the epi dermal barrier and result ing in dry skin, microbial colonizat ion, and secondary infect ions (Krakowski et al. 2008 ), with 36% of patients reporting that they often or always scratch unt il their skin bleeds (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). Pruritus fro m ADcan worsen at night, result ing in sleep disturbances, with approximately 27% of adul t patients wi th AD experiencing sleep disturbance as a result of itching (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). In adult patients with moderate to severe AD, poor sleep quali ty and latency were significant ly associ ated wi th poor quali ty of life (Yano et al . 2013 ). In clinical pract ice, AD is classified as mild, moderate ,or severe based on a variet y of clinical features, including severit y of skin lesi ons and pruri tus and extent of disease (body surface area [BSA ] invo lved) . Until recent ly, there were no US Food and Drug Administration- approved systemic treatments for pati ents wi th moderate to severe AD, with the exception of systemic corticosteroids. In March 2017, Dupixent ®(dupilumab) inject ion, a IgG4 monoclo nal ant ibody that inhibi ts IL - 4 and IL -13, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for this patient populat ion. In the European Unio n, only cycl osporine has been approved for the treatment of patients wi th severe AD (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). A recent ly completed Phase 2 study (Study I4V-MC-JAHG [JAHG]) evaluated the safety and efficacy of baricitinib (a JAK inhibitor) in AD, and results showed si gnificant improvement i n disease severit y compared to pl acebo ,and no new safet y concerns were ident ified. In addit ion to AD, b aricitinib has a lso been studied in Phase 3 in pat ients with RA and in Phase2 in pat ients with diabet ic nephropathy, moderate to severe psoriasis ,and systemic lupus erythematosus. Through 13 February 2019 , barici tinib has been studied in more than 548 healthy vol unteers and 6555 patients have received baricit inib in clinical studies. As o f 13 Februar y 2018, morethan 2700 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than a y ear and m ore than 1800 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than 2 years at doses of 2 -mg once daily or 4 -mg once daily across the RA clinical program. Barici tinib has been administered as single doses ranging from 1 -to 40 -mg and as repeat oral doses ranging from 2 -to 20 -mg to healthy subjects. Baricit inib has also been administered to pati ents wi th RA at doses up to 15 -mg daily for 4weeks, 10- mg daily for 24 weeks, 8- mg daily for 76 weeks, and lower doses up to 4 -mg daily for up to approximately 7 years."

The study is divided into 3 periods: a 5- week Screening Period, a 104 -week Double -Blinded Treatment Period, and a 4 -week Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od. Approximately 450 pati ents aged ≥18years who have responded inadequately to or who are intolerant oftopical therapy will be randomized at a 1:1 :1ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1-mg QD, or baricit inib 2 -mg QD (approximately 150 patients per group). Patients will be stratified at randomi zation according to disease severit y (Invest igator’s Global Assessment [IGA] 3 versus 4 )and geographic region if the planned country allocati on justifies. All procedures to be conducted during the study , including timing of all procedures, are indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Secti on9.4.4 describes co llection of laboratory samples; Appendix 2 ,Appendix 4 , Appendix 5 ,and Appendix 6 list the specific laboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 . Section 10.3.6.1 outlines information regarding the data monitoring co mmit tee (DMC ) and interim analyses. 5.1.1. Period 1: Screening The durati on of the Screening Period is between 8 and 35 days before Visit 2 (Week 0). At Visit1, the pati ent will sign the informed consent form ( ICF) before any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures areperformed (see Appendix 3 ). All screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on2). Patients who receive a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) skin test at Visit 1 will need to return within 48 to 72hours later to have the skin test read. Before randomizat ion, treatm ents f or AD will be washed out: 4 weeks for systemic treatments and 2 weeks for topical treatments (not including emo llients). Pati ents will be required to use emo llients daily during the 14 days preceding randomization and throughout the study . If patients have been using emo llients daily at the tim e of screening, then those cumulative days can be utilized to meet inclus ion criterion [8]. Addit ionally, collect ion of data through daily diaries will be requi red throughout the Screening Period. The baseline for the daily patient -reported outcome assessments will be the average score of the 7 days before rando mizat ion; thus , the minimum screening window was set at 8 days. All patients who are eligible to receive the herpes zoster vaccine (per l ocal guidelines) and who have not received it by screening will be encouraged to do so before randomization. Invest igators should review the vaccinat ion status of their patients and fo llow the l ocal guidelines for vaccinat ion of those aged ≥18years with nonlive vaccines intended to prevent infect ious di sease beforeentering pat ients into the study .Refer to Exclusion Criterion [27 ] in Secti on6.2for addi tional informat ion regarding herpes zoster vaccinat ions."

Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will enroll m oderate to severe AD patients with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to exi sting topical the rapies for whi ch a systemic treatm ent such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate."
28,page_28,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 28 LY3009104During the Screening Period (Peri od1), a washout of systemic and topical treatments for AD is incorporated before randomizat ion to minimize confounding effects because ofbackground treatm ent. The double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period (Period 2) is designed to minimize bias in the evaluat ion of the efficacy and safet y of 2baricit inib doses relative to placebo through the primary endpoint at Week 16 . In con sideration o f the disease severit y, all patients in Study JAIW are eligible for rescue to TCS. Invest igators areallowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable orworsening symptoms of AD. Once rescue medicat ion is used, the patient will be determined to be a nonresponder (see Sect ion7.7.3 ). Both EASI score and IGAs are commo nly use d in clinical tri als, both for qualifying pat ients for enrollment and for evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langley et al. 2015; Futamura e t al. 2016 ; Bożek and Reich, 2017 ). There is no single “gold standard” disease severit y scale for AD; however , IGA scale s provi de clinically meaningful measures to patients and investigators that are easil y described and that correspond to disease severi ty categori es (for example, m oderate to severe) ,and a 75% improvement from Baseline (EASI75) is a commo nly used measure of treatm ent effect in AD clinical trials . The IGA scale that will be used in this tri al, the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment of Atopic Dermatis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA; Appendix 11 ), has been devel oped internally and assesses AD severi ty using a 5 -point scale. The 16-week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is probable that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h baricit inib wit hin this t ime frame on the basis o f the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD and previous studies in another inflammatory skin condi tion. Patients who do not achieve IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 will be discont inued fro m the study . Similarly, patients who achieve an IGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16, and experi ence worsening in their disease resul ting in an IGA score of ≥3 at any time after Week 16 will also be di scontinued fro m the study . Pati ents who are discontinued fr om Study JAIW may be eligible to enroll in open -label Study JAIX. The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od3) is for safet y monitoring after the patient has been o ff invest igational product for approximately 28 days. 5.5. Justification for Dose The doses proposed for Study JAIW are baricit inib 1- mg QD and 2 -mg QD. These doses were chosen primarily on the basis of the recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 AD study , Study JAHG, and are additionally supported by pharm acokinetic, safet y, and efficacy data for baricit inibin Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studies and a Phase 2 psori asis study . In the Phase 2 Study JAHG, both the 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses showed benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints (EASI, IGA, SCORing Atopic Dermat itis [SCORAD], Patient-Oriented Eczem a Me asure [POEM], and Derm atology Life Qualit y Index [DLQI]) as compared to pl acebo, and both doses had an acceptable safety profile at Week 16. As baricit inib 2-mg QD and 4 -mg QD doses showed similar efficacy for mult iple endpo ints, a lower dose,"

Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all criteria for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio (placebo, baricit inib 1 -mg, or baricit inib 2 -mg) to doubl e-blind treatment at Visit 2(Week 0). Randomization will be stratified by geographic regio n (North America, rest -of-world) if the planne d country allocati on justifies and di sease severi ty at baseline (IGA 3 versus 4). Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a co mputer -generated random seque nce using an interactive web- response system ( IWRS ). The IWRS will be used to assign bottles, each containing double -blind invest igational product tablets to each pati ent, starting at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at visits per the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2), up to and including Visit 14 (Week 88). Si te personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct bottles by entering a confirmat ion number found on the bottleinto the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The invest igationa l product ( 1 tablet from Bottle A and 1 tablet from Bottle B) shoul d be taken QD without regard to food and, if possible, at approximately the same time every day, usually at the start of the patient’s day ,to aid pat ient compliance. 7.3. Blinding This is a doubl e-blind study .To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. All study assessments will be performed by study personnel who are blinded to the patient’s treatment group. Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, invest igators, Lilly study team, and any personnel interact ing direct ly wit h pat ients or investigat ive sites will remain blinded to baricit inib and placebo assignment . Every effort shoul d be made to preserve the blind unless there is a compelling reason that knowledge of the specific treatm ent woul d alter the m edical care of the patient. In case of an emergency , the invest igator has the so le responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a pati ent’s treatm ent assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. The p atient’ssafet y must always be the first consideration in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatment ass ignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rationale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. Emergenc y unblinding for AEs may be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding event sare recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, s ite personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly c linical research physician for the patient to con tinue in the study . Processes to maintain blinding during the interim analysis con ducted by the DMC are described in Section 10.3.6.1 ."

Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments Eczema Area and Severity Index scores The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1)erythema, (2) indurat ion/papulat ion, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenificat ion,each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al. 2001) . 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA - AD) The IGA used in this study, the vIGA -AD (refer red to as the IGA throughout the protocol ), measures the IGA of the pati ent’s overall severit y of their AD, on the basis of a stati c, numeric 5 -point scale fro m 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of ery thema, papul ation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification. 9.1.2.2. Eczema Area and Severity Index scores The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1)erythema, (2) i ndurat ion/papulat ion, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenificat ion,each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al. 2001) . BSA affected by AD will be derived fro m data collected as part of the EASI assessment. 9.1.2.3. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD index uses the rule o f nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6clinical characterist ics to determine disease severit y: (1) ery thema, (2)edema/papulat ion, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation ,(5) lichenification , and (6) dryness . The SCORAD index also assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss. These 3aspects (extent of disease, disease severit y, and subject ive symptoms )combine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder et al .1993; Kunz e t al. 1997; Schram et al. 2012) ."

Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The Hospi tal Anxiet y Depressi on Scal e (HADS ) is a 14 -item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiet y and depressio n that a patient is experiencing over the past week. The HADS utilizes a 4 -point Li kert s cale (for example, 0 to 3) for each question and is intended for ages 12 to 65 years ( Zigm ond and Snai th 1983; White et al. 1999). Scores for each domain (anxiet y and depressio n) can range from 0 to 21, wit h higher scores indicat ing greater anxiet y or depressio n (Zigmond and Snait h 1983; Snait h 2003 ). 9.1.3. Health Outcomes and Quality -of-Life Measures Thepatientself-reported questionnaires will be administered vi a either an el ectroni c pat ient diary or via an electroni c tablet . Questionnaires will have been translated into the native language of the country and/or region and linguist ically validated. 9.1.3.1. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM i s a simple, 7- item, patient-administered scale that assesses disease severit y in children and adults. Patients respond to questions about the frequency o f 7symptoms (itching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week. Response categories include “No days,” “1 -2 days,” “3- 4 days,” “5- 6 days,” and “Every day,” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Scores range from 0 -28 with higher total scores indicating greater disease severit y (Charman e t al. 2004). 9.1.3.2. Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch N umeric Rating Scale ( NRS )is a pati ent-administered , 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severit y of a pati ent’s i tching is indicated by select ingthe number that best describes the worst l evel of itching in the past 24hours (Naegeli et al. 2015; Kimball et al. 2016). 9.1.3.3. Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale The Atopic Dermat itis Sleep Scale ( ADSS ) is a 3 -item, patient -administered quest ionnaire developed to assess the impact of it ch on sleep including difficult y falling asleep, frequency of waking, and difficult y getting back to sleep the previous night. Patient’s rate their difficult y falling asleep and difficult y getti ng back to sl eep, item s 1 and 3, respectively , using a 5 -point Likert-type scale wit h response options ranging from 0 “not at all” to 4 “very difficult.” Patients report their frequency of waking the previous night, item 2, by select ing the number of times they woke up each night, ranging fro m 0 to 29 times. The A DSS i s designed to be completed each day with respondents thinking about sleep “last night.” Each item is scored individually . 9.1.3.4. Skin PainNumeric Rating Scale Skin Pain NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0represent ing “no pain” and 10 re p resent ing “worst pain imaginable.” Overall severit y of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst level o f skin pain in the previous 24 hours."

Patient Global Impression of Seve rity The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty–Atopic Derm atitis (PGI -S-AD) is a single -item question asking the patient how they woul d rate thei r overall AD symptoms over the past 24hours. The 5 categories o f responses range from “no symptoms” to “sever e.” 9.1.3.6. Dermatology Life Quality Index The Derm atology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI )is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -item, validated, qualit y-of-life quest ionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activi ties, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week.” Response categories include “not at all, ” “a little,”“a lot,” and “very much,” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively ,and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as 0 as applicable . Scores range from 0- 30 wi th higher scores indicat ing greater impairment of qualit y of life. A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect on a patient’s healt h-related qualit y of life (Hongbo et al. 2005 ), and a 4- point change from baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important difference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002; Basra et al. 2015). 9.1.3.7. European Quality of Life –5Dimensions – 5Levels The European Qualit y of Life –5 Dimensi ons –5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L )is a standardized measure of healt h status thatprovide sa simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic apprai sal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS ). The descript ive system co mprises the fo llowing 5 dimensio ns: m obility, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme pr oblems. The respondent is asked to indicate his or her healt h state by checking in the box associated with the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. It shoul d be noted that the numerals 1 to 5have no arithmetic properties and should no t be used as an ordinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vert ical VAS where the endpo ints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure of health outcom e. The EQ -5D- 5L healt h states, defined by the EQ -5D- 5L descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n (Herdman et al. 2011; EuroQol Group 2015 [WWW]). 9.1.3.8. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire –Atopic Dermatitis The Work Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment Questi onnai re–Atopic Dermat itis (WPAI-AD) records impairment due to AD during the past 7days. The WPAI -AD consists of 6items grouped into 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presentee ism (impai rment at work/reduced on -the-job effect iveness), work productivit y loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activi ty impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993 ),with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y."
54,page_54,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY30091049.1.4. Appropriateness of Assessments All assessments utilized in this study are standard, widely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant with the except ion of ADSS and Skin Pain NRS, which are currently being developed and validated according to regulatory guidances. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for m onitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appro priate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are seri ous or otherwi se me dically important, considered rel ated to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in t he study . In addi tion, si te personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs. Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to invest igational product, vi a eCRF. The invest igator wi ll interpret and docum ent whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment, or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause -and-effect rel ationship between the investigat ional product, study device ,and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as A Es unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clar ifying if possible the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificat ions, or discont inuat ions of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in 1of the f ollowing outcom es:"
55,page_55,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY3009104death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitaliz ation a life- threatening experience ( that is, immediate ri sk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but m ay jeopardize the patient or may require intervent ion to prevent 1of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporti ng requirements and t imelines if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If ale rts are i ssued via tel ephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation. Patients with a serio us hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data collected using the hepat ic safet y eCRF. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnanc y shoul d be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek A Es or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the pati ent summary CRF has been co mpleted). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipation, the investi gator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly. 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs ) are seri ous events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associ ated detailed guid ances or nati onal regulatory requirements in parti cipat ing countries requi re the reporting of SUSARs . Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed for the recording"

Adverse Events of Special Interest AEs of special interest will include the following: infect ions(including TB, herpes zoster, or opportunist ic infections) malignancies hepat ic events (see Section 9.4.9 ) major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) (see Secti on 9.4.11 ) thrombotic events (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmo nary embo lism) (see Secti on9.4.10 ). Sites will provide details on these A Es as instructed on the eCRF and may be asked for additional descripti on by Lilly . 9.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies to ensure the safet y of study participants, monitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety Any clinically significant findings from ECG testi ng, physical examinat ion, vital signs measurements, or laboratory measurement sthat resul t in a di agnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms A single 12- lead standard ECG will be obtained lo cally at Visit 1 and read by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria. ECGs m ay be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary. 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vital signs shoul d be measured according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2)."
57,page_57,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY30091049.4.3. Physical Exam For each patient, acomplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic and rectal examinat ions) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screen ing). A symptom -directed physical examinat ion will be perform ed at other visits as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). A com plete physical examinat ion may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion at any time a patient presents with physical co mplaints. 9.4.4. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory testsdetailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). With the excepti on of laboratory test resul ts that m ay unblind the study , Lilly or i ts desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. 9.4.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rat ing Scale The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideation and /or behavi or occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/clinical experience. The tool was developed by the Nati onal Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categori zation of suicidal events. For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale that cap tures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur before the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event i s seri ous or l eads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion, and the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form ,and the process for reportin g SAEs shoul d be followed. 9.4.6. Self-Harm and Follow -Up Supplement Forms Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administrati on of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral events is greater than zero, it will lead to the complet ion of the self -harm fo llow -up form. The self -harm follow-up form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases. 9.4.7. Chest X -Ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or–anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained l ocally at screening (Visit 1), unl ess results from a chest x -ray obtained wi thin 6 months before the study are available. The chest x-ray will be reviewed by the invest igator or his or her designee to exclude pat ients with active"

In addi tion, pati ents will be tested at screening ( Visit1) for evidence o f active or latent TB as described in the exclusio n criteria, Secti on6.2. Invest igators should fo llow local guidelines for m onitoring pat ients for TBif a pat ient is at hi gh risk for acqui ring TB or reactivat ion of latent TB. 9.4.8. Hepatitis B Virus DNA Monitoring Patients who are H BcAb posit ive and HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require measurement of HBV DNA per Sc hedule of Activities, regardl ess of thei r hepat itisB surface antibody status. The fo llowing acti ons shoul d be taken in response to HBV DNA test results: If a single result is obtained with a value “below limit of quant itation,” the test shoul d be repeated within approximately 2 weeks. If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” monitoring willresume as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). If the patient has 2or more test results with a value “below limit of quantitation” or a test result above the limit of quant itation, the patient will be permanently discontinued fro m invest igational product (see Section 8.1.2 ) and should be referred to a hepatology specialist. 9.4.9. Hepatic Safety Monitoring and Data Collection If a study patient experiences elevated A LT ≥3×ULN, ALP ≥2×ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2×ULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnormalit y and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator in consultat ion with the study medical m onitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should cont inue unt il levels norm alize or return to approximate baseline levels. Criteria for di scontinuat ionof invest igational products (either temporary interrupt ion or perm anent discont inuat ion) due to abnormal ALT, AST, TBL, or ALP are detailed in Secti on8.1. Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the hepat ic eCRF if 1or more of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5× ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥2×ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2×ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests patient discont inued fro m treatm ent due to a hepatic event or abnormalit y of liver tests hepat ic event considered to be anSAE"

VTE Assessme nt If a patient develops the signs and symptoms of a deep vein thro mbosis or pulmo nary embolism, appropriate local laboratory tests and imaging should be performed, as necessary , for diagnosi s of the event. For confirmed cases, addit ional laboratory testing shoul d be perform ed as outlined in Appendix 6 . All suspected VTE events will be independently adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Event Committee (see Secti on 10.3.6.3 ). 9.4.11. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members of the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data [refer to Interim Analyses sectio n,Secti on10.3.6 ]) can conduct addit ional analyses o f the safet y data. The Lilly clinical research physician will m onitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures. The Lilly clinical research physician will, as i s appropri ate, consul t with the f unctionally independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or clinical sc ientist and peri odically review trends in safet y data and l aboratory analy tes. Any concerning trends in frequency or severit y noted by an investigator and/or Lilly (or designee) may require further evaluat ion. All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed i n a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These reports will be reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or a clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to invest igational product, only Lilly Gl obal Patient Safety will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring. Invest igators will mo nitor vital signs and carefully review findings that may be associated with cardi ovascular and VTEs . AEreports and vital signs will be co llected at each study visit. The cardi ovascular m onitoring plan includes the following: regular monitoring of lipid l evels"

Pharmacokinetics Not applicable. 9.6. Pharmacodynamics Not applicable . 9.7. Pharmacog enetics 9.7.1. Blood Sample s for Pharmacogenetic Research A blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as specified in the Schedule o f Activities (Section 2)where local regulat ions allo w. There is growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy . Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, excret ion, the mechanism o f action of the drug, the disease etio logy, and/or the mo lecular subtype of the disease being treated. In the event of an unexpected AE, the samples may be genoty ped,and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genetic associat ion with response to baricitinib. These invest igations may belimited to targeted exome sequencing approach of known targets invo lved in drug metabolism or, if appropriate, genome -wide associ ation studi es may be perform ed to i dentify regions of the geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response. S amples will only be used for invest igations related to disease and drug or class of drugs under study in the context of this clinical program. Samples will notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the futur e. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to baricit inib and to investigate genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in ADor other inflammatory skin diseases. Assessment of variable response may include evaluati on of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by th e invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit fo r the study , or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or (ethical review boards/invest igational review boards )impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by Lilly . This retenti on peri od enables use of new techno logies, response to regulato ry questi ons, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in the development of baricit inib or after baricit inib beco mes commercially available."

However, exist ing approaches include who le geno me or exome sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, and candidate gene studies. Regardless of techno logy utilized ,genoty ping data generated will be us ed only for the specific research scope described in this sect ion. 9.8. Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of relevance to drug di sposi tion, target engagement, pharmacodynamic s, mechanism of action, variabilit y of pat ient response ( including safet y), and clinical outcome. Sample collect ion is incorporated into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these questions through measurement of bio molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. Bloodsamples for nonpharmacogenetic bio marker research will be co llected at the times specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2)where local regulat ions allow. Samples will be used for research on the drug target, disease process, variable response to baricit inib, pathways associated with AD, m echanism of action of baricit inib, and/or research method or i n validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to AD. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for t he study, or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ethical review board s impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly .

The proposed sample size will ensure approximately 68% power to detect anydifference between thebaricit inib 2-mg and placebo treatment group s,assuming a 10% pl acebo and 20% barici tinib 2 -mg response rate for the primary endpoint EASI75 using a Chi-squared test with a 2-sided ɑ level of 0.05. The assumpt ions are based on what was observed in the Phase 3monotherapy StudiesJAHL and JAHM . Sample size and power estimates were obtained from nQuery ® Advisor 7.0. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and healt h outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion, defined as all rando mized patients ,even the patient s who do not receive the correct treatment or otherwise d idnot follow the protocol. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Significant protocol vio lations will be described in the SAP. Unless otherwise specifie d, safety analyses will be perform edon all rando mized pat ients who receive at least 1 dose of invest igational product and who did not discont inue from the study for the reason “Lost to Follow - up” at the first postbaseline visit. Further details of other populat ions will be described in the SAP. Patients will be analyzed according to the dosing regimen to which they were assigned in the Doubl e-Blinded Treatment Period. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this s tudy will be the responsibilit y of Lilly o r its desi gnee. Adetailed SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be developed by Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol and the justificatio n for making the change will be described in the clinical study report. Addi tional expl oratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deem ed appropri ate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided ɑ level o f 0.05, unl ess otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logistic regressio n analysis wit h IGA baseline disease severi ty, baseline score and treatment group in the model. Regionmay be added as an addit ional factor if there is a sufficient number of pat ients for rest -of-world and stratificat ion has not resul tedin empt y strata. This will be finalized in the SAP. If appropriate, treatment by regio n interacti on may be added"
63,page_63,"I4V-MC-JAIW(c) Clinical Protocol Page 63 LY3009104to the m odel of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interacti on is significant at a 2 -sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative (that is, the treatm ent effect i s consistent in direct ion but not size of effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial fo r som e but not all regio ns). The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% CI of the difference in percentages will be reported. The p-value fro m the Fisher ’sexact test will also be produced. When evaluat ing cont inuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based MMRM will be used. The model will include treatment, baseline disease severi ty(IGA) , baseline score, visit, and treatment -by-visit interactio n as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by -visit interacti on as fixed continuous effects. Geographic regio n may be added as an addit ional factor if appropriate. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to m odel the between -and wit hin-patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward –Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees of freedo m. TypeIII sum s of squares for the LSMs will be used for the statist ical co mpar ison; 95% CI will also be reported. Contrasts will be set up within the model to test treatment groups at specific t ime points of interest. Further details on the use of MMRM will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables may also be made using ANCOVA with baseline disease severi ty(IGA) , treatm ent gro up,and baseline score in the model. Geographic region may be added as an addit ional factor if appropriate. TypeIII tests for LSMwill be used for statist ical compar ison between treatment groups. The LSM difference, standard error, p -value, and 95% CI may also be reported. The method used to handle missing data will be specified in the SAP. Fisher ’sexact test will be used for the A Es, discontinuat ion, and other categorical safet y data for between -treatm ent group com parisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuous safet y variables including laboratory variables will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value in the model. Shift tables for categorical safet y analyses ( for example, “high”or “low”laboratory resul ts) will also be produced. Missing Data Imputation: 1.NRI: All patients who discont inue the study or the study treatm ent at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI 50/75/90 afterdiscontinuation and onward. Patients who receive rescue therapy will be analyzed as nonresponders afterrescue and onward. An additional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 2.Continu ous variables such as EASI and SCORAD scores will be assumed to be missing after rescue or discont inuat ion, and then an MMRM analysis will be performed. An additional analysi s will be perform ed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not."

Various techniques may be used to estimate the effects of invest igational product interrupti ons on safet y measures. Further analyses may be performed and will be planned in the SAP. Data collected after init iation of rescue therapy will be summarized as appropri ate. 10.3.5. Other Analyses 10.3.5.1. Health Outcome Measures The health outcom e measures will be analyzed using methods described for continuous or categori cal data as described for efficacy measures in Section10.3.3 . 10.3.5.2. Subgroup Analyses To assess whether the treatment effect is similar across subgroups for the primary efficacy outcom e, a l ogistic model will be used and will include treatment, stratificat ion vari ables ( IGA (3,4) at baseline, baseline disease severi ty and region )as appropriate , the subgroup variable ( for example, sex), and the subgroup-by- treatm ent interacti on. If the interaction is statist ically significant at level of 0.10, the nature o f the interacti on will be explored, that is, within each subgroup the treatment effect will be est imated. Similarly, for the continuous variables of EASI, the MMRM model will include addit ional variables for subgroup and the subgroup -by-treatm ent interact ion. Subgroups to be evaluated will include geographi c region (as appropri ate), baseline severit y, sex, age, race, pr evious therapy ,etc. Further definit ions for the levels of the subgroup variables, the analysis methodology , and any addit ional subgroup a nalyses will be defined in the SAP. Because this study is not powered for subgroup analyses, all subgroup analyses will be treated as exploratory . 10.3.6. Interim Analyses 10.3.6.1. Data Monitoring Committee A DMC will monitor the overall safety of this tri al. The DMC will consist of members external to Lilly . This DMC will fo llow the rules defined in the DMC charter, focusing on potential and ident ified risks for this mo lecule and for this class of compounds. DMCmembership will include, at a minimum, specialists wi th experti se in derm atology, stati stics, and other appropriate specialt ies. The DMC will be authori zed to revi ew unblinded results of analyses by treatment group before database lock ,including study discont inuat ion data, A Es including SAEs, clinical laboratory data, vital sign data, etc. The DMC may reco mmend continuation o f the study , as designed; temporary suspensi on of enro llment; or the discontinuat ion of a particular dose regimen or the entire study . While t he DMC may request to revi ew efficacy data to investi gate the benefi t/risk relationship in the context of safet y observations for ongoing patients in the study , no inform ation regarding efficacy will be communicated . Moreover , the study will not be stopped for posi tive efficacy resul tsnor will it be stopped for fut ility. Hence, no ɑ is spent. Details of"

Unblinded Study Team for Early Regulatory Submission Besides DMC members, a limited number of preident ified individuals may gain access to the limited unblinded data, as specified in the unblinding plan, before the interim or final database lock to ini tiate or for preparation of regulatory docum ents. The study may be terminated prem aturely on the basis of fut ility following the Week 16 interim analysis. Although this is an interim analysis with respect to the ent ire study , it is the only and final analysis for the primary and all key secondary endpo ints. Therefore, all the ɑ is allocated for this interim analysis only and no other ɑ is allocated for other endpoints assessed bey ond Week 16 . Inform ation that m ay unblind the study during the analyses will not be reported to study sites or blinded study team until the study has been unblinded. Unblinding details will be specified in a separate unblinding plan document. 10.3.6.3. Adjudication Committee A blinded Clinical Event Committee will adjudicate potenti al MA CE (cardi ovascular death, MI, stroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospi talizat ion for unstable angina, hospitalizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock , coronary revascularization such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous corona ry interventi on), VTEs, and noncardiovascular deaths . Details of membership, operations, recommendations from the Committee, and the communicat ion plan will be documented in the Charter."

Multiple Imputation Placebo Multiple Imputation The pl acebo m ultiple imputati on (pMI) m ethod will be used as a sensit ivity analysis for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, EASI75, as well as the key secondary endpoints at Week 16 (Visit 8). In the main analysis, all pat ients who ei ther perm anently discont inue study treatm ent or discont inue from the study for any reason at any time or who are rescued will be considered missing after discontinuation or rescue. The secondary (“as observed”) analysis will be conducted for the primary endpoint, IGA (0,1) with ≥2-point im provement , and 4 -point improvement from baseline in Itch Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at Week 16. In this analysis, a ll patients who ei ther perm anent ly discont inue study treatm ent or discont inue from the study for any reason at any time will be considered to be missing after discont inuat ion. The pMI assumes that the statist ical behavi or of drug -and placebo -treated pati ents after discontinuing study medicat ion beco mes that of placebo -treated pati ents. Mul tiple imputati ons are use d to repl ace missing outcomes (IGA, EASI, SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD), ItchNRS, Atopic Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) Item 2, and Skin Pain NRS scores) for drug - and placebo -treated patients who discont inued using mult iple draws fro m the posteri or predict ive distribut ion estimated from the placebo arm. The binary outcomes of IGA (0,1), EASI75, EASI90, SCORAD75, and 4 -point improvement from baseline in Itch NRS will then be derived from the imputed data. Data are processed sequent ially by repeatedly calling SAS ®PROC MI to impute missing outcom es at vi sits t=1,.., T. 1.Initialization: Set t=0 (baseline visit) 2.Iteration: Set t=t+1.Create a data set combining records from drug -and placebo -treated patients wi th columns for covari ates Xand outcom es at visits 1,..,t wi th outcom es for all drug-treated pati ents set to missing at visit t and set to observed or imputed values at visits 1,..,t -1. 3.Imputation: Run Bayesian regressio n in SAS PROC MI on this data to impute missing values for visit tusing pre vious outcomes for visits 1 to t-1 and baseline covariates. Note that only placebo data will be used to estimate the imputation model since no outcome is available for drug -treated pati ents at vi sit t. 4.Replace imputed data for all drug -treated patients at visit t with their observed values, whenever available up to permanent study drug di scontinuat ion and/or rescue (if censoring on rescue). If t < T then go to Step 2, otherwise proceed to Step 5. 5.Repeat steps 1 -4, m times wit h different seed values to cre ate mimputed complete data sets."

All available data will be included in the analyses, excluding data that occurs after rescue or after permanent discont inuat ion of study drug. All pat ients in the intent -to-treat populat ion are included. Within each analysis, a most extreme case will be considered, in which all missing data for patients randomized to baricit inib 1 -mg or 2-mg will be imputed using the worst possible result and all missing data for patients randomized to placebo will be imputed with the best possible resul t. Treatm ent differences will be analyzed using logistic regressio n or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (Section 10.3.1 ) as appropriate. For continuous variables, the fo llowing process will be used to determine the tipping point: 1.To handle intermittent missing visit da ta, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method (SAS Proc MI wi th MCMC opti on) will be used to create a m onotone missing pattern. 2.A set of Bay esian regressio ns (using SAS Proc MI with MONOTONE option) will be used for the imputation of mo notone dropouts. Starting fro m the first visi t with at least 1missing value, the regression models will be fit sequent ially wi th treatm ent as a fi xed effect and values from the previous visit s as covariates. 3.A delta score is added to all imputed scores at the primary time point for patients in the baricit inib treatment groups, thus worsening the imputed value. The delta score is capped for patients based on the range of the outcome measure being analyzed. 4.Treatment differences between baricit inib and placebo are analyzed for each imputed dataset using ANCOVA. Results across the imputed datasets are aggregated using SAS Proc MI ANALYZE to co mpute a p -value for the treatment comparisons for the given delta value. 5.Steps 3 and 4 are repeated, and the delta value added to the imputed baricit inib scores is gradually increased. The ti pping po int is identified as the delta value which leads to a loss of stati stical significance (aggregated p -value >0.05) when evaluat ing baricit inib relative to the placebo group. As a reference, for each delta value used in Steps 3 -5, a fixed select ion of delta values (ranging from slight ly negative to slightly posit ive) will be added to imputed values in the placebo group, and Step 4 will be performed for the combination. This will result in a 2 -d tabl e, wi th the columns represent ing the delta values added to the imputed placebo responses, and the rows represent ing the del ta values added to the imputed baricit inib responses. Separate 2 -d tables will compare each baricit inib dose group to placebo. A similar process will be used for the categorical variables: 1.Missing responses in the baricit inib groups will be imputed with a range o f low response probabilit ies, including probabilit ies of 0, 0.1, and 0.2."

Criteria for patient eligibility for enrollment into Study JAIX and language for related sections were updated.IGA (0,1) at week 16 was assigned as a key secondary endpoint while EASI75 at week 16 became the primary endpoint. Both EASI 75 and IGA 0/1 are regulatory accepted endpoints for cli nical trials in Atopic Dermatitis. EASI 75 was already included in the study as a key secondary endpoint. Based on the available data from completed BREEZE studies, there is greater power to test EASI 75 compared to IGA 0/1, thus exchanging the order of testing of IGA 0/1 and EASI 75 will optimize the multiplicity testing approach of the study. Based on available data from completed BREEZE studies, baricitinib 1-mg was removed as a co -primary and will be considered with the secondary analyses only. To allow all patients participating in Study JAIW the opportunity to receive IP (2 -mg QD), the study design has been updated to allow “responders” from Study JAIW to enter open -label Study JAIX after"

If a patient needs to use rescue medication, the data after rescue onward will be considered missing, and missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. All patients who discontinue the study or study treatment at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables after discontinuation onward. Additional analy ses will be done using all observed data whether rescue medication was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, baseline disease severity (IGA) ,visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient variance –covariance errors.

Figure JAIW. 1. Illustration of study design for Clinical Protocol I4V -MC-JAIW. 5.4 Scientific Rationale for Study Design Both EASI score and IGAs are commo nly used in clinical trials, both for qualifying pat ients for enrollment and for evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langley et al . 2015; Futamura et al. 2016; Bożek and Reich, 2017 ). There i s no single “go ld standard” disease severit y scale for AD . However, IGA scales provi de clinically meaningful measures to patients and invest igators that are easily described and that correspond to disease severit y categori es (for example, m oderate to severe) , and a 75% improvement from Baseline (EASI75) is a commonly used measure of treatm ent effect in AD clinical trials. The IGA scale that will be used in this trial, the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment of Atopic Dermatis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA; Appendix 11 ), has been developed internally and assesses AD severit y using a 5 -point scale. The 16-week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is probable that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h baricit inib wit hin this t ime frame on the basis o f the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD and previous studies in another inflammatory skin condi tion. Patients who do not meet the primary endpoint of achieve IGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16 will be discont inued fro m the study . Similarly, patients who achieve an IGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16, and experience worsening in their disease result ing in an IGA score of ≥3 at any t ime after Week 16 will also be discontinued from the study . Pati ents who are discont inued from Study JAIW may be eligible to enroll in open - label Study JAIX. 9.1.1 Primary Efficacy Assessments Eczema Area and Severity Index scores : The EASI assesses ext ent of disease at 4 body regions and m easures 4 clinical signs: (1) ery thema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriat ion, and (4) lichenificat ion, each on a scale of 0 to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al. 2001). Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA -AD): The IGA used in this study, the vIGA -AD (referred to as the IGA throughout the protocol), measures the IGA of the patient’s overall severit y of their AD, on the basis of a static, numeric 5 -point scale fro m 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papul ation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenificatio n."

The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of ery thema, papul ation/induration, oozing/crusting, and l ichenification. The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulat ion, (3) excoriat ion, and (4) lichenificat ion, each on a scale of 0 to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. Th e EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al. 2001). BSA affected by AD will be derived fro m data collected as part of the EASI assessment. 9.1.2. 23 SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 9.1.2. 34 Hospital Anxiety D epression Scale 10.1 Sample Size Determination Study JAIW will aim to enroll approximately 450 patients aged ≥18years. The proposed sample size will ensure at least 90% approximately 68% power to detect any difference between the baricit inib 2 -mg and placebo treatment groups, assuming a 10% placebo and 250% bari citinib 2 - mg response rate for the primary endpoint EASI75 using a Chi -squared test wi th a 2-sided ɑ level of 0.0 25. The assumpt ions are based on what was observed in the Phase 23monotherapy StudyiesJAHGLand JAHM . Sample size and power estimates were obtained from nQuery ® Advisor 7.0 and through simulat ions fo llowing adjust ments for multiple comparisons . 10.3.1 General Statistical C onsiderations All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided ɑ level o f 0.05, unl ess otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit h IGA baseline disease severi ty, baseline score ,and treatment group in the model. Regionmay be added as an addit ional factor if there is a sufficient number of patients for rest -of-world and stratificat ion has not resulted in empt y strata. This will be finalized in the SAP. If appropriate, treatment by region interact ion may be added to the model of the primary and k ey secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interacti on is significant at a 2 -sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative (that is, the treatm ent effect i s consistent in direct ion but no t size of effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial fo r som e but not all regio ns). The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% CI of the difference in percentages will be reported. The p-value fro m the Fisher ’sexact test will also be produced. When evaluat ing cont inuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based MMRM will be used. The model will include treatment, baseline disease severi ty(IGA) , baseline score , visit, and treatm ent-by-visit interactio n as fixed categori cal effects and baseline"

In this analysis, Aallpatients who ei ther perm anent ly discont inue study treatm ent or discontinue fro m the study for any reason at any time will be considered to be missing after discontinuat ion. The pMI assumes that the statist ical behavi or of drug -and placebo -treated pati ents after discontinuing study medicat ion beco mes that of placebo -treated pati ents which is the rationale for “pMI as observed”. The main analysis will be conducted to keep in line wit h the other analyses and to assess the impact of p MI with other imputation methods . Mul tiple imputati ons are used to replace missing outcomes (IGA, EASI, SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD), ItchNRS, Atopic Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) Item 2, and Skin Pain NRS scores) for drug - and placebo -treated pati ents who di scont inued using mult iple draws fro m the posteri or predi ctive distribut ion estimated from the placebo arm. The binary outcomes of IGA (0,1), EASI75, EASI90, SCORAD75, and 4 -point improvement from baseline in Itch NRS will then be derived from the imputed data. Tipping Point Analyses To investigate the missing data mechanism, sensit ivity analysis using mult iple imputati on (MI) under the missing not at random assumpt ion will be provided for the fo llowing primary and major secondary objectives: EAS I75 at Week 16, baricit inib 2 -mg compared to placebo. IGA (0,1) with ≥2-point improvement at Week 16, baricit inib 2-mg co mpared to placebo, EASI mean percent change fro m baseline to Week 16, baricit inib 2 -mg co mpared to placebo, Itch NRS 4 -point improvement from baseline to Week 16, baricit inib 2-mg co mpared to placebo."

A djustment for Multiple Comparisons The primary hypothes ies H 2,1,0and H 1,1,0will each be tested at a 2-sided α=0.0 25. If the init ial null hypothes ies areisnot rej ected, no further testing will be conducted as the α for that test is considered “spent” and cannot be passed to other endpo ints. If H 2,1,0is rejected, then α will be propagated to H 2,2,0. In addit ion, if H 1,1,0is rejected, then α will be split equally and propagated to H 2,1,0and H 1,2,0. The testing process will cont inue in both branch es(starting wit h H 2,2,0and H1,2,0respectively ),with α propagated according to the weights on the corresponding edges displayed in Figure JAIW .2, as long as each hypothesis in the sequence can be rejected at its allocated α level. Each time a hypothesis is rejected, the gr aph will be updated to reflect the reallocat ion of α, which is considered “recycled” by Alo sh et al . 2014. Thi s iterative process of updating the graph and reallocat ing α will be repeated un til all hypotheses have been tested or when no remaining hypothes es can be rejected at their corresponding α levels."
