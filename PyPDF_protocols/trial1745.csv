Statins are among the most prescribed medi- cations with well -established safety and efficacy. Statins are recom- mended in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, which has been linked to both MDD and obesity. Moreover, statins are promising candi- dates to treat MDD because a meta -analysis of pilot randomized con- trolled trials has found antidepressive effects of statins as adjunct therapy to antidepressants. However, no study so far has tested the antidepres- sive potential of statins in patients with MDD and comorbid obesity 1 2010/C 82/01, 2.5, 43."

An investigator may discontinue or with- draw a participant from the study for the following reasons: - If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other med- ical condition occurs such that c ontinued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant (see also 11.1) Discontinuation of the trial According to the German Fachinformation for Simvastatin , the combined incidence for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis in 41.413 patients treated for at least 4 years was 0.0 8% for 40mg/d Simvastatin. Severe symptomatic hy- ponatremia (serum sodium [S Na] <125 mmol/L) is a rare but potentially fa- tal complication of Escitalopram. Signs and symptoms of hyponatr emia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, conf u- sion, weakness, and unsteadiness and can be as severe as hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Therefore, the whole study may be discontinued at the occurrence of the treatment -re- lated serious adverse event (SAE) “myopathy/ rhabdomyolysis” as defined by the German Fachinformation for Simvastatin [muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN)] in more than 5 participants or the treatment -related SAE “severe sympto matic hyponatremia” (serum sodium [S Na] <125 mmol/L) in more than 5 participants. In addition, a n early discontinuation of the trial may be decided if new scientific data during the course of the trial changes the risk -benefit -balance significantly. If suc h data emerges, recruitment and treatment of currently treated patients will be paused immediately. A final decision on continuation or termination of the trial will then made by the Sponsor/PI based on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Statistical analy- sis Primary efficacy (confirmatory) endpoint : The primary analysis will compare MADRS change from baseline to week 12 between the Simvastatin and placebo group by Gaussian linear models for repeated measures (so -called MMRM) with intervention, center, time (week 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12), and intervention -by-time interaction as factors, and baseline MADRS score as covariate. The primary analysis popu lation will be the intention -to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary efficacy (exploratory) endpoints : The secondary efficacy endpoints include the percentage s of MADRS -re- sponse, MADRS -remission, and MADRS -MCID within 12 weeks that will be analyzed by logistic regression models with intervention and center as factors and baseline MADRS as covariate. The analyses of secondary ef- ficacy endpoint BDI-II will follow the same lines as the primary outcome. The analyses of safety parameters and all secondary endpoints will have an exploratory character. Pharmacological - toxicological eval- uation Both Simvastatin and Escitalopram are approved for several indications since decades . The respective “latest version of German Fachinformation” for each medication are in the Investigator site file (ISF) . Risks, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, Simvastatin is the IMP that will be tested versus placebo as add -on to standard an tidepressant medication with Escitalopram , which will be given open label to each patient. We list the risks and potential adverse drug"

See for further information the latest version of German “Fachinformation”. Simvastatin : Simvastatin is approved for several indication s since dec- ades and has in general proven to be a safe medication. The risks and adverse effects listed below are all taken from the latest version of German “Fachinformation ”. The most prominent risk o f statin use is myopathy , associated with muscle pain, muscle tenderness, muscle weakness and increases of creatin e ki- nase (CK). The most severe form of myopathy is rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglob inuria that occurs ver y rarely and is dose -dependent. The combined incidence for myopa- thy/rhabdomyolysis in 41.413 patients treated for at least 4 years was 0.03% for 20mg/d, 0.08% for 40mg/d, and 0.61% for 80 mg/d Simvastatin . Thus, t o minimize the risk of Simvastatin , we will use it in a medium dose (40mg /d) and not a high dose (80mg /d). In addition to safety laboratory values at screening, baseline, week 4, and week 12 , It will be explicitly asked if the patient experienced unexplained muscle pain or dark urine as a sign of r habdomyolysis. Other adverse effects are listed below and the information is t aken from the latest version of German “Fachinformation” and classified as follows: Very often: (>1/10); often (> 1/100); sometimes (> 1/1000), rarely (> 1/10.000), very rarely (< 1/10.000); not known (cannot be determined on basis of available data) Very often: none Often: none Sometimes: none Rarely : Anemia, headache, dizziness, paresthesia, peripheral neuropa- thy, obstipation, stomach ache, flatulence, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nau sea, emesis, pancreatitis, hepatitis /icterus , rash, pruritus, alopecia, myopa- thy, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, muscle cramps, asthenia Very rarely: insomnia, memory complaints, liver failure Not known: depression, interstitial lung disease, tendinopathy, immun e- mediated myopathy, erectile dysfunction Medication that is contraindicated with Simvastatin due to inhibition of CYP3A4 will not be permitted (Itraconazol, Ketoconazol, Posaconazol, Voriconazol, Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. Nelfinavir) , Boceprevir, Telaprevir, Nefazodon, Cobicistat, Ciclosporin, Dana zol, Gemfibrozil). Further, medication that is not recommended to use in parallel to Simvas- tatin in a dosage of 40 mg/d will not be permitted (Fibrates, Amiodaron, Amlodipin, Verapamil, Fluconazol, Diltiazem , Fusidic acid, Niacin , Lo- mitapid ). Finally, pati ents will be noticed that they should not drink grapefruit juice during Simvastatin treatment due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and correspond- ing increases in Simvastatin plasma levels."

Patients with contraindications for Simvastatin will not be included or ex- cluded from the study in case of later occurrence (see under inclusion cri- teria). In case of an emergency the blind will be broken immediately and the pa- tient will receive immediate medical care. Escitalopram : The most prominent risk of Escitalopram is QTc -Prolonga- tion in the ECG that can lead to ventricular arrhythmia (torsade des pointes). To excl ude patients with QTc -prolongation an ECG will be con- ducted at screening . Furthermore, an additional safety ECG will be con- ducted at every visit . Other adverse effects are listed below and the information is taken from the latest version of German “Fachin formation” and classified as follows: Very often: (>1/10); often (> 1/100); sometimes (> 1/1000), rarely (> 1/10.000), very rarely (< 1/10.000); not known (cannot be determined on basis of available data) Very often: headache, nausea Often: decreased appetite, increased appetite, weight gain, anxiety, restlessness, nightmares, decreased libido, anorgasmia, insomnia, fa- tigue, diz ziness, paresthesia, tremor, sin usitis, yawning, diarrhea, obsti- pation , emesis, dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, arthralgia, myalgia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction , fever Sometimes: weight loss, bruxism, agitation, nervousness, panic at- tacks, confusion, disturbed taste, insomnia, syncope, mydriasis, blurred vision, tinnitus, tachycardia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, urticar- ial, alopecia, rash, pruritus, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, edema Rarely: anaphylaxis, aggression, depersonalization, hallucination, ser- otonin syndrome, bradycardia Very rarely: none Not known: thrombocytopenia, inadequate ADH -secretion, hypo- natremia , anorexia, mania, suicidality, dyskinesia, seizures, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness) , QTc -prolongation in the ECG, orthostasis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes, ecchymosis, angioedema, urinary retention, galactorrhea, priapism Medication that is c ontraindicated with Escitalopram will not be permitted, which includes all irreversible MAO -inhibitors and medication that is asso- ciated with QTc -prolongation [antiarrhythmica class IA and III, antipsychot- ics (e.g. haloperidol ), phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, antibiotics (e.g. moxifloxacin ), and certain antihistaminergic drugs ( e.g. astemizol, mi- zolastin) ]. Patients with contraindications for Escitalopram will not be included (please see under inclusion criteria).

All de- pressed patients enrolled in the trial will be continuously treated with a"

For Escitalopram a dose -response relationship has been suggested. Especially for patients with severe depre ssion the high standard dose of 20 mg /d was shown to be superior compared to 10 mg/d [1]. A fixed -dose of 10 mg /d Escitalopram for the entire study duration of 12 weeks would therefore not allow the optim al treatment for some pa- tients . Thus, we consider this option ethically not justifiable. A dose in- crease from 10 mg /d to 20 mg /d based on individual patient response would however interfere with comparability of the treatment group and pla- cebo group, becau se a strong decrease in depressive symptoms in the treatment group compared to placebo group could potentially be masked by a higher percentage of Escitalopram dose escalation in the placebo group. Therefore, we will increase Escitalopram to 20 mg /d after giving a low standard dose of 10 mg /d in the first two weeks. In case of adverse reactions related to Escitalopram, we will follow the instructions for dose adjustment described in 7.2.4 Treatment schedule / Dose regimen. IMP Simvastatin is offered in an “add-on” design, thus there will be virtually no drug -free patients in this trial. Invasive interventions beyond ordinary sampling of peripheral venous blood will not be performed within this trial, therefore the risks associated with trial participation a re mainly attributable to IMP Simvastatin that has already been shown in depressed patients to be safe and well tolerated in combination with an SSRI (Selective Seroto- nin Reuptake Inhibitor) [2]. It has been suggested that both for the lipid -lowering effects and for the pleiotropic effects of statins a high dose is more effective than a low dose [3-5]. Especially in studies examining effects of statins on diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis and mild cognitive dis- order a high dose of Simvastatin (60 – 80 mg/d ) has been administered [6-8]. One of the most important side effects of Simvastatin is dose -de- pendent risk of myopathy. The combined incidence for myopathy/rhabdo- myolysis under Simvastatin was 0.03% for 20 mg/d, 0.08% for 40 mg/d and markedly went up to 0.61% for 80 mg/d according to latest version of German “Fachinformation” . To minimize t he risk of Simvastatin and exam- ine the pleiotropic effects of Simvastatin in depression, we will use it in a medium dose (40 mg/d ) and not a high dose (80 mg/d ). In addition to as- sessing safety laboratory values including creatine kinase (CK) at screen- ing, baseline, at week 4, week 8 and week 12, it will be explicitly asked during each visit if the patient experienced unexplained muscle pain or dark urine as a sign of rhabdomyolysis. Furthermore, we will not include particularly vulnerable patients (e.g. pa tients with renal impairment, un- treated hypothyroidism or history of muscle toxicity under statins or fi- brates) to our study. To exclude patients with QTc -prolongation an ECG will be conducted at screening . Furthermore, an additional safety ECG will be con ducted at every visit . According to a meta -analysis of small, r andomized controlled trials, a ben- eficial antidepressive effect of Simvastatin is to be expected [2]. Many de- pressed patients with comorbid obesi ty might additionally benefit from Simvastatin in terms of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ."

Importantly, a recent ex- tensive literature review on parallel SSRI and statin use concluded the following: “ Escitalopram , Citalopram, and Paroxetine are almost certain to be safe with all statins” [9]."

Pharmakologisch - toxikologische Prüfung Sowohl Simvastatin als auch Escitalopram sind für mehrere Indikationen seit Jahrzehnten zugelassene Medikamente. Die jeweiligen aktuellsten Versionen der deutschen Fachinformationen befinden sich im Investigator site file (ISF) . Mögliche Risiken, Nebenwirkungen, Kontraindikatio- nen, Maßnahmen, die bei eventuel- len Zwischenfällen zu ergreifen sind Simvastatin ist das IMP ( Investigational Medical Product ), welches gegen ein Placebo als Zusatz therapie zur konventionellen Antidepressiva -Stan- dardt herapie mit Escitalopram („open label“ ) jedem Teilnehmer verab- reicht wird . Im Folgenden sind die Risiken und möglichen unerwünschten Ereignisse für beide Medikamente aufgelistet. Siehe für weitere Informati- onen die aktuellste Version der deutschen Fachinfo rmation. Simvastatin : Simvastatin ist seit mehreren Jahrzehnten für mehrere Indi- kationen zugelassen und ist als sichere Medikation anerkannt . Die folgen- den Risiken und unerwünschten Ereignisse sind de r aktuellsten Version der deutschen Fachinformation entnommen. Simvastatin ruft gelegentlich eine Myopathie hervor, die sich in Muskel- schmerzen, -empfindlichkeit oder –schwäche verbunden mit Erhöhungen der Kreatinkinase (CK) äußert. Die schwerwiegendste Form von Myopa- thie ist Rhabdomyolyse mit oder ohne aku tem Nierenversagen aufgrund von Myoglobinurie , welche sehr selten vorkommt und dosisabhängig ist. Die kombinierte Inzidenz für Myopathie/Rhabdomyolyse in 41.413 Patien- ten, die mind. 4 Jahre behandelt wurde, war 0 ,03 % für 20 mg/d, 0 ,08 % für 40 mg/d, und 0 ,61 % für 80 mg/d Simvastatin . Um die Risiken von Sim- vastatin zu minimieren, werden wir die mittlere Dosis (40 mg/d ) und nicht die hohe Dosis (80 mg/d ) verwenden. Zusätzlich zu einem Sicherheitsla- bor, welches zu m Screening, zur Baseline, Woche 4 und Woche 12 aus- geführt wird, wird explizit danach gefragt, ob der Patient unter anderweitig unerklärliche n Muskelschmerzen oder dunklem Urin als Hinweis für Rhab- domyolyse gelitten hat/leidet."

Patienten werden außerdem darauf hingewiesen, dass sie keinen Grape- fruitsaft im Zeitraum der Behandlung mit Simvastatin zu sich nehmen sol- len, aufgrund der Inhibition von CYP3A4 und dem korrespondierenden Anstieg der Simvastatin -Plasma konzentration . Medika mente, welche CYP3A4 induzieren und demnach zu erniedrigten Simvastatin -Plasmalevel führen, werden auch nicht zugelassen (Carbamazepin, Efavirenz, Nevirapin, Etravirin). Patienten, die eine Kontraindikation bzgl. Simvastatin aufweisen, werden nicht in die Studie eingeschlossen oder bei späterem Auftreten von der Studie ausgeschlossen (siehe Einschlusskriterien ). Im Falle eines Notfalls wird die Verblindung unmittelbar aufge hoben , und der Patient erhält eine medizinische Versorgung. Escitalopr am: Das bedeutendste Risiko von Escitalopram stellt eine QTc - Verlängerung im EKG dar, welche zu ventrikuläre Arrhythmien ( Torsade de Pointes ) führen kann.

Haloperidol ), Phenothiazin, trizyklische An- tidepressiva, Antibiotika (z.B. Moxifloxacin ) und bestimmte Antihistami- nika (z.B. Astemizol, Mizolastin) ]. Patienten, die eine Kontraindikation bzgl. Escitalopram aufweisen, werden nicht in die Studie eingeschlossen bzw. bei s päterem Auftreten aus der Studie ausgeschlossen (siehe Ausschlusskriterien). Risiko -Nutzen -Ab- wägung Beide Medikamente (Simvastatin, Escitalopram) sind seit Jahrzehnten für mehrere Indikationen zugelassen und haben sich insgesamt als sicher er- wiesen. Alle depressiven Patienten , die in die Studie eingeschlossen sind, werden kontinuierlich mit einem Standard -Antidepressivum ( Esci- talopram ) behandelt, welches durch die Nationale Versorgungsleitlinie als „Goldstandard“ für die Behandlung von MDD beschrieben wurde. Es gibt Hinweise für eine Dosis -Wirkungs -Beziehung von Escitalopram. Insbe- sondere konnte für Patienten mit einer schweren Depression gezeigt wer- den, dass sie von der höheren Standarddosierung von Escitalopram 20 mg/d profitieren [1]. Eine fixe Dosierung von 10 mg/d Escitalopram für die gesamte Studienteilnahme von 12 Wochen würde daher einem Teil der Patienten nicht die bestmögliche Therapie ermöglichen und wäre aus un- serer Sicht ethisc h nicht vertretbar. Eine Aufdosierung von 10 mg/d auf 20"

Daher werden wir die Dosierung nach initialer Dosierung von 10 mg/d in den ersten beiden Wochen auf 20 mg/d erhöhen bis zum Studienende. Dennoch ist bei Auftreten von Ver- träglichkeitsproblemen eine langsamere Aufdosierung bzw. eine Dosisre- duktion möglich mit folgendem Dosisänderungsschema (siehe Kapitel 7.2.4 ). Simvastatin als IMP wird als Zusatztherapie verabreicht, sodass keine me- dikamentenfreien Patienten in der Studie eingeschlossen sind. Invasive Interventionen, zusätzlich zur Entnahme von venösem Blut, werden in die- ser Studie nicht angewandt. Die Risiken, d ie mit einer Studienteilnahme einhergehen, beziehen sich dementsprechend hauptsächlich auf Simvas- tatin als IMP, welches bereits bei depressiven Patienten eingesetzt wurde und sich in Kombination mit SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhi- bitor) als gut ve rträglich erwiesen hat [2]. Sowohl für die lipidsenkende Wirkung als auch für die p leiotropen Effekte von Statinen gibt es Hinweise, dass eine hohe Statindosis effektiver ist als die niedrige Standarddosis [3-5]. Insbesondere bei ZNS -Erkrankungen wie Multiple Sklerose und leichter kognitiver Störung wurde in bisherigen Studien die hohe Dosis von Simvastatin (60 – 80 mg/d ) verabreicht [6-8]. Eine der wichtigsten Nebenwirkungen von Simvastatin ist die dosisabhän- gige Myopathie. Die Myopathiehäufigkeit unter Simvastatin lag annährend bei 0,03 % unter 20 mg/d , bei 0,08 % unter 40 mg/d und steigt erst unter 80 mg/d deutlich an auf 0,61 % laut aktuellster Version der deutschen Fachinformation. Um die Risiken von Simvastatin zu minimieren und gleichzeitig die pleiotropen Effekte von Simvastatin bei Depression zu un- tersuchen , werden wir eine mittlere Dosis von 40 mg/d und nicht eine hohe Dosis von 80 mg/d verabreichen. Zusätzlich erheben wir Sicherheitspara- meter inklusive Krea tininkinase (CK) im Blut zum Screening, zur Baseline und jeweils in Woche 4 , 8 und 12. Ferner wird der Patient z u jede r Visite, explizit nach unerklärliche n Muskelschmerzen und dunklem Urin gefragt als Zeichen für Rhabdomyolyse . Weiterhin schließen wir bes onders ge- fährdete Patientengruppen (z.B. Patienten mit Nierenfunktionsstörung, unbehandelter Hypothyreose oder muskulärer Symptomatik unter Be- handlung mit Statinen oder Fibraten in der Anamnese) per Ein - und Aus- schlusskriterien nicht in die Studie ein. Um Patienten mit einer QTc -Ver- längerung auszuschließen, wird ein S icherheits -EKG zum Screening und bei jeder anderen Visite ausgeführt. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen einer kürzlich erschienenen Metaanalyse, welche kleine RCTs umfasste, ist ein vorteilhafter antidepressiver Effekt von Simvastatin zu erwarten [2]. Viele Patienten mit komorbider Adiposi- tas könnten zusätzlich, hinsichtlich einer primären Prävention von kardi- ovaskulären Krankheiten , von der Einnahme von Simvastatin profitieren. Zusammenfassend überwiegt der potentielle Nutzen der Studie deutlich den potentiellen Risiken , die bei einer Einnahme von Simvastatin und Escitalopram auftreten könnten.

Introduction 4.1 Introduction and b ackground The World Health Organization’s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study just recently demon- strated that of all diseases worldwide , major depressive disorder (MDD) is among the top 5 with regard to years lived with disability (YLD) [10]. Among all psychiatric disorders, MDD is by far the leading cause of disability [11]. The 12 -months prevalence of MDD in Germany is 6% (women: 8.1%; men: 3.8%) [12]. Mortality rates of MDD are twice as high compared to the general popu- lation and translate to a reduced life expectancy of 14.0 years in men and 10.1 years in women [13]. The prevalence of obesity in the German population is 23.3% in men and 23.9% in women [14]. In patients with obesity, mortality rates are elevated and they increase in relation to BMI as re- cently confirmed in a meta -analysis of 239 studies from four continents [15]. In the GBD study, obesity was estimated to cause 3.4 million deaths, 3.9% of years of life lost, and 3.8% of disabil- ity-adjusted life years worldwide [16]. MDD and obesity are both linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, further increasing their public health and economic impact. Importantly, MDD and obesity frequently co - occur and the presence of one co ndition increases the risk for developing the other [17]. Statins (3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl Co -A reductase inhibitors) are among the most prescribed medications worldwide with well -established safety and efficacy. Recent guidelines recommend use of statins in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [18], which has b een linked to both MDD and obesity. Moreover, statins are highly promising candidates to treat MDD as described in detail below. However, no randomized controlled study so far has tested the antidepressive potential of statins in patients with MDD and com orbid obesity. Importantly, this is a difficult -to-treat population that often exhibits a chronic course of MDD and treatment resistance [19-22]. Given the enormous public health impact of MDD and obesity and given the evidence of antidepressive effects of"

Simvastatin administration is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in s aturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk of CHD, Simvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet. The indications listed below are taken fr om the prescribing information for Simvastatin (“Fachinformation SimvaHEXAL® , aktuellste Ver- sion”). - Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events . Simvastatin is indicated to o Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing CHD deaths. o Reduce the risk of non -fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. o Reduce the need for coronary and non -coronary revascularization procedures. - Hyperlipidemia . Simvastatin is indicated to o Reduce elevated total cholesterol (total -C), low -density lipoprotein ch olesterol (LDL -C), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high - density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa, heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb). o Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type lV hy- perlipidemia). o Reduce elevated TG and VLDL -C in patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type lll hyperlipidemia). o Reduce total -C and LD L-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterol- emia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid -lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable. - Adolescent Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) . Simvas- tatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total -C, LDL -C, and Apo B levels in ado- lescent boys and girls who are at least one-year post-menarche, 10 -17 years of age, with HeFH, if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: o LDL cholesterol remains 190 mg/dL; or o LDL cholesterol remains 160 mg/dL and o There is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) or o Two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient. In patients with CHD or at high risk of CHD, Simvastatin can be started simultaneously with diet. For patients at high risk for a CHD event due to existing CHD, diabetes, peripheral vessel dis- ease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, the re commended starting dose is 40 mg/d. Lipid determinations should be performed after 4 weeks of therapy and periodically there- after. Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, particularly during the first year of treatment, use of the 80 mg/d dose of Simvastatin should be restricted to patients who have been taking Simvastatin 80 mg/d chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity. Patients who are currently tolerating the 80 mg/d dose of Simvastatin who need"
32,page_32,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 26 of 70 to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for Simvastatin should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug -drug inter- action. Due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, associated with the 80 mg/d dose of Simvastatin , patients unable to achieve their LDL -C goal utilizing the 40 mg/d dose of Simvastatin should not be titrated to the 80 mg/d dose, but should be placed on alternative LDL-C-lowering treatment(s) that provides greater LDL -C lowering. For adverse drug reactions and restrictions, contraindications and drug interactions see 7.2.5. 4.2.2 Physical, Chemical, and Pharmaceutical Properties and Formulation Simvastatin is a lipid -lowering agent that is derived synthetically from a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus. After oral ingestion, Simvastatin , which is an inactive lactone, is hydrolyzed to the corresponding β -hydroxyacid form. This is an inhibitor of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl -co- enzy me A (HMG -CoA) reductase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of HMG -CoA to meva- lonate, which is an early and rate -limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Simvastatin is butanoic acid, 2,2 -dimethyl -,1,2,3,7,8,8a -hexahydro -3,7-dimethyl -8-[2-(tetrahy- dro-4- hydroxy -6-oxo-2H-pyran -2-yl)-ethyl] -1-naphthalenyl ester, [1S -[1α,3α,7β ,8β (2S*,4S*), - 8aβ ]]. The empirical formula of Simvastatin is C25H38O5 and its molecular weight is 418.57. Its structural formula is: Simvastatin is a white to off -white, nonhygroscopic, crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water, and freely soluble in chloroform, methanol and ethanol. Simvastatin for oral administra- tion contain the following inactive ingredients: ascorbic acid, citr ic acid, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxides, lactose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, talc, and titanium dioxide. Butylated hydroxyanisole is added as a preservative. Simvastatin should be store d between 5 -25°C. 4.2.3 Nonc linical Studies Simvastatin is a prodrug and is hydrolyzed to its active β-hydroxyacid form, simvastatin acid, after administration. Simvastatin is a specific inhibitor of 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl -coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG -CoA to mevalonate, an early and rate limiting step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol [23]. The primary mech- anism of action is the lowering of serum cholesterol through inhibiting hepatic cholesterol biosyn- thesis thereby upregulating the hepatic low -density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and increasing the clearance of LDL -cholesterol (LDL -C) [24]. Simvastatin reduces very low -density lipoprotein (VLDL ) and triglyceride ( TG) and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [23]. In addition, Simvastatin may exert cardiovascular protective effects that are independent of LDL - C lowering called “pleiotropic” effects. Because statins inhibit the production of isoprenoid inter- mediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, the post -translational prenylation of small gua- nosine triphosphate binding proteins such as Rho and Rac, and their downstream effectors such as Rho kinase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases are also inhibited. In cell culture and animal studies, these effects alter th e expression of endothelial nitric oxide syn- thase, the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, the production of pro -inflammatory cytokines and"

[24] Simvastatin has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in rats [25]. In addition, statin effects in animal models on several neurobiological processes and structures with relevance for MDD such as inflammatory markers, glucocorticoids and serotonin in the hippocampus, g lutamatergic N - Methyl -D-Asparte (NMDA) receptors, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels, and do- pamine receptors have been demonstrated (for review of CNS effects of statins see [26]). Oral absorption of Simvastatin is rapid and the bioavailability low due to an extensive first -pass metabolism. Plasma protein binding is high for Simvastatin (> 95%). Simvastati n undergoes en- terohepatic circulation and is recovered mainly in feces via bile, the extent of which is species - dependent. Elimination is rapid with metabolism being the main elimination route . Metabolism varies with the animal species, particularly the be ta-oxidation of the dihydroxy heptanoic side chain that occurs primarily in rodents . [27] The IC 50 (the concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis) value of Simvastatin varies from 1.0 to 23 nM in different experimental systems. [23] The administration of high dosages of Simvastatin has resulted in the production of toxicity in a variety of tissues and in a number of species. However, the investigative toxicology studies have indicated that many are mechanism -based phenomena occurring only at high dosage levels of Simvastatin and are the product of a profound, prolonged inhibition of the target enzyme that is not achieved at clinical dosages in humans . [28] On the other hand, muscle injury upon statin treatment has been confirmed and it has been shown that it can be prevented in a rat model by giving mevalonate , the product of the inhibited enzyme [29]. Simvastatin was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits, but in several t eratology studies in the 1980s Lovastatin was found to produce fetal malformations in rats and atorvastatin at maternally toxic doses was linked to developmental toxicity [30-32]. 4.2.4 Effects in humans Elevated levels of serum cholesterol is associated with the development of atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular risk [33]. Simvastatin decreases cholesterol biosynthesis and de- creases serum LDL -C and triglyceride levels [34]. Landmark clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of Simvastatin for both primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) [35]. In addition, t here i s cumulative evidence for pleiotropic effects in humans but its contribution to clinical outcomes in addition to LDL -C lowering remains unknown [24]. Simvastatin show ed antidepressive effects as adjunct treatment to Fluoxetin in one recent RCT [36] (see Figure 2). With regard to lipid levels, however, no change was reported during the course of th e study (6 weeks) . Concerning this, t he effect of statin for prevention of depression was found to be independent of the cholesterol lowering effects of statins [37]. Furthermore, Simvastatin was superior to atorvastatin in depressed patients with heart disease [38]. According to a meta -analysis of small, randomized controlled trials with various statins , a beneficial antide- pressive effect of Simvastatin is to be expected [2] (see Figure 3). Effects of Simvastatin on depressed patients with comorbid obesity is not known to our knowledge , but it is to be expected that they might additionally benefit from Simvastatin in terms of primary prevention. Simvastatin passes the blood -brain barrier [39]."
34,page_34,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 28 of 70 Figure 2: Randomized controlled trial examining the effect of add -on Simvastatin vs. add -on placebo to Fluoxe- tine in pa tients with major depression (Gougol et al, J Psychopharmacol, 201 5)[36]. Simvastatin undergoes oxidative metabolism, primarily by cytochrome P450 3A4, while simvas- tatin acid is oxidised via CYP 3A4 and β -oxidation enzyme systems. Both the parent lactone form and the acid are normally present in very small amounts in plasma due to a high hepatic extrac- tion ratio ( ∼ 95%). The major active metabolites of simvastatin present in human plasma are t he β-hydroxyacid of simvastatin and its 6´ -hydroxy, 6´ -hydroxymethyl, and 6´ -exomethylene deriva- tives. Peak plasma concentrations of both active and total inhibitors were attained within 1.3 to 2.4 hours postdose [32]. Simvastatin is cleared predominantly by the liver . Nevertheless, the plasma concentration of HMG -CoA reductase inhibitory activity is probably higher for Simvastatin in patients with severe renal insufficiency as it is for Lovastatin. Although simvastatin is a sub- strate for CYP 3A4 simvastatin 80 mg inhibit ed neither hepatic nor intestinal CYP 3A4. Therefore, simvastatin can be given with other substrates of CYP 3A4 without concern over effects on their plasma levels. There is also no evidence that simvastatin inhibits other cytochrome isoforms. Furthermore, simvastatin is not known to cause any clinically significant change in the plasma levels of any other drug, regardless of its metabolism and clearance pathways. In addition, the plasma concentrations of simvastatin and its metabolites are too low to cause significant protein binding displacement reactions. [40] CYP 3A4 inh ibitors can produce substantial increases in the plasma concentrations of the parent lactone form and the equivalent acid, although the absolute levels remain quite low. However, there are, in addition, three downstream oxidised active metabolites of simva statin that together account for about 75% of the HMG -CoA reductase inhibitory activity in plasma. The only known consequence of drug interactions between certain CYP 3A4 inhibitors and simvastatin is an in- crease in the risk of myopath y. [40] Except for rare cases of myopathy and marked but asymptomatic i ncreases in hepatic transam- inases, none of the adverse effects of simvastatin found in animals occur at human therapeutic doses [40]. The most severe form of myopathy is rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria that occurs very rarely and is dose -dependent. The combined incidence for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis in 41.413 patients treated for at least 4 years was 0.03% for 20 mg/d, 0.08% for 40 mg/d, and 0.61% for 80 mg/d Simvastatin [32]. In regard to drug inter- actions with SSRI a recent extensive literature review concluded the fol lowing: “Escitalopram, Citalopram, and Paroxetine are almost certain to be safe with all statins” [9]. Increasing age, female gender, renal insufficiency, subclinical hypothyroidism, polypharmacy, high levels of physical activity, alcohol and drug abuse, HIV infection, severe trauma , surgery with increased metabolic demands , genetic factors and inherited mitochondrial diseases have been related to increased risk of statin -induced myopathy [41]. In a meta -analysis of randomized trials, s tatin therapy was found to be associated with a slightly increased r isk of development of diabetes, but"
35,page_35,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 29 of 70 the risk was considered low both in absolute terms and when compared with the reduction in coronary events [42]. A systematic review on the risks of statins in pregnancy couldn’t show a clear relationship of congenital anomalies with statin use in pregnancy and proposed that statins are probably not teratogenic [43]. 4.2.5 Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator Simvastatin is approved for several indications since decades and has in general proven to be an effective and safe medication in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [18], whic h has been linked to both MDD and obesity. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that adjunctive treat- ment with statins could be useful for the treatment of depressive symptoms. Therefore, in our study, we want to investigate whether add-on Simvastatin to standard antidepressant medication improves depression to a greater extent than adjunct placebo in patients with major depression and comorbid obesity. In randomized trials, statin therapy appears to cause only a slight increased risk of side effects comp ared with placebo, and no increased risk of discontinuation of therapy compared with pla- cebo [44]. In 2017, a meta -analysis of 22 placebo -controlled trials on statin use involving nearly 130,000 participants showed that 13.3 % of subjects receiving a statin discontinued t he drug compared with 13.9 % of subjects on placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 -1.06) over a mean follow -up of 4.1 years [45]. The most prominent risk of statin use is myopathy, associated with muscle pain, muscle weak -ness and increases of creatin e kinase (CK). The most severe form of myopathy is rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinu- ria that occurs very rarely and is dose -dependent. Statin -induced myopathy appears to have a multi -factorial et iology that includes the effects that statins have on myocyte metabolism, the use of other concomitant drugs that increase statin blood levels, and genetic variables that predis- pose some patients to myopathy. Still, the risk -to-benefit ratio for most dyslipidemic patients greatly favors treatment with statins [46]. In regard to drug interaction with our standard medica- tion Escitalopram , no clinic ally significant pharmacokinetic interaction is expected. Nevertheless, due to the increased risk of muscle injury and the corresponding warning from the US Food and Drug Administration we will be using a dose of 40 mg/d Simvastatin in our study. Because in pregnancy Simvastatin is contra indicated, pregnan t or breastfeeding women or women with childbearing potential without acceptable form of contraception will not be included in the study and a highly sensitive serum HCG test will be conducted at screenin g visit , baseline, week 4, week 8 and at the end -of-study for women of childbearing potential . 4.3 Rationale Evidence for antidepressive effects of statins has accumulated from four independent lines of research : a) A meta -analysis [2] (see Figure 3) of three small pilot randomized controlled trials has found antidepressive effects of statins as adjunct therapy to standard antidepressant treatment and concluded: “Our results suggest that adjunctive treatment with statins could be useful for the treatment of depressive symptoms. Additional double -blind randomized, placebo -controlled trials are necessary to settle the matter” [2]. Importantly, even though these pilot RCTs have shown antidepressive effects of statins, all of these studies suffered from small sample sizes and all of these studies were con- ducted in the same county strongly limiting the generalizability of these findings. Thus, we propose to conduct this confirmative RCT including about the same number of de- pressed patients as in all previous RCTs combined. No competing study is currentl y reg- istered at clinicaltrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization."

Importantly, C italopram and Simvastatin was the most often used SSRI/statin combination and the authors concluded: “this specific com- bination would be a good candidate for a head -to-head test against a C italopram -placebo combination in a randomized controlled trial”. We will test the recommende d combination in our study except using Escitalopram instead of Citalopram due to the lack of weight gain with Escitalopram compared to Citalopram [48]. c) A meta -analysis of prospective cohort studies [49] showed that statin users are less likely to develop MDD than non -users. One of the studies included in this meta -analysis was con- ducted by the first applicant and found odds of MDD to be decreased by 38% in statin users vs. non -users [50]. These results were recently corroborated by two large Danish nation -wide population -based studies, which found that statin users were less likely to develop depression after acute coronary syndrome [51] or after stroke compared to non -users of statins [52] d) In animal models of MDD, antidepressive effects of statins have clearly been demonstrated. These studies have additionally confirmed statin effects on several neurobiological processes and structures with relevance for MDD such as inflammatory marker s, glucocorticoids and serotonin in the hippocampus, glutamatergic N -Methyl -D-Asparte (NMDA) receptors, Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) levels, and dopamine receptors (for review of CNS ef- fects of statins see [26]). In summary, given a) the enormous public health impact of depression [53, 54] and obesity [15, 16], b) the lack of remission in about 30 % of depressed patients even after several antidepressive treatment attempts [55], c) the fact that obese MDD patients are especially prone to chronicity and non -response [19-21], d) the evidence of antidepressive effects of statins from four different sources (animal studies [26], meta -analysis of prospective cohort studies [49], meta -analysis of pilot controlled trials [2], nationwide coho rt study [47]) and e) the established safety of statins, a confirmative controlled trial of add -on statin treatment in patien ts with MDD and comorbid obesity appears urgently warranted. 5.

The MCID concept originated from studies of patient -reported outcomes, in which it represented the smallest improvement that was considered meaningful by the patient [57]. Empirically, the MCID using the MADRS has been identified as a change from baseline between 1.6 – 1.9 [58].

Birth control methods which are considered as highly effective (low failure rate less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly include: • Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal m ethods of contraception. • Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. • Female bilateral tubal ligation. • Sexual abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Note: Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar ov ulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not highly effective methods of contraception Pregnancy testing: For women of childbearing potential, a highly sensitive serum HCG test will be conducted at screening visit, baseline, week 4, week 8 and at the end -of-study . 6.2.4 Follow up of pregnancy A patient must immediately inform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study.

In case of sc reening failures further treat- ment will be offered in specialized outpatient clinics for depression and obesity. If screening fail- ures occur due to medical reasons patients will be referred to specialized out - or inpatient clinics for the treatme nt of this medical condition. 7. Plan for m edical treatment 7.1 Study design We will conduct a randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind multicenter trial with parallel - group design (Phase II) . Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to IMP or placebo based on separate randomization lists for each study site provided by the biostatistician . The randomization will be based on a permuted block procedure stratified by center. Subinvestigators and patients will be blinded to the treatment. Simvastatin is an effecti ve serum lipid-lowering drug that can decrease lipid levels . In order to ensure continued blinding , laboratory assessment will be divided into safety laboratory, laboratory (lipid assessment) and laboratory (immun ometabolism/mitochondrial function). Laboratory (lipid assessment) will be conducted only at V1 and V6 to minimize the risk for unblinding of investigators/subinvestigators by revealing the lipid profile. Particularly LDL -cholesterol is expected to be lower in the treatment group. At the same time, not assessing the lipid status of patients during the entire study participation would not represent current practice where lipid status is an important part of cardiovascular risk as- sessment. No unblinding of the subinvestigator s due to specific side effects of Simvastatin treat- ment is to be expected (see 9.5) . 7.2 Description of study medication Each patient in this study will be treated with Escitalopram - a well -established standard -antide- pressant, which is readily available becau se it is commonly used as generic drug in Germany. Adjunct placebo serves as the control condition for adjunct Simvastatin (40 mg/d fixed dose). Simvastatin and placebo will be provided by the pharmacy of the Charité and will be administered in a double -blind fashion. Patients will receive IMP or placebo at baseline (visit 1), at visit 4 and visit 5. Patients will receive 10 mg Escitalopram at baselie (visit 1) and then 20 mg Escitalopram at visit 3 , visit 4 , and visit 5 (see 7.2.4 for treatment schedule and instructions for dose adjust- ments) . Please see Figure 1 for scheme of intervention. 7.2.1 Investigational Medical product (IMP) Among the available stains, we decided to use Simvastatin (SimvaHEXAL®) in a dosage of 40 mg/d based on the following considerations: Simvastatin was used in this dose in one of three RCTs showing evidence vs. placebo as adjunct treatment to SSRI [36]; it was superior to atorvas- tatin in depressed patients with heart disease [38]; it passes the blood -brain barrier [39], and it is available as generic drug (costs for 40 mg/d Simvastatin = 0.24 Euro/day = 87.6 Euro/year). We decided against using a dose of 80 mg/d Simvastatin due to the increased risk of muscle injury"

See for further information on risk -benefit assessment 10. 7.2.2 Standard medication Escitalopram will be provided by the pharmacy of the Charité , stored and dispensed at each study site in a non -blinded fashion . Current treatment with antidepressants is an exclusion cr iterion. Study participation may be per- mitted in case of wash -out of prior antidepressants for at least 7 dr ug-free days prior to inclusion. This will be permitted only if the depression severity had not sufficiently improved under the prior antidepressant regime as shown by a MADRS score ≥ 18 at screening visit . Discontinuation of effective medication to enable study participation is prohibited. 7.2.3 Control (Placebo) IMP and placebo indistinguishable in form, color, and taste will be provided by th e pharmacy of the Charité (see 7.2.8 ) and will be administered in a double -blind fashion. In order to measure blinding, we will ask patients which treatment they believe they have been assigned at the end of study. 7.2.4 Treatment sc hedule / Dose regimen Instructions for application: IMP - Simvastatin : The majority of cholesterol synthesis appears to occur at night, presumably reflecting the effects of a fasting state. For this reason, it is typically recommended that the statins with shorter half -lives including Simvastatin be administered in the even ing or at bedtime. Pa- tients should not drink grapefruit juice during Simvastatin treatment. IMP will be administer ed orally in a fixed dosage of 40 mg once a day at bedtime . IMP can be taken with or without food , but patients are reco mmended to take it wit h a glass of water. Control - Placebo : Placebo will be administered orally once a day at bedtime . Placebo can be taken with or without food, but patients are recommended to take it with a glass of water. Standard medication - Escitalopram : Escitalopram will be administere d orally in a fixed dosage of 10 mg once a day in the morning for the first two weeks, then increased to 20 mg once a day in the morning until the end of study. Escitalopram can be taken with or without food, but patients are recommended to take it with a glass of water.

In 2017, a meta -analysis of 22 placebo -controlled trials on statin use involving nearly 130,000 participants showed that 13.3 % of subjects receiving a statin discontinued the drug compared with 13.9 % of subjects on placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 95% CI 0.93-1.06) over a mean follow -up of 4.1 years [45]. Simvastatin is the IMP that will be tested versus placebo as add -on to standard antidepressant medication with Escitalopram , which will be given open label to each patient. In the following, w e list the risks and potential adverse drug effects for both medications. Simvastatin Simvastatin is approved for several indications since decades and has in general proven to be a safe medication. The risks and adverse effects listed below are all taken from the latest version of German “Fachinformation”. The most prominent risk of statin use is myo pathy (rarely ), associated with muscle pain, muscle tenderness, muscle weakness and increases of creatin e kinase (CK). The most severe form of myopathy is rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria that occurs very rarely and is dose -dependent. The combined incidence for myopathy/rhabdomyoly- sis in 41.413 patients treated for at least 4 years was 0.03% for 20 mg/d, 0.08% for 40 mg/d, and 0.61% for 80 mg/d Simvastatin . Thus, to minimize the risk of Simvastatin , we will use it in a medium dose (40 mg/d ) and not a high dose (80 mg/d ). In addition to safety la boratory values at screening, baseline, week 4, and week 12, i t will be explicitly asked if the patient experienced unexplained muscle pain or dark urine as a sign of rhab domyolysis. Other adverse effects are listed below , taken from the latest version of German “Fachinformation” and classified as follows: Very often: (>1/10); often (> 1/100); sometimes (> 1/1000), rarely (> 1/10.000), very rarely (< 1/10.000); not known (cannot be determined on basis of available data) Very often: none Often: none Sometimes: none Rarely: Anemia, headache, dizziness, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, obstipation, stom- ach ache, flatulence, dyspepsia, diarrhea, nausea, emesis, pancreatitis, hepatitis /icterus , rash, pruritus, alopecia, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, muscle cramps, asthenia Very rarely: insomnia, memory complaints, liver failure Not known: depression, interstitial lung disease, tendinopathy, immune -mediated myopathy, erectile dysfunction Medication that is contraindicated with Simvastatin due to inhibition of CYP3A4 will not be per- mitted (Itraconazol, Ketoconazol, Posaconazol, Voriconazol, Erythromycin, Clarithromycin, Teli- thromycin, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. Nelfinavir) , Boceprevir, Telaprevir, Nefazodon, Cobi- cistat, Cicl osporin, Danazol, Gemfibrozil)."
45,page_45,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 39 of 70 Further, medication that is not recommended to use in parallel to Simvastatin in a d osage of 40 mg/d will not be permitted (Fibrates, Amiodaron, Am lodipin, Verapamil, Fluconazol, Diltiazem , fusidic acid , Niacin, Lomitapid ). Finally, patients will be noticed that they should not drink grapefruit juice during Simvastatin treat- ment due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and corresponding increases in Simvastatin plasma levels. In turn, medication that induces CYP3A4 leading to decreased Simvastatin levels will also not be permitted (Carbamazepine, Efavirenz, Nevirapin, E travirine). Patients with contraindications for Simvastatin will not be included or excluded from the study in case of later occurrence (see under inclusion criteria). Escitalopram The most prominent risk of Escitalopram is QTc -Prolongation in the ECG that can lead to ven- tricular arrhythmia (torsade des pointes). To exclude patients with QTc -prolongation an ECG will be conducted at screening . Furthermore, an additional safety ECG will be conducted at every visit. Other adverse effects are listed below , taken from the latest version of German “Fachinformation” and classified as follows: Very often: (>1/10); often (> 1/100); sometimes (> 1/1000), rarely (> 1/10.000), very rarely (< 1/10.000); not known (cannot be determined on basis of available data) Very often: headach e, nausea Often: decreased appetite, increased appetite, weight gain, anxiety, restlessness, nightmares, decreased libido, anorgasmia, insomnia, fatigue, dizziness, paresthesia, tremor, si nusitis, yawning, diarrhea, o bstipation, emesis, dry mouth, hyperhid rosis, arthralgia, myalgia, delayed ejaculation, erectile dysfunction , fever Sometimes: weight loss, bruxism, agitation, nervousness, panic attacks, confusion, disturbed taste, insomnia, syncope, mydriasis, blurred vision, tinnitus, tachycardia, epistaxis, gastroin- testinal bleeding, urticarial, alopecia, rash, pruritus, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, edema Rarely: anaphylaxis, aggression, depersonalization, hallucination, serotonin syndrome, brad- ycardia Very rarely: none Not known: thrombocytopenia, inadequate ADH -secretion, hyponatremia, anorexia, mania, suicidality, dyskinesia, seizures, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness) , QTc -prolongation in the ECG, orthostasis, hepatitis, increased liver enzymes, ecchymosis, angioedema, urinar y retention, galactorrhea, priapism Medication that is contraindicated with Escitalopram will not be permitted , which includes all irre- versible MAO -inhibitors and medication that is as sociated with QTc -prolongation [ antiarrhythmica class IA and III, antip sychotics (e.g. haloperidol ), phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, anti- biotics (e.g. moxifloxacin ), and certain antihistaminergic drugs ( e.g. astemizol, mizolastin) ]. Patients with contraindications for Escitalopram will not be included (please see u nder inclusion criteria). 7.2.6 Procedures in case of emergency In case of emergency supposedly due to application of the medication, they will be immediately discont inued. The blinding will be broken immediately, and the patient will receive immediate medical care (see 7.2.9 ). No specific antidote to Simvastatin or Escitalopram are currently known, therefore treatment is limited to symptom management. Regulatory reporting duties apply."

Sub- jects will be randomized 1:1 to Simvastatin or placebo based on sepa rate randomization lists for each study site provided by the biostatistician . The randomization w ill be based on a permuted block procedure stratified by center . We will additionally collect data on prognostic variables (e.g. chronicity of depression, number of prior treatment attempts, etc.) as recommended by EMA [64] but will not stratify for these variables because a) there are a several predictive variables and it is not feasible to stratify randomization for all of them and b) we expect that these predictive variables will not systematically differ between the two treatment groups because of randomiza- tion. The Charité pharmacy will be instructed in proper al location concealment. Based on the randomization code s, the pharmacy will centrally provide for each center sequentially numbered, tamper -proof containers, which are equal in weight and similar in appearance containing IMP or placebo . The pharmacy keeps the randomization list s unavailable to investigator s and the Spon- sor/Sponsor representative until the end of study . 7.2.8 Packaging, labelling, and b linding procedures Charité Pharmacy encapsulates and packages IMP and placebo in identical vials with a medica- tion ID. The IMP/placebo vials will be provided by the Charité pharmacy to study sites . Medication is prepared and concealed by Charité Pharmacy. Concealment will no t be broken until completion of the study , therefore double -blinding remains intact. Emergency e nvelopes for the unblinding are enclosed in the packages sent to the investigator site and are stored by the local investigator . Envelopes are only to be opened in case of emer- gency and if treatment decisions depend on knowledge of application of IMP. Patient information contains contact information to ensure possibility of unblinding after treatment if necessary. 7.2.9 Unblinding In case of an emergency the blind ing will be broken immediately, and the patient will receive immediate medical care. Premature Unblinding Premature unblinding happens at the discretion of the local investigator in case of a medical emergency, where treatment is based on the knowledge whethe r IMP has been applied. When emergency envelopes are opened prematurely, date, time, reason for opening and name of the person opening have to document in source data and CRF. After unblinding the patient has to be immediately excluded from the study. An identical copy of the emergency envelopes for the unblinding will be sent to the Sponsor representative and stored securely at the coordinating site (Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin) . This way the coordinating staff is additionally available for imme diate unblinding in case of a medical emergency, where treatment is based on the knowledge whether IMP has been applied . The same rules apply as for the premature unblinding by the local investigator. Regular Unblinding After completion of the study and da ta base closure, Charité pharmacy is requested by the Spon- sor/Sponsor representative to send the randomization list s and all participants will be unblinded. Furthermore, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is granted access to limited randomization lists of the subjects they are currently reviewing."

Receipt will be confirmed via an acknowledgement of receipt dated and signed by site study staff, which will be stored in the investigator site file (ISF). At the investigator sites, IMP /placebo must be kept separate from regular medication in a locka- ble cupboard with access only to study staff. Upon distribution/application of study medication ( IMP/placebo , and standard medication) to the patient, exact amount, date, medication ID and randomiza tion number are documented in the ISF (drug account). It is the investigator ’s obligation to assure correct documentation. The same procedure applies if medication is returned. The monitor will regularly check the drug account logs. Only after this check u nused medication (IMP/placebo) will be returned to Charité pharmacy and destroyed. Charité pharmacy documents retrieval and destruction of IMP not applied. This documentation will be filed in the TMF. 7.2.11 Treatment compliance Patients will receive study medica tion for four weeks at baseline and then at week 4, and at week 8. Standard medication will be distributed for two weeks at baseline and then at week 2, at week 4, and at week 8. Patients are instructed to bring back the medication package and compliance will be determined by count of the remaining pills and patients will be considered compliant if they report taking more than 90 % of their drug (as in previous studies with Simvastatin in central nervous system diseases [7, 65] ). 8. Concomitant medication / concomitant therapy Medication that is contraindicated with Simvastatin, and Escitalopram will not be permitt ed (see 7.2.5 ). - Use of potent CYP3A4 -inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, erythromycin, HIV protease inhibitors). - Use of potent CYP3A4 inductors (carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapin, etravirine). - Medication that is associated with QTc -prolongation [antiarrhythmica class IA and III, anti- psychotics ( e.g. haloperidol), phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, antibiotics ( e.g. mox- ifloxacin), and cer tain antihistaminergic drugs ( e.g. astemizol, mizolastin) ]. - Use of nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g. Tranylcypromine) or se- lective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (e.g. Moclobemide) or the nonselective, reversible mo noamine oxidase inhibitor Linezolid . Concomitant treatment with antidepressants other than Escitalopram will not be permitted. In case of current treatment with antidepressants at study entry a wash -out of prior antidepressants for at least 7 drug -free day s prior to inclusion may be permitted. However, d iscontinuation of effective medication to enable study participation is prohibited. Other psychotropic drugs (including antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, lithium, or St. John’s Wort ) are not permitted during the study period with the fo llowing exceptions. - In case of sleep difficulties, benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone) will be a llowed on an “as needed basis”. - In case of acute anxiety or agitation, a benzodiazepine (preferably lorazepam) may be pre- scribed not exceeding 3 mg/d (other benzodiazep ines at the equivalent dosage). - Opiates for pain relief. Any clinical exacerbation requiring a higher benzodiazepine regimen or prescription of antipsy- chotics (“rescue medicati on”) will be considered as a serious adverse event."

Patients with a ny changes in medication dose or frequency of therapy during the 14 days prior to study entry will not participate in the study (see 6.2.1 ). Concomitant use of statins will not be permitted. 9. Study procedures To ensure that the study is conducted according to the study protocol, to current laws and to guidelines, a training of all investigators/ subinvestigators will be conducted prior to initiation. The trial will be initiated by a monitor. The inves tigator will be responsible for collecting the following information: laboratory lipid as- sessment comprised of LDL, HDL and total cholesterol. Otherwise the investigator will not have any other information about evaluations and efficacy assessments and wil l not perform drug dis- pensation. The subinvestigator, independently from the investigator, will perform the following evaluations: informed consent and medical history , treatment status , inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomitant medication, physical exam, ECG interpretation, assessment of blood pressure and heart rate , adverse events recording, all efficacy assessments (see 9.5), all safety assessments (see 9.6), drug dispensation, laboratory assessment immuno -metabolism/mitochondrial function, and other procedures (see 9.7.3 ). 9.1 Recruitment / Screening procedures Based on the power calculation described in chapter 16, we aim to recruit a total of 160 patients at several study sites within Germany . The time allotted for recruitment is 39 months . All centers intended for participation are specialized tertia ry depression clinics, where large numbers of de- pressed in - and outpatients are routinely seen in both clinical care and research contexts. Pa- tients will be recruited from the depression outpatient clinics and inpatient wards from each study site. In addit ion, we will use the existing and established networks of all sites within the psychiatric community to include depressed outpatients from general practitioners and psychiatrists. All con- tacted investigators have extensive experience with screening, recrui ting, and assessing patients with MDD for clinical trials . Recruitment estimations are based on current reviews of the hospital records of patients with MDD at each of these institutions. Before initiation of the trial, recruitment capabilities will again be assessed during scheduled pre -trial visits to all sites, after which a final decision for inclusion of a given site in the trial will be made. 9.2 Informed c onsent Patients will be informed about the conduction of the trial in a personal conversation by the in- vestigator/ subinvestigator . They will receive the written patient information (“Information zur Studie”) and be given time to read it thoroughly and without haste. If further questions arise, the investigator/ subinvestigator will answer them openly a nd correctly. The patients’ consent to par- ticipate in the study will be documented by signature and dating of the consent form (“Einwil- ligungserklärung”) which will be countersigned by the investigator/ subinvestigator . 9.3 Patient identification / Generation o f pseudonym Patient related data will be recorded in study files (source data) under the participant `s real name. The information required by the protocol will be entered onto the electronic case report forms (eCRF - secuTrail ) under a pseudonym. Pseudonyms will be generated by secuTrail and will be comprised of a combination of numbered and lettered sequence without the use of initials and"

Every patient will receive a patient number / pseudonym which will be unique for this individu al patient. The investigator will compile a confidential list (patient identification log ), which relates these patient numbers to the patient’s full name. This list will only be accessible to the study staff and the monitor. The investigator must print th e patient identification log and store it with other study documents, e.g. the protocol, and any protocol amendments, in a secure place. The databank will contain only pseudonymized data. Re -identification of patients will only be possible through the conf idential list. 9.4 Visits schedule and evaluations Table 3: Overview and frequencies of trial examinations Assessments Screen- ing Base- line (Visit 1) Visit 2 Visit 3 Visit 4 Visit 5 End-of-study (Visit 6) week 0 week 1 week 2 week 4 week 8 week 12 Screening and consent Informed consent X Inclusion criteria X Exclusion criteria X X X X X X Medical history X Treatment status X M.I.N.I – DSM 5 X Urine /serum drug screening X Concomitant medication X Safety Physical exam X X ECG X X X X X X X Blood pressure & heart rate X X X X X X X Safety laboratory (incl.

During screening the following procedures will be perfo rmed:  Medical history , concomitant medication, and physical examination  M.I.N.I for DSM -5  Body weight, height (for determination of body mass index)  Blood pressure, heart rate  ECG  Laboratory (safety)  Pregnancy test (women only)  Urine /serum drug screening  Demographic s  MADRS 9.4.2 Randomization visit (Baseline) - Drug dispensation Patients will be examined for inclusion and exclusion criteria in the randomization visit. Patients fulfilling all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criterion based on information assessed at the screening visit will be randomized in the two treatment groups (IMP vs. placebo). Randomization is carried out by the biostatistician . In addition , we will further characterize the sample with regard to eating behavior by a well-validated questionnaire, the “Three -Factor -Eating -Questionnaire ” [66]. Patients will not be explicitly asked to pursuit weight loss during the study participation. We will assess the treatment status of the patient (inpa tient/day -care/outpatient).

All subinvestigators will be trained to use the MADRS according to the published structured interview guide to enhance inter -rater reliability [67]. The MADRS is a clinician rated interview to measure the severity of depression within the last seven days [56]. It consists of 10 items that can be ranked on a 7 -point scale ranging from 0 to 6. This variable is explicitly recommended by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a pri- mary outcome to determine efficacy in the treatment of depression: “Improvement should be documented as the difference between baseline and post -treatment score in signs and/or symp- toms, but should also be expressed as the proportion of responders” (page 9 of EMA guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of depression) [64]. The German version of the MADRS has been shown to be a v alid instrument with high internal consistency and high sensitivity for change [68]. All subinvestigators will be trained to use this scale and interviews will be conducted according to the specific interview guide that has been developed for the MADRS [67]. MADRS will be conducted at every visit during the study by the subinvesti- gator. 9.5.2 BDI-II The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) -II is a well -established self -report questionnaire to meas- ure depressive symptoms [69]. Patients will be asked to fill out the BDI-II at every v isit except for screening. 9.6 Evaluations / Safety assessments 9.6.1 Clinical examination Physical examination The physical examination comprises a routine medical examination including neurological and cognitive assessments. The following body systems will be examined: HEENT (head, eyes, ear, nose, and throat), urological, cardiovascular, respiratory, lymphatic, gastrointestinal, musculo- skeletal, dermatological, and venous system. The physical examination will tak e place at screen- ing and at end -of-study by the subinvestigator . Blood pressure, and heart rate (vital signs) The following vital signs will be assessed at ea ch visit by the subinvestigator :  Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure (mmHg)  Heart r ate (beats per minute [bmp]) Blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate will be measured using a semi -automatic blood pressure recording device with an appropriate cuff size. Supine blood pressure and heart rate will be measured after the patient has rest ed in a supine position for at least 5 minutes. 9.6.2 Laboratory safety Safety laboratory will be performed at screening , baseline, visit 4 , visit 5 and at the end -of-study. Components of the laboratory panels include tests for the following:"

At screening visit thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) and Carbohydrate -deficient Transferrin (CDT) will be additionally determined. Sample collection will take place at each investigator site by the subinvestigator . The sample is obtained by using a needle to draw off blood f rom veins into collection tubes and then immedi- ately transported to the local laboratory. Blood samp les will be stored until all analyses are com- pleted. Safety laboratory results will be evaluated by the subinvestigator. 9.6.3 Electrocardiogram 12-lead ECG will be obtained at every visit . After the subject has rested in a supine position for at least 5 minutes , 12-lead ECG will be performed and i nterpreted by the subinvestigator . Meas- urements that deviate substantially from previous readings will be reported . The most prominent risk of Escitalopram is QTc -Prolongation in the ECG that can lead to ventricular arr hythmia (tor- sade des pointes). To exclude patients with QTc -prolongation an ECG will be conducted at every visit. If QTc reaches or exceeds 500 ms or increased ≥ 60 ms from baseline , subject will be immediately discontinued [70]. 9.6.4 MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview (German for Germany Translation Version 7.0.2) will be performed at screening visit by the subinvestigator to assess psychiatric comorbidities and evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria [71]. 9.7 Evaluations / Other assessments 9.7.1 Patient reported outcome measures PGIC The Pat ient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) measures the patient’s subjective improve- ment [72]. Patients will be asked to fill out the PGIC at every visit except for screening and base- line. EQ-5D-3L Quality of life will be determined with the EuroQol -5 Dimensions -3 Levels Questionnaire [73]. Patients will be asked to fill out the EQ -5D-3L at baseline, week 4 and end -of-study."

Heparin blood samples (80 ml) will be immediately processed using established procedures (see [74, 75] ) for isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The protocols for sample processing are harmonized between the labs. PBMCs will be frozen at a concentra tion of 107 cells/ml at -80°C in a pre -cooled freezing container. After 24 -48 hours, cells were transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored at -196°C until analysis. Serum samples (5 ml) will be centrifuged, aliquoted, and stored at -20°C until analysis .  Mitochondrial function of monozytes and T cells  Cell-specific gene expression relevant for intracellular stress hormone signaling by qRT -PCR  Phenotyping of monozytes and T cells by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)  Serum concentrations of cytokines i ncl.

Clinical Global Impression scale – Severity of illness (CGI -S) and Clinical Global Impression scale - Improvement (CGI -I) will be used to assess patient’s ove rall severity and improvement/worsening of depression [60]. CGI -I of the current visit will be assessed compared to a CGI -I score of the last visit. CGI -S will be conducted at visit 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, whereas CGI -I will be conducted at visit 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 by the subin- vestigator. SOFAS The Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) will be used to determine social functioning [76] and will be conducted at baseline, week 4 and end -of-study by the subin- vestigator . BMI, measurement of waist circumference Body -Mass -Index will be determined by measuring weight at screening, baseline and end -of- study by study staff . Height will be measured only once at screening. Waist circumference will be measured at baseline and end -of-study by study staff. 10. Risk-benefit -assessment Both medications (Simvastatin, Escitalopram) are approved for several indications since decades and have overall been proven to be safe. All depressed patients enrolled in the trial will be con- tinuously treated with a gold standard an tidepressant ( Escitalopram ) as described by the National"
56,page_56,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 50 of 70 Disease Management Guideline (“Nationale Versorgungsleitlinie”) for the treatment of MDD. For Escitalopram a dose -response relationship has been suggested. Especially for patients with se- vere depress ion the high standard dose of 20 mg/d was shown to be superior compared to 10mg/d [1]. A fixed -dose of 10 mg/d Escitalopram for the entire study duration of 12 weeks would therefore not allow the optimal treatment for some patients. Thus, we consider this option ethi- cally not justifiable. A dose increase from 10 mg/d to 20 mg/d based on individual patient re- sponse would however interfere with comparability of the treatment group and placebo group, because a strong decrease in depressive symptoms in the treatment group compared to placebo group could potentially be masked by a higher percentage of Escitalopram dose escalation in the placebo group. Therefore, we will increase Escitalopram to 20 mg/d after gi ving a low standard dose of 10 mg/d in the first two weeks. In case of adverse reactions related to Escitalopram, we will follow the instructions for dose adjustment described in 7.2.4 Treatment schedule / Dose regimen. IMP Simvastatin is offered in an “ad d-on” design, thus there will be virtually no drug -free patients in this trial. Invasive interventions beyond ordinary sampling of peripheral venous blood will not be performed within this trial, therefore the risks associated with trial participation are mainly attributable to IMP Simvastatin that has already been shown in depressed patients to be safe and well tolerated in combination with an SSRI. [2] It has been suggested that both for the lipi d-lowering effects and for the pleiotropic effects of statins a high dose is more effective than a low dose [3-5]. Especially in studies examining effects of statins on diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis and mild cognitive disorder a high dose of Si mvastatin (60 – 80 mg/d ) has been administered [6-8]. One of the most important side effects of Simvastatin is dose -dependent risk of myopathy. The combined inci- dence for myopathy/rhabdomyolysis under Simvastatin was 0.03% for 20 mg/d, 0.08% for 40 mg/d and markedly went up to 0.61% for 80 mg/d according to latest version of German “Fachinformation” . To minimize the risk of Simvastatin and examine the pleiotropic effects of Simvastatin in depression, w e will use it in a medium dose (40 mg/d ) and not a high dose (80 mg/d ). In addition to assessing safety laboratory values including creatine kinase (CK) at screening, baseline, at week 4, week 8 and week 12, it will be explicitly asked during each visit if the patient experienced unexplained muscle pain or dark urine as a sign of rhabdomyolysis. Fur- thermore, we will not include particularly vulnerable patients (e.g. patients with renal impairment, untreated hypothyroidism or history of muscle toxicity under statins or fibrates) to our study. To exclude patients with QTc -prolongation an ECG will be conducted at screening . Furthermore, additional safety ECG s will be conducted at every visit . According to a meta -analysis of small, randomized controlled trials, a beneficial antidepressive effect of Simvastatin is to be expected [2]. Many depressed patients with comorbid obesi ty might additionally benefit from Simvastatin in terms of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease . In summary, the potential benefits of the study by far outweigh the risks associated with Escital- opram and Simvastatin . Importantly, a recent extensive literature review on parallel SSRI and statin use concluded the following: “ Escitalopram , Citalopram, and P aroxetine are almost certain to be safe with all statins” [9]. 11. Termination and subsequent treatment 11.1 Premature termination of the individual participant Patients are free to withdraw from participation in the study without specifying any reasons .

In particular the following AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medica l condition will lead to immediate discontinuation of the individual participant: o report of any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness if accompanied by malaise or fever o hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice o interstitial lung disease o QTc prolongation ≥ 5 00 ms or ≥ 60 increase from baseline visit o seizures o activation of mania/hypomania o abnormal bleeding event (e.g. ecchymoses, purpura) o serotonin syndrome o angle closure glaucoma o clinically significant worsening of depression severity operationalized as a CGI - I change score of 6 or 7 (“much worse” or “very much worse”) in two successive visits. o clinically significant laboratory abnormalities such as  elevated creatine kinase greater than 5f old upper limit of normal (ULN)  elevated GOT or GPT greater than 3fold upper limit of normal (ULN)  severe symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium [S Na] <125 mmol/L)  elevated thyroid -stimulating hormone outside of the age - and sex -spe- cific reference interva ls o acute suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10 > 4) o pregnancy In the case of premature termination, the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the appropri- ate case report form (eCRF) page and the patient must be followed for safety and efficacy until the end of the study (week 12). 11.2 Premature termination of the cli nical study According to the German Fachinformation for Simvastatin , the combined incidence for myopa- thy/rhabdomyolysis in 41.413 patients treated for at least 4 years was 0.08% for 40mg/d Simvas- tatin. Severe symptomatic hyponatremia (serum sodium [S Na] <125 mmol/L) is a rare but poten- tially fatal complication of Escitalopram. Signs and symptoms of hyponatr emia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness and can be as severe as hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. Therefore, the whole study may be discontinued at the occurrence of the treatment -related serious adverse event (SAE) “myopathy/rhabdomyolysis” as defined by the German Fachinformation for Simvas- tatin [muscle pain, tenderness or weakness with creatine kinase (CK) above ten times the upper limit of normal (ULN)] in more than 5 participants or the treatment -related SAE “severe sympto- matic hyponatremia” (serum sodium [S Na] <125 mmol/L) in more than 5 participants. In addition, an early discontinuation of the trial may be decided if new scientific data during the course of the trial changes the risk -benefit -balance significantly. If such data emerges, recruitment and treat- ment of currently treated patients will be p aused immediately. A final decision on continuation or termination of the trial will then made by the Sponsor/PI based on the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)."

In case of response or remission, Escitalopram will be continued while the study medication Simvastatin (IMP) will be discontinued in any event. In case of non -response or non -remission, Esctalopram will be definitely discontinued. The in- vestigator will ensure a gradual dose reduction of Escitalopram over at least one or two weeks because of potential symp toms associated with abrupt discontinuation of Escitalopram. Patients with non -response or non -remission will be offered at least one additional clinical appointment at the psychiatric outpatient clinic of the study center after termination of the individu al study partic- ipation for the gradual discontinuation of Escitalopram. 12. Adverse events 12.1 Definitions 12.1.1 Adverse Event ( AE) An adverse event is an untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject admin- istered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment . An AE could be diseases, signs or symptoms which occur or worsen after enrolment of the patient in the clinical trial. 12.1.2 Adverse Reactions (AR) Adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered. 12.1.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) / Serious Adverse React ion (SAR) A serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction is an untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose  results in death,  is life -threatening,  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation,  results in persisten t or significant disability or incapacity,  or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;  requires a higher benzodiazepine regimen or prescription of antipsychotics (“rescue med- ication”). 12.1.4 Exceptional rules In this clinical trial the following AEs/SAEs are excluded from the notification requirement: - Serious or unexpected events which occur after enrolment, but before treatment was initiated - Events with hospitalization planned before the inclusion to the trial (i.e. scheduled surgery) 12.1.5 Suspected Unexpec ted Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is any suspected adverse reaction related to the study treatment that is both serious and unexpected. “Unexpected” means that the nature and severity of the adverse reaction are not consistent with the information about the study medication in question set out in the reference safety information."
59,page_59,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 53 of 70 12.2 Treatment of (S)AEs All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in study drug treat- ment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stopping concomitant treat- ments, changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospitalization or any other medically required intervention. 12.3 Assessment of AEs and SAEs As far as poss ible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: - the severity grade ( assessment of intensity ) - whether it constitutes a SAE (see 12.1.3 ) - its relationship to the study drug (assessment of causality) - its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) - action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/tempo rarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this AE; hospitalization) 12.3.1 Assessment of intensity We will apply the following definitions according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) grading: Grade 1 Mild; asymptom atic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appro- priate instrumental ADL (Activities of daily living ). Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to A E. Seriousness ( severity grade) shall be determined according to the definition above. Furthermore, medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeo pardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emer- gency room, or at home for aller gic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug addiction or drug abuse. 12.3.2 Assessment of causality To assess causality between administration of the IMP and the Adverse E vent the following def- initions apply: Sure : The reaction comprehensively follows the administration of the IMP in the right timeframe or can be measured in body tissues or fluids or represents a known or expected response to the study medication or disapp ears after discontinuation or dose reduction and reoccurs after re -exposure. Probable : The reaction comprehensively follows the application of the IMP in the right timeframe or represents a known or expected respons e to the study medication or di sap- pears a fter discontinu ation or dose reduction and can not be explained by known charac- teristics of the patient ’s disease ."
60,page_60,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 54 of 70 Possible : The reaction comprehensively follows the application of the IMP in the right timeframe or represents a known or expected response to the study medication, but could easily be caused by other factors. Not related : Adequate Information supporting the assumption that there is no causality Cannot be evaluated : The causa lity can not be determined . 12.4 Documentation of AEs and SAEs All AE and SAEs will be documented, no matter if the investigator suspects a causal connection to the IMP or not. The event will be recorded in the eCRF. Out of normal range laboratory data and ECG abnormalities will be analyzed concerning their clinical relevance by the subinvestigator – and if relevant documented as an AE itself. Related signs, symptoms, and laboratory changes will be summarized to a specific disease. The docu- mentation will include the type of event, start, duration, severity, causality, and action taken. SAEs need to be documented on a separate SAE form (see 12.5.1 ). All SAEs need to be followed until they subside or stabilize. The Sponsor /Sponsor representative will carefully document all Adverse Events (AEs) reported by the investigator . 12.5 Reporting of SAEs and SUSARs 12.5.1 Reporting of SAEs / Contact for SAE reporting Every event will be documented on a record form and will immediately be sent to the given ad- dress. If at that point all required information is not available, succeeding records will be sent. In the event of death, a copy of the autopsy record should be ad ded. The investigator shall promptly (at the latest within 24 h) notify the Sponsor /Sponsor representa- tive of the occurrence of a Serious Adverse Event after becoming aware and subsequently pro- vide the Sponsor /Sponsor representative with a detailed writte n report3.

The Sponsor /Sponsor representative will report all suspicious cases of SUSARs which had been occurred in one of clinic al trials conducted by the same Sponsor with the same drug substance/IMP to the relevant Ethics Committee, the relev ant regulatory authorities and to relevant regulatory authorities of other European member states and other contracting states of the EWR ag reement, if the study is run in their territory immediately, at the latest 15 days after it becomes known. He will also inform all investigator s involved in the trial. In case of a fatal or life threatening SUSAR the Sponsor /Sponsor representative will re port all information relevant for judging the event immediately, at the latest 7 days after the event be- comes known to the relevant Ethics Committee, the rele vant regulatory authorities and to relevant regulatory authorities of other European member states and other contracting states of the EWR agreement, if the study is run in their territory as well as to all investigator s involved in the trial. After a further 8 days all further relevant information must be available. 12.5.3 Other safety issues requiring expedited reporting The Sponsor /Sponsor representative will immediately, at the latest 15 days after it becomes known report all circumstances that require a revision of the risk -benefit analy sis to the relevant Ethics Committee, the relev ant regulatory authorities and to relevant regulatory authorities of other European member states and other contracting states of the EWR agreement, if the study is run in their territory. This especially includes: - Singular cases of expected severe adverse events with an unexpected outcome. - Increased incidence of expected severe adverse events that are judged as being clinically relevant . - Events related to study procedures or development of the study medica tion, which could affect a subject ’s safety. All person -related data will always be transmitted pseudonymized . 12.6 Follow -up of adverse events Once an AE is detected, it will be followed until its resolution or stabilization , and assessment will be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study, the interventions required to treat it and the outcome. Follow -up information is sent to the same address to which the original S AE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE and giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event will be reported as a fo llow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information will describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. For a follow -up report to the authorities, the investigator may be required to collect further infor- mation for a detailed description and a final evaluation of the case, including copies of hospital reports, autopsy reports, or other relevant documents. 12.7 Data Monitoring Committee We will seek advice from independent experts in the field who have agreed to serve on the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):  Prof. Dr. Brenda Penninx (methods expert/epidemiologist), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"

The DSMB will regularly (once a year) assess safety data during the course of this study and their primary interest is the safety of study participants and integrity and validity of collected data. 13. Documentation 13.1 Source Data and Study Files The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study (see 15.1). 13.2 Case Report Forms (CRF) Investigators or their designee must enter the information required by the protocol onto the elec- tronic case repor t forms - eCRF (see 15.2). 13.3 Investigator Site File (ISF) All essential documents will be kept in the Investigator Site File , which will be stored at the study sites in accordance with ICH GCP chapter 8. 13.4 Drug accountability / F low of study medication Study medication will be provided by Charité pharmacy. Receipt of study medication will be doc- umented in each study site (date, number of medication received, charge -ID, etc.) by the inves- tigator . The individual patient will receive the medication from the subinvestigator . This will be documented in the drug account (date, charge -ID). Medication that is not used and empty med i- cation boxes will be stored until final closure of the drug account by the clinical study monitor. 14. Quality management 14.1 Control of trial progress and data quality The study sites will be monitored by a clinical study monitor to ensure the quality of the data collected. The objectives of the monitoring procedures are to ensure that the trial subject’s safety and rights as a study participant are respected, that accurate, valid and complete data are col- lected, and that the tria l is conducted in accordance with the trial protocol, the principles of GCP and local legislation. 14.1.1 Monitoring, Data Quality Assurance All investigator s agree that the monitor regularly visits the study site and assure that the monitor will receive appropri ate support in his activities at the study site. The declaration of informed conse nt includes a statement to the effect that the monitor has the right – while observing the provisions of data protection legislation – to compare the case report forms (eCRFs) with the trial"

The investigator will s ecure access for the monitor to all necessary documentation for trial -related monitoring. The aims of the monitoring visits are as follows: - To check the declarations of informed consent. - To monitor trial subject safety (occurrence and documentation/reporti ng of AEs and SAEs). - To check the completeness and accuracy of entries on the eCRF. - To validate the entries on the eCRF against those in the source documents (source data ver- ification, SDV). - To evaluate the progress of the trial. - To evaluate compliance wit h the trial protocol. - To assess whether the trial is being performed according to GCP at the study site. - To discuss with the investigator aspects of trial conduct and any deficiencies found. A monitoring visit report is prepared for each visit describing t he progress of the clinical trial and any problems (e.g. refusal to give access to documentation). The investigator s allow the monitor to have access to any or all of the study materials needed for source data verification and proper review of the study pr ogress. At all times, the Sponsor /inves- tigator s/monitors will maintain the confidentiality of the study documents. Furthermore, problems with inconsistent and incomplete data will be discussed. By signing the declaration of informed consent, the participan ts allow access to their documents. 14.1.2 Audits / I nspections Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an Independent Ethics Com- mittee (IEC) may visit the center to perform audits or inspections, including source data verifica- tion. The purpose of a Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently exam- ine all study related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were con- ducted, and data were recorded, analyzed , and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable regulatory requirements . With the signature in the protocol, the investigators confirm that auditors and health authority inspectors may have access to the study documentation and accordant medical records. Auditors and inspectors are bound by professional confidentiality and may not pass on any personal i n- formation that comes to their knowledge. In the course of audits or inspections, data in the case report forms will be compared with the data for medical records. All the documentation held by the investigators within the scope of the clinical trial, as w ell as the drug logs of the study medi- cations will be verified. 14.2 Standardisation an d validation All rating scales have previously been standardized and validated. 14.3 Reference institution s Not applicable . 15. Data entry und data management Patient related data will be recorded in study files (source data) under the participant `s real name. The information required by the protocol will be entered onto the electronic case report forms"

Every patient will receive a patient number / pseudonym which w ill be unique for this individua l patient (see 9.3). 15.1 Source Data and Study Files The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of all demographic and medical information, including laborato ry data, electrocardiograms, and all as- sessments and keep them together with the signed informed consent form in designated study files. The information in original documents and records defined as Source Data will be reviewed by the Monitor for Source Data Verification. 15.2 Data collection / Case Repo rt Form (CRF) Investigator s or their designee must enter the i nformation required by the protocol onto the elec- tronic case report forms (eCRF - secuTrial® ). Data items from the eCRF are entered into the study database. All entries to the eCRF must be made as described in the electronic case report form manual. All information on eCRF must be traceable to source documents in the study file. A clinical study monitor will review the eCRF and compare the content to the source data. In addition, the investigator or designated colleague will provide access to designa ted Sponsor rep- resentative (s) for the periodic review of source documents ( e.g. hospital and clinic records) to assure accuracy and completeness of the eCRF. 15.3 Data management Data required for the analysis will be acquired and transferred electronically to a central database at the KKS Charité by means of an electronic data capture system (EDC) - secuTrial®. The secuTrial® Software solution of interActive Systems (iAS ) is a worldwide reachable web - based system (remote data entry [RDE]). The system operates according to the principle of online data capture and is in compliance with the FDA 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH -GCP. In addition, it contains further functions to perform plausibility, consistency and range checks of the study data. The log -in in the system requires a previous authentication for access and runs by a secure data transfer -protocol (SSL) to exclude any improper manipulation of data by unauthorized parties. The system will automatically keep an audit trail of all entries and corrections to the eCRF. The secuTrial® Software solution is based on an Oracle database that does not allow direct ac- cess. All access rights of study staff will be defined according to the ir trial functions. The defined access rights will e.g. allow to read or to enter study data depending on their functions (Monitor, clinical investigator , etc.). Query management is an integrated part of this RDE system. This function allows the communi- cation between the Monitor and study staff . In case of errors or improper data, the responsible person of study staff will get queries (messages) to correct the errors or to check improper data on the eCRF. The trial data will be stored digitally on a remote server with daily backups. After end of study all data will be exported for checks of consistency and plausibility. After performing the checks, the data matrix will be transferred in pseudonymized form for the statistical evaluation."

Statistical Analysis 16.1 Hypotheses 16.1.1 Primary hypothesis Simvastatin (40 mg/d ) add -on to the standard antidepressant Escitalopram (20 mg/d ) improves depression to a greater extent over 12 weeks than add -on placebo in patients with comorbid obesity and major depression 16.1.2 Secondary hypotheses Add-on Simvastatin (40 mg/d ) to standard antidepressant Escitalopram (20 mg/d ) will improve : 1) response rates, and remission rates, 2) patients’ impression of change, clinician ’s impression of severity and change , quality of life, social functioning, self -report depression, 3) lipid values, 4) mitochondrial and cellular function of of immune cells to a greater extent over 12 weeks than adjunct placebo in patients with major depression and comorbid obesity. 16.2 Sample size estimation So far, there are three small pilot RCTs in depressed patients (sample sizes ranging from n = 48 to n = 68) that have all found statistically significant beneficial effects of add -on statins vs. place bo with large, clinically relevant effect sizes. A meta -analysis [2] of these trials has found a stand- ardized mean difference between add -on statins and add -on placebo of -0.73 (95 % confidence interval -1.04 to -0.42, p < 0.001). However, it is well -known that initial studies tend to overesti- mate the t rue effect size [78]. Therefore, we conservatively assume a standardized treatment difference (also known as Cohen’s d) of 0.5, which is supported by the findings of all pilot RCTs [36, 79, 80] . Given a standard deviation of 6 -8 points on the MADRS, as commonly observed in RCTs i n this population [81-83], a standardized effect size of 0.5 translates into a mean difference of 3-4 points, which is considered clinically relevant be cause it is about twice as large as the minimal clinically important difference of 1.6 to 1.9 points that has been reported [84]. Thus, a sample size of 64 patients per group gives a power of 80% for a comparison of the mean changes in MA DRS score from baseline to week 12 between the two treatment groups using a two -sample t-test at the usual two -sided level of 5%. As the analyses will be adjusted for baseline scores the actual power is likely to be higher; this will be confirmed in a blin ded sample size review once 50% of the patients have reached week 12 [85]. Accounting for about 20% dropout, we aim to recruit 80 patients per group (i.e. 160 patients in total). Based on sex -specific prevalence rates and recruitment in our earlier studies [86, 87] , we exp ect that about two thirds of the sample will be women. This will allow gender -specific analyses."

We assume that we need to screen N = 1125 patients aged 18 - 65 with major depression according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 and obesity (body mass index ≥ 30) for eligibility at 8 recruiting centers to randomize n = 160 participants. The sam- ple size and assumed dropout rate (20%) is conservatively based on three earlier pilot RCTs of add -on statin to SSRI treatment in depressed patients [1 -3]. 16.3 Definition of population for analysis The primary analysis population will be the intention -to-treat (ITT) population. The ITT population will include all randomized patients. We will repeat the analyses in the per -protocol sample. 16.4 Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints The primary analysis will compare MADRS changes from baseline to week 12 between the Simvastatin and placebo group by Gaussian linear models for repeated measures (so -called MMRM) with intervention, center, time (week 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12), and intervention -by-time inter- action as factors, and baseline MADRS score as covariate. The error terms are assum ed to follow a multivariate normal distribution with unstructured covariance. Least squares mean changes from baseline will be reported for both groups with 95% confidence interval (CI) as well as the difference between the least squares treatment group me ans with 95% CI and p -value testing the null hypothesis of no treatment effect. Although the model described above is robust to a certain extend to missing data, sensitivity analyses will be performed as supporting analyses including multiple imputation an d last -observation -carried -forward (LOCF). The latter will also facilitate comparison with previous trials. The analyses of all secondary endpoints and safety parameters will have an exploratory charac- ter and will therefore not be adjusted for multiple te sting. The secondary efficacy endpoints MADRS -response and MADRS -remission , and MADRS -MCID within 12 weeks will be analyzed by logistic regression models with intervention and center as factors and baseline MADRS as covariate. The treatment effects will be reported as odds ratios with 95% CI and p -values testing the null hypotheses of no treatment effect. The analyses of continuous secondary efficacy end- point as well as SOFAS, and EQ -5D-3L will follow the sam e lines as the primary outcome."
67,page_67,"EudraCT -No: 2018 -002947 -27 Protocol code: SIMCODE Version 1.2 vom 03.12.2019 Page 61 of 70 We will repeat the analy ses in the per -protocol sample. All details of the statistical analyses including definitions of the analyses populations will be spec- ified in the statistical analysis plan, which will be finalized before database lock and unblinding. All statisti cal analyses will be carried out using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or the R package. 16.5 Analysis of adverse events All adverse events (AE; any undesirable experience occurring to a participant during the trial, whether or not considered related to the study medication) reported by the subject or observed by the investigator s will be recorded at each visit. Standard pro cedures for reporting of (serious) adverse events will be used. (Serious) adverse events will be summarized as frequencies and percentages by treatment group. For recurrent events and to account for variable follow -up times event rates will be reported wit h rate ratios comparing Simvastatin with add -on placebo control and 95% confidence intervals. We will use Poisson regression models with adjustment for over dispersion (or negative binomial regression models) with offset for follow -up time and possibly a mixture component to account for zero -inflation. For events of particular interest Kaplan -Meier curves stratified by treatment group will be computed and compared by log -rank tests. 16.6 Interim analyses and endpoints for premature study termination As the analyses will be adjusted for baseline scores the actual power is likely to be higher than 80 %. To confirm this in an interim analysis, a blinded sample size review will be carried out once 50 % of the patients have reached week 12. Based on blinded estim ates of the mean square error and the dropout rate the required sample size will be recalculated and the sample size will be adjusted up to a maximum total sample size of 240 patients, if necessary. 17.

A copy of the insurance policy and the insurance terms and conditions will be handed to the participants. 18.2.6 Data Privacy and confidentiality The participants’ data will be saved in a pseudonymous form, which will neither contain initials nor full date of birth. All regulative requirements applying to data protection will be met. Re -iden- tification of a participant subject’s name is possible from the patient identification log, which is kept in a l ocked research office at the study site where access is only possible by the investigator or persons authorized by the investigator . Patients will be informed that their disea se-related data will be saved for scientific purpose ( pub- lication , etc.) using a p seudonym. Consenting p atients have got the right to be informed about the data recorded. Patients will also be informed that their pseudonymized data will be forwarded to the federal authorities (BfArM) and to the Ethics Committee responsible, in accordanc e with legal notificat ion obligation for drug safety. Patients, who disagree with this process of data trans- fer, are not allowed to participate in this study. Blood samples will be pseudonymized and sent to the local laboratories for analysis. They will be destroyed after analysis (laboratory safety , laboratory assessment lipid ) or will be stored for a maximum of 10 years ( laboratory assessment immunometabolism / mitochondrial function) . The pseudonymized data will be transferred to the study site . 18.3 Archiv ing of data / Access to records Essential documents, as listed below, must be retained by the investigator for as long as needed to comply with national and international regulations. The investigator agrees to adhere to the document retention procedures b y signing the protocol. Essential documents include: - IRB/IEC approvals for the study protocol and all amendments - All source documents and laboratory records - Patient identification log - CRF copies (paper copies or electronic copies on a CD -ROM) - Signed patient informed consent forms - Any other pertinent study document. Originals of all study -related report (incl. original data of study patient - medical records ) forms will be stored in each study site for at least 10 years after completion of the trial. A list allowing patient identification will be kept for 1 0 years . 18.4 Financing The study is funded by the Bundesministerium für Forschung und Bildung (BMBF; Federal Min- istry of Education and Research ) within the call „Klinische Studien mit besonderer Relevanz für die Patientenversorgung“"

This will allow gender -specific analyses. 20.2 Stellungnahme zur Weiterbehandlung nach Studienende After completing all the protocol treatment and visits, patients will continue with regular visits according to usual practice. In case of response or remission, Escitalopram will be continued while the study medication Simvastatin (IMP) will be discontinu ed in any event. In case of non - response or non -remission, Esctalopram will be definitely discontinued. The investigator will en- sure a gradual dose reduction of Escitalopram over at least one or two weeks because of poten- tial symptoms associated with abrup t discontinuation of Escitalopram. Patients with non -re- sponse or non -remission will be offered at least one additional clinical appointment at the psychi- atric outpatient clinic of the study center after termination of the individual study participation for the gradual discontinuation of Escitalopram. In the case of premature termination, the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the appropri- ate case report form (eCRF) page and the patient must be followed for safety and efficacy until the end of the stu dy (week 12). 20.3 Zusammenfassende Nutzen -Risiko -Abwä gung See 10.
