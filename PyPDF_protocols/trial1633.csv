As the safety tests will be performed by each local laboratory to ensure prompt patient's management, blood analysis will be done according to each local standard practice based on each available validated analytical methods.

In particular, the ufic acid analysis can be done in both spechnen (plaslna or serum) and the referente nonnal ranges are the same (Clinical Chemistry, Lawrence A. Laplan, Amadeo J.

[3], the fisk of developing TLS, or more simply the risk of developing acute renal impairment, is significantly increased in patients with higher levels of uric acid velwus those with lower levels. For every mg/dL increase in sUA, the risk of TLS raises by a factor 1.75 (p<0.0001), while the risk of renal events by a factor 2.21 (p=0.0012). This observation underlines the impolÿance of preventing/containing the uric acid increase during chemotherapy. 2) Diagnosis: Laboratory TLS (LTLS) is diagnosed if levels of 2 or more serata values of uric acid, potassium, phosphate or calcium are more or less than normal at presentation, or if they change by at least 25% from baseline (see Errore.

Reasons for the Amendment Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is usually accepted as the best overall index of kidney function. In clinical practice kidney function is evaluated by measuring the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) or Creatinine Clearance. According to the linternational guidelines published in 2012 by KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) severe renal insufficiency (grade 4) corresponds to creatinine clearance <30 mL/nfin. For adult patients this classification is considered as the most appropriate and is the same category considered for the use of Febuxostat as reported in its SmPC. For the pediatric population a more conservative approach is commonly applied, and it considers the corrected creatinine clearance with the cut off <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as the indicator of kidney damage. As requested by the Hungarian National Institute of Phammcy and Nutrition Agency, the exclusion of adult and paediatric patients with severe renal fimction will be based on the cut off of the clearance creatinine < 30 mL/min and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Therefore, the criteria relative to kidney function making the patients eligible to take part to the study as well as for treatment withdrawal because of severe renal failure will be accordingly specified along the protocol.
