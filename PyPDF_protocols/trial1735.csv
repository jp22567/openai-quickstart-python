Subjects enrolled in the study in NL , ES and SG only with Hb levels that are falling below the threshold of 10 g/dL during the study will need to be withdrawn from further study t reatment dosing . 2 Dosing at Week 6 (Visit 3) will be based on the iron need upon screening Hb and weight values and only be done in subjects for whom Hb at Week 6 (Visit 3) ≤15 g/dL . Notes: FCM =Ferric carboxymaltose; Hb =Haemoglobin; ID =Iron deficiency. The study treatment doses administered at V isits 2 and 3 are considered as the “repletion phase ” and any subsequent administrations (if ID persists ) will be considered as the “ maintenance phase”. The first dose of study treatment will be administered for all randomised subjects at Visit 2 while the subject is still hospitalised for the Index hospitalisation . It is recommended that the first dose of study treatment is administered on the same day as randomisation. To accommodate local hospital practice, the first dose of study treatment may be administered either on the same day or the day before the planned discharge day. Note that a planned overnight stay fo llowing study treatment administration does NOT fulfil the criteri a of a serious adverse event (SAE) unless there is a medical reason for doing this . The subsequent administrations of study treatment will be done as part of the outpatient clinic visits at W eek 6 ( Visit 3), and at W eeks 12 (V isit 4) and 24 (V isit 5) . Dosing at Week 6 (Visit 3) will be based on the iron need upon screening Hb and weight values to replete iron as described in Table 1 and only be done in subjects for whom Hb at Week 6 ( Visit 3) ≤15 g/dL . Maintenance dosing at Weeks 12 (Visit 4) and 24 (Visit 5) is only for subjec ts in whom ID persists and for whom Hb ≥8 g/dL* and ≤15 g/dL at those visits . ID is defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL, or 100 ng/mL ≤ serum ferritin ≤299 ng/mL if transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) <20%. The serum pregnancy test must also be negative for the respective visit for females of childbearing potential. Subjects will be requested to return to the outpatient clinic for the administration of study treatment maximally 7 days after the date when the blood sample was drawn . Study treatment will be prepared by an unblinded study personnel using black syringes and once prepared, study treatment should be administered immediately thereafter using a curtain (or similar) to maintain subject blinding . Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection of study treatment. The unblinded study personnel may be involved in performing screening activities . Following randomisation the unblinded study personnel will not be operationally involved in the study for the subject concerned other than the preparation and administration of study treatment and assessment and interpretation of post -randomisation laboratory test results . * Following section in italics is applicable for The Netherlands , Spain and Singapore"

Procedures: See Table 2 for full details of protocol required procedures and applicable visits (and timings). Screening Visit The AHF hospitalisation will be considered as the Index hospitalisation. Screening visit – performed in- hospital: • Subjects who have been hospitalised for an AHF episode will be screened to determine potential eligibility to participate in the AFFIRM -AHF trial. • The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from potentially eligible subjects before any trial -related procedure is performed. • As of the date of informed consent for each subject, the sites will document in the electronic case report form all AEs and changes/additions made to concomitant medications. SAEs will be reported as they occur but no later than 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness of the event. • A blood test will be drawn, which will be analysed locally, to determ ine if the subject is iron deficient and for whom Hb ≥8 g/dL* and ≤15 g/dL. The assays to be performed are: serum ferritin, TSAT and Hb. In addition, serum phosphorus levels analysed locally from the same blood draw will be documented in the eCRF. • During t he same blood draw, a serum pregnancy test will be taken for females of childbearing potential. Baseline Visit, Randomisation and Administration of the First Dose of Study Treatment • The baseline visit will be performed in hospital (for the Index hospitalisation) upon receipt of the screening visit blood test results. • Upon receipt and review of the screening visit blood test results, the baseline visit will be performed for subjects in whom ID is confirmed and for whom the baseline Hb ≥8 g/dL* and ≤15 g/dL. In addition, for females of childbearing potential, the serum pregnancy test must be negative. The Investigator will perform/complete the baseline procedures/assessments as shown in Table 2. • In a subset of subjects samples for determination of blood biomarkers will be retained. • Upon completion of the baseline visit procedures/assessments and after the IV drugs prescribed to treat the AHF episode have been stopped for ≥12 hours, eligible subjects will be randomised using a validated centralised procedure (IWRS) to either FCM or pl acebo. The first dose of study treatment must be administered on the same day as randomisation. To accommodate local hospital practice, the first dose of study treatment may be administered either on the same day or the day before the planned discharge day . Note that a planned overnight stay following study treatment administration does NOT fulfil the criteria of a n SAE unless there is a medical reason for doing this."

Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection of study treatment. Thereafter, the subject may be discharged from hospital, at the discretion of the Investigator. Post-randomisation Visit • Subjects will return to the outpatient clinic at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after randomisation. Note: due to the COVID -19 pandemic situation the Investigat or can perform the 52 week visit (V isit 6) via remote methods (such as phone calls, video calls , etc.) to ensure collecting at a minimum subject ’s health status , AEs and concomitant medications . • During the outpatient visits, the Investigator will perform the procedures/assessments as shown in Table 2 for the respective visit. • At Weeks 6 (Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 24 (Visit 5) and 52 (Visit 6) a blood test which will be analysed locally will be performed. The assays to be performed are: serum ferritin, TSAT and Hb. In addition, serum phosphorus levels analysed locally from the same blood draw will be documented in the eCRF. • During the same blood draw (except at Week 52 (Visit 6)), a serum pregnancy test will be taken for females of childbearing potential. • Blood test for biomarkers at Week 6 (Visit 3), Week 24 (Visit 5) and Week 52 (Visit 6) in a s ubset of subjects . • At Week 6 ( Visit 3) the repletion dose of study treatment will be administered based on the iron need as assessed at the baseline visit ( Table 1). Dosing will only be done in subjects for whom Hb at Week 6 (Visit 3) ≤15 g/dL and for whom the serum pregnancy test is negative in females of childbearing potential. • If ID persists and Hb ≥8 g/dL* and ≤15 g/dL at Week 12 (Visit 4) and Week 24 (Visit 5) and for whom the serum pregnancy test is negative in females of childbearing potential, the dose of study treatment to be administered will be determined as shown in Table 1. • Subjects for whom an administration of study treatment is necessary during an outpatient clinic visit will be requested to return to the outpatient clinic for the administration of study treatment maximally 7 days after the date when the blood sample was performed. • Study treatment will be prepared and administered by unblinded study personnel as described in the ‘Treatment’ section. • If ID persists at Week 52 (Visit 6), the Investigator will treat the ID according to local routine/standard practice. • Subjects will be contacted by telephone at Weeks 2, 4 and 36 after randomisation – see Table 2."

Study Committees and Trial Oversight A Steering Committee (SC), a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and a Clinical Endpoint Committee (CEC) will be established for this trial. The SC will ensure the scientific integrity of the trial in addition to overseeing the operational conduct. The DSMB will be constituted to oversee the safety of study participants and the CEC will adjudicate all events suggestive of the study outcomes using predefined criteria detailed in the adjudication charter. Sample Size: A total of 1,100 subjects is planned to be randomised (i.e., 550 per treatment group). Using the negative binomial statistical approach, the study would require 1,000 subjects in total (500 per study group) for a power of 80% and a 2- sided alpha of 0.05 to demonstrate a statistically significant r ate ratio of 0.75 (i.e., 25% reduction in the composite of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death, between the FCM and placebo groups) assuming a recurrent event rate of 0.7 events/year for HF hospitalisations and CV death in the placebo group. The mea n follow -up time is estimated to 11 month accounting for a death rate of 12%. Taking into account loss to follow -up, an overall sample size of 1,100 subjects (550 per treatment group) is planned. Statistical Methods: No interim analysis is planned. Analys ing Recurrent Heart Failure Hospitalisations and Cardiovascular Death The crude rate of HF hospitalisations and CV deaths per 100 patient -years of follow -up will be calculated by dividing the total number of HF hospitalisations and CV deaths by the total f ollow -up duration of all subjects in each group. The rate ratio (95% confidence interval and p -value) between treatment groups for the composite of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death will be estimated for the full analysis set (FAS) using the negat ive binomial model. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the per -protocol set. All secondary and other endpoints will be analysed on the FAS and all statistical tests will be performed at a 5% level. Concerning the safety data, the total number of events and number (%) of subjects with event will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term by treatment group. Further details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan."

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Two major clinical trials (FAIR -HF and CONFIRM -HF) have demonstrated that the treatment with intravenous (IV) ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) improves functional capacity, exercise tolerance, symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in stable iron deficient subjects with heart failure (HF) [1,2]. Additionally, in the secondary analysis of the CONFIRM -HF trial, the treatment with IV FCM was associated with a significant 60% reduction of the risk of h ospitalis ations for worsening HF during the 12 month follow -up. Moreover, the recent m eta-analysis of 5 trials with IV iron therapy in patients with stable HF (incl uding 509 subjects receiving IV iron therapy in comparison with 342 subjects receiv ing placebo) has shown that IV iron therapy can reduce the risk of the combined endpoint of all -cause death or/an d cardiovascular (CV) hospitalis ation ( odds ratio (OR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 -0.64, P < 0.0001) , and the combined endpoint of CV d eath or hospitalisation for worsening HF (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24-0.63, P=0.0001) [ 3]. Acute heart failure (AHF) constitutes a clinically and economically challenging problem. The prognosis of these patients remains poor, and so far, major clinical trials have failed to improve outcomes in these patients . The current treatment of AHF remained virtually unchanged in recent decades. iron deficiency ( ID) is frequent among patients with HF and predicts poor outcome [4]. Although, there are premises that correction of ID in AHF patients could improve clinical outcomes, it has not been investigated to date. We aim to investigate the effect of IV FCM, relative to placebo on recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death up to 52 weeks after randomis ation in iron deficient subjects hospitalised for AHF . 1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options Based on rough estimates, at least 10 million people suffer from HF in European countries [ 5]. The incidence of HF approaches 10 per 1 ,000 population after age 65, and approximately 80% of patients hospitalised with HF are more than 65 years old [ 6]. HF results in poor life expectancy, impaired QoL, repeated hospitalisations and is a considerable economic burden, accounting for 1–2% of health care expenditure in European countries [ 4]. Despite advances in its treatment, the prognosis of HF remains poor. The Euro Heart Survey showed that the in- hospital mortality of patients admitted for de novo A HF was 8.1%, and 5.8% for patients admitted for worsening HF [7]. About 50% of patients with HF will die within 4 years of the initial diagnosis, and for patients with severe chronic heart failure ( CHF ), approximately 50% will die within 1 year [ 5]. AHF has become the leading cause for hospital admissions among patients o ver 65 years, with unacceptably poor outcomes [8]. Despite initial stabilisation and symptomatic relief, sustained improvement in signs and symptoms of HF is difficult to maintain. In -hospital worsening of HF requiring intensification of therapy occurs in 15- 20% of patients and in-hospital mortality ranges from 4 -10% [ 7]. Post-discharge outcomes are even more"
29,page_29,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 30 of 108 alarming; more than half of all patients will be either readmitted to the hospital or die within the first 6 months after hospital discharge [ 9]. The prevalence of ID is high in patients with HF as described above, most importantly both in anaemic and non- anaemic subjects. Moreover, the clear beneficial effects of IV FCM supplementation have been observed in both anaemic and non- anaemic patients with HF, suggesting that optimal iron status is crucial for the proper functioning of both haematopoietic and non- haematopoietic tissues. It should be emphas ised that in spite of the critical evident role of iron for erythropoiesis, there is accumulating evidence showing that iron is needed for optimal energy metabolism of all cells [ 4]. Iron is essential for the transport and storage of oxygen, oxidative metabolism in the skeletal and heart muscle and the synthesis and degradation of lipids, carbohydrates, DNA, RNA [10,11]. I ron deficiency leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, and therefore unfavourable effects of depleted iron are seen predominantly in tissues of high energy demand, such as skeletal or heart muscles [4]. There is growing scientific literature describing the prevalence of ID in CHF, and individual manuscripts report that up to 50% of CHF patients may suffer from ID [12,13,14] . Patients with HF are also at risk of iron loss secondary to gastritis or ulceration caused by concomitant pharmacotherapy, and from proteinuria arising from chronic renal disease [15,16]. This decrease in iron intake respectively stores may lead to absolute ID . In subjects with CHF, ID has been defined as serum ferritin less than 100 ng/mL (absolute ID) or serum ferritin less than 300 ng/mL with transferrin saturation (TSAT) less than 20% (functional ID) [17]. Taking into consideration the biological role of iron, it may be hypothesised that ID is a key reason for the greatly reduced exercise capacity, fatigue an d breathlessness observed in these subjects. Anker et al. [18] suggested that therapeutic options to improve functional capacity are very limited and, as such, targeting abnormalities impeding oxygen transportation and/or utilisation may confer functional benefits. These hypotheses were confirmed in the FAIR -HF study with demonstrated improvements in symptomatic, functional and exercise capacity of subjects treated with FCM [1]. Several other smaller studies had shown similar benefits with the treatment of subjects using IV iron [ 19-22]. Beyond the improvements observed in the randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) alluded to, initial evidence (in small sample sizes) suggests that iron repletion in iron deficient subjects with anaemia may also have additional benefits and improve the left ventricular dysfunction, decrease N -termina l-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP) levels and inflammatory status, as measured by C -reactive protein [21]. The origin of ID in patients with HF remains unknown. Patients with HF (particularly during circulatory decompensation) have high circulating levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines, and the inflammation has been postulated by several experts as the key pathomechanism triggering the development of functional ID due to the increased liver production of hepcidin in patients with HF, similarly as in chronic kidney disease and"
30,page_30,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 31 of 108 other chronic inflammatory disorders [23-27]. Although theoretically anticipated, until now it has not been demonstrated that ID occurring in the course of HF is linked with inflammation. On the contrary, patients with stable systolic HF developing ID have very low circulating hepcidin (without increased interleukin 6), suggesting severely depleted iron stores [28]. Also, patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery with depleted iron stores in bone marrow demonstrate low serum levels of hepcidin [ 29]. Finally, it has been shown that 46% of patients admitted due to AHF have extremely low circulating hepcidin level (<14.5 ng/mL), and those with low hepcidin accompanied by high circulating soluble transferrin receptor have very high 12-month all- cause mortality [4]. Provided evidence suggests that patients with HF (either when in stable or decompensated conditions) have extremely low hepcidin, which suggests the presence of profound absolute ID not rel ated with inflammation. Such severe ID can be effectively supplemented only intravenously [ 3,5]. 1.2 Summary of Nonclinical and Clinical Data Geisser et al . [30] h ave characterised FCM as a robust and strong type iron complex (Type I) with a molecular mass of about 150,000 Da ltons . The solution is a dark brown colour with a near neutral pH and a physiological osmolarity. As the product does not contain dextran it has been demonstrated to not cross react with dextran antibodies hence avoiding dextran- induced anaphylactic reactions. After IV administration, FCM is mainly found in the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, in the spleen and in the bone marrow. Since the iron is predominantly deposited in the reticuloendothelial system, and not in the parenchyma, iron induced radical forming lipid peroxidation, which takes place in the parenchyma only, is not triggered by FCM. R esults from nonclinical histotoxicological investigations confirm that FCM does not cause any necroses in the liver, and no changes of toxicological importance were detected in kidney, adrenal, lung and spleen tissue following FCM administration. Except for the spleen, only a small amount of iron is found in the organs, which is due to high iron complex stability. A clinical pharmacokinetics study [31,32] using positron emission tomography demonstrated a fast initial elimination of radioactively labelled iron 52Fe/59Fe FCM from the blood, along with rapid transfer to the bone marrow and rapid deposition in the liver and spleen. At 8 hours after administration, 5- 20% of the injected amount was still in the blood. The projected calculated half -life of terminal elimination was about 16 hours, in comparison to 3 to 4 days for iron dextran and 6 hours for iron sucrose. A further Phase 2 study in subjects with ID anaemia demonstrated a monoexponential elimination pattern with a half -life of terminal elimination in the range 10 to 18 hours. There was negligible renal elimination. In this and another registration study, total serum iron returned to the normal range within 3 and 7 days allowing for a weekly dosing schedule. In general, clinical safety and efficacy studies have b een conducted in numerous settings that are representative of underlying diseases that may lead to ID i.e., diseases with increased inflammatory status that impairs iron absorption as well as diseases with large losses of iron that cannot be compensated vi a dietary iron ."
31,page_31,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 32 of 108 Since the developmental international birth date, more than 7,000 subjects are known to have been exposed to FCM with at least one dose in more than 35 completed prospective, interventional clinical studies . Across various clinical studies, replenishment of iron stores has been consistently observed. Markers of ID have included both TSAT and serum ferritin. In subjects with more severe or prolonged ID that has led to anaemia, correction of ID using FCM has consistently resulted in medically significant increases in haemoglobin (Hb) values (correction of anaemia). This improvement was usually seen within 2 weeks. In addition to the correction of laboratory parameters, iron replacement therapy has demonstrated significant improvements in subject QoL and functional status. Ferric carboxymaltose was well tolerated by study participants. In the completed clinical studies, up until the 1 January 2015, approximately 50% of the subjects experienced at least 1 treatment- emergent adverse event (AE), and events considered related to treatment occurred in just over 17% of subjects who received FCM. T he most commonly reported adverse drug reactions (ADR s) in the FCM group were nausea, injection/infusion site reactions, hypophosphataemia, headache, flushing, dizziness, and hypertension. In relation to laboratory parameters recorded in clinical studies, no consistent pattern of clinically meaningful changes requiring intervention have been observed. However, mild and transient changes of liver enzymes, such as aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, gamma -glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase, have been reported in some studies. A transient decrease in blood phosphorus levels was frequently observed. The nadir occurred approximately 2 weeks after dosing and resolved without treatment in most subjects within the follow -up period of up to 12 weeks. Severe hypophosphataemia (i.e., <0.3 mmol/L) was observed in very few cases, and was of short duration. No formal interaction studies have been performed. Except for the reduced uptake of oral iron administered in parallel with parenteral iron, no interactions with other medications are known. The first marketing authoris ation for FCM was received in July 2007, and as of 1 January 2015, FCM has received marketing author isation in a total of 63 countries worldwide. The total exposure of patients since the introduction of FCM into the market up to December 2014 corresponded to more than 2,000,000 patient -years. The total number of spontaneous and s olicited adverse drug experience cases reported is considered small with respect to the overall drug exposure. Post -marketing reports up to December 2014 confirm the known AE profile and the positive benefit/risk ratio of FCM. Please see the Investigator’s Brochure for further details."

RATIONALE Currently there are 8 studies of varying sizes performed using IV iron in stable HF subjects , and 2 of these studies using IV FCM conducted as placebo -controlled, double-blinded studies [ 1,2]. These two RCTs have provided evidence, that relative to placebo, the correction of ID with IV FCM improves clinical functional capacity, symptoms, clinical findings related to HF and QoL. In addition, IV FCM was well tolerated . To date, no data exists concerning the impact of IV FCM on recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death in a HF population with ID who have recently stabilised after an AHF episode. The intervention is planned in subjects with diagnosed ID at the time of randomisation and left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) <50% demonst rated at any time within 12 months prior to randomisation. In this trial, it is planned to administer the first IV dose of FCM/placebo just prior to discharge for the AHF episode. Subjects will be followed for 52 weeks and study treatment will be administered at Week 6 based on the iron need as assessed at the baseline visit , and at Weeks 12 and 24 if ID persists at these time points. Recent observational data from Jankowska et al . [33] in subjects with systolic CHF, suggested that ID constitutes a strong independent predictor of unfavourable outcome proposing that iron supplementation may be considered as a therapeutic approach in CHF subjects to improve outcome. In this observational study , a distinct difference in survival curves in favour of non- iron deficient subjects was observed within the first 6- 12 months . After 12 months the difference between iron deficient and non-iron deficient subjects remained stable. Study D esign Rationale This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo- controlled trial. The 52 week s observation period following randomisation is considered appropriate to investigate the primary endpoint of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death. To evaluate the effect of IV FCM in iron deficient subjects with AHF, subjects will be enrolled during a hospital stay (Index hospitalisation) after the acute care treatment of the index event has been stabilise d. All subjects will continue to receive their established standard therapy for HF and medical emergencies will be treated according to local routine. Placebo -treatment will be used for blinding reasons of IV FCM treatment, and as such does not bear any additional risk to the subject . Given that there is no proven effective intervention for the condition under investigation in the AFFIRM -AHF trial, the use of a placebo arm is considered ethically justified. For this trial, the same treatment algorithm was selected to be used as that implemented in an RCT with IV FCM in stable CHF subjects [2]. First treatment will be a dministered in the hospital prior to discharge. Over the 52 weeks following randomis ation, the collected endpoints will focus on important events for this subject population ( hospitalisations, mortality and QoL ) that directly impacts the subjects and the health care system."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Overall Study Design The AFFIRM -AHF trial is multicentre, randomised, double -blind, prospective, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, trial with a fixed follow -up of 52 weeks after randomisation per subject. The Schedule of Events is shown in Table 2 and Figure 1. 4.1.1 Screening Visit The AHF hospitalisation will be considered as the Index hospitalisation. The s creening visit will be performed in -hospital. The screening visit process can be summarised as follows: • Subjects who have been hospitalised for an AHF episode will be screened to determine potential eligibility to participate in the A FFIRM -AHF trial. • The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from potentially eligible subjects before any trial -related procedure is performed. • As of the date of informed consent for each subject, the sites will document in the electronic case r eport form (eCRF ) all AEs and changes/additions made to concomitant medications. S AEs will be reported as they occur but no later than 24 hours after the Investigator’s awareness of the event. • In potentially eligible subjects, a blood test will be drawn , which will be analysed locally, to determine if the subject is iron deficient and if the Hb ≥ 8 g/dL * and ≤15 g/dL. Iron deficiency is defined as serum ferritin <100 ng/mL, or 100 ng/mL ≤ serum ferritin ≤ 299 ng/mL if TSAT <20%. The assays to be performed are: serum ferritin, TSAT and Hb . In addition, serum phosphorus levels analysed locally from the same blood draw will be documented in the eCRF. • During the same blood draw, a serum pregnancy test will be taken for females of childbearing potential. *Following section in i talics is applicable for T he Netherlands , Spain and Singapore only (NL, ES and SG only): The lower threshold of Hb values is set to 10 g/dL."
36,page_36,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 37 of 108 4.1.2 Baseline Visit, Randomisation and Administration of the First Dose of Study Treatment The baseline visit process/procedures can be summarised as follows: • Upon receipt of the screening visit blood test results, the baseline visit will be performed for subjects in whom ID is confirmed and for whom the baseline Hb ≥8 g/dL* and ≤15 g/dL. In addition, for females of childbearing potential, the serum pregnancy test must be negative. The Investigator will perform/complete the baseline procedures/assessments as shown in Table 2. *Following section in italics is applicable for T he Netherlands , Spain and Singapore only ( NL, ES and SG only): The lower threshold of Hb values is set to 10 g/dL. • In a subset of subjects samples for determination of blood biomarkers will be retained. • Upon completion of the baseline visit procedures/assessments and after the IV drugs prescribed to treat the AHF episode have been stopped for ≥ 12 hours , eligible subjects will be randomised us ing a validated centralised procedure ( interactive web-based randomisation s ystem (IWRS )) to either FCM or placebo. S tudy treatment must be administered on the same day as randomisation. To accommodate local hospital practice, the first dose of study treatment may be administered either on the same day or the day before the planned discharge day. Note that a planned overnight stay following study treatment administration does NOT fulfil the criteria of a n SAE unless there is a medical reason for doing this. • Study treatment will be prepared and administered by unblinded study personnel who will otherwise not be involved in any study assessments for the subject concerned other than assessment and interpretation of post-randomisation laboratory test results. • The dose of study treatment to be administered will be done following the instructions in Table 1. Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection of study treatment. Thereafter, the subject may be discharged from hospital, at the discretion of the Investigator. 4.1.3 Post-Randomisation Visits The post- randomisation subject contacts can be summarised as follows: • Subjects will return to the outpatient clinic at 6, 12, 24 and 52 weeks after randomisation. Note: due to the COVID -19 pandemic situation the Investigator can perform the 52 week visit (Visit 6) via remote methods (such as phone calls, video calls , etc.) to ensure collecting at a minimum subject’s health status, AEs and concomitant medications."
37,page_37,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 38 of 108 • During the outpatient visits, the Investigator will perform the procedures/assessments as shown in Table 2 for each respective visit . • At Weeks 6 ( Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 24 ( Visit 5) and 52 (V isit 6) a blood test, which will be analysed locally, will be drawn . The assays to be performed are: serum ferritin, TSAT and Hb . If ID persists and Hb ≥8* g/dL and ≤1 5 g/dL at Weeks 12 (Visit 4) and 24 (Visit 5), the dose of study treatment to be administered will be determined as shown in Table 1. In addition, serum phosphorus levels analysed locally from the same blood draw will be documented in the eCRF. *Following section in italics is applicable for The Netherlands , Spain and Singapore only ( NL, ES and SG only): The lower threshold of Hb values is set to 10 g/dL. • During the same blood draw (except at Week 52 (Visit 6)) , a serum pregnancy test will be taken for females of childbearing potential. • At Week 6 ( Visit 3) the repletion dose of study treatment will be administered based on the iron need as assessed at the baseline visit ( Table 1) and only in subjects for whom Hb at Week 6 (Visit 3) ≤15 g/dL. For females of childbearing potential, the serum pregnancy test must be negative. • Subjects for whom an administration of study treatment is necessary during an outpatient clinic visit, will be requested to return to the outpatient clinic for the administration of study treatment maximally 7 days after the date when the blood sample was performed for the respective outpatient clinic visit. For females of childbearing potential, the serum pregnancy test must be negative. • In a subset of subjects samples for determination of blood biomarkers will be retained at Weeks 6 (Visit 3), 24 (Visit 5) and 52 (Visit 6). • Study treatment will be prepared and administered by unblinded study personnel who will otherwise not be involved in any study assessments for the subject concerned other than assessment and interpretation of post- randomisation laboratory test results . • The dose of study treatment to be administered will be determined following the instructions in Table 1. Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection of study treatment. Thereafter, the subject may leave the outpatient clinic at the discretion of the Investigator."
38,page_38,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 39 of 108 • The site will contact the subject by telephone at Week 2 (Tel ephone C all 1), Week 4 (Telephone C all 2), and Week 36 (Tel ephone C all 3), after randomisation to enquire about the subject’s health status and enquire if the subjects experienced a deterioration of their condition or if they were hospitalised since the last visit contact and /or if there were changes made to their concomitant treatments. The latter will be reported in the eCRF. The subjects will be requested to complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( KCCQ )-12 questionnaire at home on the same day as the Week 2, Week 4 and Week 36 telephone call. The subjects will be instructed to return the comp leted questionnaires at the following out -patient clinic Visit. Adverse events will also be reported in the eCRF. If the subject reports a hospitalisation, the Investigator must report the SAE as per the protocol requirements (see Section 10). • If ID persists at Week 52 (Visit 6), the Investigator will treat the ID according to local routine/standard practice. The FCM and placebo solutions differ in appearance. Hence, unblinded study personnel not otherwise involved in any study assessments ( other than assessment and interpretation of post -randomisation laboratory test results ) will be responsible for preparing and administering the study treatment injections in black syringes and using a curtain (or similar) to maintain subject blinding. The u nblinded study personnel will ensure that the subject is not able to observe the preparation and administration of the st udy treatment injections. The unblinded physician will review the laboratory test results at the respective follow -up visits to determine if ID persists and hence the need to administer study treatment (or not). 4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study The duration of subject participation is 52 weeks (i.e., 12 months) as of randomisation. The end of study is defined as the Last Subject Last Visit."

The subject concerned will remain under follow -up and the subsequent visits should be performed in accordance with the protocol schedule. Whether the subject should receive additional doses of study treatment will be discussed with the Medical Monitor and will be decided on a case by case basis. If study drug is stopped prematurely for any one subject, the subject concerned will not be replaced. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study drug if in the opinion of the Medical Monitor or the Investigator there would be a risk to the subject’s safety if they received any further dose of study drug. Following section in i talics is applicable for T he Netherlands , Spain and Singapore only (NL, ES and SG only): Subjects enrolled in the study with Hb levels that are falling below the threshold of 10 g/dL during the study will need to be withdrawn from further study treatment dosing."
43,page_43,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 44 of 108 If study treatment is stopped prematurely for a subject , follow -up for the subject concerned should continue in accordance with the protocol schedule. The discontinuation of study treatment is mandatory in circumstances that therapies or treatments listed in Section 7.7.2 as restricted need to be applied to the subjects for general health reasons. Discontinuation of study treatment is also mandatory in the case a subject enrolled into the study is getting preg nant (see Section 10.3.3 for reporting instructions). The reason for study -drug discontinuation and the date must be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. The follow -up of these subjects should continue in accordance with the protocol schedule. 5.4.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from Follow-up Subjects may voluntarily withdraw their participation from the trial at any time without having to provide a reason or a subject may be withdrawn from follow -up at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s best interest. The reason(s), including the primary reason for withdrawal from follow -up, if provided by the subject, will be recorded in the eCR F. Although a subject is not obliged to give her/his reason(s) for discontinuing trial participation prematurely, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights. If the subject does not wish to provide a reason, the source documents and the e CRF should document the reason for discontinuation as “withdrawal by subject ”. Whenever possible, the Investigator should request the subject to return for a clinic assessment at the time of or soon after discontinuation from follow -up. T he Investigator is required to make every effort possible to follow the subjec t concerned for survival and hospitalisation after discontinuation of follow -up on the condition that the subject has not withdrawn consent to do so. If subjects refuse to return to the outpatient clinic for the scheduled visits, all reasonable efforts should be made to contact the subject by telephone at the time point of the scheduled visits. In such situations and unless the subject withdraws informed consent for further participation in the trial, all randomised subjects who withdraw from follow -up visits prematurely will continue to be followed for the occurrence events suggestive of the study outcomes. It is vital to obtain follow -up data on any subject withdrawn because of an AE. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake protocol -specified safety follow -up procedures. If a subject is discontinued due to an AE, the event should be followed by the Investigator through contac t with the subject until resolution or stabilisation has occurred. All AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilisation or the subject is lost to follow-up and cannot be contacted. Reasons for discontinuations will be documented in the e CRFs. Subjects who discontinue prematurely will not be replaced."

If a randomised subject withdraws consent for further follow -up, the subject concerned cannot be rescreened. However, a subject who fails to meet the protocol selection criteria and who was not randomised during the initial Index hospitalisation may be reconsidered for participation during any subsequent hospitalisation for AHF. 5.5.1 Subject R escreening During the Sam e Index Hospitalisation If during the initial Index hospitalisation, the blood test results and/or ejection fraction measurement are outside the criteria defined in the study protocol, the diagnostic tests may be repeated once during the same Index hospitalisation. If the second blood test results and/or second ejection fraction measurement are still outside the limits set by the study protocol, the subject will not be eligible to participate. 5.5.2 Subject R escreening Subjects determined as being ineligible duri ng the initial Index hospitalisation may be rescreened for participation at a subsequent hospitalisation(s) for worsening HF. Th e subject (s) concerned will be considered as a de- novo screening and the subsequent hospitalisation for worsening HF will be considered as the Index hospitalisation.

RANDOMISATION , BLINDING AND UNBLINDING PROCEDURES 6.1 Randomisation All subjects enrolled must be identifiable throughout the study. The Investigator will maintain a list of subject numbers and subject names to enable records to be found at a later date. Numbered study treatment packs will contain either FCM solution or placebo (i.e., normal saline) according to a computer generated randomisation plan. Each eligible subject will be randomised to either FCM or placebo using a validated centralised procedure ( IWRS ) that automates the random assignment of treatment groups to randomisation numbers . Subject randomi sation (1:1) will be determined by a minimisa tion algorithm including a random variable and accounting for the fol lowing stratification factors: sex , age ( <70 years/ ≥70 years ), HF a etiology ( ischemic/ non-ischemic ), HF duration (newly diagnosed at Index hospitalisation /known documented HF prior to Index hospitalisation ), country and centre. The system will allocate study treatment pack number (s) which should be used for the subject concerned. Details on how to randomis e a subject will be found in the respective user manual. The randomisation plan will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authori sed persons, until the time of unblinding. If a subject discontinues from the study, neither the subject identification number nor the allocated study treatment pack numbers will be reused, and the subject will not be allowed to be re -randomised in the study . 6.2 Blinding This is a double -blind trial with randomisation concealment and neither the Investigator, the subject nor Sponsor (or representative) will be aware of the administered study treatment to each subject. The Vifor Pharma Safety Department will have access to the randomisation codes as will investigational sites should the need to unblind a subject arise. As the FCM and placebo solutions differ in appearance and the study treatment boxes w ill not be blinded, unblinded study personnel not involved in any study assessments ( other than assessment and interpretation of post -randomisation laboratory test results) will be responsible for handling the study treatment boxes, and preparing and admin istering the study treatment injections in black syringes and using a curtain (or similar) to maintain subject blinding. Unblinded personnel will make sure the subject is not able to observe the preparation of study treatment injections. Post- baseline iron values should be seen only by the unblinded study physician, who will then be responsible for evaluating the parameters. This physician must review the parameters to confirm the subject well-being and follow guidance per Section 10.2.6."
46,page_46,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 47 of 108 6.3 Unblinding In an emergency situation where knowledge of a subject ’s study treatment allocation must be present in order to determine the further medical management of the subject concerned, or if knowledge of a subject’s treatment allocation is required for safety regulatory reporting purposes, the blinded Investigator or the S ponsor pharmacovigilance officer, respectively (as appropriate) will have access to the study treatment code for the subject concerned via the secure, web -based trial -specific treatment allocation system. Instructions for access (which is password protected) and use may be found in the respective user m anual. All information (i.e. , the name of the person who has accessed the treatment code, the reason, date and time and subject for whom the code was accessed) concerning study treatment code access will be tracked and stored in the web -based system. If a study treatment code is broken, the subject concerned must discontinue study treatment. Further medical management is at the discretion of the Investigator .

48,page_48,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 49 of 108 7.2.2 Dosing and Administration Guidelines The dose of study treatment to be administered will be determined using the subject’s body weight and Hb values based on a repletion and maintenance dosing scheme . Subjects will be administered study treatment as an undiluted bolus IV injection - a 10-mL vial of FCM contains 500 mg iron. The individual dose requirements (in mL) per visit are detailed in Table 1. The doses of study treatment administered at V isits 2 and 3 are considered the repletion phase and any subsequent administrations (if ID persist s) will be considered the maintenance phase. A ll administrations, including duration of injection, will be documented in the site source data and in the e CRF. Each administration of study treatment will be documented in the treatment accountability log kept by the unblinded person on site. The IV bolus injection will be done using a black syringe. A curtain (or similar) will be used in addition to ensure that blinding of the subject is maintained. Injections will have a volume of 20 mL (1,000 mg iron or normal saline) or 10 mL (500 mg iron or normal saline) depending on the subject’s Hb value and body weight. In case a site has local regulations that prevent the use of a black syringe then the investigational site need s to provide an alternative acceptable procedure that will maintain the blind, whilst satisfying their local procedures. This alternative procedure must receive approval by the Sponsor on a site- by-site basis. The following describes the procedure for the preparation and administration of study treatment. 7.2.2.1 Preparation of S tudy T reatment Study treatment must be prepared by an unblinded member of the site study team using black syringes. The volume of study treatment to administrate must follow the instructions in Table 1. When preparing the FCM solution, the vials should be visually inspected for sediment and damage before use and only those containing sedim ent-free, homogeneous solution should be used. Once prepared, study treatment should be administered immediately thereafter. 7.2.2.2 Administration of Ferric Carboxymaltose and P lacebo Study treatment should only be administered when staff trained to evaluate and manage anaphylactic reactions is immediately available, in an environment where full resuscitation facilities can be assured. Unblinded study personnel will administer study treatment. He/she should apply tourniquet, identify a suitable vein, disinfect the injection site and perform the venous puncture. It is recommended to use a blue catheter 22 G or pink catheter 20 G and secure it with duct tape. The use of blue butterfly needle is possible but a curtain (or similar) must be used to maintain blinding of the subject during the administration of study treatment ."
49,page_49,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 50 of 108 After the venous puncture is performed , the correct positioning of the needle (within the vein) can be checked by flushing with 10 mL NaCl 0.9%. Thereafter, the study personnel should then connect the syringe containing the study treatment to the needle and slowly inject the study treatment over at least 5 minutes for the 500 mg dose and over at least 15 minutes for the 1,000 mg dose). After administration, the vein should then be flushed with 5- 10 mL saline. Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection. Since FCM has a physiological pH, pain at the injection site is unlikely, therefore caution should be exercised to avoid paravenous injections. The choice of an appropriate needle (i.e., a blue catheter 22 G or pink catheter 20 G) for the IV access should minimise the potential risk of a paravenous injection of FCM or placebo. The administration of study treatment should be di scontinued immediately if swelling (paravenous injection) is observed at or around the injection site which can cause irritation and a brown discolouration of the skin which can be long -lasting. Please refer to Section 7.6 for more details. No rinsing or pressure bandage should be used, in order to prevent distribution and extension of extravasations. 7.3 Package and Labelling Study drug will be supplied to each si te already packaged and labelled. The packaging and labelling of study treatment will be performed according to GMP and GCP (Good Clinical Practice). In addition, the content of the labels to be affixed on the study treatment packs will be in accordance wi th local regulations for clinical trials. Each study treatment pack and its content will be identified by a treatment number. Once allocated to a subjec t, the content from a specific study treatment pack should not be used for another subject . 7.4 Study Treat ment Allocation Each eligible subject will be randomised to either FCM or placebo using a secure validated centralised ( IWRS ) system. The system will allocate a study treatment pack number which should be used for the subject concerned. Details how to randomise a subject will be found in the respective user manual. Numbered study treatment packs will contain either FCM solution or placebo (normal saline) according to a compute r generated randomisation plan. 7.5 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability 7.5.1 Site Supply Once a site has been approved to receive study treatment, the site will be supplied with an initial stock of study treatment. The need for treatment resupply will be assessed on a regular basis taking into account the number of subjects enrolled, and the number of subjects in screening at the site."
50,page_50,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 51 of 108 7.5.2 Storage Study treatment must be stored in a locked and temperature controlled area. Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log should be updated by site personnel daily. This log must be available for review by the Monitor during on- site monitoring visits . 7.5.3 Accountability The unblinded study personnel at each site is responsible for study treatment supplies. The study personnel will ensure that adequate records of the receipt, preparation, administration and return of the study treatment are kept and that the study treatment is used only for subjects enrolled in the study. All data regarding the study treatment (including kit and batch numbers) must be recorded in the e CRF and on any other relevant forms provided. Each study site will maintain a treatment inventory/dispensing record for all treatment s dispensed and returned. At the end of the study, 1 copy of the treatment inventory/dispensing record should be sent to the Sponsor for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files. After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all unused materials will be returned to the Sponsor. The decision to destroy study treatment at site must be made by the Sponsor. If the study treatment is destroyed at site, the Investigator will forward the certificate of destruction to the Sponsor. 7.6 Study Treatment Dose Modification If extravasation is noted during administration of study treatment, the administration should be ceased immediately. Study treatment administration may be completed using a different injection site to complete the required dosage. 7.6.1 Procedures for Overdose If an inadvertent overdosing of a subject (e.g., by a calculation error of the required iron dose) is detected, this will be reported as a special situation. If associated with any signs/symptoms, this will be reported as an AE (see Section 10). Post- baseline iron parameters will be assessed by the unblinded Investigator at each visit using the local laboratory. In the case of iron accumulation the Investigator at the site will initiate corrective measures according to local guidelines for treatment of iron overload . 7.7 Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment All medica tions and treatments prescribed for a subject at the time of or during screening, and all additional medications or dose changes made during follow -up, are considered to be concomitant treatments. In addition, all treatments prescribed up to at least 3 months"

This includes the treatments prescribed to treat the AHF episode during the Index hospitalisation . 7.7.1 Basic Regimen In this trial, study treatment (i.e. , FCM or placebo) is given in addition to the basic HF treatment regimen . Anti -coagulants and/or platelet aggregation inhibiting drugs may be used according to local routine . No trial- specific dietary requirements are mandated by the protoc ol and other medications to treat concurrent diseases can be prescribed as required provided that the restrictions given in Section 7.7.2 are adhered to . As of randomisation, the aim should be to keep the prescribed basic regimen for HF as stable as the subject’s clinical presentation permits over the 52- week follow -up period. However, if symptoms or signs develop which suggest a worsening of HF , the management and treatment of subjects is at the discretion of the Investigator. Any other clinically relevant diagnosis or finding(s) which develops or worsens during the subject ’s participation in the trial may be treated as indicated, provided that the restrictions given in Section 7.7.2 are observed. Any new clinically relevant symptom, diagnosis or finding must be reported as an event on the appropriate SAE or AE report form (see Section 10). 7.7.2 Concomitant Treatment Restrictions The following therapies or treatments must not be given, or must not be performed, concurrently with study treatment (if needed, subject has to be withdrawn from study treatment) : • Immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy • Erythropoietin • Oral or IV iron therapy (other than study medication) . Note: Ongoing use of multivitamins containing iron <75 mg/day are permitted. • Blood transfusion • Surgery that may result in significant blood loss (>100 mL or >1 g/dL Hb) • Renal dialysis • Heart transplant 7.7.3 Treatment in the Case of an E mergency The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that appropriate processes, procedures and expertise are in place to cope with medical emergencies that occur during the trial."
52,page_52,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 53 of 108 Medical emergencies should be treated accordi ng to local routine. Continuation of the study treatment is at the discretion of the Investigator beside in cases of an emergency that involves any kind of hypersensitivity reaction related to the study drug during administration. The latter case will be d iscussed with the Medical Monitor and a case by case decision will be made, whether the subject should receive additional doses of study treatment ( Section 5.4.1). The guidelines and restrictions given in Section 7.7.2 must be adhered to as long as the subject is still on study treatment. An emergency situation constitutes an immediately reportable SAE (see Section 10)."

RISKS/PRECAUTIONS 8.1 IV Iron Risks Parenterally administered iron preparations can cause hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid reactions, which may be fatal. Therefore, facilities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be available. If allergic reactions or signs of intolerance occur during administration, the treatment must be stopped immediately. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported after previously uneventful doses of any parenteral iron complexes, including FCM . Each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following administration of the study treatment. In subjects with liver dysfunction, parenteral iron should only be administered after careful benefit/risk assessment. Parenteral iron administration should be avoided in subjects with hepatic dysfunction where iron overload is a precipitating factor, in particular porphyria cutanea tarda. Careful monitoring of iron status is recommended t o avoid iron overload. Parenteral iron must be used with caution in cases of acute or chronic infection, asthma, eczema or atopic allergies. It is recommended that the administration of FCM be stopped in subjects with ongoing bacteraemia. In subjects with chronic infection, a benefit/risk evaluation has to be performed, taking into account the suppression of erythropoiesis (due to chronic infection). Paravenous leakage must be avoided because leakage of FCM solution at the injection site may lead to irritation of the skin and potentially long- lasting, brown discolouration at the site of injection. In the event of paravenous leakage, administration of FCM must be stopped immediately. Study treatment administration may be completed using a different injection site to complete the required dosage. 8.2 Ferric Carboxymaltose One mL of undiluted FCM solution contains up to 5.5 mg (0.24 mmol) of sodium. This has to be taken into account in subjects on a sodium-controlled diet. To date, over 7,300 subjects have received FCM in completed clinical studies. The most commonly reported ADRs that have occurred in between 1% and 10% of subjects were headache, dizziness, hypertension, nausea, injection site reactions, flushing and hypophosphataemia. No reported ADRs were very com mon (≥10%). Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for full list and description of risks and precautions. 8.3 Sodium Chloride (NaCl 0.9%) One mL of NaCl 0.9% solution contains 9 mg (0.39 mmol) of sodium. This has to be taken into account in subjects on a sodium-controlled diet."

The KCCQ -12 is a self -administered, disease- specific instrument for measuring HRQoL in subjects with HF regardless of aetiology. It is a 12- item questionnaire that quantifies physical function, symptoms (frequency, severity and recent change), social function, self-efficacy and knowledge, and QoL [35]. Validated official translations in the local language versions will be used. The subject should complete the paper -based KCCQ -12 before any other assessment or procedure for the visit conce rned is performed. The subject should complete the questionnaires in a quiet environment. Source data verification will be performed for paper -based questionnaires . Once completed by the subjects, data will be entered into the eCRF by site staff. The manual of operations will detail how the data flow will be handled. EQ-5D – European Quality of L ife – 5 D imensions The EQ -5D questionnaire is a brief, utility -based generic HRQoL instrument. It consists of a health descriptive system and a visual analogue scale ( VAS) for respondents to self-classify and rate their health status on the day of administration of the instrument. [ 36] The descriptive system has 5 items/dimensions (i.e. mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression). The VAS is a vertical, graduated (0 -100 points) 20 cm “the rmometer ”, with 100 at the top representing “ best imaginable health state ” and 0 at the bottom representing “ worst imaginable health state ”. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a 20 cm vertical, VAS with endpoints labelled “ the best healt h you can imagine ” and “ the worst health you can imagine ”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents. Validated official translations in the local language versions will be used. The subject should complete the paper -based EQ-5D after the KCCQ -12 but before any other assessment or procedure for the visit concerned is performed. The subject should complete the questionnaires in a quiet environment. Source data verification will be performed for paper -based questionnaires . Once completed by the subjects, data will be entered into the eCRF by site staff. The manual of operations will detail how the data flow will be handled. 9.2.3.11 Laboratory Tests Mandated by the Study Protocol The laboratory tests mandated by the trial protocol to be transferred into the eCRF will be analysed locally. The assays to be performed are Hb, serum ferritin, TSAT , serum phosphorus and serum pregnancy tests in females of childbearing potential.

Blood samples will be stored for up to three years after the end of the trial for future analyses of biomarkers of scientific interest. Details concerning the blood s amples storage will be provided in an instruction manual and results of these exploratory analyses will be not part of the clinical study report of the main study. 9.2.3.12 Randomisation Upon completion of the baseline visit procedures/assessments, eligible subjects will be randomised using a validated centralised procedure (IWRS) to either FCM or placebo. Study treatment must be administered on the same day as randomisation. To accommodat e local hospital practice, the first dose of study treatment may be administered either on the same day or the day before the planned discharge day. Note that a planned overnight stay following study treatment administration does NOT fulfil the criteria of an SAE unless there is a medical reason for doing this . The randomisation system will allocate the study treatment pack number(s) which should be used for the subject concerned . 9.2.3.13 Administration of Study Treatment The unblinded Investigator will determine the dose of study treatment to be administered as shown in Table 1. After administration of the first dose of study treatment by the unblinded study personnel , each subject should be observed for adverse effects for at least 30 minutes following each injection of study treatment. Thereafter, at the discretion of the Investigator, subjects may then be discharged from hospital (i.e. , following the Index hospitalisation) and for the follow -up visits, may leave the outpatient clinic at the discretion of the Investigator. The complete details concerning the study drug administration procedures will be detailed in the manual o f operations. 9.2.3.14 Reporting of Events Suggestive of the Study Outcomes Reported AEs will be assessed to determine if they are suggestive of the study outcomes – this includes emergency room admissions and unscheduled outpatient clinic visits to treat worsening HF . For such events , the sites will be requested to provide additional information and source documentation (e.g., discharge letters, laboratory/investig ational test results) concerning the event which will be used by the CEC to adjudicate the event concerned.

Any new clinically relevant changes, as assessed by the Investigator, in laboratory tests performed under normal routine during the follow -up period of the trial must be reported as an AE (see Section 10 ). The results of the laboratory tests concerned must be available in the source data. 9.2.5.2 Symptoms and Clinical F indings Relating to Heart Failure The symptoms and signs with which the subject presented at the Index hospitalisation must be documented in the subject’ s source data. The date for the LVEF measurement used to determine eligibility must be <12 months prior the randomisation date. The LVEF may have been measured by echocardiography, computerised tomography (CT scan) , magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ventricular gated single -photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) or radionuclide angiography (MUGA ). 9.2.6 End of Treatment Procedures Not applicable. 9.2.7 End of Study (or Early Discontinuation) Procedures Upon completion of the study (i.e., at Week 52 (Visit 6)), or if subject is discontinued/withdrawn prior to Week 52 (Visit 6) , all assessments should be performed as detailed in Table 2 for such scenarios."

EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES, SAE S AND SPECIAL SITUATIONS 10.1 Definitions 10.1.1 Reference Safety Information The Reference Safety Information (RSI) presents the basis for expectedness assessment of an adverse reaction for expedite d reporting and annual safety reporting, as well as surveillance of subject’s safety in a clinical trial by regulatory (and ethic) bodies. In the context of this study, the RSI is contained in Appendix 2 of the Investigator’ s Brochure . 10.1.2 Adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 10.1.3 Adverse Drug Reaction In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medical product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR s. The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 10.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event /Adverse Drug Reaction An AE/ADR, the nature (i.e., specificity/seriousness/outcome/frequency) or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved investigational product, or Packag e Insert/Summary of Product Characteristics for an approved product). Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase in the rate of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction also constitute unex pected events. 10.1.5 Serious Adverse Event A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (the term life -threatening in the definition of serious refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of d eath at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe)"
65,page_65,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 66 of 108 • Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation (unless elective surgery (a planned, non- emergen cy medical procedure)) • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medical event (i.e., medically significant) Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether exped ited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These events should also be considered as serious. Conversely, some hospitalisations, particularly those which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for pre -existing conditions , treatment on an em ergency outpatient basis not resulting in hospital admission or inpatient hospitali sation for social reasons in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s general condition should not automatically be classed as SAEs. Also, a planned overnight stay following study treatment administration does NOT fulfil the criteria of a n SAE unless there is a medical reason for doing this. Any worsening of a pre -existing medical condition or any new medical condition that meets the above SAE criteria should be considered as an SAE. In case of any worsening of a pre -existing medical condition or any new medical condition occurring that meets the above SAE criteria should be considered as an SAE. Any suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product should be considered as an important medical event (i.e., medically significant) and therefore documented as an SAE. The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the Contract Research Organisation (CRO)/Sponsor any AEs for which the issue of seriousness is unclear or questionable. 10.1.6 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the RSI) that, based on the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product. Based on the specific study design and the advanced underlying disease state of the recruited subject population, events suggestive of the study outcomes i.e., a re-hospitalisation for an episode of acutely decompensated HF or a CV event leading to death which occurs after discharge for the Index hospitalisation would automatically"
66,page_66,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 67 of 108 qualify to meet the criteria of seriousness in this study. These events would be report ed as suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions in cases where there is reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product. 10.1.7 Special Situations The following are defined as special situations: • Use of a medicinal product during pregnancy or breastfeeding • Medication abuse: the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of study medication • Medication error: any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing or administration of a medicinal product during the study • Medication misuse: an intentional and inappropriate use of a medicinal product not in accordance with the protocol dose, route of administration, and/or the indication(s) • Medication overdose: the administration of a quantity of study treatment given per administration or per day which is above the protocol maximum permitted dose • Occupational exposure: an exposure to a medicinal product for human use as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation • Drug interaction • Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from product use Suspected adverse reactions associated with medication errors of the investigational medicinal product or use outside that foreseen in the protocol (e.g., overdose or misuse) are also considered as ADRs. Any special situation occurring wit h/without ADR/AE shall be recorded in the study-specific documentation. 10.2 AE Descriptors 10.2.1 Intensity/Severity Categorisation The term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infa rction); however the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by the subject during the course of the event. The medical assessment of intensity will be determined by using the following definitions:"
67,page_67,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 68 of 108 Mild: The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. Moderate: The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function. Severe: The AE is incapacitating and the subject is unable to work or complete usual activity. 10.2.2 Causal Relationship Categorisation An Investigator who is qualified in medicine (or dentistry, if appropriate) must make the determination of relationship to investigational product for each AE and SAE. The Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgement, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE/SAE should be classified as unrelated . Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE should be considered certainly, probably/likely, or possibly related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of causal relationship on the SAE form. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition Certain Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with plausible time relationship to study treatment intake • Cannot be explained by disease or other drugs • Response to withdrawal plausible (pharmacologically, pathologically) • Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e., an objective and specific medical disorder or a recognised pharmacological phenomenon) • Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary Probable/ Likely Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to study treatment intake • Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs • Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable • Rechallenge not required Possible Yes • Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to study treatment intake • Could also be explained by disease or other drugs • Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear Unrelated No • Event or laboratory test abnormality which is clearly related to circumstances not connected with the study treatment intake"
68,page_68,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 69 of 108 If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “certainly, probably/likely, or possibly related”, the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator has not provided his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as related and qual ify for expedited regulatory reporting. 10.2.3 Outcome Categorisation Outcome may be classified as: recovered/resolved (i.e., without sequelae); recovered/resolved with sequelae; recovering/resolving; not recovered/not resolved; fatal; or unknown (if follow-up is not possible). If the outcome of an SAE is reported as recovered/resolved with sequelae, the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on the SAE form. If the outcome of an SAE is reported as unknown, the Investigator should specify (on the SAE for m) the rationale why unknown was selected. 10.2.4 Pre-existing Medical Conditions A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the medical history eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the AE eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”). 10.2.5 Worsening of the Disease Under Study Symptoms and signs of the disease under study should not be considered AEs as long as they are not regarded as worsening of the clinical features of the disease under study. If a sign or symptom of the disease has unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study, the symptoms and signs should be recorded as AEs, and clearly marked as worsening of the signs or symptoms in the e CRF. 10.2.6 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations A change in the value of a safety laboratory investigation can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to a pathological value, or results in a deterioration of Common Terminology Criteria grade, or a further worsening of an already pathological value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration."
69,page_69,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 70 of 108 If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are pathological laboratory values which were not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations should be performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values. The Investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a laboratory parameter is clinically significant and therefore represents an AE. If the Investigator considers such an AE as serious (e.g., medically significant event fulfilling criteria per Section 10.1.5), it must be reported as an SAE. If a laboratory abnormality meeting the above criteria is a sign of a disease or syndrome only the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF. If a laboratory abnormality meeting the above criteria is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded in the eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., “elevated potassium” as opposed to “abnormal potassium”). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterised by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, hyperkalaemia or hypoglycaemia. Observations of the same laboratory abnormality from visit to visi t should not be repeatedly recorded in the eCRF, unless the aetiology changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. At the end of the study period, all pathological laboratory findings/values diagnosed throughout the treatment period should be reviewed by the Investigator to provide a final clinical assessment in view of the dynamic of laboratory changes/abnormalities. 10.2.7 Abnormal Vital Signs Not every vital sign abn ormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result must be reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria: • Accompanied by clinical symptoms • Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) • Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy • Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an AE."
70,page_70,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 71 of 108 If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) shoul d be recorded in the eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should not be repeatedly recorded in the eCRF, unless the aetiology changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 10.2.8 Special Situations All special situations ( see Section 10.1.7) such as study treatment overdose and medication errors including in jection rate errors have to be documented in the subject’s eCRF (investigational medicinal product accountability and special situations pages as appropriate) and source documents. All special situations, e.g., overdose, or medication errors have to be reported per standard guidelines. 10.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs and Pregnancy 10.3.1 Adverse Events All AEs either observed by the Investigator or one of his/her medical collaborators, or reported by the subject spontaneously, or in response to a direct question, will be noted in the AE section of the subject's eCRF and source documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study. AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatme nt should also be collected. If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to study treatment, any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has become chronic), outcome, intensity (worst at any point during the event) and whether the AE was serious or not at any time during the event will be recorded. In order to establish the duration of any SAE, the dates of hospitalisation and discharge or dates of meeting other SAE criteria will be recorded in the eCRF . Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterised as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded in the eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by 1 AE report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. The Investigator should use standard medical terminology/concepts; avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only 1 AE term should be recorded in each event field in the eCRF."
71,page_71,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 72 of 108 The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. The AE reporting period ends at the last study/follow-up visit (Week 52 – Visit 6 ). AEs that extend continuously, without resolution, between trial assessments should only be recorded once in the eCRF. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity should be updated to reflect the most extreme severity any time the event worsens. AEs that resolve and subsequently recur should have each re currence recorded separately in the eCRF. All AEs persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilisation, or the subject is lost to follow- up and cannot be contacted. The outcome must be documented in the subject’s source documents. If the subject reports an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess causality. This may require additional laboratory testing, physi cal examinations, telephone contacts, etc. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non- leading question, such as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non-leading way about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. This information should be collected prior to completion of assessments at all study visits. In addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be assessed as AEs. 10.3.2 Serious Adverse Events The occurrence of an SAE must be immediately reported to Vifor Pharma (or its delegate; e.g., CRO) within 24 hours of awareness . This includes all SAEs (independent of relationship to study treatment) occurring from the time the informed consent is signed until 30 days following the last study visit or until 30 days after last study drug administration, whichever is longer. The fina l follow -up may be conducted as a telephone call rather than a formal visit, but the Investigator must report any SAEs that occur during this period. SAEs starting before first administration of study treatment must be identified as such. A death occurrin g during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit or until 30 days after the last study treatment administration, whichever is longer, whether considered treatment -related or not, must be repor ted to the CRO/Vifor Pharma. SAEs must be reported by entering the SAE information into the eCRF. CRO (Worldwide Clinical Trial Pharmacovigilance department) will receive notification of the initial SAE via an email alert generated from the electronic data capture system."
72,page_72,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 73 of 108 The electronic SAE f orm will be completed with the following information at a minimum: • Event description/verbatim (including onset date of the SAE, outcome and reason for it being considered serious) • Relationship to investigational product (i.e., causality) • Name of the investigational product (including study treatment dose and administration dates) • Action taken with the investigational product • Severity of the event Additional information must be uploaded to the eCRF when available includi ng any relevant records (e.g., hospital discharge summary, autopsy report/death certificate, etc.). Any supporting information provided should not reveal a subject’s identity beyond the agreed study identifier. The Investigator should ensure that information reported is accurate and consistent. If the Investigator is unable to access the eCRF , the report may be done by facsimile or email using the study -specific Vifor Pharma SAE form provided by Vifor Pharma (see Appendix 1). The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE pages, and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the source documents. The Vifor Pharma SAE form must be completed in capital letters, in medical terms, in English and to the best extent possible given the time constraints. Any supporting documentation should be sent along with the Vifor Pharma SAE form. At a minimum the following should be provided at the time of the initial SAE report: • Study name and/or number • Subject number, age and sex • Event descrip tion/verbatim (including onset date of the SAE, outcome and reason for it being considered serious) • Relationship to investigational product (i.e., causality) • Name of the investigational product (including study treatment dose and administration dates) • Action taken with the investigational product • Severity of the event"

This will be kept up to date with any changes being provided to the Investigator immediately. Pharmacovigilance Department Worldwide Clinical Trials Fax: Email address: The SAE information must be entered onto the SAE eCRF as soon as the web- based system becomes accessible. Follow- up information must be handled in the same way and reported within the same time frame as the initial report. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than signs and symptoms. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. In case of a fatal outcome, the Investigator should provide a working diagnosis (event which caused outcome, e.g., death due to fatal myocardial infarction) instead of reporting only death; and an autopsy report should be provided where possible. If the cause of death later becomes availab le (e.g., after autopsy), this working diagnosis should be replaced by the established cause of death. The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the signs and symptoms/diagnosis became serious, i.e., met at least 1 of the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH ) criteria for serious ness. The resolution date of the SAE is defined as when the symptoms resolve, or the event is considered chronic (e.g., sequelae) or stable, and/or if the seriousness criteria are no longer applicable. SAEs that are o ngoing at the time of death are considered unresolved. All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to investigational product, will be followed up until resolution, stabilisation, or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted. No further updates should be entered into the e CRF after the completion of the final safety follow-up period, but should be notified to the CRO/Vifor Pharma using the Vifor Pharma SAE form. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject (or his/her relatives), the Investigator must provide a written statement (recorded in the subject’s source documents) to the CRO/Vifor Pharma, confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up."

Any SAE considered to have a causal relationship (i.e., related) to the investigational product and discovered by the Investigator at any time after the study should be reported. A rationale for the assessment of a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator. Any safety information that is o btained after database lock of the clinical database will be documented in the safety database and implications for handling the data in the clinical database assessed on an individual case basis . Additional detail regarding SAE reporting procedures and ma nagement is available in the study- specific SAE Processing and Reporting Plan, which will be provided in the study documentation. 10.3.2.1 Elective Surgery/Routine Examination Elective surgery (a planned, non- emergency medical procedure) and in -patient routine examination for a pre -existing condition (i.e., recorded in the medical history) do not qualify as SAEs as long as the procedure was not performed as a result of a worsening of the condition. However, AEs which occur during any elective hospitalisation wil l need to be collected and reported. 10.3.3 Pregnancy When a female subject becomes pregnant during the study and study treatment has been administered to the subject, the outcome of the pregnancy needs to be monitored and the safety of the mother and unborn child need to be safeguarded (as per protocol, pregnancy is an exclusion criteria). Therefore, the outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) must be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study or the study has b een completed. Women of childbearing potential should have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to randomisation. Study treatment should not be initiated by the Investigator until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained. A highly e ffective contraception must be used in female subjects of childbearing potenti al before beginning study treatment , during study dosing, and for 30 days following discontinuation of study treatment . Following sections in i talics are applicable for United Kingdom only ( UK only ): Highly effective birth control methods include: • Combined ( oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation"
75,page_75,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 76 of 108 − Oral − Intravaginal − Transdermal • Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation − Oral − Injectable − Implantable • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone- releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomised partner • Sexual abstinence Due to the follow -up of 52 weeks per patient after randomisation in the present study, sexual abstinence is only acceptable as ‘true abstinence’ when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to IMP, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study and no further study treatment shall be administered. The Medical Monitor must be contacted immediately to break the blind (if applicable). The Investigator should counsel the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the foetus. The Investigator/Sponsor is responsible for monitoring the subject and pregnancy outcome. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days postpartum (or otherwise as appropriate). It will be the responsibility of the Sponsor, together with the appropriate support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. Any report of pregnancy recorded for any female subject should be reported to the CRO/Vifor Pharma within the same timelines as a SAE, i.e., immediately (within 24 hours of awareness). The Investigator should complete a Vifor Pharma Report on Exposure to Medicines During Pregnancy form (see Appendix 2) and forward to the CRO/Vifor Pharma. Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or"

STUDY COMMITTEES 11.1 DSMB/DMC Procedures A DSMB/DMC will be constituted to protect the safety of study participants. A DSMB/DMC is a group of independent experts external to a study assessing the progress, safety data and, if needed critical efficacy endpoints of a clinical study. Most DSMBs/DMCs are composed of clinicians with expertise in relevant clinical specialties and at least 1 biostatistician knowledgeable about statistical methods for clinical trials and sequential analysis of trial data. For trials with unusually high risks or with broad public health implications, the DSMB/DMC may include a medical ethicist knowledgeable about the design, conduct, and interpretation of clinical trials. For practical reasons the number of members of a DSMB/DMC should be limited. The DSMB/DMC will receive blinded eCRF data in the form of tables and listings (prepared by an independent statistician), and adjudicat e on subject status changes and dosing decisions (where appropriate). Where appropriate, the DSMB/DMC may receive unblinded data (on a subject level or treatment group level) that should be reviewed in a closed session. The data should include, but is not limited to, demographics, subject enrolment, baseline characteristics, AE data, SAE data (by severity and causality), laboratory data, dose adjustments, protocol adherence, and subject withdrawals. The DSMB/DMC will evaluate the progress of the trial, assess data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, and participant benefit/risk . In addition the DSMB/DMC will monitor external factors relevant to the trial, for example scientific and therapeutic developments that may affect participant safety or ethical status. Based on the observed benefits or adverse effects, the DSMB/DMC will make recommendations to the Sponsor concerning continuation, termination or modifications of the trial. The Sponsor will establish a charter document explaining the working procedures and responsibilities of the DSMB/DMC. The charter should be agreed to by the DSMB/DMC. 11.2 Steering Committee The Steering Committee ( SC), chaired by Co -ordinating Investi gator, will be responsible for maintaining the scientific integrity of the trial. Members will be selected investigators from the participating countries/regions. The Co-ordinating Investigator will review and approve the trial protocol and subsequent protocol amendments, taking into account also feedb ack from other SC members, if applicable. The SC will be blinded to study treatment allocation while the trial is ongoing. Each SC member is expected to discuss with the SC Chairman any activities that might constitute a conflict of interest for the AFFIRM -AHF trial. SC meetings will be attended by, in addition, representatives of the Sponsor and coordinating personnel (if applicable), in a non- voting capacity."
78,page_78,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 79 of 108 11.3 Clinical Endpoint Committee An independent CEC will be formed to adjudicate all events suggestive of the study endpoints using prospectively defined criteria which will be detailed in the CEC charter. Members of the CEC will not be employees of Sponsor. This committee will be compose d of at least three members including at least one cardiologist specialising in HF . The CEC will adjudicate the events blinded to study treatment group allocation. Endpoint adjudication will be done, using a web -based adjudication system, on an ongoing bas is throughout the duration of the trial.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 12.1 Statistical Methods All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS Version 9.3 or later (SAS Institute Inc. SAS/STAT, Cary, NC, U nited S tates). The level of significance to be used will be 0.05. Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (S AP), which will be finalised prior to unlocking of the study data base. A general description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the final study report. 12.2 Sample Size and Power Calculati ons The recurrent HF hospitalisation and CV death rates in the control group was extrapolated as 0.9 event s/year using the data from the EVEREST study [37] and as 0.61 event s/year using the data from the ESC -HF study [38]. For this study, it is anticipated that approximately 35% of subjects will sustain either a CV death or will sustain at least one HF hospitalisation . It is also anticipated that 12% of subjects w ill sustain a CV death . Assuming that 50% of subjects who sustain a C V death will not undergo any prior HF hospitalisation and that the average number of HF hospitalisation s per subject with at least one HF hospitalisation will be estimated as 2, the number of events per 100 years has been estimated as follows: 12 CV deaths + 2*(35- 6) HF hospitalisations, which equates to approximately 70 events/100 years of follow -up for HF hospitalisations and CV death. Concerning the event rate ratio, it is ass umed that there will be a 30% reduction in HF hospitalisations for subjects allocated to FCM and that CV death rates will be similar between the FCM and placebo groups. It is therefore assumed that the rate ratio between FCM and placebo for the composite of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV deaths will be approximately 25%. The dispersion factor used in negative binomial regression is a measure of the mean- variance. There is currently insufficient data to estimate the negative binomial dispersion. For th is sample size calculation, a dispersion factor (K) of 1 was assumed . The sample size calculation was done in the software NCSS PASS-14 [ 39] using the sample size form ula proposed by Zhu and Lakkis 2014 [ 40] to compare two negative binomial rates. Assuming a recurrent HF hospitalisation and CV death of 0.7 events/year the placebo group, in total, 1,000 subjects (500 per study treatment group) would be required to demonstrate a statistically significant rate ratio of 0.75 (i.e. , 25% reduction of recurrent events between the FCM and placebo groups) with a power of 80% and a 2-sided alpha of 0.05. Taking into account 9% loss to follow -up, a sample size of 1,100 subjects (550 per treatment group) is planned."

The subjects in this group will be analysed based on the treatment received. 12.4 Background and Demographic Characteristics The baseline and demographic characteristics will be summari sed per treatment group. 12.5 Study Treatment The total amount of study treatment given will be calculated for each subject and will be compared to the amount expected to be given for each subject. Treatment compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarised by treat ment group. 12.6 Concomitant Therapy Concomitant medications will be categorised according to a standard dictionary (World Health Organization Drug Classification). Counts and percentages of subject use for each medication will be computed and summarised by tre atment group. 12.7 Efficacy Evaluations 12.7.1 Primary The primary outcome is the composite of recurrent HF hospitalisations and CV death up to 52 weeks after randomisation . The HF hospitalisation and CV death rates per 100 patient -years of follow -up as adjudicated by the CE C, will be calculated by dividing the total number of HF hospitalisations , and CV deaths by the total follow -up duration of all subjects in each group. The rate ratio ( 95% CI and p- value) for this analysis will be analysed using a negative binomial model. Compared to the Poisson distribution, the negative binomial"

The negative binomial model will be adjusted for the following baseline covariates: sex , age, HF aetiology (ischemi c/non- ischemic), HF durat ion (newly diagnosed at Index hospitalisation/known documented HF prior to Index hospitalisation) and country. A sensitivity analyses will be performed using an unadjusted model. The primary outcome analysis will be performed on the FAS will use the CEC adjudicated events. A sensitivity analysis will be performed on the PP population set. Descriptive statistics will provide, per treatment group, the total number of event s and the number (%) of subjects with at least one event. A graphical representation o f the estimated cumulative hazard rate will also be provided. As the analysis of HF hospitalisation s could be confounded by the competing risk of death, a confirmatory analysis will be performed on the FAS population set using the joint frailty model in order to analyse repeat hospitalisation rate whilst accounting for their associated mortality rate [42]. 12.7.2 Secondary and Other Endpoints The secondary endpoints will evaluate, relative to placebo, the effect of IV FCM . Hochberg’s procedure will be used to control the overall T ype I error for the evaluation of the secondary endpoints. The secondary endpoints are the following: • The composite of recurrent CV hospitalisations and CV death up to 52 weeks after randomisation. • HF hospitalisations up to 52 weeks after randomisation (analysed as recurrent event). • CV mortality analysed as time to first event at 52 weeks after randomisation. • The composite of HF hospitalisations or CV death analysed as time to first event at 52 weeks after randomisation. • Days lost due to HF hospitalisations or CV death at 52 weeks after randomisation. Complete details concerning the analyses of the secondary endpoints and the statistical tests to be performed will be detailed in the SAP – the latter will be finalised prior to unblinding of the trial database."

83,page_83,"FER-CARS -06 Version 3.1 Confident ial 1 April 2020 Page 84 of 108 For the recurrent event analysis, the same analysis as that described f or the primary outcome will be performed. For the time to first event analysis, t he incidence of events will be documented by treatment group with the total number of events, the number of subjects with at least 1 event and the event hazard rate per 100 patient years “ at risk ” (estimated as the number of patients with at least 1 event divided by the patient years at risk of event). Patient years at risk of event will be taken as the sum of the observation time from start of study treatment until the first occurrence of the event concerned, or until censoring. T he hazard ratio (relative to placebo), its 95% CI and the p -value test will be provided using Cox regression . The proportion of patients with an event (HF hos pitalisations, CV hospitalisations, CV mortality; composite and individual categories) will also be reported. The change in N YHA class will be analysed using a repeated measurement analysis of the ordered polytomous regression adjusted for treatment, time and the baseline NYHA value. Complete details concerning the analyses of the other endpoints and the statistical tests to be performed will be detailed in the SAP – the latter will be finalised prior to unblinding of the trial database. 12.8 Safety Evaluations The safety analysis will be performed on the Safety analysis set. The following safety outcomes will be analysed : • Clinical laboratory panels (iron status, serum phosphorus and cardiac biomarkers) • Summary of AEs: by s ystem organ class (SOC) and preferred t erm (PT) (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coded term), by severity and relation to study product • Summary of SAEs: by SOC and PT (MedDRA coded term), by severity and relation to study product All data will be presented in a descriptive manner by providing mean tables (continuous variables) or frequency tables (discrete variables and AEs ). Laboratory data will also be presented by shift tables. For AEs, the total number of events and number (%) of subjects with event will be presented by MedDRA S OC and PT by treatment group .

Such analyses may include subgroup analyses based on various baseline characteristics such as Hb, HF aetiology, duration of H F, baseline serum creatinine and will be fully described in the final SAP. 12.10.2 Biomarker Blood Samples It is planned to perform biomarker analyses in blood samples from approximately 60% of randomised subjects. The decision concerning which biomarkers will be analysed will be made by in collaboration with the SC, together with the Sponsor. If the biomarker samples will not be analysed, they will be destroyed. Details concerning the blood samples storage will be provided in an instruction manual. The statistical analysis for the biomarker blood samples will be detailed in a separate biomarker SAP and results of these exploratory analyses will be not part of the clinical study report of the main study . 12.10.3 Quality of Life Quality of Life will be asse ssed using t he KCC Q-12 and EQ -5D. The analysis of treatment difference on the KCCQ -12 score at Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36 and Week 52 will be done by comparing the model adjusted means of the corresponding visit based on a model for repeated -measures including terms for treatment, baseline, time and treatment- by-time with an unstructured covariance matrix to model the within -patient variability . The analysis of treatment difference on the EQ -5D score will be done in the same manner for the data collected at Week 6, Week 24 and Week 52. The SAP will detail the analysis to be performed . 12.10.4 Pooling of AFFIRM-AHF, FAIR-HF2 and FAIR-HFpEF studies Since February 2017, a study (FAIR -HF2: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03036462) is running as multinational trial. The purpose of this study is to determine whether IV iron supplementation using FCM reduces hospitalisation and mortality i n patients with ID and HF. Since August 2017, a study (FAIR -HFpEF: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03074591) is running in Germany. The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with IV iron for patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction and ID, both with or without anaemia, can improve exercise capacity as measured by 6 -minute walking test and symptoms while being safe. As there are a lot of similarities between AFFIRM -AHF, FAIR -HF2 and FAIR -HFpEF studies, it has been decided to per form 2 integrated analyses of the 3 studies: • Integrated analysis 1: AFFIRM -HF and FAIR -HF2 studies"

POLICY FOR PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION OF DATA Vifor Pharma is committed to the timely communication of data from clinical research trials, following the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America principles [45]. Where possible, authorship will be agreed at the beginning of the study. The authors will form a publication committee and this committee will propose and develop appropriate scientific manuscripts or abstracts from the study data. Investigators may not present or publish partial or complete study results individually. Following section in i talics is applicable for The Netherlands only (NL only): In The Netherlands the previous sentence is extended with: […]individually, in the initial 12 months after the study’s termination prior research results have been disclosed. Any manuscript or abstract proposed by the Investigators must be reviewed and approved in writing by Vifor Pharma before submission for publication. Names of all Investigators actively participating in the study will be included in the publication. The publica tion committee for a study will comprise of authors selected in adherence with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria [46] for authorship. That is, all authors must meet each of the following 3 criteria: 1. Substantial contribution to conception and design or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data 2. Drafted the article or revised it critically for important intellectual content 3. Approved the final version for publication Members of the study SC generally fulfil the authorship criteria through their involvement in protocol design and review, monitoring of and sometimes direct involvement with recruitment, and thus they will usually be part of the publication committee. If studies are multicentre, it may be appropriate to assign group authorship. In addition, certain Vifor Pharma employees involved in the design and conception of the protocol, study management and data analysis and interpretation are qualified authors and will be included in the publication committee e.g., the lead physician, statistician and study project manager or their equivalents."
