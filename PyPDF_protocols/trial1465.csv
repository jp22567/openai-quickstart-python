As a result of the planned sample size re-estimation the sample size is increased to 65 su bjects per group (260 in total) The sample size calculation is based on pairwise comparisons of the primary endpoint for each active dose versus placebo. Objective cough frequency will be analyz ed on a log scale. A two -sided type I error of 0.05, not adjus ted for multiple comparisons against placebo, will be used for this exploratory study. Assuming a revised standar d deviation of change from B aseline (after taking logs) of 0. 285 (based on the sample size re - estimate and increased from the original assumpti on of 0.261 ), a reduction in the placebo group of 10% and a reduction in the orvepitant group of 35%, 65 subjects per arm will provide a power of 80% . This new standard deviation estimate has been obtained (at the first sample size review) by considering t he revised full analysis set of"

After at least 100 subjects have completed the Week 12 ACM assessment (and in addition to the now completed first sample size re -estimate) the cough frequency data will be reviewed to check the estimate of variabi lity assumed for the primary efficacy variable. This sample - size re -estimation will be done on a blinded basis and may result in an increase in the sample size. Assuming no further changes to the sample size estimate, approximately 292 subjects will be randomized to ensure at least 260 completers (assuming approximately 10% drop out rate). The sample size may be adjusted again after the second re -estimate and provided no more than 320 subjects (approximately 80 per group) are required the precise number w ill be documented in a non - substantial (administrative) amendment to the protocol.

BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 5.1 Orvepitant NeRRe is develop ing orvepitant as a treatment for C hronic Refractor y Cough (CRC), also known as chronic idiopathic cough or unexplained chronic cough (Irwin et al., 1998; Gibson et al., 2016). Cough in these subjects is a difficult symptom to manage and there remains a substantial need for new and effective treatments (Gibson & Vertigan, 2015). It is hypothesi zed that chronic cough results from hypersensitivity of peripheral airway sensory afferent neurones a nd neurones centrally in the brainstem that together govern the cough reflex, resulting in enhanced cough in either response to otherwise trivial stimuli or in the absence of an initiating event (reviewed in Canning et al., 2014; Gibson & Vertigan, 2015). Substance P and its cog nate neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor have been implicated as having a role in induction and maintenance of the peripheral and central cough reflex hypersensitivity; thus NK -1 antagonism has the potential to provide a novel and effective a pproach to address the CRC subject population (Canning, 2009; Lavinka & Dong, 2013; Harle et al., 2016). Therefore, the overall anticipated benefits of orvepitant as a centrally penetrant, potent and selective NK -1 receptor antagonist include rapid and sus tained control of CRC together with associated enhanced general Quality -of-Life. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional information related to the physical, chemical and pharmaceutical properties and formulation of orvepitant . 5.2 Pre-clinica l research 5.3 Clinical experience"

Excessive coughing is the leading reason for ambulatory care visits by subjects in the US (Hsiao et al., 2010) and has a significant impact on subject Quality - of-Life (French et al., 1998; Chamberlain et al., 2015). Chronic coughing has been shown to have significant physical, social and psychological consequences (Birring et al., 2003; French et al., 2002, Dicpinigaitis et al., 2006). Subjects often suffer complications such as chest and abdominal pains, retching and vomiting, urinary incontinence an d even cough syncope. Many are embarrassed and stigmatiz ed by this symptom and therefore avoid public places and social gatherings. Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP ) define chronic cough as being of duration ≥8 weeks (Irwin et al., 2006). A recent meta -analysis found the worldwide epidemiological prevalence of chronic cough to be 7.9% (Song et al., 2015) and was significantly more frequent in Europe (12.7%) and America (11.0%). Chronic cough afflicts women more often than men a nd generally has an onset from middle age (Irwin et al., 1981; Janson et al., 2001; Ford et al., 2006; Irwin et al., 2006; Everett et al., 2007). CRC represents a particular problem to physicians as the management is difficult with symptoms persisting des pite guideline based treatment (Gibson & Vertigan, 2015). For example, in a community based chronic cough survey, 60% of respondents reported that their symptoms had not improved despite treatment (Everett et al., 2007). The cough pathway is complex; it is activated by sensory afferent nerve fibers in the airways that converge into vagus nerves to a central cough -reflex centre in the brain stem called the Nucleus"
20,page_20,"Product: CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: VOLCANO -2 ORVEPITANT NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd Protocol No.: 5.0 FINAL Page 21 of 65 21-February -2018 Tractus Solitarius (NTS). The NTS is connected in turn to respiratory related neurones that a re involved in coordinating the cough response; higher cortical centers also provide a controlling influence enabling either voluntary production or inhibition of cough. A cough activating reflex event may occur as a result of inflammatory or mechanical ch anges or be triggered due to the inhalation of irritants. It is hypothesi zed that the pathological basis of chronic cough is plastic changes in peripheral airway sensory afferent neurones and neurones centrally in the brainstem that hypersensitizes the cou gh reflex resulting in enhanced cough in either response to otherwise trivial stimuli or in the absence of an initiating event (reviewed in Canning et al., 2014; Gibson & Vertigan, 2015). Current thinking is that a mechanism that can target both peripheral and central cough reflex hypersensitivity could therefore provide an optimum approach to address the CRC subject population. One such potential mechanism that could be targeted is the NK -1 receptor and its cognate ligand Substance P. Peripherally in the a irways, hypersensitivity could result by activation of lung mast cells that degranulate, releasing mediators which in turn stimulate unmyelinated C -fibers to release S ubstance P creating a neuro -inflammatory state (Lavinka & Dong, 2013). Such a mechanism i s consistent with emerging data that has shown that in isolated vagal nerves from both guinea -pig and humans, S ubstance P can cause depolarization that is blocked by the NK -1 antagonist aprepitant (Harle et al., 2016). Centrally the hypersensitization could be due to the key role that the NK -1 receptor system plays as a controlling excitatory transmitter regulator in the cough reflex centre in the NTS (Joad et al., 2004; Mazzone et al., 2005; Mutulo et al., 2007; Canning, 2009; Chen et al., 2009; Sekizawa e t al., 2011). Recently NK -1 receptors have been shown to be implicated in the cough reflex pathway in another brainstem location, the caudal Ventral Respiratory Group (cVRG) (Mutolo et al., 2010). In vivo in animal models, NK -1 receptor antagonists have de monstrated to be effective anti -tussive agents in five different species, namely: guinea pigs (Bolser et al., 1997; El -Hashim et al., 2004; Mazzone et al., 2005), rabbits (Mutolo et al., 2008; Mutolo et al., 2010), cats (Bolser et al., 1997; Bolser et al., 1999), dogs (Chapman et al., 2004) and pigs (Moreaux et al., 2000). In these experiments, the NK -1 antagonists were administered by different routes: systemically, by intracerebroventricular injection, via the central artery or by direct injection into bo th the NTS and cVRG. In canine chronic bronchitis, which is a self -perpetuating, inflammatory disease of airways, characterized by cough >2 months in duration, treatment with the NK -1 antagonist maropitant in a small 14 - day study, significantly decreased c ough frequency ( p < 0.001) and cough VAS scores ( p = 0.005) (Grobman & Reinero, 2016) . Clinically , raised plasma levels of S ubstance P have been reported in humans suffering with both asthmatic and non -asthmatic persistent cough (Otsuka et al., 2011) . Substance P was also elevated in induced sputum from cough subjects with acid reflux (Patterson et al., 2007), and chronic cough subjects with non -acid gastro -esophageal reflux (Qiu et al., 2011). S ubstance P has also been reported to be increased in nasal sec retions from subjects with chronic cough (Lim et al., 2011) and those whose cough has been demonstrated to be hypersensitive to capsaicin challenge (Bae et al., 2012). Subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Hope -Gill et al., 2003)"

The primary endpoint will be change from Baseline to Week 12 in awake objective cough frequency measured with an automated cough monitor (ACM) , The use of acoustic cough counting to objectively assess cough frequency is recognized as a valid and increasi ngly preferred tool for primary endpoint determinat ion in cough clinical studies (Spinou & Birring, 2014; Boulet et al., 2015). Secondary endpoint measures to be utilized that will aim to further characterize the CRC treatment outcomes will include awake objective cough frequency changes at other clinic vi sits and the validated Quality -of-Life assessment tool the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) (Birring et al., 2003; Spinou & Birring, 2014; Boulet et al., 2015). Other patient -reported outcome instruments that will be deployed are the Cough Severity visu al analogue scale (VAS), a simple to use tool that is widely utilized in cough clinical studies (Morice et al., 2007), the Urge - to-Cough VAS (Spinou & Birring, 2014) and the Global Rating of Change for Cough Frequency and Severity . Safety and tolerability will be evaluated through conventional assessments used in the evaluation of investigational medicinal products (IMP) . The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of orve pitant in the target population will be characterized through collection of sparse samples from all subjects. Sparse sampling is a well -established method of collecting PK data that avoids the need for multiple blood draws and extended clinic visits. 6. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 6.1 Primary objectives • To evaluate the efficacy of once daily doses of 10 m g, 20 mg , and 30 mg orvepitant versus placebo in reducing awake objective cough frequency . 6.2 Secondary objectives • To evaluate the efficacy of once daily dosing of 10 mg , 20 mg , and 30 mg orvepitant versus placebo in: • Reducing 24-hour objective cough frequen cy • Reducing night -time (non-waking time) objective cough frequency • Reducing subject assessed cough severity and Urge -to-Cough • Improving Quality -of-Life and subject perception of change • To evaluate the dose -response relationship of 10 mg , 20 mg , and 30 mg orvepitant"

The Investigator may withdraw subjects from the study or may discontinue study treatment at any time. Withdrawal from the study or early discont inuation from the IMP is to be registered in the Interactive Web Response Service (I WRS ). Early withdrawal or early discontinuation from the IMP of any subject who has given informed consent to participate will be recorded including the reason for withdraw al. The primary reason will be selected from the following standard categories of early discontinuations or withdrawals : • Failed to meet randomiz ation criteria (screen failure) • Adverse Event : Clinical events occurred or laboratory results are reported that in the medical judgment of the investigator are grounds for discontinuation from participation in the best interests of the subject • Withdrawal of Consent : The subject desired to withdraw from further participation in the study. The subject is not obliged t o provide any reason for withdrawal of consent, but where a reason is given this will be recorded on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) • Protocol Violation : The subject failed to adhere to the protocol requirements, at the investi gator’s discretion e .g. the subject requires to start taking a medication from th e prohibited medications list (S ection 9.9) • Lost to Follow -Up: The subject stopped coming for visits and study personnel w ere unable to contact the subje ct"

If the s ubject withdraws due to an adverse event ( AE), the event should be followed until resolution or care is transferred to the subject’s general practitioner or primary care physician. Subjects who are withdrawn after randomization will not be replaced. In some circumstances, the Investigator may discontinue study treatm ent without the need to withdraw the subject from participation in the study. When s ubjects permanently discontinue IMP, effort should be made to continue following the subject through to the end of scheduled visits for safety and to obtain efficacy assess ments that can be assigned to the originally randomized treatment . 7.5 Criteria for Stopping the Study The Sponsor may terminate the study for safety or administrative reasons at any time. If, in the opinion of an Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor, the clinical safety observations in the study suggest that it may be unwise to continue, the study may be terminated either at that Investigator’s site or overall. 8.

All IMP must be stored in a secure area with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff. The IMP is to be stored at ambient room temperature up to a maximum of 30oC. Only authorized investigational site study staff members are to dispense the IMP. 9.3 Allocation to Treatment The study will be conducted in a double -blind manner, with the subjects , Investigators and Sponsor all blinded to the treatment allocated. Both orvepitant (10 mg, 20 mg , and 30 mg) and placebo will be presented as white tablets, identical in size and shape. Following the Screening period and confirmation of eligibility, subjects in each cohort will be randomized in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to receive either orvepitant 10 mg /day, 20 mg/day 30 mg /day or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by region, namely North America and Europ e. The IMP each subject will receive will be allocated by an IWRS tool provided by on behalf of the Sponsor. 9.4 Study Treatment and Administration IMP will be taken once daily during the 12 -week double -blind treatment phase (i.e. Day 1 through Week 12 ). IMP doses are fixed and will not be adjusted for individual subjects during the study. At each visit subjects will be dispensed IMP for self -administration for daily dosing until the subsequent visit, with overage included to allow for visit windows. Subjects will be required to take one tablet of IMP once -daily in the morning upon waking with or without food. Subjects will receive their first dose (Day 1) whilst at the clinic and will also take the daily dose at the clinic at each of the Week 2, 4, 8 an d 12 visits . At Day 1 subjects will be dispensed sufficient supply to cover the period from Day 2 to Week 4. An interim check of compliance will be made during the Week 2 visit (subjects will be instructed to bring their IMP bottle with them to this visit ). At Week 4 subjects will be dispensed sufficient supply to cover the period from Week 4 to Week 8. At Week 8 subjects will be dispensed sufficient supply from Week 8 to Week 12. At each visit an overage will be included to allow for visit windows."

The dose on these days will be taken in the clinic after a blood sample for analysis of blood levels of orvepitant is taken . At each clinic visit subjects will be asked to provide the time that they took their dose the previous morning and this will be documented in the eCRF; after the PK sample has been taken subjects will take their dose of IMP and the time recorded in the e CRF. All doses are to be taken at approximatel y the same time each morning . In the event that a subject forgets to take a dose in the morning then the dose can be taken at any time up until 6:00pm. After this time, the dose should not be taken and will be considered a missed dose. Subjects will return any unused medicati on at each clinic visit . 9.5 Duration of Subject Participation The planned duration of participation in the study for an individual subject is up to 1 8 weeks, which includes the following: • Initial S creening phase of up to three weeks (can be extended to up to four weeks in the event that the ACM fails and the 24-hour cough monitoring must be repeated) • 12-week double blind treatment phase • Two-week safety follow -up 9.6 Treatment Accountability and Co mpliance Checks In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Investigator or designated site staff must document the amount of IMP dispensed and/or administered to study subjects , the amount returned by study subjects , and the amount received from and r eturned to the Sponsor (or representative) when applicable. IMP accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study. The accountability unit for this study is a tablet . Discrepancies are to be reconciled or resolved. Procedures for final disposition of unused IMP will be provided in the Pharmacy Manua l. The Investigator has overall responsibility in ensuring that the study treatment is received and managed at the study site in accordance with GCP. Limited responsibility may be deleg ated to a nominated study site representative and this delegation must be documented. Study treatment will be dispensed by a nominated person at each study site. The Sponsor will be permitted upon request to audit supplies, storage and dispensing records a nd procedures. Every effort should be made to encourage subject compliance with the dosage regimen as per the protocol. All subjects will be instructed to return their medication bottle with any unused tablets at each visit (at the Week 2 visit the same bo ttle will be given back to the subject for continuation"

A record of the tablets dispensed, taken, and returned will be recorded at each visit and compliance calculated. 9.7 Treatment Blinding Code Study investigators will be given ac cess to the IWRS system for the purposes of emergency unblinding. Investigators are permitted to unblind treatment for a subject if it is deemed that knowledge of the subject’ s treatment will impact subject’s future medical care. If possible, the medical m onitor or Sponsor medical expert should be notified prior to the blind being broken . If this is not possible, the medical monitor or Sponsor medical expert must be notified as soon as possible if a code break was performed. If a suspected unexpected serio us adverse reaction (SUSAR) occurs that requir es expedited reporting to the relevant regulatory agency/Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , then the blind will be broken for the relevant subject by the safety group, in order to provide the Regulators the knowledge of the event and the causal agent. This is in agreement with ICH E2A and a blinded copy of the report will be provided to the investigators and the relevant IRB /IEC . If unblinding occurs accidentally this w ill be considered a protocol deviation , this must be documented in the subject ’s medical notes and in the trial master file (TMF), and the Sponsor must be informed. 9.8 Permitted Concomitant Medications All concomitant medications taken during the study will b e recorded in the eCRF with indication, dose information, and dates of administration. Concomitant respiratory medication is allowed, but subjects must have been on a stable dose/regimen for the three months prior to S creening and must continue to take the same dose/regimen for the duration of the study . 9.9 Prohibit ed Concomitant Medication Due to their potential effect on cough reflex sensitivity , the use of opioids, dextromethorphan, gabapentin, pregabalin, baclofen, antihistamines or tricyclic antidepressa nts (e.g. amitriptyline) for treatment of cough is not allowed throughout the study. Subjects must have discontinued these drugs at least 1 month prior to Screening and should not have them started during the study . Subjects may, however, be permitted to c ontinue to use these drugs if they have been prescribed solely for the management of another disorder (eg neuropathic pain, depression). The use of other drugs taken solely for the treatment of cough (including those used on an as needed basis) is also pro hibited from at least 1 month prior to Screening."

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporal ly associated with the use of a IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP."
45,page_45,"Product: CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: VOLCANO -2 ORVEPITANT NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd Protocol No.: 5.0 FINAL Page 46 of 65 21-February -2018 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) All AEs considered to be untoward and unintended responses to a IMP related to any dose should be considered ADRs . The definition covers also med ication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product. The phrase “responses to a IMP” means that a causal relationship between a IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationsh ip cannot be ruled out. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An adverse event that: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if i t was more severe) • Requires in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (see explanation below) • Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is considered to be an important medi cal event Based upon medical and scientific judgment , important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening, or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outco mes l isted in the definition above may be considered a SAE . Hospitaliz ations are defined as initial or prolonged admissions that include an overnight stay. Hospitaliz ation or prolonged hospitalization for technical, practical or social reasons, in the absence of an adverse event is not an SAE and neither is attendance at an Emergency Room / Accident and Emergency Department that takes place in the evening or night and does not result in admission to the hospital . Pregnancy Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. However, any pregnancy complication, spontaneous or elective abortion (for medical reasons), still birth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly will be recorded as an AE or SAE. Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction An adverse reaction, the nature or se verity of which is not consistent with applicable product information (e.g., IB for an unapproved IMP). Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reactio n constitute unexpected events."

A causal relationship is present if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by the drug or study procedure. AEs will be classified as either related or unrelated. 10.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject, or discovered as a result of general, non -leading questioning. Adverse events occurring from the time of consent up to the final study visit will be recorded. All AEs should be recorded in the eCRF and in the subjects’ source notes . Any SAE occurring from the time the subject signs informed consent until 30 days after the last dose of IMP must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of it) and recorded on the SAE Form. Detailed instructions for the reporting of SAEs can be found in the Study Manual. All patients with a SAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported. The investigator must supply the Sponsor and the relevant agency/ IRB/IEC with any additional requested information ( e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports). Any follow - up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reported within 24 hours of awareness . If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/ she will not wait to receive additional information before reporti ng the event and completing the appropriate data collection form. The Investigator will always provide a preliminary assessment of causality at the time of the initial report as described in Section 10.5.3 . The primary mechanism for reporting SAEs will be a paper collection form. Fax transmission or ‘scan & email’ of the SAE form is the preferred method to transmit this information to the project contact for SAE receipt. In rare circumstances and in the absence o f fax equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable, with a copy of the SAE data collection form"

Initial notification via the telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE data collection form within the designated reporting periods . NeRRe is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory authorities reports of SUSARs in line with the relevant legislation. Fatal or life -threatening SUSARs must be reported within 7 calendar days and other SUS ARs within 15 calendar days. In accordance with the European Commission Directive 2001/20/EC, NeRRe will notify the relevant Ethics Committees in concerned Member states of applicable SUSARs as individual notifications or through a periodic line listing. NeRRe will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic reports, as required by applicable regulatory requirements. All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant SUSAR reports. Each Investigator must then notify his or her relevant agency/ IRB/IEC of the SAE as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance with IRB /IEC policy. NeRRe will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic reports, as required by applicable regul atory requirements . 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of 10 mg, 20 mg , and 30 mg orvepitant versus placebo in reducing awake objective cough frequency. The corresponding primary endpoint is the change in objective awake cough frequency at Week 12 compared to Baseline and will be analy zed after taking logs (to base 10) . The primary objective will be assessed by testing the following hypotheses for each orvepitant group separately: Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the mean change in log transformed objective awake cough frequency at Week 12 compared to Baseline for the orvepitant treatment group compared to placebo. H0: µ (active) = µ (placebo) Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a differ ence in the mean change in log transformed objective awake cough frequency at Week 12 compared to Baseline for the orvepitant treatment group compared to placebo . H1: µ (active) ≠ µ (placebo) Each comparison will be carried out at the two -sided 5% level of statistical significance. No adjustment will be made for the multiple orvepitant versus placebo group comparisons in this"

As a result of the planned sample size re -estimation the sample size is increased to 65 subjects per group (260 in total). The sample size calculation is based on pairwise comparisons of the primary endpoint for each active dose versus placebo. Objective cough frequency will be analysed on a log scale. A two -sided type I error of 0.05, not adjusted for multiple comparisons against placebo, will be used for this exploratory study. Assuming a revised standar d deviation of change from B aseline (after taking logs) of 0.2 85 (based on the sample size re -estimate and increased from th e original assumption of 0.261 ) a reduction in the placebo group of 10% and a reduction in the orvepitant group of 35%, 65 subjects per arm will provide a power of 80% . This new standard deviation estimate has been obtained (at the first sample size review ) by considering the full analysis set subjects (as revised, See Section 11.2). After at least 100 subjects have completed the Week 12 ACM assessment (and in addition to the now completed first sample size re -estimate) the cou gh frequency data will be reviewed to check the estimate of variability assumed for the primary efficacy variable. This interim sample -size re - estimation will be done on a fully blinded basis using an overall pooled estimate of standard deviation and may r esult in an increase in the sample size (Kieser and Friede, 2000) . Only the awake cough frequency data will be reviewed. Assuming no further changes to the sample size estimate, a pproximately 2 92 subjects will be randomized to ensure at least 2 60 complete rs (assuming approximately 10% drop out rate). The sample size may be adjusted again after the second re -estimate and provided no more than 320 subjects (approximately 80 per group) are required the precise number will be documented in a non-substantial (a dministrative) amendment to the protocol. Any possible impact on the type I error due to this blinded sample size re -assessment procedure is believed to be negligible (Kieser and Friede, 2003). 11.2 Analysis Sets The following data sets will be used for the sta tistical analysis. 1. Safety Set : All subjects who receive at least one dose of double -blind study drug irrespective of treatment received . Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received 2. Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized subjects who received at least one dose of double -blind study drug , irrespective of treatment received , satisfy inclusion criterion number 4 (awake cough frequency of >=10 coughs/hour during the Screening period) , and have awake cough frequency data from the ACM for at least o ne post -treatment assessment . Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment. This is the primary efficacy analysis set for the study."

Exposure -Response (ER) Set: all subjects who received at least one dose of double -blind study drug and for whom the PK data are considered sufficient . Analysis Sets will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study data. 11.3 Data Analysis More details of t he proposed statistical analysis will be documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be written following finalization of the protocol and finalized prior to the breaking of the blind. For continuous data and for ordered categorical data , if appropriate, the number of non -missing observations, mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum will be calculated. For ordered categorical data and nominal data, absolute counts and relative frequencies (in %) wi ll be calculated. All statistical hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be two sided, using a type I error rate of 0.05. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be used for this study. Raw data will be listed. 11.4 Demographics and Baseline Charact eristics Relevant Screening and B aseline data (i.e. data collected prior to the treatment administration) and demographic characteristics will be summarized descriptively for each treatment group. There will be no f ormal comparison of B aseline data, that i s, no statistical hypothesis testing. 11.5 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Parameters 11.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis Awake objective cough frequency at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4 and 12, along with change from Baseline, will be summarized for each treatment group and for each time point on the original scale (including percent change from B aseline) and after log (base 10) transformation. NB: The Baseline for objective cough frequency outcome s is the measurement obtained during the Screening period . The primary analysi s of log transformed awake objective cough frequency will be conducted via a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the model including terms for region, baseline log -transformed awake objective cough frequency, treatment group, week, week*region, week*baseline and week*treatment interactions. Subject will be included as a random effect. The estimated treatment means and differences (orvepitant versus placebo) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) will be reported as part of this analysis, along with 95% con fidence intervals and associated p -values.

The analysis of change from Baseline in both 24 hour and night -time (non-waking time) objective cough frequency will be analyzed in the same way as for the primary endpoint. The other secondary endpoints will be also be analyzed using the MMRM except for the global rating of change in cough frequency and in severity. These shall be summarized as categorical endpoints (“worse”, “about the same” and “better”) and analyzed using Mantel -Haenszel methodology.

No formal inferential tests will be performed on safety data. The number of treatmen t emergent AEs (TEAEs) , and subjects with TEAEs, will be compared between groups . TEAEs are defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened in severity after the first dose of IMP.

TEAEs will also be reported by severity. Any deaths, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP administration will also be summar ised by treatment group. SAEs will be presented in a similar way to AEs. Vital signs will be summarised for each treatment group by visit. Summary statistics will be presented for absolute values and the change from Baseline . ECGs will be assessed by the I nvestigator for abnormal findings. These will be categorised and summarised as normal, abnormal -not clinically significant or abnormal -clinically significant. ECG intervals will be recorded and summarised as absolute values and changes from B aseline. Clinical laboratory data for individual subjects will be listed and any out of range values will be highlighted. Laboratory data will be summarised for each treatment group by visit . Summary statistics will be presented for a bsolute values and change from B aseline, as well as an analysis of shifts from Baseline . Extent of exposure and compliance will be evaluated."

The Pop PK model will be used to evaluate the relationship between orvepitant exposure and clinical endpoints. The details of the analysis will be described in a Pop PK Data Analysis Plan (DAP). 11.8 Missing Data Summary statistic s will be based primarily on non -missing values. For hypothesis tests, estimates and confidence intervals, missing values for continuous efficacy endpoints analyzed via likelihood methods (e.g. repeated measures mixed models) will not be directly imputed a s they are handled within the analysis itself, under the assumption that the model specification is correct and that the data is missing at random. Sensitivity analyses may be conducted to check the robustness of the analysis results under alternative assu mptions with regards to missing data. Further details on the handling of missing values, including rules applied to incomplete questionnaires and any planned sensitivity analyses will be defined in the SAP. 12. END OF THE STUDY The e nd of the study will be def ined as the last subject ’s last visit. 13. ETHICS COMMITTEE REVIEW/INFORMED CONSENT 13.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and Relevant Authorities The final study protocol , the subject information and consent form and any other subject facing materials (e.g. questionnaires, advertisements) will be approved by an appropriately constituted IRB/IEC.

They will receive all information that is required by local regulations and ICH guidelines. 14. STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT 14.1 Protocol Amendments Once approved by the applicable Regulatory Authorities and IRBs /IECs , the protocol must not be amended without approval by NeRRe. Unless a n amendment is required to be implemented urgently in the interests of safety, or is deemed administrative by NeRRe, any amendments to the protocol must be authorized by the applicable Regulatory Authorities and IRB/IEC prior to implementation . 14.2 Monitoring In accordance with applicable regulations including GCP and NeRRe or delegated CRO’s Standard Operating Pr ocedures (SOP), approved clinical research monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with the site staff the protocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy regulatory, ethical, and NeRRe requirements. Whe n reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the eCRF will serve as the source document. A list of what is to be classed as ‘source documentation’ will be docum ented in the Study Monitoring Manual. NeRRe will monitor the study and site s to verify: • Data are authentic, accurate and complete • Safety and right of the subjects are being protected • IMP accountability • SAE reporting • Study is conducted in accordance with th e currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements The investigator[s]/institution[s] will permit study -related monitoring, providing direct a ccess to source data/documents."
53,page_53,"Product: CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: VOLCANO -2 ORVEPITANT NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd Protocol No.: 5.0 FINAL Page 54 of 65 21-February -2018 14.3 Quality Assurance To ens ure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, the investigator[s]/institution[s] will permit study -related audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection[s], providing direct a ccess to source data/documents. 14.4 Data Recording 14.4.1 Data to be Considered as Source Data An eCRF will be used to capture subject data into a secure, validated database . Access to enter data in the eCRF will be limited to delegated and trained investigator site staff only. ACM, PK and safety laboratory data will be transferred electronically into the database periodically during the study. Source data may be defined as information from an original record or certified copy of the original record containing patient information for use in the trial. The information ma y include, but is not limited, to clinical findings, observations, or other activities necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or certified copies) (ICH E2A Guideline ). Examples of source data include subject identification and randomization identification. 14.5 Confidentiality The Investigator must assure that the subjects ’ anonymity will be maintained. On all study documentation, with the exception of the consent form and subject ID logs, subjects will only be identified by their unique identification code and initials and will not be referred to by name. Study data will be handled with utmost discretion within the context of physician’s confidentiality. On the eCRFs and oth er study specific documents, subjects are not identified by their names, but by a unique subject number. Names of participating subject s and data generated as a result of this study will not be passed on to unauthorized persons. The Investigator must assur e that the subjects are properly anonymized throughout the study. On all study documentation which is supposed to leave the site (i.e., to be transmitted to NeRRe, CRO or third parties), subjects will only be identified by their unique identification code and will not be referred to by name. NeRRe may transfer some data collected during the study to a different company or regulatory authority outside of the US or EU for the purpose of processing, review, analysis or storage. Whenever the subject’s personal data is transferred, it will be kept confidential and secure, and will used only for the purpose for which it was collected. Safety analysis samples collected during the study will be analyzed at a central laboratory . Samples will be identified by the subj ects’ unique identification code. All safety samples will be destroyed after the assays have been completed."

Samples will be identified by the subjec ts’ unique identification code. Following completion of the analysis, all samples will be destroyed. 14.6 Retention of Study Data Following closure of the study, the Investigator must maintain all site study records, except for those required by local regulatio ns to be maintained by someone else, in a safe and secure location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed (e.g., audit or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction wi th assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by local laws/ regulations or institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., microfiche, scanned, electronic); howev er, caution needs to be exercised before such action is taken. The Investigator must assure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the originals, and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the Investigator must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an acceptable quality control process exists for making these reproductions. NeRRe will inform the Investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the study, as dictated by any institutional requirements or local laws or regulations , or NeRRe , or delegated CRO’s SOPs; otherwise, the retention period will default to 15 years. The Investigator must notify NeRRe of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility or transfer of ow nership of the records in the event the Investigator leaves the site. The Investigator may not dispose of any records without prior approval from NeRRe . 14.7 Communication and Publication of Results Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an Inves tigator signatory will be identified for the approval of the clinical study report ( CSR ). The Investigator will be provided appropriate access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the opportunity to review the complete study r esults at NeRRe or another mutually agreeable location. The original eCRFs and all data generated during the study under this protocol will become the property of the Sponsor. Upon completion of the CSR, NeRRe will ensure public disclosure of the clinical trial research results according to the NeRRe ’s SOP and provide the Investigator with the full summary of the study results. The Investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as appropriate."

These new sectionsinclude nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB);acute bronchitis; nonbronchiectatic suppurative air-way diseases; cough due to aspiration secondary tooral/pharyngeal dysphagia; environmental/occupa-tional causes of cough; tuberculosis (TB) and otherinfections; cough in the dialysis patient; uncommoncauses of cough; unexplained cough, previously re-ferred to as idiopathic cough; an empiric integrativeapproach to the management of cough; assessingcough severity and efficacy of therapy in clinicalresearch; potential future therapies; and future di-rections for research.

The com- mittee unanimously recommends that the term upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) be used in preference topostnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) when discussing cough that is associated with upper airway conditionsbecause it is unclear whether the mechanism of coughis postnasal drip, direct irritation, or inflammation ofthe cough receptors in the upper airway. The commit-tee also recommends using the term unexplained cough rather than idiopathic cough because it is likely that more than one unknown cause of chronic cough will bediscovered. The term idiopathic implies that one is dealing with only one disease. For managing adult patients with cough, the com- mittee recommends an empiric, integrative diagnos-tic approach, which is presented in the sectionentitled “An Empiric Integrative Approach to theManagement of Cough”. 3Guidelines for managing acute, subacute, and chronic cough are presented inalgorithmic form (Fig 1–3). Guidelines with algo-rithms for evaluating chronic cough in pediatricpatients /H1102115 years of age are presented in the section entitled “Guidelines for Evaluating ChronicCough in Pediatrics” 2,4[Fig 4, 5]. For a full discus- sion on how to use the algorithms, please refer tothese sections.

Methodology and Grading of the Evidence for the Diagnosis and Management of Cough 5 •The recommendations were graded, by consensusby the panel, using the American College of ChestPhysicians Health and Science Policy GradingSystem, which is based on the following two compo-nents: quality of evidence; and the net benefit of thediagnostic and therapeutic procedure. •The quality of evidence is rated according to thestudy design and strength of other methodologiesused in the included studies. •The net benefit of the recommendations is basedon the estimated benefit to the specific patientpopulation described in each recommendationand not for an individual patient. Usually, the netbenefit is a clinical benefit to the population ofpatients defined in the first phrase of the recom-mendation, but, in recommendations for futureresearch or other nonclinical recommendations, itmay be a societal benefit. •Both the quality of evidence and the net benefitcomponents are listed after each recommenda-tion; their interaction defines the strength of therecommendations. •The recommendations scale is as follows: A,strong; B, moderate; C, weak; D, negative; I,inconclusive (no recommendation possible); E/A, Figure 1.

In patients with cough, the starting point is the medical history and physical examination.Although the timing and characteristics of thecough are of little diagnostic value, the medicalhistory is important to determine whether thepatient is receiving an ACE inhibitor, is asmoker, or has evidence of a serious life-threat-ening or systemic disease. Level of evidence, expert opinion; benefit, substantial; grade of recom-mendation, E/A 2. In patients with an acute cough, first de- termine whether the acute cough is a reflectionof a serious illness such as pneumonia or pul-monary embolism, or, as is usually the case, amanifestation of a non-life-threatening diseasesuch as a respiratory tract infection ( eg, com- mon cold or lower respiratory tract infection),an exacerbation of a preexisting condition ( eg, COPD, UACS, asthma, or bronchiectasis), or anenvironmental or occupational exposure tosome noxious or irritating agent ( eg, allergic or irritant-induced rhinitis).

90,page_90,Asthma/eosinophic bronchitis Key points NCough may be the only manifestation of these syndromes.NNo currently available tests of airway function can reliably exclude a corticosteroid responsive cough. Recommendation NCough is unlikely to be due to eosinophilic airway inflammation if there is no response to a two week oral steroid trial. (Audit) Drugs Recommendation NNo patient with a troublesome cough should continue on ACE inhibitors. EnvironmentKey point NOne of the commonest causes of persistent cough is smoking and appears to be dose related. Recommendation NSmoking cessation should be encouraged as it is accompanied by significant remission in cough symptoms. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)Key points NFailure to consider GORD as a cause for cough is a common reason for treatment failure.NReflux associated cough may occur in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Recommendations NIntensive acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors and alginates should be undertaken for a minimum of 3 months. (Audit)NAntireflux therapy may be effective in treating cough in carefully selected cases. Upper airway pathology Key points NRhinosinusitis is commonly associated with chronic cough .NThere is an association between upper airway disease and cough but a poor association between the various symptoms and cough.NThere is disparity in the reported efficacy of antihistamines. Recommendations NIn the presence of prominent upper airway symptoms a trial of topical corticosteroid is recommended. Undiagnosed or idiopathic cough Key points NChronic cough should only be considered idiopathic following thorough assessment at a specialist cough clinic.NThe clinical history of reflux cough is often present in patients with idiopathic cough.NA typical lymphocytic airways inflammation is seen in idiopathic cough. Treatment of cough due to other common respiratory diseases Key point NCough can be a debilitating symptom in many common acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Recommendation NSuppression may be relatively contraindicated especially when cough clearance is important. Specialist cough clinicsKey points NA systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment remains the most effective way to manage chronic cough.NImportant questions remain as to the complexity and cost effectiveness of existing diagnostic algorithms.BTS recommendations for cough management in adults i3 www.thoraxjnl.com
91,page_91,"Recommendations NNo single existing diagnostic protocol can be recommended.NA combination of selected diagnostic testing and empirical trials of treatment is likely to be most cost effective.NReferral to a specialist cough clinic should be encouraged and a directory of specialist centres should be made available. Specialist investigations Key point NDebate remains as to the interpretation and clinical utility of more complex investigations. Bronchial provocation testingRecommendations NBronchial provocation testing should be performed in patients without a clinically obvious aetiology referred to a respiratory physician with chronic cough and normal spirometry.NA negative test excludes asthma but does not rule out a steroid responsive cough. Oesophageal studies Recommendations NEmpirical treatment should be offered to patients with cough and typical reflux symptoms before oesophageal testing .NNo current test of oesophageal function predicts treatment response. Upper airway investigationsRecommendations NExamination of ear, nose and throat should be performed in preference to sinus imaging in patients suspected of having rhinosinusitis, but with persisting cough despite an adequate trial of treatment directed at the upper airway.NSpecialist cough clinics should have access to fibreoptic laryngoscopy, preferably within the clinic setting. Cough provocation testing Recommendations NThere is no current evidence to support the routine use of cough challenge testing in the management of chronic cough.NFor research purposes, standardisation of methodology is required and accurate data on the distribution of cough responsiveness within the population are needed. Measurement and monitoring of cough Recommendations NAccurate measurement of cough helps determine cough severity, assess treatment efficacy, and may provide diagnostic information.NAmbulatory cough recording currently offers most promise in the objective assessment of cough, although furthertechnical refinement is required if it is to be broadly accessible to physicians. Assessing airway inflammation Recommendations NThe demonstration of sputum eosinophilia has important treatment implications and should be available in cough clinics.NInduced sputum should be requested after exclusion of the other common causes.NThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of exhaled breath measurements in the clinical evaluation of chronic cough. Potential new treatments for cough Key point NThere are no effective treatments controlling the cough response per se with an acceptable therapeutic ratio. Recommendation NThere is a need for multicentre clinical trials on new drugs carried out across specialist centres using objective methods of cough counting as well as subjective quality of life and symptom indexes.i4 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
92,page_92,"1.5 Updating of recommendations It is envisaged that the Executive Committee of the Guideline Group will meet every two years to review any new published evidence obtained from a subsequent structured literature search. An additional purpose of these update meetings will be to formulate key clinical and research priorities. 1.6 Audit A number of quality indicators were chosen from recom mendations made in this document against which the quality of management of cough could be measured. The key indicators were: NChest radiography and spirometry are mandatory in the evaluation of chronic cough.NThe severity of the cough should be quantified.NTreatment effects should be formally quantified.NIntensive acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors should be undertaken for a minimum of 2 months.NDecision to continue steroids made on the basis of a2 week trial of oral corticosteroids. 2. DEFINITIONS 2.1. CoughDebate exists as to the most appropriate clinical definition of a cough event. 8For the purposes of this document, the members of the Task Force agreed the following definition:‘‘Cough is a forced expulsive manoeuvre, usually against a closed glottis and which is associated with a characteristic sound .’’ 2.2 Acute and chronic cough Recommendations NAcute cough is defined as one lasting less than 3 weeks.NChronic cough is defined as one lasting more than8 weeks. Classification of cough based on symptom duration is somewhat arbitrary. A cough lasting less than 3 weeks is termed acute and one lasting longer than 8 weeks is defined aschronic . Acute cough is usually a result of a viral upper respiratory tract infection as almost all such coughs resolve within this time period. 9A post infective cough may, however, persist for a considerable period of time. An upperrespiratory tract infection (URTI) cough lingering for morethan 3 weeks is usually termed ‘‘post viral cough’’. The grey area between 3 and 8 weeks of cough is difficult to define aetiologically since all chronic cough will have started as an acute cough, but the clear diagnostic groups of chronic cough are diluted by those patients with post viral cough. 3. ACUTE COUGH 3.1 Epidemiology Key points NAcute cough is the commonest new presentation in primary care.NIt is most commonly associated with viral upper respira tory tract infection.NIn the absence of significant co morbidity, it is normallybenign and self limiting. NIt is one of the commonest symptoms associated withacute exacerbations and hospitalisations with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute cough is usually caused by a viral URTI but may arisefrom other aetiologies such as pneumonia or aspiration of a foreign body. The duration of a single episode of URTI associated cough varies but is rarely more than 2 weeks. Acut off of 2 months for chronic cough has been arbitrarily agreed in both American 10and European guidelines.6The economic impact of acute cough may be usefully thought ofin terms of a series of patient thresholds that trigger interventions such as the purchase of a cough medicine or consultation with a general practitioner (GP). 3.1.1 Incidence of URTI Symptomatic URTI occur at rates of 2 5 per adult person per year, with school children suffering 7 10 episodes per year.11 If one accepts the lowest rate of URTI of two episodes perperson per year, then this translates into a conservative estimate of an incidence of 120 million episodes of URTI per year in the UK (fig 1). 3.1.2 Incidence of acute cough Only a proportion of cases of URTI are associated with coughas a symptom. In naturally acquired URTI, cough was present in 40 50% of patients. 12 13This translates into an incidence of approximately 48 million cases of acute cough per year in theUK. The severity and duration of acute cough will vary widely but many will reach a threshold of severity that precipitates self medication. 3.1.3 Incidence of self medication The sale of non prescription liquid cough medicines grossed £96.5 millions in 2001 in the UK.14This sales figure is an underestimate of total sales as it is for sales from pharmacyand grocery outlets only, and does not include sales from outlets such as supermarkets and convenience stores. Withcough medicines averaging £3 4 per unit, this represents at least 24 million episodes per year in the UK. 3.1.4 Consultations with a general practitioner Morbidity statistics from general practice for the period 1991 2 reported that more people consulted for respiratory illnesses (31%) than for any other single disease category.15With 20% of patients consulting for URTI, this translates into 12 millionconsultations per year, with acute cough representing ‘‘the largest single cause of consultation in primary care’’. 16 3.1.5 Hospital admissions In normal subjects acute cough associated with URTI is not usually a cause of hospital admission. However, in patients with co morbidity such as asthma11and COPD,17viral URTI is the commonest cause of admission. Cough is a commonsymptom in this group of patients as well as those admitted URTIAcute coughSelf medicationGP consultationHospitalisation 120 million48 million24 million12? Figure 1 Pyramid of incidence of acute cough. The base represents the population with an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), some of whom will suffer from acute cough. Level 2 represents all those suffering from acute cough. Level 3 is the proportion of those suffering from acutecough who reach the threshold of severity of cough to trigger thepurchase of a cough medicine. Level 4 is the proportion of thosesuffering from acute cough who reach the threshold of severity of coughto trigger a GP consultation. Level 5 is the proportion of those sufferingfrom acute cough who are admitted to hospital.

96,page_96,"(c) Characteristics of the cough NInterpretation of the diagnostic characteristics of the cough should be done with caution. Published evidence One study has suggested that the character and timing of a cough are not diagnostically helpful.53However, others have suggested a characteristic pattern in reflux cough.54 Important areas of inquiry may establish that the cough is associated with frequent throat clearing or the sensation ofpost nasal drip, occurs mainly at night or after meals, or is made worse with exercise or cold air. However, the symptoms of post nasal drip in a patient may reflect only coexistent rhinitis and the absence of dyspepsia does not rule out reflux as the cause of cough. In one study the predictive values for cough characteristics and associated symptoms were calcu lated. 55 A cough with a ‘‘honking’’ or ‘‘barking’’ quality and which disappears with sleep has been suggested as typical of a psychogenic or habit cough. Such characteristics have beenfrequently reported in the paediatric literature and may represent a tic cough. 56 Consensus would suggest the following areas should be covered in the history in relation to the cough. It may be easier to ask the patients to complete a history questionnaire around which to structure the consultation (see Appendix 3 for suggested questionnaire framework). (i) Onset NDid coughing begin gradually or suddenly? Published evidence Cough of sudden onset may be clinically associated with foreign body aspiration. (ii) Duration NWhen did the cough start? How long have you had yourcough? Published evidence There is no evidence linking the duration of cough to a particular association. (iii) Relation to infection NDid coughing begin after an initial upper respiratory tract infection for example, a cold or sore throat? Published evidence Although patients commonly describe their persistent coughas starting after an infection, there are no data specifically linking ongoing viral infection to persistent cough. Viral infection enhances the cough reflex sensitivity 57and may make subclinical bronchial hyperresponsiveness or refluxclinically apparent. (iv) Sputum NIs the cough dry/productive?NSignificant sputum production suggests primary pulmonary pathology Published evidence Numerous studies link chronic cough and sputum production. In a cross sectional study in 18 000 Italian adults there was a 11.9% prevalence of cough and phlegm for a minimum of 3 months per year. 58Primary pulmonary disease is morelikely in patients attending a specialist cough clinic with a productive cough. (v) Diurnal variation in cough NPatients cough less at night.NA cough which abates overnight may be due to reflux (closure of the lower oesophageal sphincter).NAsthma, infection, or heart failure can cause coughingwhich wakes patients. Published evidence Sleep is known to suppress the cough reflex. In a series of patients with lung disease and nocturnal cough, spontaneouscough was almost abolished during sleep stages 3 and 4. 59 In an observational study in coughers, asthmatics and non coughers, ambulatory recordings have shown a marked reduction in cough overnight.60 (vi) Severe coughing spasms/paroxysms NSevere coughing paroxysms may be associated with syncope.NThe Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) stipu lates that those at risk of syncope should not be driving. Published evidence www.dvla.gov.uk (vii) Incontinence NWomen with cough are often troubled by stress incon tinence and this may be one of their major concerns. Published evidence In a questionnaire survey 55% of women reported urinaryincontinence in association with chronic cough. 54 (viii) Origin of sensation NIt is unlikely to be of diagnostic value to enquire where the sensation that leads to cough arises.NWhatever the aetiology, the irritation leading to cough is usually localised to the throat or upper chest. Published evidence The site where cough sensations arise in the thorax tends to be poorly localised. One case study reported cough and tickly throat occurring during ventricular pacing.61 62These C fibre sensations can be reproduced by systemic injections in boththe throat and chest. (ix) Cough triggers and aggravants NPersistent cough may be perpetuated because the coughreflex is abnormally sensitive. NA sensitised cough reflex is suggested if there is triggeringof cough with change in air temperature, scent, sprays, aerosols, exercise. Published evidence Cough reflex sensitivity may vary from time to time,particularly when intercurrent respiratory infection occurs. 57 Other known cough aggravants have been shown to alter thesensitivity of the cough reflex for example, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors 63and diseases includ ing asthma and gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).55 The effect of air temperature, scent, sprays, aerosols, and exercise has not been studied.BTS recommendations for cough management in adults i9 www.thoraxjnl.com"
97,page_97,"(x) Posture NReflux is known to be related to posture, e.g. bending or lying down. However, there is no evidence demonstrating a connection between posture and reflux related cough. Published evidence See Bonnet et al.64 (xi) Food NCough on eating and postprandially may indicate refluxcough. Published evidence Maximum stimulation for transient opening of the loweroesophageal sphincter is gastric distention which typically occurs 10 minutes postprandially. 65In a retrospective review of patients with proven reflux cough, three quarters hadcough with food or postprandial cough. 66 (xii) Cough on phonation NCough on phonation such as talking on the telephone, laughing, or singing may indicate reflux because of lack of diaphragmatic closure of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS). Published evidence A retrospective review again showed that 90% of patientswith reflux cough associated the symptom with phonation. 66 (d) Medications NNote all medications, particularly ACE inhibitors, andconsider which might be causing or potentiating the cough. The cough may take some months to settle following withdrawal of ACE inhibitors. Published evidence Cough associated with ACE inhibitors was first reported withcaptopril in 1985. 67It is a class effect, but the reported incidence variable may be as high as 16%. It is not doserelated and time to onset is variable, occurring within hours or more than a year after start of treatment. 68Studies identifying predisposing factors for the development of cough associated with ACE inhibitors have been largely inconclu sive. A recent large retrospective cohort study has identified smoking, East Asian ethnicity, and previous ACE inhibitor associated cough as risk factors.69ACE inhibitors are associated with an increased sensitivity of the cough reflex,so they may aggravate cough due to other causes. 63The cough invariably resolves on cessation of the drug. The median timeto resolution is 26 days although it may be longer (up to 40 weeks) in some patients. 68 70Most patients with ACE inhibitor associated cough can tolerate angiotensin IIreceptor blockers. 71 There are only occasional reports of cough as a troublesome side effect of other drug treatments. One case report has attributed chronic cough to antiretroviral therapy in an HIV positive woman.72Dry cough has also been reported as a rare complication of interferon alpha treatment in chronic viralgastroenteritis. 73 (e) Occupation/hobbies/pets NA thorough occupational history should be sought as workplace sensitisers can lead to chronic cough. The same is true of dust/chemical exposure at home.Published evidence Numerous studies and case reports provide accounts ofpersistent cough as a presenting feature of occupational sensitisation of the airways. 74Significant excess cough was reported in workers exposed to hot acidic conditions in abottle factory 75and in workers exposed to hot chilli peppers.76 (f) Past medical history and the association of cough with underlying disease (i) Respiratory disease NChronic cough is a common association of respiratory diseases and a thorough respiratory history should be sought. Persistent cough is commonly associated with asthma including eosinophilic bronchitis and upper airway disease. These will be detailed in subsequent sections of this document. Common respiratory diseases which are readily appreciated as being associated with chronic cough will be addressed below. (ii) COPD Although patients with COPD commonly report cough, it is usually in association with production of phlegm and breathlessness. Published evidence Smokers with persistent cough may be at risk of developingCOPD (GOLD). 77A productive cough in patients with established airflow obstruction is predictive of lung functiondecline. (iii) Bronchiectasis Although usually associated with sputum production, ‘‘dry’’ bronchiectasis can cause persistent cough and a history of past respiratory insult as a potential trigger should be sought. Published evidence Patients with productive cough may have the same range ofaetiologies as those with dry cough. The prevalence of bronchiectasis among patients attending specialist cough clinics is low, estimated at 4%. 78 (iv) Lung cancer Cough may arise as a consequence of the cancer itself, the treatment, or other co existent disease. Published evidence Cough is the fourth commonest presenting feature of lung cancer.79Persistent cough contributes significantly to impaired quality of life. In one study, 39% of patients withinoperable non small cell lung cancer scored cough promi nently. 80 (v) Pertussis infection NPersistent pertussis infection can lead to chronic cough. Published evidence An increasing body of circumstantial evidence implicates pertussis as a cause of persistent cough. In a series of 180 prospective cases of chronic cough, 10% had nasal swabs positive for Bordetella .81In a case control study of 201 patients with cough lasting up to 3 months, a significant increase inpositive serology was reported for Bordetella in the patient group. 82 (vi) Atopic disease NThere is an increase in respiratory symptoms in atopic individuals.i10 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
98,page_98,"Published evidence In a longitudinal comparative study in 620 adults, atopy was associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sympto matic patients.83In Japan a separate syndrome of atopic cough is described,84although whether this is indeed a separate syndrome has been called into doubt.85 (vii) Cardiovascular disease NPatients with heart disease can develop chronic cough and are at risk of myocardial infarction. Published evidence Analysis of the Framingham Heart Study data identified both chronic non productive cough and productive cough as independent risk factors for myocardial infarction.86 (viii) Organ-specific autoimmune disease NAn association between chronic cough and organ specific autoimmunity has been reported. Published evidence An association between organ specific autoimmune dis ease in particular thyroid disease has been reported.87In a case control study, there was more autoimmune diseaseand a higher proportion of organ specific autoantibodies in patients with cough than in age and sex matched controls. 87 (f) Family history NChronic cough may be familial, suggesting either aninherited anatomical abnormality or neurological condi tion. Published evidence A kinship of autonomic sensory neuropathy prevalence with reflux cough (possibly vagal) followed by peripheral sensory neuropathy was recently described.88 4.3.2 Physical examination Recommendation NPhysical examination should concentrate on the afferent sites of the vagus nerve most commonly associated with the irritation leading to chronic cough. The physical examination of the patient with chronic cough may demonstrate clinical signs of obstructive lung disease, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, or cardiac failure. However, more often the examination reveals less specific findings. Physical examination should concentrate on the afferent sites identified as most commonly associated with chronic cough. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) examination may reveal evidence of nasal obstruction due to inflamed turbinates or the presence of polyps. The appearance of secretions draining in the posterior pharynx may be apparent. A ‘‘cobblestone’’ appearance of the oropharyngeal mucosa has been suggested but is an uncommon finding in the routine examination of patients with chronic cough.89Tonsillar enlargement is seen in some patients with chronic cough. Tonsillectomy can improve cough reflex sensitivity.90 Evidence of irritation of the larynx and pharynx on indirect laryngoscopy could suggest proximal gastro oesophageal reflux.91 Examination of the chest is not useful in differentiating reversible airflow obstruction from fixed or partially rever sible airflow limitation. Likewise, there are no features which easily distinguish cough variant asthma. Asking the patientto inhale may trigger paroxysms of coughing. Chest auscultation may reveal wheezes and a prolonged expiratory phase on auscultation. Coarse crackles may be a prominent finding on examination of a patient with bronchiectasis, while widespread fine late inspiratory crackles are typical of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. The presence of finger clubbing in a smoker together with evidence of a pleural effusion or lobar collapse on examina tion almost certainly points to a diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma. In patients with a family history of chronic cough, neurological examination of the legs should be performed to look for signs of familial neuropathy.88 4.3.3 Baseline investigations: primary care Cough is one of the most common symptoms of patientspresenting to primary care, yet there are few studies investigating its management. One descriptive study found that 46% of patients presenting with a cough of more than 2 weeks’ duration (28% of whom had a cough of more than 3 months’ duration) had a diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 92This contrasts markedly with studies in secondary care and specialist cough clinics inwhich gastro oesophageal reflux, cough predominant asthma, and rhinitis are the main causes. A number of reviews outlining the diagnosis and management of chronic cough in primary care have been published. 93 95However, the evidence for these is predominately based on descriptive cohort studies and case studies/clinical experience from specialist centres. (a) Chest radiography Recommendations NA chest radiograph should be undertaken in all patients with chronic cough and those with acute cough demon strating atypical symptoms (see table 2). Published evidence There are numerous causes of chronic cough, many of whichcan be diagnosed from abnormalities on the chest radio graph. A study from a general respiratory clinic found that 31% of chest radiographs requested for the diagnosis of persistent cough were abnormal or yielded a diagnosis. 2 Studies using algorithms for the diagnosis of chronic coughhave been validated in patients with normal chest radio graphs. 55 78 96 100If the patient has an abnormality on the chest radiograph that would account for his/her symptoms, thisshould be investigated appropriately and use of a diagnostic algorithm for chronic cough is not appropriate. (b) Assessment of pulmonary function Recommendation NSpirometry should be performed in all patients with chronic cough.NPatients with normal spirometry and bronchodilator response in whom the diagnoses of cough predominant asthma or eosinophilic bronchitis are being considered should be offered a therapeutic trial of prednisolone. Published evidence Spirometry is helpful in identifying cough caused by chronicairways obstruction. 101If an obstructive pattern is identified on spirometry, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) should be measured before and after inhalation of a short acting b2agonist (for example, salbutamol 400 mg by metered dose inhaler and spacer or 2.5 mg by nebuliser).102NormalBTS recommendations for cough management in adults i11 www.thoraxjnl.com"
99,page_99,"spirometry does not exclude asthma as a cause of chronic cough. In addition, many patients with asthma may not have spirometric reversibility sufficient to be defined as having asthma for the purpose of clinical studies.103 Single peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and, in particular, PEF to assess bronchodilator response are not as accurate as FEV 1in diagnosing airflow obstruction as a cause of cough in primary care and should be avoided.104The role of serial PEF has not been studied in patients with persistent cough. Patients with ‘‘cough variant’’ or ‘‘cough predomi nant’’ asthma may not exhibit airways obstruction.99 105In addition, patients with cough due to eosinophilic bronchitis exhibit neither bronchial obstruction nor bronchial hyperre sponsiveness.106Patients in whom the diagnosis is in doubt should be referred to a specialist centre.107 4.3.4 Baseline investigations: secondary care Studies from general respiratory clinics have reported poor diagnostic and treatment outcomes compared with specialist cough clinics that use comprehensive management algo rithms.2 108 110Extrapulmonary causes, particularly gastro oesophageal reflux, are frequently overlooked. The investigation of these conditions is dealt with under the specialist clinic section. (a) Bronchoscopy Recommendation NBronchoscopy should be undertaken in all patients in whom inhalation of a foreign body is suspected.NBronchoscopy may be useful in patients in whom othermore targeted investigations are normal. Published evidence Bronchoscopy should be undertaken as an initial investiga tion in all patients suspected of having cough as a result of inhalation of a foreign body or aspiration. A retrospective study of 15 420 patients undergoing bronchoscopy without a history of inhalation of a foreign body, 91% of whom had a persistent cough and 63% of whom had normal chest radiographs, found that a foreign body was identified in only 0.3%.111 Descriptive studies have shown its diagnostic yield as part of a diagnostic algorithm for chronic cough is low (1 6%),78 98 100 112although in carefully selected cases the yield may be higher.113 114In addition, bronchoscopy allows inspection of the larynx for signs of chronic inflammationthat may be a result of gastro oesophageal reflux. 91 115 (b) High resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scanning of the thorax Recommendation NHigh resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scanning may be of use in patients with persistent atypical cough in whom other more targeted investigations are normal. Published evidence The role of HRCT scanning of the thorax in the diagnosis of cough has not been properly evaluated. In a prospective study of patients with chronic cough and normal radiographs who had undergone a complex diagnostic protocol, HRCT scanning was claimed to be diagnostic in 24% of patients; however, multiple diagnoses were frequently reported in this study. 100In carefully selected patients the diagnostic rate may be higher.116 117HRCT scanning is more sensitive and specific than plain chest radiography in diagnosing bronchiectasis and diffuse pulmonary diseases that may present withchronic cough. Studies have shown abnormalities on HRCT scans in up to 42% of patients thought to have had a normal chest radiograph.118 120 4.4 Diganosis and management of specific cough syndromes 4.4.1 Cough variant asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis (a) Definition An isolated cough in a patient without objective evidence of asthma that is, variable airflow obstruction and evidence ofeosinophilic inflammation. In cough variant asthma bron chial hyperresponsiveness is present, whereas in eosinophilic bronchitis it is absent. These syndromes are a common cause of isolated cough, accounting for around 30% of cough referrals to cough clinics. 50 121Clinical indicators of cough variant asthma include cough occurring nocturnally, after exercise, or afterallergen exposure, although how reliable these features are is unclear. Some studies have highlighted overdiagnosis of cough variant asthma in children. 122 (b) Diagnosis of cough variant asthma Recommendations Current methodology for measurement of airway hyperre sponsiveness is well standardised and widely accepted. A negative test excludes asthma but does not rule out a steroid responsive cough. Published evidence This requires the demonstration of variable airflow obstruction and/or airway hyperresponsiveness. In patients with normal or near normal spirometric values (that is, FEV 1 .70% predicted), tests of airway responsiveness are more sensitive and specific than bronchodilator reversibility studies and PEF records.107 123 (c) Asthma syndromes and cough Key points NThe presence of non asthmatic corticosteroid responsive cough syndromes emphasises the importance of assess ment of airway inflammation or, if this is not available, a trial of corticosteroids in all patients with chronic cough, irrespective of the results of tests of variable airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness.NThe test box provides clear guidance on interpretation ofthe results of treatment trials. NThe type of corticosteroid used in a trial and the durationof treatment is unclear; expert opinion is that cough is unlikely to be due to eosinophilic airway inflammation ifthere is no response to treatment with prednisolone 30 mg/day for 2 weeks. NIn patients with apparently corticosteroid resistant coughvariant asthma, an alternative diagnosis should be considered. Published evidence Eosinophilic bronchitis is a common cause of cough.124It presents as an isolated chronic cough and is characterised byeosinophilic airway inflammation associated with increasedTh2 cytokine expression 125in the absence of airway hyperre sponsiveness or variable airflow obstruction. It is unclearwhether eosinophilic bronchitis represents a distinct clinical entity. Some patients with cough and asthma have non eosinophilic airway inflammation. 126This pattern of airway inflammation has been associated with corticosteroidi12 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
100,page_100,"resistance;126 127theoretically it might be associated with a bronchodilator responsive but corticosteroid resistant cough. The prevalence of non eosinophilic asthma in patients presenting with cough variant asthma is unclear. (d) Management Recommendation NManagement of cough variant asthma should follow national guidelines, except at step 3 where there is no evidence for use of a long acting bagonist.NAt step 3, evidence exists for the use of leukotriene receptor antagonists. Eosinophilic bronchitis and atopic cough respond to inhaled corticosteroids.NThere is insufficient evidence to give guidance on dose,preparation, and duration of inhaled corticosteroid ther apy but use of the BTS asthma guidelines is recommended. NThere is some evidence to support the role of antihistamines and anti leukotrienes in cough due to asthma and its variants, but larger scale studies are required. Published evidence Cough variant asthma responds to treatment with corticosteroids. 128Leukotriene receptor antagonists have also been reported to be effective in reducing cough in this condition.129 High dose antihistamines have been shown to dramatically reduce cough in seasonal asthma130but have not been specifically investigated in cough variant asthma. Eosinophilic bronchitis is characteristically resistant to treatment with inhaled bronchodilators but responds to inhaled steroids.131 Longitudinal studies have shown that up to one third of patients who present with cough variant asthma later develop the typical wheezing of classical asthma.84 132 133In contrast, the development of wheezing or airway hyperresponsiveness is extremely uncommon in eosinophilic bronchitis. 134 4.4.2 Gastro oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) (a) Background Chronic cough due to gastro oesophageal disorders has been reported in prospective studies in 5 41% of cases.97 100 110 Confusion between different diagnostic criteria, symptomsof dyspepsia, extra oesophageal reflux, and pH monitoring make quantification of cough due to GORD difficult. Patients with GORD have an increased cough reflex sensitivity which improves with antireflux therapy.135 137 GORD related cough may be induced by microaspirationof gastric content into the larynx and tracheobronchial tree. 138 140A second proposed mechanism is through a vagally mediated oesophageal reflex stimulated by acid or non acid volume reflux.141 143Oesophageal motor dysfunction144 148and reduced oesophageal clearance149but not delayed gastric emptying150can contribute to both of these mechanisms. The presence of a self perpetuating cough reflux cycle has also been suggested.143 151 (b) Does antireflux therapy improve cough associated with GORD ? Recommendations NProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole 20 40 mg twice daily or equivalent taken before meals for at least 8 weeks.NProkinetic agents such as metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily may be required in a proportion of patients.NElimination of medications that potentially can worsen GORD should be considered. Published evidence A number of uncontrolled studies have reported that antireflux therapy produces an improvement in chronic reflux cough in 75 100% of cases.98 99 135In contrast, randomised controlled trials suggest that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) twice daily improve cough in 36 57% of patients with gastro oesophageal reflux related cough when given for 8 weeks.152 153Ranitidine 300 mg daily for 2 weeks improved cough in 54% of patients.154However, PPIs may be superior to H 2antagonists.99 155Twice daily dosing and dosing before meals may be more appropriate.156 157Full acid suppression may only be achieved by a combination of twice daily PPIs and nocturnal H 2antagonists.158A trial of treatment should be at least 8 weeks.96 98 152 153 159Prokinetic agents may be helpful in a proportion of patients.78 96 98 160 Elimination of medications potentially worsening reflux(bisphosphonates, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, theo phylline, progesterones) may also help. 160 The GABA agonist baclofen increases lower oesophageal tone and decreases lower oesophageal opening and, in an open study, decreased the incidence of GORD related cough resistant to other treatment.161A non specific effect on the cough reflex has also been demonstrated.162 (c) What is the role of antireflux surgery ? Recommendation NAntireflux surgery may be effective in treating cough in carefully selected cases. Published evidence Some patients with GORD related cough may benefit fromsurgical intervention such as fundoplication. 160 163 164 However, the timing and indications for surgery remainundefined. Prior to surgery a careful evaluation should be undertaken including exclusion of other causes of cough, oesophageal ambulatory 24 hour pH measurement (measur ing acid and alkaline reflux and the temporal association between cough and reflux events), oesophageal manometry, barium meal, gastric emptying studies, Bernstein acid infusion tests, trial of PPI treatment, and elimination of medications potentially worsening reflux. 160 164 165Abnormal oesophageal motility may be associated with a less satisfac tory outcome following surgery.145 4.4.3 Upper airway disease and cough (a) Definition Upper airway disease causes a cough commonly accompanied by nasal stuffiness, sinusitis, and the sensation of secretions draining into the posterior pharynx from the nose or sinuses, sometimes termed post nasal drip. Key points NThere is an association between upper airway disease and cough but a poor association between the various symptoms and cough.NThere is disparity in the reported efficacy of antihista mines.NIn the presence of prominent upper airway symptoms, a1 month trial of topical corticosteroid is recommended. Published evidence Post nasal drip syndrome (PNDS) has been reported in theAmerican literature as the most common cause of chronicBTS recommendations for cough management in adults i13 www.thoraxjnl.com"
101,page_101,"cough,97 99although this is not a universal finding.110A broad range of diseases of the upper airway are associated with post nasal drip and cough. In contrast, many patients with observable post nasal secretion do not cough. Whether PNDS is a distinct syndrome or merely a symptom has beendebated. 166 Symptoms89and clinical findings99are not reliable dis criminators in establishing post nasal drip upper airwaysdisease as a cause of cough. A successful response totreatment directed at the upper airway is one recommendeddiagnostic approach. 5 In the USA, recommended treatment involves a first line approach with a sedating antihistamine/decongestant combination. 5The first generation antihistamines recommended in this document are not available in the UK and there isconflicting evidence as to the efficacy of second generation(less sedating) antihistamines in the treatment of cough. 167 168 There have been no randomised controlled studies evaluatingthe role of topical steroids in chronic cough, although onerandomised placebo controlled trial has suggested that intranasal steroids given for 2 weeks are effective in the treatment of cough due to allergic rhinitis. 169Intranasal steroids appear to be ineffective in the treatment of commoncold symptoms including cough. 170A number of prospective studies suggest that topical nasal steroids given for 28 weeks to patients with cough and post nasal drip areeffective. 55 171 4.4.4 Undiagnosed or idiopathic chronic cough Key points NChronic cough should only be considered idiopathic following thorough assessment at a specialist cough clinic. NThe clinical history of reflux cough is often present inpatients with idiopathic cough. NA typical lymphocytic airways inflammation is seen inidiopathic cough. Published evidence In up to 20% of referrals to cough clinics55 87 172 173the cause of cough remains unclear after extensive investigations andtreatment trials. It has been suggested that these patientsrepresent a separate subgroup that should be labelled asidiopathic chronic cough. However, the clinical historyusually suggests non acid reflux and opinion is divided asto whether, in the absence of a definitive diagnostic ortherapeutic intervention, this represents the underlyingaetiology. If reflux is the underlying cause, then the airwaychanges seen in these patients represent the response to therefluxate. The alternative view that there is a separatesyndrome is discussed below. Patients with idiopathic cough are predominantly middle aged women who typically present with a long standingchronic dry cough which starts around the time of themenopause 87 172 174and often appears to follow a viral respiratory tract infection.173Organ specific autoimmune disease is present in up to 30%; autoimmune hypothyroidismis particularly common. 87 172Patients have objective evidence of abnormal airways with a heightened cough reflex,175 evidence of lymphocytic airway inflammation,87 174 176 177 increased numbers of mast cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,178 179and increased concentrations of tussive mediators such as histamine, prostaglandin (PG)D 2and PGE 2in induced sputum.180A plausible explanation for the develop ment of cough is amplification of previously subclinical airway inflammation at the time of the menopause.174 181 182In some cases this airway inflammation may be as a result ofaberrant homing of inflammatory cells to the lungs from a primary site of autoimmune inflammation.87 183 185 When evaluating a patient with idiopathic cough, it is important to recognise common pitfalls in managing chronic cough. Treatment for idiopathic chronic cough is disappoint ing and is largely limited to non specific antitussive therapy such as dextromethorphan and drugs with weak evidence of benefit such as baclofen and nebulised local anaesthetics (lidocaine, mepivicaine).186Low dose morphine has recently been shown to be helpful.187 4.4.5 Treatment of cough due to other common respiratory diseases Cough may be a prominent and debilitating symptom in a number of common respiratory diseases including lower respiratory tract infections (acute tracheobronchitis and pneumonia) COPD, lung cancer, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and bronchiectasis. Key points NCough can be a debilitating symptom in many common acute and chronic respiratory diseases.NSuppression may be relatively contraindicated, especiallywhen cough clearance is important. Published evidence In some conditions, in particular pneumonia and bronch iectasis, cough clearance is important and its suppression would be undesirable. The treatment of COPD is mainly directed at the control of symptoms and reduction of exacerbations, but no studies have evaluated the effective ness of a particular treatment on the cough itself .188The majority of lung cancer patients experience cough.189 Radiotherapy and both opioid and non opioid antitussives have been recommended (www.rcseng.ac.uk). Breathlessness is usually the most distressing symptom for patients with diffuse parenchymal lung disease. However, cough is frequently reported and can be debilitating;190only limited information is available on its treatment.191There are no randomised trials evaluating the benefit of treatment directed solely at cough. The treatment of diffuse parench ymal lung disease is outside the scope of this document and the reader is referred to the appropriate BTS guidelines onthis topic (www.brit thoracic.org.uk). 5. GUIDELINES FOR SPECIALIST COUGH CLINICS General recommendation NA systematic approach to diagnosis and treatment remains the most effective way to manage chronic cough. Important questions remain as to the complexity and cost effectiveness of existing diagnostic algorithms. 5.1 Introduction The evaluation and management of cough in specialist clinics has been widely reported in the literature. Patients attending specialist cough clinics generally comprise non smokers with a female preponderance of approximately 2:1.50They have often had a combination of baseline investigations and trialsof empirical treatment before referral. Studies in the primary literature from specialist cough clinics consist mainly of descriptive cohort studies andreports of clinical experience from centres with recognised expertise in cough evaluation and management. There have been no comparative studies of diagnostic methodology within or between specialty clinics. The recommendations for specialist clinics in this document will therefore comprise a review of the published evidence and the clinical experience of the Guideline Development Group.i14 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
102,page_102,"5.2 Do specialist cough clinics offer superior diagnostic/management outcomes ? Recommendations NAll clinics managing patients with chronic cough shouldensure management protocols consider pulmonary and extrapulmonary causes of cough. Published evidence Three studies have reported poor diagnostic and treatmentoutcomes in hospital based clinics where no established management algorithm for cough existed. 2 108 109The experi ence in such clinics markedly contrasts with the generallyhigh treatment success attributed to the specialist approach. 55 98 99 171 192In non specialist clinics extrapulmonary causes, particularly GORD, appears to be overlooked. 5.2.1 Comparison of specialist cough clinic protocols and outcomes Recommendation NSpecialist protocols should continue to evaluate pulmon ary and extrapulmonary causes for cough. Comparative studies of cough algorithms are required. No single existing diagnostic protocol can be recommended. A combination of therapeutic trials and targeted investiga tion is recommended when diagnostic doubt exists. Published evidence No direct comparisons of management protocols betweenspecialty clinics have been published. However, treatment success reported from specialist clinics ranges from 68% to 100%. 55 97 100 171 192Thus, despite the specialist evaluation of cough, a significant number of patients remain undiagnosed.It is not clear whether this variance reflects differences in referral population. 5.2.2 Cost effectiveness of diagnostic cough algorithms employed by specialist cough clinics Recommendation NA combination approach of selected diagnostic testing and empirical trials of treatment is likely to be most cost effective. Published evidence Algorithms for cough evaluation typically used in specialist clinics range from sequential trials of empirical treatment99to exhaustive diagnostic testing in all cases before any trial oftreatment. 100Only one study has explored the cost efficacy of such diagnostic cough algorithms.193The ‘‘investigate all then treat’’ approach was the most expensive, but with the shortest time to success compared with sequential trials of empirical treatment. 5.2.3 Is there a specific role for specialist cough clinics and when to refer ? Recommendation NReferral to a specialist cough clinic should be encouraged when there has been a failure of empirical treatment.NA directory of specialist centres should be made available. The specialist cough clinics from Europe,55 124 148 194Asia Pacific,84 192 195and the Americas98 100broadly report successful outcomes when comprehensive diagnostic protocols areimplemented. It would be desirable if all physicians were able to refer to a specialist cough clinic. Advice on how to set up a specialist cough clinic is given in Appendix 4. Appropriate referral criteria are: Nlack of availability of relevant diagnostic testing in primaryor secondary care; Nfailed trials of empirical treatment directed at asthma,GORD, and rhinosinusitis; Na history suggestive of serious cough complication such assyncope or chest wall trauma; Npatient preference; and Nrecruitment and participation in clinical trials of antitussive therapy. 5.3 Specialist investigations 5.3.1 Background Mandatory investigations in patients with chronic cough arechest radiography and spirometry. This section will deal withmore complex diagnostic tests where the interpretationremains open to debate, tests with largely research implica tions, and new innovations. 5.3.2 Bronchial provocation testing Key points NCurrent methodology for measurement of airway hyperre sponsiveness is standardised and widely accepted. Anegative test excludes asthma but does not rule out a steroid responsive cough. Recommendations NBronchial provocation testing should be performed in patients without a clinically obvious aetiology referred to arespiratory physician with chronic cough and normalspirometric values. Published evidence Most of the published accounts from specialist cough clinics have described their experience with bronchial provocation testing. The methods of measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness have been well standardised. In cough clinics,direct methods using methacholine or histamine are mostcommonly employed, 55 98 171although indirect methods have been described.196There is broad agreement between cough centres that a positive test is suggestive of asthma and shouldprompt treatment with inhaled steroids. 55 98 192The positive predictive value of this test ranges from 78% to 88%.55 98 While a negative test in a patient with cough rules out asthma, it does not eliminate a cough which may respond to steroids. A number of independent centres have reportedsteroid responsive cough in patients with no evidence ofairway hyperresponsiveness. 124 195 196 Extrathoracic airway responsiveness can be assessed by recording the maximal inspiratory flow/volume curve duringconventional bronchial challenge testing. Three groups haveused this method in the assessment of cough. 192 197 198There is no wide agreement as to the interpretation of this test. 5.3.3 Oesophageal testing Key point NFailure to consider GORD as a cause of cough is a common reason for treatment failure.BTS recommendations for cough management in adults i15 www.thoraxjnl.com"
103,page_103,"Recommendation NEmpirical treatment should be offered to patients with cough and typical reflux symptoms before oesophageal testing.N24 hour pH monitoring poorly predicts the therapeuticresponse but may be indicated in cases of diagnostic doubt and in patients thought to require fundoplication. Published evidence Objective investigation for GORD including barium stu dies,96 100upper gastrointestinal endoscopy,141and ambulatory oesophageal pH testing55 84 98 100 141 149have been described. Ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring is often regarded as the most sensitive and specific investigation for the diagnosis of GORD. A long term follow up study (median 30 months) has recently reported that less than 30% of patients with a‘‘positive’’ oesophageal pH study respond to antireflux therapy, and no features on pH monitoring accurately predict the response. 199One study has described a high prevalence of motility disorders in cough patients using oesophagealmanometry testing. 148As cough may arise as a consequence of non acid reflux, impedance testing may offer new insightsinto GORD related cough. 200No published reports of its application in cough currently exist. One study has advocatedthe use of empirical therapy in place of oesophageal testing. 152 5.3.4 Sinus imaging Key point NRhinosinusitis is commonly associated with chronic cough. Recommendation NExamination of ear, nose and throat should be performedin preference to sinus imaging in patients suspected of having rhinosinusitis but with persisting cough, despite an adequate trial of treatment directed at the upper airway. Published evidence Existing cough guidelines make few recommendations on the role of sinus imaging, preferring to observe the response to a course of specific treatment for nasal disease.10In selected patients (chronic cough and excess sputum production) asinus radiograph has a reported positive predictive value of 81% and negative predictive value of 95%. 78However, sinus radiographs are less sensitive than CT imaging of thesinuses. 201In a prospective study, routine CT sinus scanning was no better than an ENT examination in accuratelyidentifying upper airway disease as a cause of the cough. 55 5.3.5 Fibreoptic laryngoscopy Recommendation NSpecialist cough clinics should have access to fibreoptic laryngoscopy, preferably within the clinic setting. Published evidence Pernasal fibreoptic laryngoscopy provides a quick and simple method of viewing the laryngeal apparatus without sedation. The presence of laryngopharyngeal reflux may be determined by the characteristic changes associated with laryngeal inflammation and oedema.202These include pseudosulcus (subglottic oedema), obliteration of the laryngeal ventricle,erythema of the arytenoids, oedema of the posterior laryngeal wall, and laryngeal mucus.5.3.6 Cough provocation testing Recommendations NThere is no current evidence to support the routine use of cough challenge testing in the management of chronic cough.NFor research purposes, standardisation of methodology isrequired and accurate data on the distribution of cough responsiveness within the population are needed. Published evidence A variety of methods to measure cough reflex sensitivity havebeen described in the specialist cough clinic setting. These include tidal breathing challenge with low chloride solutions, and single breath challenges with capsaicin 55 171 203and citric acid.37Although safe and relatively simple to perform, a review of cough provocation testing has highlighted the need for consensus on methodology.204 Unlike bronchial hyperresponsiveness, cough challenge reveals a wide range of normal cough reflex sensitivity. Cough provocation testing therefore has no clear diagnostic applications and is likely to be confined to the clinical research of cough. 5.4 Measurement and monitoring of cough Key points NAccurate measurement of cough helps determine cough severity, assess treatment efficacy, and may provide diagnostic information.NAmbulatory cough recording currently offers most promise in the objective assessment of cough, although further technical refinement is required if it is to be broadly accessible to physicians. Published evidence A number of methods to measure cough frequency, intensity and severity have been described. Visual analogue scales and self report cough diary cards have been used but do not consistently correlate with objective methods such as ambulatory cough monitoring.205The use of a series of different ambulatory cough recording monitors has beenreported in both adult 60 206and paediatric207 209literature. Although some technical limitations currently exist, they offer the best objective means of recording cough. Differences in the characteristics of the cough sound and flow pattern between asthma, bronchitis, and interstitial fibrosis have been reported.210Recently, analysis of overnight cough recording determined differences in character and intensityof cough sounds between patients with cystic fibrosis and those with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. 211These observa tions open the diagnostic possibilities for cough monitoring. 5.5 Assessing airway inflammation 5.5.1 Induced sputum Recommendations NThe demonstration of sputum eosinophilia has important treatment implications and should be available in cough clinics.NInduced sputum should be requested after exclusion ofother common causes. Published evidence A number of independent groups have adapted conventionaldiagnostic strategies for chronic cough to include induced sputum. 84 124 195The demonstration of airway eosinophilia (.3% sputum eosinophil count) in patients without thei16 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
104,page_104,"functional abnormalities (particularly bronchial hyperreac tivity) associated with asthma has helped define eosinophilic bronchitis as a distinct cause for chronic cough. Eosinophilic bronchitis may account for up to 15% of cases of cough referred for specialist attention,124although debate remains as to whether eosinophilic bronchitis exists as a separate diagnostic entity.212 5.5.2 Exhaled breath Recommendations NThere is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of exhaled breath measurements in the clinical evaluation of chronic cough. Published evidence Exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels appear to be lower in non asthmatic coughers, allowing some differentiation from asthmatic patients with cough.213Exhaled NO may represent a simpler alternative to induced sputum tests but currently ithas no clear diagnostic role in the management of chronic cough. An increase in nitrite levels has been reported in exhaled breath condensate from asthmatic children with cough but not from non asthmatic children with cough. 214 Measurement of many different inflammatory molecules inbreath condensate, although currently a research procedure, may have a place in the future diagnosis of chronic cough. 5.6 Recommended diagnostic protocol (see Appendix 2, Parts 1 and 2) The evaluation and management of cough in an adult should comprise two phases. The approach suggested in phase 1 is applicable to all physicians (primary and secondary care) encountering the patient for the first time. Treatment failure should prompt phase 2 of the evaluation algorithm. The algorithm is available online only at http://www.thoraxjnl. com/supplemental. 6. POTENTIAL NEW TREATMENTS FOR COUGH Recommendations NThere is an urgent need for multicentre phase II trials on new drugs carried out across specialist centres using objective methods of cough counting as well as subjective quality of life and symptom indices. 6.1 Background Chronic cough is associated with many inflammatory airwaysdiseases such as asthma, COPD, post viral infections, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. 10In some cases certain drugs can be used to inhibit the underlyinginflammatory process that, under certain conditions, cause cough for example, corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma or COPD, or PPIs as treatment for gastro oesophageal reflux. However, there are patients who cough who do not respond to treatments directed at the cause of the cough, and there are patients in whom there is no identifiable cause to treat. Therefore, there is also a requirement to develop compounds that are targeted to inhibit sensory nerve activity directly (by inhibition of peripheral or central mechanisms), which should in theory inhibit cough of any aetiology. 6.2 New treatments under investigation 6.2.1 Opioids Attempts have been made to improve the therapeutic indexby topical administration of a peripherally acting polar enkephalin analogue, BW443C81, which was shown to inhibit citric acid induced cough in guinea pigs. 215However, in humans there was no effect on capsaicin induced cough innormal volunteers.215A novel opioid peptide, nociceptin, which binds to the opioid receptor like 1 receptor (NOP) has been shown to suppress capsaicin induced cough in guinea pigs and mechanically induced cough in the cat, but so far no data exist in humans.216 217 6.2.2 Neurokinin receptor (NK) antagonists The NK 2receptor antagonist SR 48968 has been shown to inhibit citric acid induced cough in conscious guinea pigs,218 219and an antitussive effect of NK 1receptor antago nists is still under debate. Although there is a reportsuggesting an antitussive effect of a dual NK 1/NK 2receptor antagonist (FK224) on bradykinin induced cough in asthmatics, 220other studies have failed to demonstrate any antitussive action of compounds of this type.221Recent data have implicated a role for NK 3receptor activation in evoking a tussive response possibly via a peripheral mechanism of action,222 223even though there have been no reports of the presence of functional NK 3receptor antagonists in the human lung. 6.2.3 Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA B)r e c e p t o r agonists GABA Bagonists (such as baclofen) have been shown to inhibit capsaicin induced cough in the conscious guinea pig224 225and in normal volunteers,226and provided some benefit in patients with chronic cough.227 6.2.4 Cannabinoid CB 2receptor agonists CB2receptor agonists inhibit guinea pig and human sensory nerve activation in vitro and the cough reflex in guinea pigs,which suggests that the development of CB 2agonists, devoid of CB 1mediated central effects, will provide a new and safe antitussive treatment for chronic cough.228No clinical data exist in humans. 6.2.5 Local anaesthetics Local anaesthetics such as lignocaine are delivered locally tothe airways and have been shown to attenuate capsaicin induced cough in man. 229However, the effect is transient and the antitussive effect is accompanied by oropharyngealanaesthesia leading to an increased risk of aspiration of airway secretions and food. 6.2.6 Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels The cold and menthol sensitive receptor (CMR1) has recently been characterised and cloned.230Interestingly, menthol has been proposed as an antitussive therapy and has been shownto inhibit citric acid induced cough in normal volunteers. 28 The heat sensitive channel TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin,the main pungent ingredient in hot chilli peppers, 231 232and capsazepine, a blocker of this channel, inhibits capsaicin and citric acid induced cough in the guinea pig.233An increase in epithelial nerve profiles expressing TRPV1 has been reported in patients with non asthmatic chronic cough.234Compounds of this type are currently in clinical development. 6.2.7 Potassium channel openers NS1619, an opener of large conductance calcium activated potassium (BKCa) channels, has been shown to inhibit sensory nerve function and cough induced by citric acid in the guinea pig.235ATP sensitive potassium channels may also be a good target. 6.3 ConclusionsTreatment of the causes of cough can often be an effective treatment strategy. However, at the moment there are no effective treatments controlling the cough response per se with an acceptable therapeutic ratio. The future looks promising with several novel mechanisms identified;BTS recommendations for cough management in adults i17 www.thoraxjnl.com"

APPENDIX 1 PATIENT INFORMATION SHEET APPENDIX 2 PROTOCOL FOR THE EVALUATION OF CHRONIC COUGH IN AN ADULT Appendix 2 Parts 1 and 2 is available online only at http://www.thoraxjnl.com/supplemental.Most short term coughs are due to a virus infection. Antibiotics won’t help, even if you are bringing up phlegm, and you probaly don’t need to see a doctor. You can get treatment from a pharmacist (chemist). Cough remedies that contain dextromethorphan may be the most effective. Take some paracetamol. Menthol lozenges or vapo ur might help too.You’ll probably feel tired, with a running or blocked nose, and perhaps have a mild fever and aching bones.Patient information sheet We recommend a home remedy, such as honey and lemon if you feel the need for treatment. Remember, coughs and sneezes do spread diseases, try not to infect others!

111,page_111,"APPENDIX 4 SETTING UP A SPECIALIST COUGH CLINIC SERVICE Why set up a cough clinic service? A specialist cough clinic service offers a number of distinct advantages (1) Improved patient outcomes: treatment success is con siderably higher for patients managed in a specialist cough clinic than in general respiratory clinics. (2) Avoidance of inappropriate prescribing: diagnostic uncer tainty often leads to inappropriate use of antibiotics and inhaled corticosteroids. (3) Training: specialist cough clinics provide an environment for training and skill development for physicians (oftenspecialist registrars in respiratory training programmes), pulmonary function technicians, and respiratory nurse specialists. (4) Clinical research: an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of cough and need to develop and evaluate new cough treatments requires the collaboration of clinicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. Specialist cough clinics ensure the accurate characterisa tion of patients with cough and provide opportunities for trusts with an interest in clinical research and pharma ceutical trial participation. Where to set up a cough clinic service ? A specialist cough clinic should provide a combination ofdiagnostic testing and treatment trials. Although specialist cough clinics have generally been set up in secondary care, they could be developed within a Primary Care Trust. There are no comparisons of treatment outcome or cost to recommend one or other. Core requirements (1) A named consultant or GP should have responsibility for the service.(2) All staff should be provided with training appropriate to their role in providing care. (3) To adequately supervise trials of treatment including assessment of cough severity (visual analogue scales and quality of life questionnaires). (4) Pulmonary function testing with spirometry as a mini mum requirement. (5) Access to chest radiography and bronchial provocation challenge testing (methacholine inhalation challengetesting). (6) Facility to refer for oesophageal testing in appropriate circumstances. (7) Ear, nose and throat (ENT) assessment either on site (facility for direct laryngoscopy) or direct access to ENTclinic. (8) Access to bronchoscopy and chest CT scanning in appropriate circumstances. (9) The outcomes of the service should be subject to regular review. Desirable requirements (1) Facility to obtain and analyse induced sputum samples. (2) Cough provocation testing. Cost implications Capital costs NEssential items: spirometer (£200 2500)NNon essential: flexible laryngoscope (approximately £7000); cough provocation testing, dosimeter and nebuliser (approximately £4000). Recurring costs NStaff costs should include physician, pulmonary functiontechnician, nurse specialist, and clerical time. NConsumables for example, methacholine challenge testing (approximately £50 per test).i24 Morice, McGarvey, Pavord www.thoraxjnl.com"
