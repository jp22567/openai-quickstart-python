Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells are recruited to the lung in response to various chemotactic factors, including chemokines. Specificall y, there is a large bod y of evidence that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor play s a pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung. For neutrophils, chemokine binding to the CXCR2 results in chemotaxis and cell activation, ultimately resulting in the release of a number of inflammatory mediators and proteases that are thought to contribute to the progressive fibrosis, airway stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman, 2009]. A reduction in tissue and airway neutrophilia is expected to result in downstream effects on mucus hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruction that are h ypothesized to underlie the development and worsening of respiratory symptoms and decline in lung function that occurs in COPD. Molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity have been shown to reduce the influx of neutrophils into the lungs in healthy participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) and to red uce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis in association with improvements in measures of disease activity in some, but not all, studies [ O'By rne, 2016; Holz , 2010; Watz , 2016; Lazaar , 2011; Nair, 2012; Rennard , 2015]. Overall, the results of the reported clinical studies with CXCR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target patient population is important to achieving clinical benefit. Danirixin is a selective CXCR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti - inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory diseases a nd influenza. Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number YM2010/00163/07]. Clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunte ers demonstrated the pharmacody namic activity of danirixin (inhibition of ex vivo CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils). Danirixin has also been tested in a Phase IIa study in symptomatic participants with mild to moderate COPD a t risk for exacerbation [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163]. I n study 200163, twice dail y dosing with danirixin free base (75 mg bid) or placebo given on top of standard of care inhaled maintenanc e treatm ents was tested for one y ear. Analy ses of clinical endpoints from study 200163 demonstrated that danirixin, compared to placebo, reduced respiratory symptoms as measured with E -RS:COPD [ Miller , 2016]. 2018N394263_00"
14,page_14,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 153.1. Stud y Rationale This p rotocol describes a pilot study to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on lung function and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with mild to moderate airflow obstruction identified from the COPDGene cohort. Study partici pants will continue with their standard of care inhaled medications (i.e. long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids) while receiving study treatment. Specificall y, this study aims to assess whether or not danirixin has the potential to impact disease progression in participants with a demonstrated history of decline in FEV 1based on 5 y ear data from COPDGene and support the conduct of a larger Phase III study for disease progression. In addition to lung function and HRQoL , this st udy will assess moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, health status (CAT), and rescue medication use. 3.2. Background COPD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006; Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016]. The morbidity and mortality of COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by the year 2020, COPD is expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability [Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016]. The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is primarily due to small airway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an excessive inflammatory response in the lung, mainly caused b y cigarette smoking [ Celli , 2004]. COPD is characterized by symptoms of chronic and, in many patients, progressive breathlessness (or d yspnea), cough and sputum production. Many COPD patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the typical day to day variation [ Hurst , 2010]. These episodes of worsening s ymptoms (COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of COPD- related and total health care costs. Despite several available therapies that have been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations and respiratory symptoms, many COPD patients continue to experience a high burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations resulting in a continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016]. Additionally , there is growing recognition that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well as smokers with preserved lung function suffer from a high burden of s ymptoms and COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [ Woodruff , 2016]. Therapies that effectivel y further reduce COPD exacerbations and improve respiratory symptoms could have a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly result in an improvement in COPD patients’ quality of life. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for the treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the management of current respiratory symptoms and subsequent worsening of s ymptoms resulting in COPD exacerbations should be an important component of CO PD patient management [ GOL D, 2016]. Danirixin is being evaluated as an addition to standard of care inhaled therapies (i.e. long acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination 2018N394263_00"

Benefit/Risk A ssessment More detailed information about the potential benefits and risks o f danirixin may be found in the danirixin I nvestigator’s Brochure [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number YM2010/00163/07]. 2018N394263_00

Risk A ssessment Investigational Product (IP) [Danirixin, GSK1325756] Potential Risk of Clinical Significanc e Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Testicular effects and male fertility The most sensitive species is the rat. Testicular effects present at doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in the rat include spermatid degeneration, seminiferous tubular degene ration and secondary epididy mal changes, including oligo/aspermia and/or epididy mal intratubular cellular debris. The no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) in this study , based on the microscopic findings in the testis, was 50 mg/kg/day for male rats. The s ystemic exposure margins for the NOAEL for testicular effects in the rat is 7.3 -fold for an oral clinical dose of 50 mg BID free base tablet. The testicular effects seen in the rat have also been shown to directly impact on male fertility and the NO AEL for these reproductive effects was 100 mg/kg/day . Refer to IB Section 4.4 for full details No adverse events related to testicular effects have been observed in clinical studies to date.Standard safet y monitoring will be employ ed. The potential risk of testicular injury has been convey ed in the informed consent. PK modelling predicts that in a participant receiving 35 mg BID of the HBr salt, the risk of exposure exceeding the 2 -fold margin for AUC(0 -24) for the NOAEL of testicular effects is low. 2018N394263_00"

Host defense has not been studied directly in nonclinical studies. However, data in nonclinical species have not identified an increased risk of infection with danirixin. Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with two CXCR2 a ntagonists in the same chemical class as danirixin have not shown an increase in infections in challenge models (e.g., influenza viral load). Secondary bacterial infections after viral infection have not been directly evaluated in nonclinical studies. Thedata from clinical studies including healthy participants, COPD and influenza patients thus far show no evidence that participants taking danirixin have an increased infection rate compared with participants taking placebo. Neutropenia has been reported i n clinical trials of other CXCR2 antagonists. No instances of neutropenia have been reported in nonclinical studies with danirixin.

In healthy participants , the data are confounded b y the observation of low neutrophil counts before dosing or at follow -up, and were not dose -related, while in patients with influenza, neutrophil counts recovered while receiving danirixin, coincident with resolution of the viral infection. There have been no reports of neutrophil count decreases below the lower limit of normal in patients with COPD who were treated with danirixin for one year. These data support the conclusion that a causal association of neutropen ia with danirixin cannot be definitively established. 2018N394263_00"

Participants will have frequent study clinic visits for the evaluation of their disease s ymptoms. During these visits, participants will have spirometry , ECG, vital signs monitoring, and phy sical examinations. Monitoring for worsening of their disease will also take place. Participants may benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing to the process of developing a new treatment in an area of unmet need, even if not directly beneficial for them All participants will continue with changes to their medications, where medically appropriate, to receive established standard of care. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk C onclusion Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical and clinical studies. I ts potency and duration of action supports its potential use as an oral, anti -inflammatory agent in the treatment of CO PD with anticipated potential for bringing benefit to a serious condition that affects the lives of millions and contributes to significant morbidit y and mortality. In clinical trials completed to date danirixin has been well -tolerated and most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity . The most commonly observed AEs have been nasophary ngitis, headache and diarrhea following administration of danirixin or placebo. There have been no treatment related clinically signif icant changes in vital signs or ECG at any dose of danirixin. Taking into accou nt the measures taken to minimiz e risks to participants in this study , the potential risks identified in association with danirixin are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with COPD. 2018N394263_00"

Following screening and assessment of rescue medication use via a dail y diar y over study days -32 to 1, participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either danirixin 35mg tablets or placebo. Study treatmen t will be administer edtwice dail y for 52weeks [Figure 1]. There will be no pre -specified interim anal ysis for this study . An interim analy sis may be performed if it is determined that the enrolment is slow enough to allow it to be informative. There will be no IDMC for this study. An internal safety review team will meet approximately every 3 months (or as needed based on emerging data) to review available safet y information. Figure 1 Study Schematic 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 130 participa nts will be screened to achieve 100 randomized in this study . It is anticipated that approximately 85 participants will complete the 12 months of treatment (assuming a 15% drop out rate). For the anal ysis of study assessments, several analy sis populations are defined in Section 10.3. 5.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all planned study visits including the last stud y visit and the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study .

23,page_23,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 245.4. Scientific Rationa le for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, parallel- group design. This is a well established design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. With the use of an enriched population, it is anticipated that one year of treatment will be sufficient to detect a trend in altering disease progression. Danirixin has alread y been clinically investigated over one year treatment duration ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163 ). The data from this study will provide useful information in determining whether or not to progress to a Phase III study to explore an indication for slowing disease progression. 5.5. Dose Justification One dose of danirixin is proposed for thi s study , 35mg tablets BID. This dose was selected based on integrating information on: Dose -exposure -biomarker response using inhibition of ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils over the dose range of 0 -400mg (free base ta blet) in healthy volunteers (GSK Study No. CX3 112483). Evidence of reduced respiratory symptoms and improvement in health status in mild to moderate COPD participants from interim data in the Phase IIa study (GSK Study No. 200163). Relative bioavailabili ty study comparing danirixin free base vs HBr ( GSK Study No. 201037). In the previous clinical studies, danirixin was a dministered as a free base tablet , whereas the danirixin formulation to be used in this study will be a hydrobromide salt tablet. The hy drobromide tablet has approximately twice the bioavailability of the free base tablet in healthy elderl y participants (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00, Study ID 201037 ). Thus the danirixin (hy drobromide tablet) 35mg BID dose for investigation in this study is expected to provide steady -state sy stemic exposure approximately equivalent to the 75mg BID (free base tablet) used in Study 200163. Predicted stead y-state exposures and multiples of blood ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b pharmacology at the proposed danirixin doses are presented in Table 2.

STUDY POPULA TION This study will identify specific COPD patients most likely to decline from well established cohorts like COPDGen e [NCT00608764]. This study will be an ancillary study within COPDGene and any other relevant cohort investigating the enrichment strategy for assessing disease progression. These potential participants will beidentified by COPDGene investigators based on data collected over the initial 5 year period. The participants were identified based on a demonstrated decline of at least 15mL/yr over the initial 5 year period. Once participants are identified from the COPDGene dataset, the following criteria will be verified at initial study visit following signing of consent. Equivalent cirteria may be identified within other cohorts if necessary to broaden recruitment pool.

Discontinuation of Study Treatment 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance [ FDA , 2009 ]. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm below or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the partic ipant. 2018N394263_00"

QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis. Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant w ho meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc > 500 msec OR Uncorrected QT > 600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec 2018N394263_00"

Neutrophil Stopping Criteria A participant with a periph eral blood neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing. The neutrophil count should be monitored daily until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 9 . 8.1.4. Temporary Discontinuation Temporary discontinuation of study treatment is allowed for up to 14 day s when medically necessary , e.g. for hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation, other medical condition requiring hospitalization, or reduction in periphera l blood neutrophil counts  0.5 x 109/L. Temporary discontinuation for any other reason should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor. 8.1.5. Study Treatment Restart Study treatment restart after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Refer to Appendix 7 (Section 12.7)for full guidance for required actions and follow -up assessments to undertake if liver stopping criteria are met. Study treatment restart a fter neutrophil stopping criteria are met can be considered once the neutrophil count has returned to within baseline and provided that no more than 14 days have elapsed since study medication was halted. The Investigator must obtain approval from the GSK Medical Monitor prior to restarting study treatment. See Appendix 9 for the procedure to be followed for study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, th e sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 2018N394263_00"
35,page_35,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 36If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the s ite study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant a nd reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalen t methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 2018N394263_00"

STUDY ASSESSMENTS A ND PROC EDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Table 1) Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occur rence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failur e, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of I CF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol - specified cri teria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL . Repeat or unschedule d samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. FEV 1 9.1.1.1. Clinic Spirometry Spirometry using FEV 1 and FVC measurements (FEV%, and FVC% and FEV1/FVC will be calculated) will be performed in triplicate at t imepoints listed in the SoA (Table 1 ). Spirometry assessments should be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines as outlined in the SRM . 9.1.1.2. Mobile Spirometry Spirometry will also be performed weekl y by the participants using a mobile spirometer at home. Details will be outlined in the SRM. 9.1.2. SGRQ -C The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific tool ( SGRQ - C) is a disease -specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respira tory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL [ Meguro , 2007]. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains 2018N394263_00"
37,page_37,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 38of sy mptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. The SGRQ -Chas been used in numerous previous studies of COPD participants and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -Cis derived from the original SGRQ and produces SGRQ scores equivalent to the original SGRQ instrument [ Jones , 1992]. 9.1.3. CAT The COPD Assessment Test is a short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD [ Jones, 2009; Jones , 2012]. When completing the questionnaire, participants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (maximum impairment) to 5 (no impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 9.1.4. COPD Exacerbations An exacerbation of COPD is defined b y a worsening of s ymptoms requiring additional treatment or hospitalization . Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. Exacerbations will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE) as they are considered Disease Rel ated Events (DREs). Only when the event is, in the Investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , or duration than expected for the individual participant, or the Investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to study treatment should it be reported as an SAE (See Section 9.2). (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF (See Section 9.4.5 )). All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the participant’s study treatment temporaril y in o rder to treat the COPD exacerbation. The reason for temporaril y stopping study treatment and duration should be recorded in the eCRF. The date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF based on the Investiga tor’s judgement . 9.1.5. Patient Global Rating of Severity and Global Rating of Change in Disease Severity Participants will complete the Global Rating of COPD S everity at randomisation and final study visit or I P Discontinuation Visit. This single global question will ask participants to rate their severit y of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Participants will complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at every visit following randomization (or Earl y Withdrawal (EW) Visit). Response 2018N394263_00"
38,page_38,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 39options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Asking at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can b e found in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Colle cting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the time the informed conse nt is signed b y the participant until the follow up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Table 1). All AEs will be collected from t he start of s tudy treatment (randomization visit) until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs must be reported immediately and not more than 24 hrs to the sponsor , as indicated in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notif y the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the i nitial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as 2018N394263_00"
39,page_39,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 40defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor o f a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regula tory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional R eview Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded t o investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Broc hure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ) andall deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in participants with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbations Because these events are ty picall y associate d with the disease under study , they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page in the participant’ s CRF within 72 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by the Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis as described in Section 12.3 (Appendix 3 ). 2018N394263_00"
40,page_40,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 41NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product 9.2.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants w ill be collected after the start of study treatment and until 60 hours after the last dose of study treatment. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outl ined in Section 12.5(Appendix 5). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. 9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of monitoring inhaled rescue medication use and measuring spirometry at home . In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligat ions worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be fo und in Sec tion 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 9.2and Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ). 9.2.8.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in whic h the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator wi ll promptl y notify the sponsor within 24 hours of determining a device- related event . The method of documenting Medical Device In cidents is provided in Section 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). 2018N394263_00"
41,page_41,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 429.2.8.2. Follo w-up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same manner as other AEs (see Section 9.2). This applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study treatment or the study . The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes an y supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the incident. New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated b y the investigator. 9.2.8.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol defi nition of a medical device incident. Complete the Medical Device Incident Form for each participant who has a medical device incident with GSK medical devices provided for use during the study period. All of the header information in the form must be comp leted before sending to GSK. Original documents should be filed in the site study file. A cop y of the form must also be sent to the GKS study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. A copy of the form must also be sent to the GSK study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. For incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE or SAE, the appropriate pages of the CRF must be completed. If there is an SAE, the completed CRF pages should be sent together with the Medical Device Incident From. If the participant is withdrawn due to a medi cal device incident, ensure the Study Conclusion page is completed. The same individual will be the contact for the receipt of medical device reports and SAEs. 9.2.8.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements f or Medical Device Incidents The investigator will promptly report all incidents occurring with any medical device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and ot her entities about certain safet y information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies. The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g., the head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable l ocal regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the I RB/IEC. 2018N394263_00"
42,page_42,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 439.3. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of study treatment 4 tablets in a day will be considered an overdose. GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an ove rdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until study treatment can no longer be detected sy stemically (at least 3 day s). 3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis as soon as possible from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time po ints for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, cardiovascular, respiratory , gastrointestinal and neurological s ystems. Height and weight wi ll also be measured and recorded. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previo us serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken. The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the CRF. A single measurement of respiratory rate is adequate. 2018N394263_00"
43,page_43,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 449.4.3. Electrocardiograms For participant screening and pre -dose on Day 1,triplicate ECG measurements should be collected. For all subsequent ECG assessments, single measurement sare to be collected. 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 8.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be necessary . At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 10 minutes. 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Section 12.2 (Appendix 2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investi gator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during participation in the study or within 3 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repea ted until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 12.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table 1). If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 9.4.5. Pneumonia All suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined b y the presence or new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of the following signs and s ymptoms: Increased cough Increased sputum purulence (colour) or production Auscultatory findings of adventitious sounds (e.g. egophon y, bronchial breath sounds, rales, etc.) 2018N394263_00"

The Investigator and site staff should remain vigilant for the possib le development of pneumonia in participants as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. For all suspected cases of pneumonia, Investigators are strongl y encouraged to confirm the diagnosis (this includes ob taining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate therap y as promptly as possible. Any microbiology or virology tests performed to determine etiology should be reported on the pneumonia eCRF page. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed o r unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable). 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.7. Genetics A 6 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics anal ysis component of the study. Participation in the genetics anal ysis is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research m ay still participate in the study . See Section 12.6 (Appendix 6) for Information regarding genetic research. Details on procedures for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in the SRM. 9.8. Biomarkers Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study . The following samples for biomarker research will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA: peripheral venous blood samples for the preparation of serum and plasma Samples will be tested for biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation (i.e. CRP), extracellular matrix turnover and remodelling to evaluate their association with the observed clinical responses or to help understand the underl ying biological responses to danirixin. 2018N394263_00"

Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on COPD disease progression. There are no formal h ypothesis tests associated with this objective and no formal significance tests. The information acquired from this study will primarily be used to assess whether or not danirixin impacts diseas e progression and to quantify the effect that danirixin has on disease progression, specifically change in lung function as measured b y FEV 1decline and change in health -related quality of life as measured b y SGRQ total score to further support disease und erstanding and future studies. 10.1. Sample Size Determination Sample size is based primarily on feasibility for this study . Since there is much uncertaint y around the magnitude of the difference in the decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ along with the between -subject variabilit y for the specific patient population, the proposed sample size is unavoidably imprecise. Sample size may be adjusted using the predictions of final study outcome based on simulations and possible interim analyses. It is anticipated that screening 130 participants will allow for approximately 100 participants to enrol. In order to observe the effect of different sample sizes, various simulations were done to assess the impact of sample sizes of 50, 100, 150 and 200 with a 1:1 allocation t o each treatment group [ Table 3 ]. The assumed variability for rate of decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ is 25 and 10, respectively. The correlation between rate of decline in FEV1 and change in SGRQ is assumed to be - 0.2.

The samples from the posterior probability distribution from the MCMC approximation were divided into four regions based on δFEV1and δSGRQtreatment effect cut- off values; δ FEV1≥0 and δSGRQ ≤0, δ FEV1≥0 and δ SGRQ>0, δFEV1<0 and δSGRQ≤0, and δ FEV1<0 and δSGRQ>0. Based on a 70% threshold, the proportion of the 1000 simulations meeting the requirement P(δFEV1≥0 & δSGRQ≤0)≥70% we re considered a success based on the joint definition [Figure 2, Table 4]. If P(δFEV1≥0 & δSGRQ≤0)< 70%, success could further be defined based on each endpoint independentl y where P(δFEV1≥0) ≥ 80% or P(δSGRQ ≤0) ≥ 80%.

Randomization will be stratified by smoking status (current vs. former). 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description All Participants This population w ill comprise all participants screened and for whom a record exists on the study database and will be used for the tabulation and listing of reasons for withdrawal before randomization and listings of AEs and SAEs for nonrandomized participants. Intent To Treat (ITT) This population will comprise all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. This will constitute the primary population for all analyses of efficacy and safet y. Outcomes will be reported accor ding to the randomized treatment allocation. Per-Protocol (PP) PopulationThis population will comprise of all patients in the I TT population who are not major protocol violators. Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analy zed according to the treatment they actually received. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses Treatment comparisons using all endpoints will be made using appropriate statistical techniques. Anal ysis methods for key endpoints are described below. Main anal ysis will use ITT unless noted. Further details on all analy ses will be described in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP). 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses The total probability of success will be defined as a combination of a joint and conditional state ment. The joint probability of success will be defined as the probability of the difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1between danirixin and placebo is greater than or equal to 0 and the difference in the change in SGRQ total score from baseline betwee n danirixin and placebo is less than or equal to 0 is greater than 70%.

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary Rate of decline in FEV 1and change from baseline in SGRQ t otal score Exploratory Will be described in detail in the RAP Lung Function Decline: Rate of Decline of FEV 1(mL/yr) The rate of decline of FEV 1will be derived from a repeated measures random coefficients model. Post-baseline FEV 1will be modelled inc luding terms for age, sex, smoking status, FEV 1at baseline, and BMI along with treatment group, time and treatment b y time interaction as fixed effects. Subject will be a random effect. Time will be defined as the number of day s since start of treatment. Only FEV 1values measured after baseline will be used in the model. Based on the results of previous studies, the study team will determine the time point at which post- baseline spirometry assessments will be included in the model to account for the initi al treatment response. The estimate of the rate of FEV 1decline will be the slope of the parameter estimate of the treatment b y time interaction term in the model. Contrasts will be calculated for the difference in treatment b y time interaction between dan irixin and placebo treatment groups to estimate the treatment difference. FEV 1= Treatment group + age + sex +smoking status+FEV1_BL+BMI+ time + treatment*time The rate of decline for each subject, the estimate of the slope parameter of the treatment by time interaction term, will be used as a co- primary endpoint for the joint anal ysis using both FEV 1and SGRQ. HRQoL: SGRQ A co -primary endpoint of interest is change in SGRQ total score (derived from SGRQ -C) from baseline. Change in SGRQ total scores from baseline will be derived using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment group, age, sex, smoking status, BMI, baseline SGRQ score, time as a categorical variable and a treatment b y time interaction term. Subject wil l be a random effect. Estimated treatment differences at the end of one y ear will be obtained. The difference of the least square mean change from baseline at 12 months will be derived. The adjusted SGRQ total score 2018N394263_00"

Joint Analysis The joint analy sis will use the ITT population with all available FEV 1rate of decline and change in SGRQ data. The rate of decline (the slope parameter from the rand om coefficients model) of FEV 1, along with the change in SGRQ from the MMRM model will be extracted for each subject. These values will then be used to obtain MCMC approximations of the joint posterior distribution of the treatment differences between FEV 1decline and change in SGRQ between the danirixin and placebo groups. Based on the samples from the posterior distribution, the proportion of samples falling within certain treatment difference regions will be calculated and the probability of success will be derived. 10.4.2. Safety Analyses All safet y endpoints will be tabulated or plotted b y treatment group and will be performed on the Safet y Population. Further details will be described in the RAP. 10.4.3. Other A nalyses Exploratory biomarker analy ses will be described in the RAP. 10.4.4. Interim A nalyses Conducting an interim analy sis or futility assessment may not be practical due to an expected fast recruitment period. By the time enough data will accumulate for any meaningful interim anal ysis to support changes to the study design, recruitment of all study participants will have concluded. However, if recruitment takes a longer than anticipated, an interim analy sis to reassess the variability assumptions, estimate the probability of success at the end of study , and confirm t he directionality of the endpoints may be conducted. The RAP will describe the potential interim anal yses in greater detail. 2018N394263_00"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urin alysis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progres sion of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the defin ition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" con stitutes an AE or SAE. 2018N394263_00"
65,page_65,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 66Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more seve re than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical pr ocedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs /symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a)Results in death b)Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to a n event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza tion In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s offi ce or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessa ry, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disr uption of a person’s ability to conduct 2018N394263_00"

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV even t page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2018N394263_00"
67,page_67,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 68Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnos tics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE /SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records befo re submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomf ort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: A n event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are fa cts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 2018N394263_00"
68,page_68,"2016N293064_03 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 69Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant ther apy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investiga tor has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the inve stigator will provide GSK with a copy of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. 2018N394263_00"

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be us ed to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single F SH measurement is insufficient and confirmatory testing with additional FSH and estradiol measurements is required. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Pregnancy Testing WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highl y sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at approximately monthly intervals during the stud y treatment period, after the last dose of study treatment and as required locally . Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when pregnancy is ot herwise suspected 2018N394263_00"

Collection of Pregnancy Information Male participants with partners who become pregnant Investigator will not routinely attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female partner(s) who becomes pregnant while the male participant is participat ing in this study; however, voluntary reports of such incidents will be captured through the GSK standard reporting mechanism. This applies only to male participants who receive double- blind study treatment. If pregnancy information for a male participant’ s female partner(s) is voluntarily reported, after obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directl y, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incident associated with a device happened and The incident was s uch that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to bod y structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects 2018N394263_00"

125,page_125,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 133. INTRODUCTION The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized by a prominent infiltration of neutrophils in lung tissue and the airway s. Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells are recruited to the lung in response to various chemo tactic factors, including chemokines. Specificall y, there is a large bod y of evidence that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor play s a pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung. For neutrophils, chemokine binding to the CXCR2 results in chemotaxis and cell activation, ultimately resulting in the release of a number of inflammatory mediators and proteases that are thought to contribute to the progressive fibrosis, airway stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. Selecti ve antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman, 2009]. A reduction in tissue and airway neutrophilia is expected to result in downstream effects on mucus hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruction that are h ypothesized to underlie the development and worsening of respiratory s ymptoms and decline in lung function that occurs in COPD. Molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity have been shown to reduce the influx of neutrophils into the lungs in healthy participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) and to reduce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis in associa tion with improvements in measures of disease activity in some, but not all, studies [ O'By rne, 2016; Holz , 2010; Watz , 2016; Lazaar , 2011; Nair, 2012;Rennard , 2015]. Overall, the results of the reported clinical studies with CXCR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target patient population is important to achieving clinical benefit. Danirixin is a selective CX CR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti - inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory diseases and influenza. Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number YM2010/00163/07]. Clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated the pharmacody namic activity of danirixin (inhibition of ex vivo CXCL1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils). Danirixin has also been tested in a Phase IIa study in symptomatic participants with mild to moderate COPD at risk for exacerbation [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163]. I n study 200163, twice dail y dosing with danirixin free base (75 mg bid) or placebo given on top of standard of care inhaled maintenance treatm ents was tested for one y ear. Analy ses of clinical endpoints from study 200163 demonstrated that danirixin, compared t o placebo, reduced respiratory symptoms as measured with E -RS:COPD [ Miller , 2016]. 3.1. Stud y Rationale This protocol describes a pilot study to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on lung function and health related qual ity of life (HRQoL) in participants with 2018N394263_00"
126,page_126,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 14mild to moderate airflow obstruction identified from the COPDGene cohort. Study participants will continue with their standard of care inhaled medications (i.e. long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled co rticosteroids) while receiving study treatment. Specificall y, this study aims to assess whether or not danirixin has the potential to impact disease progression in participants with a COPD progression score indicating they are likely to decline based on 5 year data from COPDGene and support the conduct of a larger Phase III stud y for disease progression. In addition to lung function and HRQoL , this study will assess moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, health status (CAT), and rescue medication use. 3.2. Background COPD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006; Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016]. The morbidity and mortality of COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by the year 2020, COPD is expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability [Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016]. The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is primarily due to small airway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an excessive inflamma tory response in the lung, mainly caused b y cigarette smoking [ Celli , 2004]. COPD is characterized by symptoms of chronic and, in many patients, progressive breathlessness (or d yspnea), cough and sputum production. Many COPD patient s also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the typical day to day variation [ Hurst , 2010]. These episodes of worsening symptoms (COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of COPD -relate d and total health care costs. Despite several available therapies that have been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations and respiratory symptoms, many COPD patients continue to experience a high burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations resulting in a continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016]. Additionally , there is growing recognition that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well as smokers with preserved lung function suffer from a high b urden of s ymptoms and COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [ Woodruff , 2016]. Therapies that effectivel y further reduce COPD exacerbations and improve respiratory symptoms could have a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly result in an improvement in COPD patients’ quality of life. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for the treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the m anagement of current respiratory symptoms and subsequent worsening of s ymptoms resulting in COPD exacerbations should be an important component of COPD patient management [ GOL D, 2016]. Danirixin is being evaluated as an addition to s tandard of care inhaled therapies (i.e. long acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination therapies) and is targeting those COPD patients that continue to have a burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations desp ite management with currentl y available COPD treatments. 2018N394263_00"

Testicular effects present at doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in the rat include spermatid degeneration, seminiferous tubular degeneration and secondary epididy mal changes, including oligo/aspermia and/or epididy mal intratubular cellular d ebris. The no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) in this study , based on the microscopic findings in the testis, was 50 mg/kg/day for male rats. The s ystemic exposure margins for the NOAEL for testicular effects in the rat is 7.3 -fold for an oral clinical dose of 50 mg BID free base tablet. The testicular effects seen in the rat have also been shown to directly impact on male fertility and the NOAEL for these reproductive effects was 100 mg/kg/day . Refer to IB Section 4.4 for full details No adverse e vents related to testicular effects have been observed in clinical studies to date.Standard safet y monitoring will be employ ed. The potential risk of testicular injury has been convey ed in the informed consent. PK modelling predicts that in a participan t receiving 35 mg BID of the HBr salt, the risk of exposure exceeding the 2 -fold margin for AUC(0 -24) for the NOAEL of testicular effects is low. 2018N394263_00"

Host defense has not been studied directly in nonclinical studies. However, dat a in nonclinical species have not identified an increased risk of infection with danirixin. Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with two CXCR2 antagonists in the same chemical class as danirixin have not shown an increase in infections in challenge models (e.g., influenza viral load). Secondary bacterial infections after viral infection have not been directly evaluated in nonclinical studies. The data from clinical studies including healthy participants, COPD and influenza patients thus far show no ev idence that participants taking danirixin have an increased infection rate compared with participants taking placebo. Neutropenia has been reported in clinical trials of other CXCR2 antagonists. No instances of neutropenia have been reported in nonclinica l studies with danirixin.

In healthy participants , the data are confounded b y the observation of low neutrophil counts before dosing or at follow-up, and were not dose -related, while in patients with influenza, neutrophil counts recovered while receiving danirixin, coincident with resolution of the viral infection. There have been no reports of neutrophil count decreases below the lower limit of normal in patients with COPD who were treated with danirixin for one year. These data support the conclusion that a causal association of neutropenia with danirixin cannot be definitively established. 2018N394263_00"

Participants will have frequent study clinic visits for the evaluation of their disease s ymptoms. During these visits, participants will have spirometry , ECG, vital signs monitoring, and phy sical examinations. Mo nitoring for worsening of their disease will also take place. Participants may benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing to the process of developing a new treatment in an area of unmet need, even if not directly beneficial for them All parti cipants will continue with changes to their medications, where medically appropriate, to receive established standard of care. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in precl inical and clinical studies. I ts potency and duration of action supports its potential use as an oral, anti -inflammatory agent in the treatment of COPD with anticipated potential for bringing benefit to a serious condition that affects the lives of million s and contributes to significant morbidit y and mortality. In clinical trials completed to date danirixin has been well -tolerated and most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity The most commonly observed AEs have been nasophary ngitis, hea dache and diarrhea following administration of danirixin or placebo. There have been no treatment related clinically signif icant changes in vital signs orECG at an y dose of danirixin. Taking into accou nt the measures taken to minimiz e risks to particip ants in this study , the potential risks identified in association with danirixin are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with COPD. 2018N394263_00"

Following screening and assessment of rescue medication use via a dail y diar y over study days -28 to 1, participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either danirixin 35mg tablets or placebo. Study treatment will be administer edtwice dail y for 52weeks [Figure 1]. There will be no p re-specified interim anal ysis for this study . An interim analy sis may be performed if it is determined that the enrolment is slow enough to allow it to be informative. There will be no IDMC for this study. An internal safety review team will meet approxim ately every 3 months (or as needed based on emerging data) to review available safet y information. Figure 1 Study Schematic 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 130 participa nts will be screened to achieve 100 randomized in this study . It is anticipated that approximately 85 participants will complete the 12 months of treatment (assuming a 15% drop out rate). For the anal ysis of study assessments, several analy sis populations are defined in Section 10.3. 2018N394263_00"
135,page_135,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 235.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all planned study visits including the last stud y visit and the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, parallel- group design. This is a well estab lished design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. With the use of an enriched population, it is anticipated that one year of treatment will be sufficient to detect a trend in altering disease progression. Danirixin has alread y been clinically investigated over one year treatment duration ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163 ). The data from this study will provide useful information in determining whether or not to progress to a Phase III study to explore an indication for slowing disease progression. 5.5. Dose Justification One dose of danirixin is proposed for this study , 35mg tablets BID. This dose was selected based on integrating information on: Dose -exposure -biomarker response using inhibition of ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils over the dose range of 0 -400mg (free base tablet) in healthy volunteers (GSK Study No. CX3 112483). Evidence of reduced respiratory symptoms and improvement in health status in mild to moderate COPD participants from interim data in the Phase IIa study (GSK Study No. 200163). Relative bioavailability study comparing danirixin free base vs HBr ( GSK Study No. 201037). In the previous clinical studies, danirix in was a dministered as a free base tablet , whereas the danirixin formulation to be used in this study will be a hydrobromide salt tablet. The hy drobromide tablet has approximately twice the bioavailability of the free base tablet in healthy elderl y partici pants (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00, Study ID 201037 ). Thus the danirixin (hy drobromide tablet) 35mg BID dose for investigation in this study is expected to provide steady -state sy stemic exposure approximate ly equivalent to the 75mg BID (free base tablet) used in Study 200163. Predicted stead y-state exposures and multiples of blood ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b pharmacology at the proposed danirixin doses are presented in Table 2. 2018N394263_00"

Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant. GSK will not provide post- study treatment. There are no plans to provide the study treatment for compassionate use following study completion. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol g uidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance [ FDA , 2009 ]. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets one of the condit ions outlined in the algorithm below or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. 2018N394263_00"
146,page_146,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 34 Liver Safet y Required Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in Appendix 7 : Liver Safet y: Requ ired Actions and Follow- up Assessments ). 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participa nt’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc va lues of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc > 500 msec OR Un corrected QT > 600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec 2018N394263_00"
147,page_147,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 35For patients with underl ying bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block < 450 msec > 500 msec 450 –480 msec ≥ 530 msec See the SoA ( Table 1 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Neutrophil Stopping Criteria A participant with a periph eral blood neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing. The neutrophil count should be monitored daily until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 9 . 8.1.4. Temporary Discontinuation Temporary discontinuation of study treatment is allowed for up to 14 day s when medically necessary , e.g. for hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation, other medical condition requiring hospitalization, or reduction in periphera l blood neutrophil counts  0.5 x 109/L. Temporary discontinuation for any other reason should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor. 8.1.5. Study Treatment Restart Study treatment restart after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Refer to Appendix 7 (Section 12.7)for full guidance for required actions and follow -up assessments to undertake if liver stopping criteria are met. Study treatment restart a fter neutrophil stopping criteria are met can be considered once the neutrophil count has returned to within baseline and provided that no more than 14 days have elapsed since study medication was halted. The Investigator must obtain approval from the GSK Medical Monitor prior to restarting study treatment. See Appendix 9 for the procedure to be followed for study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, th e sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 2018N394263_00"
148,page_148,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 36If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the s ite study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant a nd reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalen t methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 2018N394263_00"

STUDY ASSESSMENTS A ND PROC EDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Table 1) Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occur rence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failur e, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of I CF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol - specified cri teria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL . Repeat or unschedule d samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. FEV 1 9.1.1.1. Clinic Spirometry Spirometry using FEV 1 and FVC measurements (FEV%, and FVC% and FEV1/FVC will be calculated) will be performed in triplicate at t imepoints listed in the SoA (Table 1 ). Spirometry assessments should be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines as outlined in the SRM . 9.1.1.2. Mobile Spirometry Spirometry will also be performed weekl y by the participants using a mobile spirometer at home. Details will be outlined in the SRM. 9.1.2. SGRQ -C The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific tool ( SGRQ - C) is a disease -specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respira tory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL [ Meguro , 2007]. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains 2018N394263_00"
150,page_150,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 38of sy mptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. The SGRQ -Chas been used in numerous previous studies of COPD participants and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -Cis derived from the original SGRQ and produces SGRQ scores equivalent to the original SGRQ instrument [ Jones , 1992]. 9.1.3. CAT The COPD Assessment Test is a short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD [ Jones, 2009; Jones , 2012]. When completing the questionnaire, participants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (maximum impairment) to 5 (no impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 9.1.4. COPD Exacerbations An exacerbation of COPD is defined b y a worsening of s ymptoms requiring additional treatment or hospitalization . Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. Exacerbations will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE) as they are considered Disease Rel ated Events (DREs). Only when the event is, in the Investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , or duration than expected for the individual participant, or the Investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to study treatment should it be reported as an SAE (See Section 9.2). (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF (See Section 9.4.5 )). All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the participant’s study treatment temporaril y in o rder to treat the COPD exacerbation. The reason for temporaril y stopping study treatment and duration should be recorded in the eCRF. The date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF based on the Investiga tor’s judgement . 9.1.5. Patient Global Rating of Severity and Global Rating of Change in Disease Severity Participants will complete the Global Rating of COPD S everity at randomisation and final study visit or I P Discontinuation Visit. This single global question will ask participants to rate their severit y of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Participants will complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at every visit following randomization (or Earl y Withdrawal (EW) Visit). Response 2018N394263_00"
151,page_151,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 39options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Asking at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can b e found in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Colle cting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the time the informed conse nt is signed b y the participant until the follow up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Table 1). All AEs will be collected from t he start of s tudy treatment (randomization visit) until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA ( Table 1 ). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs must be reported immediately and not more than 24 hrs to the sponsor , as indicated in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notif y the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the i nitial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as 2018N394263_00"
152,page_152,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 40defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor o f a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regula tory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional R eview Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded t o investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Broc hure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ) andall deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in participants with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbations Because these events are ty picall y associate d with the disease under study , they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page in the participant’ s CRF within 72 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by the Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis as described in Section 12.3 (Appendix 3 ). 2018N394263_00"
153,page_153,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 41NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product 9.2.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants w ill be collected after the start of study treatment and until 60 hours after the last dose of study treatment. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outl ined in Section 12.5 (Appendix 5). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. 9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of monitoring inhaled rescue medication use and measuring spirometry at home . In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligat ions worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be fo und in Sec tion 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 9.2and Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ). 9.2.8.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in whic h the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator wi ll promptl y notify the sponsor. The method of documenting Medical Device In cidents is provided in Section 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). 2018N394263_00"
154,page_154,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 429.2.8.2. Follo w-up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same manner as other AEs (see Section 9.2). This applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study treatment or the study . The investigator is responsible for ensuring th at follow -up includes an y supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the incident. New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated b y the investigator. 9.2.8.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a medical device incident. Complete the Medi cal Device Incident Form for each participant who has a medical device incident with GSK medical devices provided for use during the study period. All of the header information in the form must be completed before sending to GSK. Original documents shoul d be filed in the site study file. A cop y of the form must also be sent to the GKS study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. A copy of the form must also be sent to the GSK study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. For incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE or SAE, the appropriate pages of the CRF must be completed. If there is an SAE, the completed CRF pages should be sent together with the Medical Device Incident From. If the participant is withdrawn due to a medi cal device incident, ensure the Study Conclusion page is completed. The same individual will be the contact for the receipt of medical device reports and SAEs. 9.2.8.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Medical Device Incidents The investigator will prom ptly report all incidents occurring with any medical device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about certain safet y information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies. The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g., the head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the I RB/IEC. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of study treatment 4 tablets in a day will be considered an overdose. 2018N394263_00"
155,page_155,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 43GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/tr eating ph ysician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until study treatment can no longer be detected sy stemically (at least 3 day s). 3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysisas soon as possible from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA . 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, cardiovascular, respiratory , gastrointestinal and neurological s ystems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be m easured in a semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken. The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the CRF. A single measurement of respiratory rate is adequate. 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms For participant screening and pre -dose on Day 1, triplicate ECG measurements should be collected. For all subsequent ECG assessments, single measurements are to be collected. 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 8.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be necessary . 2018N394263_00"
156,page_156,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 44At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 10 minutes. 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Section 12.2 (Appendix 2) for the list of clinical labo ratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participa nt's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during participation in the study or within 3 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or ar e no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 12.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table 1). If laboratory values from non- protocol spe cified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 9.4.5. Pneumoni a All suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined b y the presence or new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of the following signs and s ymptoms: Increased cough Increased sputum purulence (colour) or production Auscultatory findings of adventitious sounds (e.g. egophony , bronchial breath sounds, rales, etc.) Dyspnea or tachy pnea Fever (oral temperature > 37.5 oC) Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) (> 10 x 109/L or > 15% immature forms) Hypoxemia (Hb O 2saturation < 88% or at least 2% lower than baseline value) 2018N394263_00"
157,page_157,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 45All pneumonias must be captured on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF. The Investigator and site staff should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in participants as the clin ical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. For all suspected cases of pneumonia, Investigators are strongl y encouraged to confirm the diagnosis (this includes obtaining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate ther apy as promptly as possible. Any microbiology or virology tests performed to determine etiology should be reported on the pneumonia eCRF page. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed or unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if app licable). 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.7. Genetics A 6 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics anal ysis component of the study. Participation in the genetics anal ysis is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . See Section 12.6 (Appendix 6) for Information regarding genetic research. Details on procedures for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in the SRM. 9.8. Biomarkers Collection of samples for biomar ker research is also part of this study . The following samples for biomarker research will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA: peripheral venous blood samples for the preparation of serum and plasma Samples will be tes ted for biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation (i.e. CRP), extracellular matrix turnover and remodelling to evaluate their association with the observed clinical responses or to help understand the underl ying biological responses to danirixin. In addition, with the participant’s consent, samples will be stored and may be used to investigate additional biomarkers thought to play a role in COPD disease progression or to evaluate their association with observed clinical responses to danirixin Samples a lso may be used for research to develop methods or support identification of prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes in COPD and related diseases. 2018N394263_00"

Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on COPD disease progression. There are no f ormal h ypothesis tests associated with this objective and no formal significance tests. The information acquired from this study will primarily be used to assess whether or not danirixin impacts disease progression and to quantify the effect that danirixin has on disease progression, specifically change in lung function as measured b y FEV 1decline and change in health -related quality of life as measured b y SGRQ total score to further support disease understanding and future studies. 10.1. Sample Size Determinati on Sample size is based primarily on feasibility for this study . Since there is much uncertaint y around the magnitude of the difference in the decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ along with the between -subject variabilit y for the specific patient population , the proposed sample size is unavoidably imprecise. Sample size may be adjusted using the predictions of final study outcome based on simulations and possible interim analyses. It is anticipated that screening 130 participants will allow for approximately 100 participants to enrol. In order to observe the effect of different sample sizes, various simulations were done to assess the impact of sample sizes of 50, 100, 150 and 200 with a 1:1 allocation to each treatment group [ Table 3 ]. The assumed variability for rate of decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ is 25 and 10, respectively. The correlation between rate of decline in FEV1 and change in SGRQ is assumed to be - 0.2.

The samples from the posterior pro bability distribution from the MCMC approximation were divided into four regions based on δFEV1and δSGRQtreatment effect cut- off values; δ FEV1≥0 and δSGRQ ≤0, δ FEV1≥0 and δ SGRQ>0, δFEV1<0 and δSGRQ≤0, and δ FEV1<0 and δSGRQ>0. Based on a 70% threshold, the proportion of the 1000 simulations meeting the requirement P(δFEV1≥0 & δSGRQ≤0)≥70% we re considered a success based on the joint definition 2018N394263_00"

The half widths of the 95% CI of the point estimate of the marginal treatment differences for FEV 1 (Figure 3) and SGRQ ( Figure 4) have the greatest reduction from a sample size of 50 to 100. A sample size of 100 will allow for an adequate level of confidence in the study success while also considering the precision of the treatment effect differences. 2018N394263_00"

Randomization will be stratified by smoking status (current vs. former). 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description All Participants This population w ill comprise all participants screened and for whom a record exists on the study database and will be used for the tabulation and listing of reasons for withdrawal before randomization and listings of AEs and SAEs for nonrandomized participants. Intent To Treat (ITT) This population will comprise all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. This will constitute the primary population for all analyses of efficacy and safet y. Outcomes will be reported accor ding to the randomized treatment allocation. Per-Protocol (PP) PopulationThis population will comprise of all patients in the I TT population who are not major protocol violators. Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analy zed according to the treatment they actually received. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses Treatment comparisons using all endpoints will be made using appropriate statistical techniques. Anal ysis methods for key endpoints are described below. Main anal ysis will use ITT unless noted. Further details on all analy ses will be described in the reporting and analysis plan (RAP). 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses The total probability of success will be defined as a combination of a joint and conditional state ment. The joint probability of success will be defined as the probability of the difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1between danirixin and placebo is greater than or equal to 0 and the difference in the change in SGRQ total score from baseline betwee n danirixin and placebo is less than or equal to 0 is greater than 70%. If the joint probability of success is less than 70%, success can further be defined based on each endpoint independentl y, where either the difference in the rate of decline in FEV 1is 2018N394263_00"

Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary Rate of decline in FEV 1and change from baseline in SGRQ t otal score Exploratory Will be described in detail in the RAP Lung Function Decline: Rate of Decline of FEV 1(mL/yr) The rate of decline of FEV 1will be derived from a repeated measures random coefficients model. Post-baseline FEV 1will be modelled inc luding terms for age, sex, smoking status, FEV 1at baseline, and BMI along with treatment group, time and treatment b y time interaction as fixed effects. Subject will be a random effect. Time will be defined as the number of day s since start of treatment. Only FEV 1values measured after baseline will be used in the model. Based on the results of previous studies, the study team will determine the time point at which post- baseline spirometry assessments will be included in the model to account for the initi al treatment response. The estimate of the rate of FEV 1decline will be the slope of the parameter estimate of the treatment b y time interaction term in the model. Contrasts will be calculated for the difference in treatment b y time interaction between dan irixin and placebo treatment groups to estimate the treatment difference. FEV 1= Treatment group + age + sex +smoking status+FEV1_BL+BMI+ time + treatment*time The rate of decline for each subject, the estimate of the slope parameter of the treatment by time interaction term, will be used as a co- primary endpoint for the joint anal ysis using both FEV 1and SGRQ. HRQoL: SGRQ A co -primary endpoint of interest is change in SGRQ total score (derived from SGRQ -C) from baseline. Change in SGRQ total scores from baseline will be derived using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment group, age, sex, smoking status, BMI, baseline SGRQ score, time as a categorical variable and a treatment b y time interaction term. Subject wil l be a random effect. Estimated treatment differences at the end of one y ear will be obtained. The difference of the least square mean change from baseline at 12 months will be derived. The adjusted SGRQ total score 2018N394263_00"
163,page_163,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 51change from baseline will used as the ot her co -primary endpoint for the joint analy sis using both FEV 1and SGRQ. Joint Analysis The joint analy sis will use the ITT population with all available FEV 1rate of decline and change in SGRQ data. The rate of decline (the slope parameter from the rand om coefficients model) of FEV 1, along with the change in SGRQ from the MMRM model will be extracted for each subject. These values will then be used to obtain MCMC approximations of the joint posterior distribution of the treatment differences between FEV 1decline and change in SGRQ between the danirixin and placebo groups. Based on the samples from the posterior distribution, the proportion of samples falling within certain treatment difference regions will be calculated and the probability of success will be derived. 10.4.2. Safety Analyses All safet y endpoints will be tabulated or plotted b y treatment group and will be performed on the Safet y Population. Further details will be described in the RAP. 10.4.3. Other A nalyses Exploratory biomarker analy ses will be described in the RAP. 10.4.4. Interim A nalyses Conducting an interim analy sis or futility assessment may not be practical due to an expected fast recruitment period. By the time enough data will accumulate for any meaningful interim anal ysis to support changes to the study design, recruitment of all study participants will have concluded. However, if recruitment takes a longer than anticipated, an interim analy sis to reassess the variability assumptions, estimate the probability of success at the end of study , and confirm t he directionality of the endpoints may be conducted. The RAP will describe the potential interim anal yses in greater detail. 2018N394263_00"

Study and Site Closure GSK or its desig nee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for an y reason at the sole discretion of GSK. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study suppli es have been collected and a stud y-site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the earl y closure of a stud y site b y the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidel ines Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator Discontinuation of further study treatment development 2018N394263_00"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urin alysis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progres sion of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the defin ition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" con stitutes an AE or SAE. 2018N394263_00"
178,page_178,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 66Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more seve re than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical pr ocedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs /symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a)Results in death b)Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to a n event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza tion In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s offi ce or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessa ry, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disr uption of a person’s ability to conduct 2018N394263_00"
179,page_179,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 67normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV even t page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2018N394263_00"
180,page_180,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 68Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnos tics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE /SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records befo re submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomf ort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: A n event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are fa cts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 2018N394263_00"
181,page_181,"2016N293064_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 69Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant ther apy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investiga tor has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the inve stigator will provide GSK with a copy of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. 2018N394263_00"

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be us ed to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single F SH measurement is insufficient and confirmatory testing with additional FSH and estradiol measurements is required. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Pregnancy Testing WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highl y sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at approximately monthly intervals during the stud y treatment period, after the last dose of study treatment and as required locally . Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when pregnancy is ot herwise suspected 2018N394263_00"

229,page_229,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 123. INTRODUCTION The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized by a prominent infiltration of neutrophils in lung tissue and the airway s. Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells are recruited to the l ung in response to various chemotactic factors, including chemokines. Specificall y, there is a large bod y of evidence that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor play s a pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung. For neutrophils, chemokine binding to the CXCR2 results in chemotaxis and cell activation, ultimately resulting in the release of a number of inflammatory mediators and proteases that are thought to contribute to the progressive fibrosis, airway stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman, 2009]. A reduction in tissue and airway neutrophilia is expected to result in downstream effects on mucus hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruction that are h ypothesized to underlie the development and worsening of respiratory s ymptoms and dec line in lung function that occurs in COPD. Molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity have been shown to reduce the influx of neutrophils into the lungs in healthy participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) and to reduce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchiectasis in association with improvements in measures of disease activity in some, but not all, studies [ O'By rne, 2016; Holz , 2010; Watz , 2016; Lazaar , 2011; Nair, 2012; Rennard , 2015]. Overall, the results of the reported clinical studies with CX CR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target patient population is important to achieving clinical benefit. Danirixin is a selective CXCR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti - inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory diseases and influenza. Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number YM2010/00163/07]. Clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated the pharmacody namic activity of danirixin (inhibition of ex vivo CXCL1 -induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils). Danirixin has also been tested in a Phase IIa study in symptomatic participants with mild to moderate COPD at risk for exacerbation [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163]. I n study 200163, twice dail y dosing with danirixin free base (75 mg bid) or placebo given on top of standard of care inhaled maintenance treatm ents was tested for one year. Analy ses of clinical endpoints from study 200163 demonstrated that danirixin, compared to placebo, reduced respiratory symptoms as measured with E -RS:COPD [ Miller , 2016]. 3.1. Stud y Rationale This protocol describes a pilot study to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on lung function and health related quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with 2018N394263_00"
230,page_230,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 13mild to moderate airflow obstruction identified from the COPDGene cohort. Study participants will continue with their standard of care inhaled medications (i.e. long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids) while receiving study treatment. Specificall y, this study aims to assess whether or not danirixin has the potential to impact disease progression in participants with a COPD progression score indicating they are likely to decline based on 5 y ear data from COPDGene and support the conduct of a larger Phase III stud y for d isease progression. In addition to lung function and HRQoL , this study will assess moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, health status (CAT), and rescue medication use. 3.2. Background COPD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006; Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016]. The morbidity and mortality of COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by the year2020, COPD is expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability [Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016]. The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is primarily due to small airway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an excessive inflammatory response in the lung, mainly caused b y cigarette smoking [ Celli , 2004]. COPD is characterized by symptoms of chronic and, in many patients, progressive breathlessness (or d yspnea), cough and sputum producti on. Many COPD patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the typical day to day variation [ Hurst , 2010]. These episodes of worsening symptoms (COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of CO PD-related and total health care costs. Despite several available therapies that have been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations and respiratory symptoms, many COPD patients continue to experience a high burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations resulting in a continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016]. Additionally , there is growing recognit ion that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well as smokers with preserved lung function suffer from a high burden of s ymptoms and COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [ Woodruff , 2016]. Therapies that effectivel y further reduce COPD exacerbations and improve respiratory symptoms could have a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly result in an improvement in COPD patients’ quality of life. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for the treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the management of current respiratory symptoms and subse quent worsening of s ymptoms resulting in COPD exacerbations should be an important component of COPD patient management [ GOL D, 2016]. Danirixin is being evaluated as an addit ion to standard of care inhaled therapies (i.e. long acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination therapies) and is targeting those COPD patients that continue to have a burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbati ons despite management with currentl y available COPD treatments. 2018N394263_00"

Risk A ssessment Investigational Product (IP) [Danirixin, GSK1325756] Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Testicular effects and male fertility The most sensitive species is the rat. Testicular effects present at doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in the rat include spermatid degeneration, seminiferous tubular degeneration and secondary epididy mal changes, including oligo/aspermia and/or epididy mal intratubular cellular debris. The no observed adve rse effect level ( NOAEL) in this study , based on the microscopic findings in the testis, was 50 mg/kg/day for male rats. The s ystemic exposure margins for the NOAEL for testicular effects in the rat is 7.3 -fold for an oral clinical dose of 50 mg BID free base tablet. The testicular effects seen in the rat have also been shown to directly impact on male fertility and the NOAEL for these reproductive effects was 100 mg/kg/day . Refer to IB Section 4.4 for full details No adverse events related to testicular effects have been observed in clinical studies to date.Standard safet y monitoring will be employ ed. The potential risk of testicular injury has been convey ed in the informed consent. PK modelling predicts that in a participant receiving 35 mg BID of the HBr salt, the risk of exposure exceeding the 2 -fold margin for AUC(0 -24) for the NOAEL of testicular effects is low. 2018N394263_00"

Host defense has not been studied directly in nonclinical studies. However, data in nonclinical species have not identified an increased risk of infection with danirixin. Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with two CXCR2 antagonists in the same chemical class as danirixin have not shown an increase in infections in challenge models (e.g., influenza viral load). Secondary bacterial infections after viral infection have not been directly evaluated in nonclinical studies. The data from clinical studies including healthy participants, COPD and influenza patients thus far show no evidence that participants taking danirixin have an increased infection rate compared with participants taking placebo. Neutropenia has been reported in clinical trials of other CXCR2 antagon ists. No instances of neutropenia have been reported in nonclinical studies with danirixin.

In healthy participants , the data are confounded b y the observation of low neutrophil counts before dosing or at follow -up, and were not dose -related, while in patients with influenza, neutrophil counts recovered while receiving danirixin, coincident with resolution of the viral infection. There have been no reports of neutrophil count decreases below the lower limit of norma l in patients with COPD who were treated with danirixin for one year. These data support the conclusion that a causal association of neutropenia with danirixin cannot be definitively established. 2018N394263_00"

Participants will have frequent study clinic visits for the evaluation of their disease s ymptoms. During these visits, participants will have spirometry , ECG, vital signs monitor ing, and phy sical examinations. Monitoring for worsening of their disease will also take place. Participants may benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing to the process of developing a new treatment in an area of unmet need, even if not directly beneficial for them All participants will continue with changes to their medications, where medically appropriate, to receive established standard of care. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical and clinical studies. I ts potency and duration of action supports its potential use as an oral, anti -inflammatory agent in the treatment of COPD with anticipated potential for bringing benefit to a serious condition that affects the lives of millions and contributes to significant morbidit y and mortality. In clinical trials completed to date danirixin has been well -tolerated and most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity The most commonly observed AEs have been nasophary ngitis, headache and diarrhea following administration of danirixin or placebo. There have been no treatment related clinically signif icant changes in vital signs orECG at an y dose of danirixin. Taking into accou nt the measures t aken to minimiz e risks to participants in this study , the potential risks identified in association with danirixin are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with COPD. 2018N394263_00"

Following screening and assessment of rescue medication use via a dail y diar y over study days -28 to 1, participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either danirixin 35mg tabl etsor placebo. Study treatment will be administer edtwice dail y for 52weeks [Figure 1 ]. There will be no pre -specified interim anal ysis for this study . An interim analy sis may be performed if it is determined that the enrolment is slow enough to allow it to be informative. There will be no IDMC for this study. An internal safety review team will meet approximately every 3 months (or as needed based on emerging data) to review available safet y information. Figure 1 Study Schematic 5.2. Number of Partici pants Approximately 130 participa nts will be screened to achieve 100 randomized in this study . It is anticipated that approximately 85 participants will complete the 12 months of treatment (assuming a 15% drop out rate). For the anal ysis of study assessments, several analy sis populations are defined in Section 10.3 . 2018N394263_00"
239,page_239,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 225.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all planned study visits including the last stud y visit and the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, par allel-group design. This is a well established design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. With the use of an enriched population, it is anticipated that one year of treatment will be sufficient to detect a trend in altering di sease progression. Danirixin has alread y been clinically investigated over one year treatment duration ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163 ). The data from this study will provide useful information in determining whether or not to progress to a Phase III study to explore an indication for slowing disease progression. 5.5. Dose Justification One dose of danirixin is proposed for this study , 35mg tablets BID. This dose was selected based on integrating information on: Dose -exposure -biomarker response using inhibition of ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils over the dose range of 0 -400mg (free base tabl et) in healthy volunteers (GSK Study No. CX3 112483). Evidence of reduced respiratory symptoms and improvement in health status in mild to moderate COPD participants from interim data in the Phase IIa study (GSK Study No. 200163). Relative bioavailability study comparing danirixin free base vs HBr ( GSK Study No. 201037). In the previous clinical studies, danirixin was a dministered as a free base tablet , whereas the danirixin formulation to be used in this study will be a hydrobromide salt tablet. The hy drobromide tablet has approximately twice the bioavailability of the free base tablet in healthy elderl y participants (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00, Study ID 201037 ). Thus the danirixin (hy drobromide tablet) 35mg BID dose for investigation in this study is expected to provide steady -state sy stemic exposure approximately equivalent to the 75mg BID (free base tablet) used in Study 200163. Predicte d stead y-state exposures and multiples of blood ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b pharmacology at the proposed danirixin doses are presented in Table 2. 2018N394263_00"

Discontinuation of Study Treatment 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinic al liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance [ FDA , 2009 ]. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered b y the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm below or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. 2018N394263_00"

QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording perio d. A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc > 500 msec OR Uncorrected QT > 600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec 2018N394263_00"
251,page_251,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 34For patients with underl ying bund le branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block < 450 msec > 500 msec 450 –480 msec ≥ 530 msec See the SoA ( Table 1 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Neutrophil Stopping Criteria A participant with a peripheral blood neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing. The neutrophil count should be monitored daily until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 9. 8.1.4. Temporary Discontinuation Temporary discontinuation of study treatment is allowed for up to 14 day s when medically necessary , e.g. for hospitalization for a COPD exa cerbation, other medical condition requiring hospitalization, or reduction in peripheral blood neutrophil counts  0.5 x 109/L. Temporary discontinuation for any other reason should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor. 8.1.5. Study Treatment Restart Study treatment restart after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Refer to Appendix 7 (Section 12.7)for full guidance for required actions and follow -up assessments to undertake if liver stopping criteria are met. Study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met can be considered once the neutrophil count has returned to within baseline and provided that no more than 14 days have elapsed since study medication was halted. The Investigator must obtain approval from the GSK Medical Monitor prior to restarting study treatment. See Appendix 9for the procedure to be followed for study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/he r own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural, compliance or administrative reasons. 2018N394263_00"

Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact atte mpts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 2018N394263_00"

STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Table 1) Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with t he sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduc t. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or re cord reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of I CF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedu re met the protocol - specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL . Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. FEV 1 9.1.1.1. Clinic Spirometry Spirometry using FEV 1 and FVC measurements (FEV%, and FVC% and FEV1/FVC will be calculated) will be performed in triplicate at time points listed in the SoA (Table 1). Spirometry assessments should be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines as outlin ed in the SRM . 9.1.1.2. Mobile Spirometry Spirometry will also be performed weekl y by the participants using a mobile spirometer at home. Details will be outlined in the SRM. 9.1.2. SGRQ -C The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific tool ( SGRQ - C) is a disease -specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL [ Meguro , 2007]. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of sy mptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. The SGRQ -Chas been used in 2018N394263_00"
254,page_254,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 37numerous previous studies of COPD participants and has been translated and validate d for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -Cis derived from the original SGRQ and produces SGRQ scores equivalent to the original SGRQ instrument [ Jones , 1992]. 9.1.3. CAT The COP D Assessment Test is a short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD [ Jones, 2009; Jones , 2012]. When completing the questionnaire, parti cipants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (maximum impairment) to 5 (no impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 9.1.4. COPD Exacerbations An exacerbation of COPD is defined b y a worsening of symptoms requiring additional treatment or hospitalization . Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. Exacerbations will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (e ven though the event may meet the definition of an SAE) as they are considered Disease Related Events (DREs). Only when the event is, in the Investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , or duration than expected for the individual participant, or the Inv estigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to stud y treatment should it be reported as an SAE (See Section 9.2). (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF (See Section 9.4.5 )). All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the participant’s study treatment temporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. The reason for temporaril y stopping study treatment and duration should be recorded in the eCRF. The date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF based on the Investigator’s judgement . 9.1.5. Patient Global Rating of Severity and Global Rating of Change in Disease Severity Participants will complete the Global Rating of COPD S everity at randomisation and final study visit or I P Discontinuation Visit. This single global question will ask participants to rate their severit y of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Participants will complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (overall disease) question at every visit following randomization (or Earl y Withdrawal (EW) Visit). Response 2018N394263_00"
255,page_255,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 38options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Asking at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the time the informed conse nt is signed b y the participant until the follow up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Table 1). All AEs will be collected from the start of study treatment (randomization vi sit) until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA ( Table 1) . Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtainin g informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs must be reported immediately and not more than 24 hrs to the sponsor , as indicated in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investig ator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended a nd non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is 2018N394263_00"

Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinic al investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report descri bing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascul ar and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ) andall deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in participants with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: COPD exacerbations Because these events are ty picall y associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page in the participant’s CRF within 72 hours after the investigator 2018N394263_00"
257,page_257,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 40becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by the Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis as described in Section 12.3 (Appendix 3 ). NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of great er intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product 9.2.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregn ancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 60 hours after the last dose of study treatment. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 12.5 (Appendix 5). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. . 9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of monitoring inhaled rescue medication use . In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of inc ident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be fo und in Section 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 9.2and Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ). 9.2.8.1. Time Period for Detecting Me dical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in which the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y inci dent at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptl y notify the sponsor. 2018N394263_00"

Follo w-up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same manner as other AEs (see Section 9.2). This applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study treatment or the study . The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes an y supplemental investigati ons as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the incident. New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated b y the investigator. 9.2.8.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to S ponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a medical device incident. Complete the Medical Device Incident Form for each participant who has a medical device incident with GSK medical devices provided for use during the study period. All of the header information in the form must be completed before sending to GSK. Original documents should be filed in the site study file. A cop y of the form must also be sent to the GKS study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. A copy of the form must also be sent to the GSK study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. For incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE o r SAE, the appropriate pages of the CRF must be completed. If there is an SAE, the completed CRF pages should be sent together with the Medical Device Incident From. If the participant is withdrawn due to a medi cal device incident, ensure the Study Conclusion page is completed. The same individual will be the contact for the receipt of medical device reports and SAEs. 9.2.8.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Medical Device Incidents The investigator will promptly report all incidents occurring with any medic al device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about certain safet y information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies . The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g., the head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the I RB/IEC. 2018N394263_00"

GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monit or immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until study treatment can no longer be detected sy stemically (at least 3 day s). 3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis as soon as possible from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be ma de by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, cardiovascular, respiratory , gastrointestinal and neurological s ystems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessme nts of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine position after 5 m inutes rest and will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken. The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the me asurement to be recorded in the CRF. A single measurement of respiratory rate is adequate. 2018N394263_00"
260,page_260,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 439.4.3. Electrocardiograms For participant screening and pre -dose on Day 1, triplicate ECG measurements should be collected. For all subsequent ECG assessments, single meas urement sare to be collected. 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 8.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc readings that may be necessary . At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 10 minutes. 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Section 12.2 (Appendix 2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered abnormal and clinically significant during participation in the study or within 3 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or b aseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the spo nsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Section 12.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table 1). If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant manage ment or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 9.4.5. Pneumonia All suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined b y the presence or new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of the following signs and s ymptoms: Increased cough Increased sputum purulence (colour) or production Auscultatory findings of adventitious sounds (e.g. egophon y, bronchial breath sounds, rales, etc.) 2018N394263_00"

The Investigator and site staff should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in participants as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. For all suspec ted cases of pneumonia, Investigators are strongl y encouraged to confirm the diagnosis (this includes obtaining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate therap y as promptly as possible. Any microbiology or virology tests performed to determine etiology should be reported on the pneumonia eCRF page. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed or unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable). 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.7. Genetics A 6 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics anal ysis component of the study. Participation i n the genetics anal ysis is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . See Section 12.6 (Appendix 6) for Information regarding genetic research. Details on procedures for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in the SRM. 9.8. Biomarkers Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study . The following samples for biomarker research will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA: peripheral venous blood samples for the preparation of serum a nd plasma Samples will be tested for biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation (i.e. CRP), extracellular matrix turnover and remodelling to evaluate their association with the 2018N394263_00"

In addition, with the participant’s consent, samples will be stored and may be used to investigate additional biomarkers thought to play a role in COPD disease progression or to evaluate their association with observed clinical res ponses to danirixin Samples also may be used for research to develop methods or support identification of prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes in COPD and related diseases. 9.9. Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on COPD disease progression. There are no formal h ypothesis tests associated with this objective and no formal significance tests. The information acquired from this study will primarily be used to assess whether or not danirixin impacts disease progression and to quantify the effect that danirixin has on disease progression, specifically change in lung function as measured b y FEV 1decline and change in health -related quality of life as measured b y SGRQ total score to further support disease understanding and futur e studies. 10.1. Sample Size Determination Sample size is based primarily on feasibility for this study . Since there is much uncertaint y around the magnitude of the difference in the decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ along with the between -subject variabilit y for the specific patient population, the proposed sample size is unavoidably imprecise. Sample size may be adjusted using the predictions of final study outcome based on simulations and possible interim analy ses. It is anticipated that screening 130 participants will allow for approximately 100 participants to enrol. In order to observe the effect of different sample sizes, various simulations were done to assess the impact of sample sizes of 5 0, 100, 150 and 200 with a 1:1 allocation to each treatment group [ Table 3 ]. The assumed variability for rate of decline in FEV 1and change in SGRQ is 25 and 10, resp ectivel y. The correlation between rate of decline in FEV1 and change in SGRQ is assumed to be - 0.2.

Intent To Treat (ITT) This population will comprise all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. This will constitute the primary population for all analyses of efficacy and safet y. Outcomes will be reported according to the randomized treatm ent allocation. Per-Protocol (PP) PopulationThis population will comprise of all patients in the I TT population who are not major protocol violators. Safety All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be an alyzed according to the treatment they actually received. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses Treatment comparisons using all endpoints will be made using appropriate statistical techniques. Anal ysis methods for key endpoints are described below.

267,page_267,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 50Lung Function Decline: Rate of Decline of FEV 1(mL/yr) The rate of decline of FEV 1will be derived from a repeated measures random coefficients model. Post-baseline FEV 1will be modelled including terms for age, sex, smoking status, FEV 1at baseline, and BMI along with treatment group, time and treatment b y time interaction as fixed effects. Subject will be a random effect. Time will be defined as the number of day s since start of treatment. Only FEV 1values measured after baseline will be used in the model. Based on the results of previous studies, the study team will determine the time point at which post- baseline spirometry assessments will be included in the model to account for the initial treatment response. The estimate of the rate of FEV 1decline will be the slope of the parameter estimate of the treatment b y time interaction term in the model. Contrasts will be calculated for the difference in treatment b y time interaction between danirixin and placebo treatment groups to estimate the treatment difference. FEV 1= Treatment group + age + sex +smoking status+FEV1_BL+BMI+ time + treatment*time The rate of decline for each subject, the estimate of the slope parameter of the treatment by time interaction term, will be used as a co- primary endpoint for the joint anal ysis using both FEV 1and SGRQ. HRQoL: SGRQ A co -primary endpoint of interest is change in SGRQ total score (derived from SGRQ -C) from baseline. Change in SGRQ total scores from baseline will be derived using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment group, age, sex, smoking status, BMI, baseline SGRQ score, time as a categorical variable and a treatment b y time interaction term. Subject will be a random effect. Estimated treatment differences at the end of one y ear will be obtained. The difference of the least square mean change from baseline at 12 months will be derived. The adjusted SGRQ total score change from baseline will used as the other co -primary endpoint for the joint analy sis using both FEV 1and SGRQ. Joint Analysis The joint analy sis will use the ITT population with all available FEV 1rate of decline and change in SGRQ data. The rate of decline (the slope parameter from the random coefficients model) of FEV 1, along with the change in SGRQ from the MMRM model will be extracted for each subject. These values will then be used to obtain MCMC approximations of the joint posterior distribution of the treatment differences between FEV 1decline and change in SGRQ between the danir ixin and placebo groups. Based on the samples from the posterior distribution, the proportion of samples falling within certain treatment difference regions will be calculated and the probability of success will be derived. 2018N394263_00"

Interim A nalyses Conducting an interim analy sis or futility assessment may not be practical due to an expected fast recruitment period. By the time enough data will accumulate for any meaningful interim anal ysis to support changes to the study design, recruitment of all study partici pants will have concluded. However, if recruitment takes a longer than anticipated, an interim analy sis to reassess the variability assumptions, estimate the probability of success at the end of study , and confirm the directionality of the endpoints may beconducted. The RAP will describe the potential interim anal yses in greater detail. 2018N394263_00"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluatin g, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal labor atory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientif ic judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected ove rdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of effic acy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" constitutes an AE or SAE. 2018N394263_00"
283,page_283,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 66Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expec ted for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even i f serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treat ment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent d isability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 2018N394263_00"
284,page_284,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 67normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the partic ipant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2018N394263_00"
285,page_285,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 68Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: A n event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 2018N394263_00"
286,page_286,"2016N293064_01 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 69Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/ she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the inves tigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the upda ted causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated infor mation will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. 2018N394263_00"

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single F SH measurement is insufficient and confirmatory testing with additional FSH and estradiol measurements is required. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be requir ed to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Contraception Guidance Male participants Male participants with female partners of child- bearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following during the protocol -defined time frame in Section 6.1: Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifesty le (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent 2018N394263_00"

Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants in clinical studies. b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptibl e to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 60 hours after the last dose of stud y treatment Pregnancy Testing WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highl y sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test Additional pregnancy testing will be performed at approximately monthly intervals during the studytreatment period ,after the last dose of study treatment and as required locally . Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cy cle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected Pregnancy testing, with a high sensitivity test will be performed using the test kit provided b y the central laboratory and approved by the sponsor and in accordance with instructions provided in the test kit package insert. Collection of Pregnancy Information Male participants with partners who become pregnant Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female partner of a male study participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study . This applies only to participants who receive study treatment . After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directl y, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy . Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK Generally , follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date.

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which , directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incident associated with a device happened and The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects 2018N394263_00"

322,page_322,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 113. INTRODUCTION The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized by a prominent infiltration of neutrophils in lung tissue and the airway s. Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells are recruited to the lung in response to various chemotactic factors, including chemokines. Specific ally, there is a large bod y of evidence that the CXCR2 chemokine receptor play s a pivotal role in neutrophil recruitment to the lung. For neutrophils, chemokine binding to the CXCR2 results in chemotaxis and cell activation, ultimately resulting in the re lease of a number of inflammatory mediators and proteases that are thought to contribute to the progressive fibrosis, airway stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma characteristic of COPD. Selective antagonism of the interaction between CXCR2 and its ligands is a potential strategy for reducing the inflammation in COPD [ Chapman, 2009]. A reduction in tissue and airway neutrophilia is expected to result in downstream effects on mucus hypersecretion, lung inflammation, and tissue destruction that are h ypothesized to underlie the development and worsening of respiratory s ymptoms and decline in lung function that occurs in COPD. Molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity have been shown to reduce the influx of neutrophils into the lungs in healthy participants (e.g. ozone or LPS challenge models) and to reduce sputum and tissue neutrophils in the lungs of patients with severe, neutrophilic asthma, COPD and bronchi ectasis in association with improvements in measures of disease activity in some, but not all, studies [ O'By rne, 2016; Holz , 2010; Watz , 2016; Lazaar , 2011; Nair, 2012; Rennard , 2015]. Overall, the results of the reported clinical studies with CXCR2 antagonists suggest that careful selection of the target patient population is important to achieving clinical benefit. Danirixin is a selective CXCR2 antagonist being developed as a potential anti - inflammatory agent for the treatment of COPD and other inflammatory diseases and influenza. Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies [ GlaxoSmithKline Document Number YM2010/00163/07]. Clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated the pharmacody namic activity of danirixin (inhibition of ex vivo CXCL1 -induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils). Danirixin has also been tested in a Phase IIa study in symptomatic participants with mild to moderate COPD at risk for exacerbation [GlaxoSmi thKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163 ]. In study 200163, twice dail y dosing with danirixin free base (75 mg bid) or placebo given on top of standard of care inhaled maintenance treatm ents was tested for one y ear. Analy ses of clinical endpoints from study 200163 demonstrated that danirixin, compared to placebo, reduced respiratory symptoms as measured with E -RS:COPD [ Miller , 2016]. 3.1. Stud y Rationale This protocol describes a pilot study to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on lung function and health rela ted quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with 2018N394263_00"
323,page_323,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 12mild to mode rate airflow obstruction identified from the COPDGene cohort . Study participants will continue with their standard of care inhaled medications (i.e. long acting bronchodilators with or without inhaled corticosteroids) while re ceiving study treatment. Specificall y, this study aims to assess whether or not danirixin has the potential to impact disease progression in participants with a COPD progression score indicating they are likely to decline based on 5 y ear data from COPDGen e and support the conduct of a larger Phase III stud y for disease progression. In addition to lung function and HRQoL , this study will assess moderate/severe COPD exacerbations, health status (CAT), and rescue medication use . 3.2. Background COPD is a major cau se of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of deaths annuall y worldwide contributing significantly to health care costs [ Mathers , 2006; Lopez -Campos, 2016; Vastava , 2015; GOLD, 2016]. The morbidity and mortality of COPD are continuing to increase and worldwide and, by the year 2020, COPD is expected to be the third leading cause of death and fifth leading cause of disability [Mathers , 2006; Lopez-Campos , 2016]. The airflow limitation that characterizes COPD is primarily due to small airway s disease and parenchy mal destruction associated with an excessive inflammatory response in the lung, mainly caused b y cigarette smoking [ Celli , 2004]. COPD is characterized by s ymptoms of chronic and, in many patients, progressive breathlessness (or d yspnea), cough and sputum production. Many COPD patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms that is bey ond the typical day to day variation [ Hurst , 2010]. These episodes of worsening symptoms (COPD exacerbations) account for a significant proportion of COPD- related and total health care costs. Despite s everal available therapies that have been shown to reduce COPD exacerbations and respiratory symptoms, many COPD patients continue to experience a high burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations resulting in a continuing unmet medical need [ Vestbo, 2016]. Additionally , there is growing recognition that a high percentage of COPD patients with mild airflow limitation as well as smokers with preserved lung function s uffer from a high burden of s ymptoms and COPD exacerbations with a subsequent impact on health status [ Woodruff , 2016]. Therapies that effectivel y further reduce COPD exacerbations and improve respiratory symptoms could have a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly result in an improvement in COPD patients’ quality of life. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guid elines for the treatment and management of patients with COPD recommend that the management of current respiratory symptoms and subsequent worsening of s ymptoms resulting in COPD exacerbations should be an important component of COPD patient management [ GOL D, 2016]. Danirixin is being evaluated as an addition to standard of care inhaled therapies (i.e. long acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilator/corticosteroid combination therapies) a nd is targeting those COPD patients that continue to have a burden of respiratory symptoms and COPD exacerbations despite management with currentl y available COPD treatments. 2018N394263_00"

Risk A ssessment Investigational Product (IP) [Danirixin, GSK1325756] Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Testicular effects and male fertility The most sensitive species is the rat. Testicular effects present at doses ≥150 mg/kg/day in the rat include spermatid degeneration, seminiferous tubular degeneration and secondary epididy mal changes, including oligo/aspermia and/or epididy mal intratubular cellular debris. The no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL) in this study , based on the microscopic findings in the testis, was 50 mg/kg/day for male rats. The s ystemic exposure margins for the NOAEL for testicular effects in the rat is 7.3 -fold for a n oral clinical dose of 50 mg BID free base tablet. The testicular effects seen in the rat have also been shown to directly impact on male fertility and the NOAEL for these reproductive effects was 100 mg/kg/day . Refer to IB Section 4.4 for full details No adverse events related to testicular effects have been observed in clinical studies to date.Standard safet y monitoring will be employ ed. The potential risk of testicular injury has been convey ed in the informed consent. PK modelling predicts that in a participant receiving 35 mg BID of the HBr salt, the risk of exposure exceeding the 2 -fold margin for AUC(0 -24) for the NOAEL of testicular effects is low. 2018N394263_00"

Host defense has not been studied directly in nonclinical studies. However, data in nonclinical species have not identified an increased risk of infection with danirixin. Nonclinical studies in mice and ferrets with two CXCR2 antagonists in the same chemical class as danirixin have not shown an increase in infections in challenge models (e.g., influenza viral load). Secondary bacterial infections after viral infection have not been directly evaluated in nonclinical studies. The data from clinical studies including healthy participants, COPD and influenza patients thus far show no evidence that participants taking danirixin have an increased infection rate compared with participants taking placebo. Neutropenia has been reported in clinical trials of other CXCR2 antagon ists. No instances of neutropenia have been reported in nonclinical studies with danirixin.

In healthy participants , the data are confounded b y the observation of low neutrophil counts before dosing or at follow -up, and were not dose -related, while in patients with influenza, neutrophil counts recovered while receiving danirixin, coincident with resolution of the viral infection. There have been no reports of neutrophil count decreases below the lower limit of norma l in patients with COPD who were treated with danirixin for one year. These data support the conclusion that a causal association of neutropenia with danirixin cannot be definitively established. 2018N394263_00"

Participants will have frequent study clinic visits for the evaluation of their disease s ymptoms. During these visits, particip ants will have spirometry , ECG, vital signs monitoring, and phy sical examinations. Monitoring for worsening of their disease will also take place. Participants may benefit from the knowledge that they are contributing to the process of developing a new t reatment in an area of unmet need, even if not directly beneficial for them All participants will continue with changes to their medications, where medically appropriate, to receive established standard of care. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical and clinical studies. I ts potency and duration of action supports its potential use as an oral, anti -inflammatory agent in the treatment of COPD with anticipated potential for bringing benefit to a serious condition that affects the lives of millions and contributes to significant morbidit y and mortality. In clinical trials completed to date danirixin has been well -tolerated and most adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate in intensity The most commonly observed AEs have been nasophary ngitis, headache and diarrhea following administration of danirixin or placebo. There have been no treatment related clinically signif icant changes in vital signs orECG at an y dose of danirixin. Taking into accou nt the measures taken to minimiz e risks to participants in this study , the potential risks identified in association with danirixin are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with COPD . 2018N394263_00"

Following screening and assessment of rescue medication use via a dail y diar y over study days -7 to 1, participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive eithe rdanirixin 35mg tablets or placebo. Study treatment will be administer edtwice dail y for 52weeks [Figure 1]. There will be no pre -specified interim anal ysis for t his study . An interim analy sis may be performed if it is determined that the enrolment is slow enough to allow it to be informative. There will be no IDMC for this study. A n internal safety review team will meet approximately every 3 months (or as needed based on emerging data) to review available safet y information. Figure 1 Study Schematic 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 130 participa nts will be screened to achieve 100 randomized in this study . It is anticipated that approximately 85 participants will complete the 12 months of treatment (assuming a 15% drop out rate). For the anal ysis of study assessments, several analy sis populations are defined in Section 10.3. 2018N394263_00"
332,page_332,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 215.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all planned study visits including the last stud y visit and the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, parallel- group design. This is a well established design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. With the use of an enriched population, it is anticipated that one y ear of treatment will be sufficient to detect a trend in altering disease progression. Danirixin has alread y been clinically investigated over one year treatment duration ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N180289_03 Study ID 200163 ). The data from this study will provide useful information in determining whether or not to progress to a Phase III study to explore an indication for slowing disease progression. 5.5. Dose Justification One dose of danirixin is proposed for thi s study , 35mg tablets BID. This dose was selected based on integrating information on: Dose -exposure -biomarker response using inhibition of ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b expression on peripheral blood neutrophils over the dose range of 0 -400mg (free base tablet) in healthy volunteers (GSK Study No. CX3 112483). Evidence of reduced respiratory symptoms and improvement in health status in mild to moderate COPD participants from interim data in the Phase IIa study (GSK Study No. 200163). Relative bioavailability study comparing danirixin free base vs HBr (GSK Study No. 201037). In the previous clinical studies, danirixin was a dministered as a free base tablet , whereas the danirixin formul ation to be used in this stud y will be a hydrobromide salt tablet. The hy drobromide tablet has approximately twice the bioavailability of the free base tablet in healthy elderl y participants (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2015N248339_00, Study ID 201037 ). Thus the dani rixin (hy drobromide tablet) 35mg BID dose for investigation in this study is expected to provide steady -state sy stemic exposure approximately equivalent t o the 75mg BID (free base tablet) used in Study 200163. Predicted stead y-state exposures and multiples of blood ex vivo CXCL 1-induced CD11b pharmacology at the proposed danirixin doses are presented in Table 2. 2018N394263_00"

Treatment Compliance When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment directl y from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents. The dose of study treatment and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the stud y site staff other than the person administering the stud y treatment. When participants self -administer study treatment(s) at home, compliance with study treatment administration will be assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and documented in the source documents and CRF. In addition, participants will be asked to confirm study administration each day in the daily ediary . Study participants who are not compliant with study treatment administration requirements should be re -educated on the importance of treatment compliance. Every effort should b e made to keep participants in the study . Participants who continue to be non -compliant after several attempts to re -educate may be discontinued after consultation with the GSK study team. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrolment or receives during the stud y must be recorded along with: reason for use dates of administration including start and end dates 2018N394263_00"

Pneumococcal vaccine may also be administered, when indicated, based on applicable local or national guidelines. Additional vaccination s may be administered when indicated. An y vaccination administered during the study should be recorded as a concomitant therapy . 7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the pos t- study care of the participant. GSK will not provide post- study treatment. There are no plans to provide the study treatment for compassionate use following study completion. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Sto pping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines a re in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance [ FDA , 2009 ]. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investiga tor when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm below or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. 2018N394263_00"
343,page_343,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 32Liver Safet y Required Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in Appendix 7 : Liver Safet y: Required Actions and Follow -up Assessments ). 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discon tinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECG s and other non- protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc > 500 msec OR Uncorrected QT > 600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec 2018N394263_00"
344,page_344,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 33For patients with underl ying bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block < 450 msec > 500 msec 450 –480 msec ≥ 530 msec See the SoA ( Table 1 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Neutrophil Stopping Criteria A participant with a peripheral blood neutrophil count 0.5 x 109/L that is confirmed on repeat testing will be instructed to suspend dosing. The neutrophil count should be monitored daily until it returns to within the baseline value, as detailed in Appendix 9 . 8.1.4. Temporary Discontinuation Temporary discontinuation of study treatment is allowed for up to 14 day s when medically necessary , e.g. for hospitalization for a COPD exacerbation, other medical condition requiring hospitalization, or reduction in peripheral blood neutrophil counts  0.5 x 109/L. Temporary discontinuation for any other reason should be discussed with the GSK Medical Monitor. 8.1.5. Study Treatment Restart Study treatment restart after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Refer to Appendix 7 (Section 12.7)for full guidance for required actions and follow -up assessments to undertake if liver stopping criteria are met. Study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met can be considered once the neutrophil count has returned to within baseline and provided that no more than 14 days have elapsed since study medication was halted. The Investigator must obtain approval from the GSK Medical Monitor prior to restarting study treatment. See Appendix 9 for the procedure to be followed for study treatment restart after neutrophil stopping criteria are met. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioural, compliance or administrative r easons. 2018N394263_00"
345,page_345,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 34If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of an y samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not t he participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 2018N394263_00"
346,page_346,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 359. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Table 1) Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential part icipants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the pa rticipant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of I CF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol - specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500 mL . Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technica l issues with the samples. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. FEV 1 9.1.1.1. Clinic Spirometry Spirometry using FEV 1 and FVC measurements (FEV%, and FVC% and FEV1/FVC will be calculated) will be performed in triplicate at time points listed in the SoA (Table 1). Spirometry assessments should be performed in accordance with ATS/ERS guidelines as outlined in the SRM . 9.1.1.2. Mobile Spirometry Spirometry will also be performed weekl y by the participants using a mobile spirometer at home. Details will be outlined in the SRM. 9.1.2. SGRQ -C The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific tool ( SGRQ -C) is a disease -specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD patient’s HRQoL [ Meguro , 2007]. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of sy mptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. The SGRQ -Chas been used in 2018N394263_00"
347,page_347,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 36numerous previous studies of COPD participants and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -Cis derived from the original SGRQ and produc es SGRQ scores equivalent to the original SGRQ instrument [ Jones , 1992]. 9.1.3. CAT The COPD Assessment Test is a short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD [ Jones, 2009; Jones , 2012]. When completing the questionnair e, participants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (maximum impairment) to 5 (no impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 9.1.4. COPD Exacerbations An exacerbation of COPD is defined b y a worse ning of s ymptoms requiring additional treatment or hospitalization . Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. Exacerbations will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs t o GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of an SAE) as they are considered Disease Related Events (DREs). Only when the event is, in the Investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , or duration than expected for the individual participant, or the Investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to stud y treatment should it be reported as an SAE (See Section 9.2). (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF (See Section 9.4.5 )). All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents and the exacerbation page of the eCRF. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the participant’s study treatment temporaril y in order to treat the COPD exacerba tion. The reason for temporaril y stopping study treatment and duration should be recorded in the eCRF. The date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF based on the Investigator’s judgement . 9.1.5. Patient Global Rating of Severity and Global Rating of Change in Disease Severity Participants will complete the Global Rating of COPD S everity at randomisation and final study visit or I P Discontinuation Visit. This single global question will ask participants to rate their severit y of COPD on a four point scale (mild, moderate, severe, very severe). Participants will complete a Global Rating of Change in COPD (o verall disease) question at every visit following randomization (or Earl y Withdrawal (EW) Visit). Response 2018N394263_00"
348,page_348,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 37options will be on a 7 point L ikert scale ranging from much better to much worse. Asking at each Visit allows for early detection of response as well as continued response. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenti ng, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see S ection 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the time the informed conse nt is signed by the participant until the follow up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Table 1). All AEs will be collected from the start of study treatment (randomiz ation visit) until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA ( Table 1) . Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs must be reported immediately and not more than 24 h rs to the sponsor , as indicated in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to th e sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharg ed from the study , and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 (Section 12.4). 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.2.3. Follow -up of AEs and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subse quent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is 2018N394263_00"
349,page_349,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 38resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ) andall deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CR F within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in participants with COPD and can be seri ous/life threatening: COPD exacerbations Because these events are ty picall y associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the defi nition of an SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page in the participant’s CRF within 72 hours after the investigator 2018N394263_00"
350,page_350,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 39becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by the Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis as described in Section 12.3 (Appendix 3 ). NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product 9.2.7. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 60 hours after the last dose of study treatment. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 12.5 (Appendix 5). Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, conge nital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. . 9.2.8. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of monitoring inhaled rescue medication use . In order to fulfill regulato ry reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be fo und in Section 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 9.2and Section 12.4 (Appendix 4 ). 9.2.8.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in which the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptl y notify the sponsor. 2018N394263_00"
351,page_351,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 40The method of documenting Medical Device In cident s is provided in Section 12.8 (Appendix 8 ). 9.2.8.2. Follo w-up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same manner as other AEs (see Section 9.2). This applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study treatment or the study . The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes an y supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the incident. New or updated informa tion will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated b y the investigator. 9.2.8.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investi gator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a medical device incident. Complete the Medical Device Incident Form for each participant who has a medical device incident with GSK medical devices provided for use during the study period. All of the header information in the form must be completed before sending to GSK. Original documents should be filed in the site study file. A cop y of the form must also be sent to the GKS study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. A copy of the form must also be sent to the GSK study monitor. Contact details will be included in the SRM. For incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE or SAE, the appropriate pages of the CRF must be completed. If there is an SAE, the completed CRF pages should be sent together with the Medical Device Incident From. If the participant is withdrawn due to a medi cal device incident, ensure the Study Conclusion page is completed. The same individual will be the contact for the receipt of medical devic e reports and SAEs. 9.2.8.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Medical Device Incidents The investigator will promptly report all incidents occurring with any medical device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibil ity to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about certain safet y information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies. The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g., the head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the I RB/IEC. 2018N394263_00"
352,page_352,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 419.3. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of study treatment 4 tablets in a day will be considered an overdose . GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator/treating ph ysician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until stu dy treatment can no longer be detected sy stemically (at least 3 day s). 3.Obtain a plasma sample for PK anal ysis as soon as possible from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). 4.Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, cardiovascular, respiratory , gastroint estinal and neurological s ystems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Three readings of blood pressure and pulse will be taken. The first reading should be rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement to be recorded in the CRF. A single measurement of respiratory rate is adequate. 2018N394263_00"
353,page_353,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 429.4.3. Electrocardi ograms For participant screening and pre -dose on Day 1, triplicate ECG measurements should be collected. For all subsequent ECG assessments, single measurement sare to be collected. 12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in the SoA using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Refer to Section 8.1.2 for QTc withdrawal criteria and additional QTc read ings that may be necessary . At each time point at which triplicate ECG are required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicates should be completed in less than 10 minutes. 9.4.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Section 12.2 (Appendix 2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and freq uency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered abnorma l and clinically significant during participation in the study or within 3 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Secti on 12.2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA ( Table 1). If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE), then the results must be recorded in the CRF. 9.4.5. Pneumonia All suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined b y the presence or new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of the following signs and s ymptoms: Increased cough Increased sputum purulence (colour) or production Auscultatory findings of adventitious sounds (e.g. egophon y, bronchial breath sounds, rales, etc.) 2018N394263_00"
354,page_354,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 43Dyspnea or tachy pnea Fever (oral temperature > 37.5 oC) Elevated white blood cell count (WBC) (> 10 x 109/L or > 15% immature forms) Hypoxemia (Hb O 2saturation < 88% or at least 2% lower than baseline value) All pneumonias must be captured on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF. The Investigator and site staff should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in participants as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the symptoms of COPD exacerbations. For all suspected cases of pneumonia, Investigators are strongl y encouraged to confirm the diagnosis (this incl udes obtaining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate therap y as promptly as possible. Any microbiology or virology tests performed to determine etiology should be reported on the pneumonia eCRF page. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y conf irmed or unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable). 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.7. Genetics A 6 mL whole blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics anal ysis component of the study. Participation in the genetics anal ysis is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic r esearch may still participate in the study . See Section 12.6 (Appendix 6) for Information regarding genetic research. Details on procedures for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in the SRM. 9.8. Biomarkers Collection of samples for biomarker research is also part of this study . The following samples for bi omarker research will be collected from all participants in this study as specified in the SoA: peripheral venous blood samples for the preparation of serum and plasma Samples will be tested for biomarkers that are indicative of inflammation (i.e. CRP), extracellular matrix turnover and remodelling to evaluate their association with the 2018N394263_00"

Health Econom ics OR Medical Reso urce Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Re source Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of danirixin HBr 35mg tablets on COPD disease progression. There are no formal hypothesis tests associated with this objective and no formal significance tests. Th e information acquired from this study will primarily be used to assess whether or not danirixin impacts disease progression and to quantify the effect that danirixin has on disease progression, specifically change in lung function as measured by FEV 1 decline and change in health -related quality of life as measured by SGRQ total score to furthe r support disease understanding and future studies. 10.1. Sample Size Determination Sample size is based primarily on feasibil ity for this study. Since there is much uncertainty around the magnitude of the difference in the decline in FEV 1 and change in SGRQ along with the between-s ubject variability for the specific patient population, the proposed sample size is unavoi dably imprecise. Sample size may be adjusted using the predictions of final study outcome based on si mulations and possible interim analyses. It is anticipated that screening 130 participants will allow for approximately 100 participants to enrol. In order to observe the effect of different sample sizes, various simulations were done to assess the impact of sample sizes of 50, 100, 150 and 200 with a 1:1 allocation to each treatment group [Table 3]. The assumed va riability for rate of decline in FEV 1 and change in SGRQ is 25 and 10, respectively. The correlation between rate of decline in FEV1 and change in SGRQ is assumed to be -0.2.

The samples from the posterior probability distribution from the MCMC approximation were divided into four regions based on δ FEV1 and δSGRQ treatment effect cut-off values; δFEV1≥0 and δSGRQ ≤0, δ FEV1≥0 and δ SGRQ>0, δ FEV1<0 and δ SGRQ≤0, and δ FEV1<0 and δ SGRQ>0. Based on a 70% threshold, the proportion of the 1000 simulations meeting the requirement P(δFEV1≥0 & δ SGRQ≤0) ≥ 70% were considered a succe ss based on the joint definition [Figure 2, Table 4]. If P( δFEV1≥0 & δ SGRQ≤0) < 70%, success could further be defined based on each endpoint independently where P( δFEV1 ≥ 0) ≥ 80% or P( δSGRQ ≤ 0) ≥ 80%.

The half widths of the 95% CI of the point estimate of the marginal treatment differences for FEV 1 (Figure 3) and SGRQ (Figure 4) have the greatest reduction from a sample size of 50 to 100.

Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description All Participants This population will comprise all participants screened and for whom a record exists on the study database and will be used for the tabulation and listing of reasons for withdrawal before randomization and listings of AEs and SAEs for nonrandomized participants. Intent To Treat (ITT) This population will comprise all participants randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. This will constitute the primary population for all analyses of efficacy and safet y. Outcomes will be reported according to the randomized treatment allocation. Per-Protocol (PP) PopulationThis population will comprise of all patients in the I TT population who are not major protocol violators. Safety Allrandomized participants who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analy zed according to the treatment they actually received. 10.4.

360,page_360,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 49Lung Function Decline: Rate of Decline of FEV 1(mL/yr) The rate of decline of FEV 1will be derived from a repeated measures random coefficients model. Post-baseline FEV 1will be modelled including terms for age, sex, smoking status, FEV 1at baseline, and BMI along with treatment group, time and treatment b y time interaction as fixed effects. Subject will be a random effect. Time will be defined as the number of day s since start of treatment. Only FEV 1values measured after baseline will be used in the model. Based on the results of previous studies, the study team will determine the time point at which post- baseline s pirometry assessments will be included in the model to account for t he initial treatment response. The estimate of the rate of FEV 1decline will be the slope of the parameter estimate of the treatment b y time interaction term in the model. Contrasts will b e calculated for the difference in treatment b y time interaction between danirixin and placebo treatment groups to esti mate the treatment difference. FEV 1= Treatment group + age + sex +smoking status+FEV1_BL+BMI+ time + treatment*time The rate of decline for each subject, the estimate of the slope parameter of the treatment by time interaction term, will be used as a co- primary endpoint for the joint anal ysis using both FEV 1and SGRQ . HRQoL: SGRQ A co -primary endpoint of interest is change in SGR Qtotal score (derived from SGRQ -C) from baseline. Change in SGRQ total scores from baseline will be derived using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment group, age, sex, smoking status, BMI, baseline SGRQ score, t ime as a categorical variable and a treatment b y time interaction term. Subject will be a random effect. Estimated treatment differences at the end of one y ear will be obtained. The difference of the least square mean change from baseline at 12 months will be derived. The adjusted SGRQ total score change from baseline will used as the other co -primary endpoint for the joint analy sis using both FEV 1and SGRQ . Joint Analysis The joint analy sis will use the ITT population with all available FEV 1rate of decl ine and change in SGRQ data. The rate of decline (the slope parameter from the random coefficients model) of FEV 1, along with the change in SGRQ from the MMRM model will be extracted for each subject. These values will then be used to obtain MCMC approxim ations of the joint posterior distribution of the treatment differences between FEV 1decline and change in SGRQ between the danirixin and placebo groups. Based on the samples from the posterior distribution, the proportion of samples falling within certain treatment differe nce regions will be calculated and the probability of success will be derived. 2018N394263_00"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AEDefinition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and sc ientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a su spected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" constitutes anAE or SAE. 2018N394263_00"
376,page_376,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 65Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in per sistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 2018N394263_00"
377,page_377,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 66normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated h eadache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize t he participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2018N394263_00"
378,page_378,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 67Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies o f the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the dia gnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: A n event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ wh en it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine th e relationship. 2018N394263_00"
379,page_379,"2016N293064_00 CONFIDENTIA L 205864 68Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will a lso consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment o f causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK .However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every eve nt before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. 2018N394263_00"

P ostmenopausal female A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contrac eption or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effec tive contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Contraception Guidance Male participants Male participants with fem ale partners of child -bearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following during the protocol -defined time frame in Section 6.1: Are abstinent from penile- vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifesty le (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent Agree to use a male condom plus an additional method of contraception with a failure rate of <1% per year as described in Table 6when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential 2018N394263_00"

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death o r serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incident associated with a device happened and The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to bod y structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects 2018N394263_00"
