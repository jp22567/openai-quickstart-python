Study Code: AUR -VCS -2017-03 Objectives: Primary Objective : • To assess the efficacy of voclosporin in achieving complete or partial remission of proteinuria after 24 weeks of therapy in subjects with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Secondary Objective: • To assess the safety and tolerability of voclosporin over 24 weeks in subjects with FSGS. Design: Open -label , 24-week, multicenter , exploratory cohort study of voclosporin . Treatment: Investigational Treatment: Voclosporin softgel capsules containing 7.9 mg drug. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and take voclosporin 23.7 mg orally ( PO), twice daily (BID) . The dose level of voclosporin for Cohort 2 ( at least 10 subjects) will be determined by analysis of efficacy and safety data at Week 12 from the first 5-6 subjects in Cohort 1. Inclusion Criteria: 1. Written informed consent before any study -specific procedures are performed. 2. Male or female subjects with a minimum age of 18 years (or legal age of consent if >18 years) to 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent. 3. Primary FSGS diagnosed by renal biopsy within 6 months prior to the screening visit. Biopsy results over 6 months prior to screening may be permitted following review with the Medical Monitor to confirm eligibility ."
5,page_5,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 6 of 111 Inclusion Criteria (cont’d): 4. At initial screening assessment and at last qualifying assessment during screening period prior to baseline, FSGS subjects must have a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) of ≥2. 0 mg/mg. Subjects can be treatment -naïve or receiving steroid treatment (oral or IV) for FSGS. Subjects taking steroids must show signs of improvement in proteinuria, defined as at least a 20% improvement in UPCR from initiation of steroids to the last stability assessment prior to baseline. Subjects who have discontinued steroid t reatment due to poor tolerability may be considered for the study . Subjects should also have a serum albumin level of ≤3.2 g/dL at screening and at the last qualifying assessment prior to baseline; subjects with serum albumin >3. 2 g/dL may be included following review to confirm primary FSGS and after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 5. All subjects should be treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs ) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) unless they have documented intolerance or contraindication to these medications. Doses of these agents must be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline, with blood pressure (BP) ≤150/90 mmHg at the baseline visit (Visit 2) . a) Subjects with nephrotic edema may be treated with diuretics during the screening period. Volume status should be optimized based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the doses of diuretics must be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline. b) At the discretion of the Investigator, subjects with hyperlipidemia may be treated with lipid -lowering agents (e.g., statins) in accordance with standard clinical practice. Doses must be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline. 6. Stable proteinuria, re nal function, and BP for at least 2 weeks prior to baseline, as assessed by the Investigator. Changes in UPCR, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and/or BP during the screening period may be due to treatments administered (e.g., ACEIs and ARBs); and, therefore, may interfere with study assessments or outcomes, or may place the subject at increased risk. All subjects must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiation of study treatment. 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negati ve serum pregnancy test prior to dispensing study treatment. Two effective forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Subjects must use effective contraception during the study . Exclusion Criteria: 1. Subjects unable or unwilling to give written informed consent and/or to comply with study procedures. 2. Clinical or histologic evidence of secondary FSGS. 3. Histologic evidence of collapsing variant FSGS. 4. eGFR as calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology C ollaboration (CKD -EPI) equation of ≤30 mL/minute/1 .73 m2 at initial screening assessment or ≤45 mL/minute/1.73 m2 at last qualifying assessment during screening period prior to baseline."

Subjects who have provided signed and dated informed consent will be screened for entry into this study. Subjects will be assigned a unique subject number which will be used to identify them throughout the study . If a subject has not had a renal biopsy within the required timeframe for study eligibility, one may be performed to assess eligibility into the study, provided consent is in place and provided the results are received before the end of screening. The duration of the screening period will be approximately 4 weeks to 10 weeks (allowing for visit windows) to ensure that subjects meet eligibility criteria, including renal disease stability assessments. The first 5-10 subjects meeting the required eligibility criteria will be assigned to Cohort 1 and will receive voclosporin according to the following dosing regimen: • Week 1: 1 capsule (7.9 mg) PO, BID • Week 2: 2 capsules (15.8 mg) PO, BID • Week 3 – Week 24: 3 capsules (23.7 mg) PO , BID Appropriate sponsor personnel (including the medical monitor) and the investigator will jointly decide whether to conti nue with the dose escalation for each subject. When the first 5 or 6 subjects in Cohort 1 have completed 12 weeks of treatment wit h voclosporin, the top line efficacy and safety data will be analyzed to determine the dose level for Cohort 2. The selected dose may be higher or lower than 23.7 mg BID. The maximum dose possible for Cohort 2 will be 39.5 mg (5 capsules) BID. Should this dose be selected the following dosing regimen will be followed: • Week 1: 1 capsule (7.9 mg) PO, BID • Week 2: 2 capsules (15.8 mg) PO, BID • Week 3: 3 capsules (23.7 mg) PO, BID • Week 4 – Week 24 : 5 capsules (39.5 mg) PO, BID Evaluable safety and tolerability da ta at Week 12 from the first 5-6 subjects from Cohort 1 are required in order to make the decision to escalate to a higher dose level for Cohort 2. As a guidance, the dose will not be escalated if any of following criteria are met in the first 5 or 6 subjects from Cohort 1, unless it was obvious that the occurrence was not related to the administration of voclosporin: • Severe adverse events (SAEs) of same character in ≥2 subjects. • Clinically significant decrease in eGFR in ≥5 subjects. • Clinically signif icant laboratory abnormalities of same character in ≥5 subjects. • Clinically significant abnormalities of electrolytes in ≥4 subjects. • Clinically significant changes in vital signs of same character in ≥4 subjects."
10,page_10,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 11 of 111 Procedures (cont’d) Doses and dose increments smaller than anticipated may be proposed for Cohort 2 based on the safety and tolerability results from the Cohort 1. All subjects will complete dosing through 24 weeks of study treatment and will have 2 Safety Follow -Up visits, 1 and 2 weeks after completion of treatment (i.e., at Week 25 and Week 26). Subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment before the Week 24 visit will return for all remaining study visits and assessments, including the 2 Safety Follow -Up visits, unless they hav e withdrawn consent. Sample Size: As this is an exploratory study, sample size calculations are not required. It is estimated that approximately 2 0 subjects will be recruited , with up to 10 subj ects in Cohort 1 and at least 10 subjects in Cohort 2. Statistical Methods: Analysis: All statistical analyses relating to the primary and secondary objectives will be undertaken at study closure and will incorporate all available data. Given the small sample size, all analyses will be descriptive in nature. Confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions may be calculated but it is recognized that such intervals, being based on 20 patients, will be very wide. As an example, the 95% Clopper -Pearson CI for a proportion of 30% based on 20 patients is (11.9%, 54.3%). Populations: The efficacy analysis will be based on intent -to-treat (ITT) principles and will include all enrolled subjects (non-screening failures) . The per -protocol data set will include the subset of subjects in the ITT set who do not have any major pr otocol violations (to be defined). The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. Methods: Top line efficacy (change from Baseline in UPCR) and safety data (AEs, eGFR, ECGs and vital signs) for the firs t 5 or 6 subjects in Cohort 1 completing 12 weeks of study treatment will be reviewed and based on those data the commencement of enrol lment and the target dose for Cohort 2 will be determined. The analysis of the primary endpoint, complete or partial remi ssion of proteinuria at Week 24, will be conducted on the ITT set and confirmed with the per- protocol set (if applicable). Remission of proteinuria will be summarized and an exact 2 -sided 95% CI for the remission rate will be calculated. The analyses of the secondary endpoints will incorporate the use of 2 -sided 95% CIs and are described below: • Binary endpoints will be summarized using exact 2 -sided 95% CIs. • Endpoints measured as a time -to-event will be displayed using Kaplan -Meier metho dology. Median time -to-event along with 2 -sided 95% CIs will be displayed."
11,page_11,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 12 of 111 Statistical Methods (cont’d) • Other endpoints will be summarized by visit. Absolute values and differences between baseline and each time point up to and including Week 24 will be summarized using means and 2 -sided 95% CIs. Changes between last on treatment value and post treatment follow -up will also be summarized. Safety Endpoints: Adverse events will be aggregated by System Organ Class and preferred term and presented as summary tables. Laboratory values, vital signs, and other safety parameters will be summarized by visit as absolute values and change from baseline. Laboratory values outside of defined normal ranges will be summarized. Exploratory analyses will be undertaken should the data suggest areas worthy of further investigation."

Stability assessments 1 and 2 are mandatory; assessments 3 and 4 are optional if additional time is required for the subject’s clinical status to stabilize. Note that the laboratory assessments and FMV results of the last stability assessment will be used as the qualifying values for eligibility. Enrol lment of eligible subjects must occur within 1 week of the final stability assessment. 2 If a subject has not had a recent renal biopsy, one may be performed to assess eligibility for the study provided informed co nsent has been given. The biopsy must have been performed 6 months prior to the screening visit. Biopsy results over 6 months prior to screening may be permitted following review with the Medical M onitor to confirm eligibility . Repeat renal biopsies may be done at Week 24 in a subset of subjects at selected sites. 3 Complete physical exam at screening ; abbreviated exam at all other v isits. 4 BP, pulse, temp erature , weight, and height. Height included at initial screening assessment only . At stability assessments, BP only will be included . 5 In the event that a subject is noted to have a QTcF value exceeding 500 msec, or an increase of >60 msec from baseline, the ECG should be repeated within 24 hours . Further details provided in the study protocol. 6 Laboratory assessments will be performed according to the schedule in the study protocol. Subjects must be fasting for at least 8 -12 hour s at Baseline and at end of study/early termination visit. 7 Pharmacokinetic assessments will be done at Weeks 4 and 24 . PK samples will be drawn prior to study treatment dosing (trough sample), and at 1, 2 and 4 hours post -dose. In the event a subject experiences an SAE or requires a dose modification or is withdrawn from treatment, a voclosporin sample should be taken, with a trough sample preferred. 8 The UPCR will be calculated both from the FMV and from standard urinalysis results. If the FMV is for some reason not available, then standard urinalysis from a 24 -hour urine collection may be substituted as an exception but only after agreement is reached with the Medical Monitor . 9 24-hour urine collection should begin 2 days prior to the scheduled study visit in order not to coincide with the FMV sampling due on the day of the study visit. 10 Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information system (PROMIS) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life- Short Form (KDQOL-SFTM). 11 Serum pregnancy test to be evaluated at central laboratory at Screening and Week 24; urine pregnancy test will be performed locally at all other visits as applicable. 12 If screening visit occurs on the same day as informed consent, any findings are to be recorded as Medical History. Any change since the date of signed consent and/or during the screening period would be considered an AE. 13 Subjects in Cohort 1, will be contacted by telephone at the end of Week 1 as a reminder to increase their dose to 2 capsules (15.8 mg) BID for 1 week, starting at Week 2. Subjects will be contacted again by telephone at the end of Week 2 as a reminder to increase their dose to 3 capsules (23.7 mg) BID, starting at Week 3, for the remainder of the treatment period . Subjects in Cohort 2, will also be contacted at the end of each week (as required) up to Week 4, as a reminder to increase their dose to the maximum selected for Cohort 2. 14 Compliance only. 15 First dose of study medication should occur in the morning the day after dis pensing.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 1.1 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS) is diagnosed by characteristic glomerular findings of podocyte injury evidenced by findings from immunofluorescence and electron microscopy following renal biopsy. The disease is categorized as primary (i.e., idiopathic FSGS) or secondary (e.g., adaptive changes resulting from glomerular hyperfiltration in conditions such as reflux nephropathy, obesity, and reduced nephron mass; drug- induced FSGS; and FSGS associated with viral diseases) [ 1]. The predominate clinical feature of primary FSGS is proteinuria, typically with signs and laboratory abnormalities associated with nephrotic syndrome (i.e., total urine protein >3.5 g/day, edema, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperchol esterolemia) [ 1]. Patients may experience renal dysfunction which can progress to end -stage renal disease (ESRD). Reportedly 50%- 60% of patients have nephrotic syndrome at presentation, and approximately 50% of adult patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are diagnosed with FSGS [ 1]. The amount of proteinuria at presenta tion and lack of response to treatment are correlated with progression to ESRD. FSGS is more common in males than in females and, in racially diverse populations, more common in black patients than in white patients [ 1]. Several published reviews have summarized the histopathologic features of FSGS and mechanisms of podocyte injury, disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier, and progression of renal dysfunction, e.g., D’Agati [ 1] and Kikuchi et al [ 2]. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of glomerular endothelial cells, the glom erular basement membrane, and epithelial cells (podocytes). There is a complex interaction between these elements; the podocyte is not only a critical part of the structure, providing structural support to glomerular capillary, but also plays a role in maintaining the glomerular basement membrane and slit diaphragm proteins that permit filtration of water and small molecules and retention of large molecules and cells. Light microscopy findings include a segmental pattern of mesangial sclerosis occurring in some (i.e., focal), but not all glomeruli, without typical features of other proteinuric glomerulopathies. Immunofluorescence microscopy does not reveal immune deposits. The primary pathophysiologic mechanism of FSGS is reflected in electron microscopy findings, which include typical abnormalities of podocyte morphology, i.e., diffuse podocyte foot process effacement. In FSGS, as in other podocytopathies, these abnormalities disrupt the glomerular filtration barrier, resulting in protein leakage. The etiolo gy of primary (idiopathic) FSGS is not known and is likely multifactorial. Based on indirect evidence, development of FSGS has been attributed to circulating factors (e.g., cytokines such as cardiotrophin- like cytokine 1, anti -CD40 (podocyte -B7-1 antigen) antibody, apolipoprotein A -Ib (ApoA -Ib) and serum soluble urokinase -type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR)) which may mediate glomerular permeability. FSGS recurs in transplanted"
24,page_24,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 25 of 111 kidneys, and proteinuria can be reduced by plasmapheresis in these patients; plasma and sera from FSGS patients have induced proteinuria in rats and in isolated rat glomeruli [ 3]. Several immune mechanisms have also been postulated to contribute to progressive glomerular damage subsequent to the initial podocyte injury, including cellular immunity and autoimmune reactivity [ 4]. Elevated levels of transforming growth factor -beta (TGF -β) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of FSGS and have been reported in numerous tissues of patients with FSGS including the tubule -interstitium and the glomerular epithelial cells [ 5,6]. Calcineurin α, one of the calcineurin isoforms, is involved in broad cellular tasks including protein folding and regulation of TGF -β expression. The use of an immunosuppressive agent that increases TGF -β levels may have a negative long -term impact on renal fibrosis, whereas the us e of an immunosuppressive agent that either decreases or has no impact on TGF -β levels may stabilize presently existing renal fibrosis. Concerning the podocyte, Liao et al [7] showed that in a murine (MRL/lpr) model, the calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI) tacrolimus may decrease TGF -β- induced podocyte apoptosis, suggesting that calcineurin may play a role in the progression of renal disease, thereby suggesti ng a potential mechanism of CNI benefit. 1.1.1 Limitations of Current Treatment The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis [ 8] provides Level 2C (low) and 2D (very low) suggestions for the treatment of primary FSGS: Corticosteroids are suggested as initial treatment at a daily single dose of 1 mg/kg (maximum 80 mg) or 2 mg/kg (maximum 120 mg) (Level 2C), to be administered for a minimum of 4 weeks and maximum of 16 weeks, as tolerated, or until complete remission has been achieved, whichever is earlier (Level 2D). Calcineurin inhibitors are suggested for use in FSGS as second -line treatment after failure of remission with steroid treatment and as first -line treatment in patients with relative contraindications to steroids. (Level 2D) (see Section 1.2.1, Mechanism of Action of CNIs and Potential for Treatment Benefit in FSGS ). Up to 50% of patients fail to respond to corticosteroids [ 1]. Earlier use of CNIs in primary FSGS, as initial treatment at the time of diagnosis, would avoid the risks of corticosteroid use, and may result in proteinuria remission, as well as potentially decrease the risk of progression to ESRD. The potential benefit of voclosporin in treatment- naïve FSGS patients is supported by the mechanism of action of CNIs (see Section 1.2.1, Mechanism of Action of CNIs and Potential for Treatment Benefit in FSGS ) and clinical data suggesting benefit in steroid -resistant patients (see Section 1.2.2, Clinical Studies of CNIs in FSGS ), as well as potential advantages of voclosporin over cyclosporine (i.e., increased potency demonstrated in nonclinical studies with voclosporin, more predictable pharmacokinetic ( PK)/pharmacodynamic ( PD) profile (obviating the need for therapeutic drug monitoring), and a potentially improved safety profile compared to cyclosporine A ( CsA) ) (see FSGS Investigator’s Brochure (IB) [9]). These data, with the demonstrated efficacy in renal response (including reduction in proteinuria) , suggest"
25,page_25,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 26 of 111 that voclosporin may benefit patients with FSGS. Although treatment guidelines suggest corticosteroids as first line therapy in these patients [ 8], there are no data to support the use of corticosteroids instead of CNIs in this setting. Corticosteroids are associated with si gnificant toxicities, and if voclosporin demonstrates treatment benefit and an acceptable safety profile, it would provide an appropriate alternative treatment to corticosteroids in this setting. 1.2 Rationale for the Use of Calcineurin Inhibitors in FSGS Calcineurin inhibitors are suggested for use in FSGS as second line treatment after failure of remission with steroid treatment and as first line treatment in patients with relative contraindications to steroids. In addition to well- characterized immunomodulatory effects, CNIs have been demonstrated to have direct beneficial effects on podocytes that are likely mechanisms of amelioration of proteinuria in podocytopathies, including FSGS. 1.2.1 Mechanism of Action of CNIs and Potential for Treatment Benefit in FSG S Calcineurin inhibitors have beneficial effects in diseases characterized by disorders of the immune system and in the prevention of rejection after solid organ transplantation by inhibiting activation of nuclear factor of activated T -cell (NFAT) with sub sequent regulation of the production of T -cell cytokines [ 9]. Recently , several investigat ions have demonstrated that CNIs have non- immunologic effects that contribute to their anti- proteinuric effects in podocytopathies. Podocyte function depends on a complex and unique structure that, in turn, depends on a tightly regulated actin cytoskeleton. Synaptopodin acts as a key stabilizer of the actin cytoskeleton in podocytes. When synaptopodin is phosphorylated, it binds to another protein, 14-3- 3, and is protected from degradation. Calcineurin dephosphorylates synaptopodin allowing its degradation, with subsequent alteration of the actin cytoskeleton, disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier, and proteinuria. Expression of activated calcineurin in podocytes leads to proteinuria. Thus, by inhibiting calcineurin, CNIs exert a specific anti -proteinuric effect by preventing the degradation of the podocyte stabilizing protein synaptopodin [ 10,11]. In addition to effects on synaptopodin, cyclosporine has been found to stabilize other components of the actin cytoskeleton, i.e., cofilin- 1 and nephrin. Podocyte apoptosis can be induced in the rat purine aminonucleoside model [ 12]. Shen et al [13] demonstrated that cyclosporine and tacrolimus reduced podocyte apoptosis in the rat purine aminonucleoside model. In addition, inhibition of NFAT signaling in the podocyte by CNIs may ameliorate podocyte injury [ 14]. Wakamatsu et al [15] evaluated the effects of tacrolimus in a nephrotic rat model (anti- nephrin antibody-induced nephropathy). Utilizing immunohistological analyses of rat and human kidneys, these investigators demonstrated that calcineurin is an element of the slit diaphragm and associated with nephrin, a critical component of the slit diaphragm. In the nephrotic rat model, they demonstrated that calcineurin distribution was altered and calcineurin activity was increased; these abnormalities were prevented by administration of tacrolimus, with amelioration of proteinuria. As noted in Section 1.1,"
26,page_26,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 27 of 111 Background of the Disease and Treatment Options , calcineurin may also contr ibute to TGF -β- induced fibrosis. In summary, CNIs, in addition to their immunomodulatory effects have been demonstrated to have direct beneficial effects on podocytes via multiple mechanisms. These effects are likely mechanisms of amelioration of proteinuria in podocytopathies, including FSGS. 1.2.2 Clinical Studies of CNIs in FSGS The KDIGO guidelines suggest CNIs for use in the first line treatment of FSGS in patients who are intolerant or have contraindications to corticosteroid use [ 8]. There are no prospective, randomized trials of CNIs (either cyclosporine or tacrolimus) used as first line treatment in adult patients (or children) with FSGS. Limited retrospective observational data support their use in this setting; a recent treatment review [ 16] cites two studies: Duncan et al [ 17] and Goumenos et al [ 18]. In a single study center by Duncan et al [ 17], 6 patients with biopsy -proven FSGS and nephrotic syndrome, who had been previously treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), but not immunosuppression (including corticosteroids), were treated with tacrolimus and followed prospectively. The mean duration of nephrotic syndrome prior to treatment with tacrolimus was 13.6 months (standard deviation (SD) 11.8); baseline urine protein was 11.0 g/day (SD 4.5) and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 71.7 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (SD 22.4). After approximately 12 months of follow -up, all 6 patients achieved remission, defined as normalization of serum albumin and resolution of edema. Mean urine protein decreased from 11.0 g/day (SD 4.5) to 2.8 g/day (SD 2.5). Reportedly, no patients relapsed after attaining remission. In a retrospective review by Goumenos et al [18], 51 patients with biopsy- proven FSGS, proteinuria >1 g/day, and serum creatinine <2.5 mg/dL, were followed for 5 years. Of the 51 patients, 26 were treated with conservative management (including ACEIs and other anti - hypertensives) and 25 were treated with immunosuppressive drugs, including prednisolone alone (9 patients, treated for 16 months, 8 with nephrotic syndrome), prednisolone and azathioprine (6 patients, treated for 18 months, 5 with nephrotic syndrome) and prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg/day) and cyclosporine (10 patients, treated for 25 months, 7 with nephrotic syndrome). No patients received cyclosporine monotherapy. Treatment assignment w as reportedly based on renal impairment and degree of proteinuria. Remission of nephrotic syndrome (both complete remission (defined as urine protein < 0.3 g/day) and partial remission (defined as urine protein between 0.3 and 3 g/day)) occurred in 5/ 8 patients treated with prednisolone alone, 4/ 5 patients treated with prednisolone and azathioprine, and 6/7 patients treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine. Evidence to support the use of CNIs in adult patients who are steroid resistant includes randomized clinical trials as well as observational data. A Cochrane Review published in"
27,page_27,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 28 of 111 2008 [ 19] identified one blinded controlled study (Cattran et al, 1999 [ 20]) which evaluated the effect of cyclosporine on remission of proteinuria and ESRD in steroid -resistant adult patients with nephrotic syndrome. This study was a single blind, randomized, placebo - controlled trial in which 26 patients were treated with cyclosporine and low dose prednisone and 23 patients were treated with placebo and low -dose prednisone. Complete remission (urine protein ≤0.3 g/day with stable renal function) or partial remission (50% reduction and ≤3.5 g/day with stable renal function) occurred in 69% of the cyclosporine group and 4% of the placebo group at 26 weeks (p<0.001). At 4 years, the renal survival rate was 72% in the cyclosporine group and 49% in the placebo group. Laurin et al [21] performed a meta- analysis of studies evaluating the effects of CNIs in primary FSGS. They did not identify any trials in which CNIs were used as first -line treatment. Six randomized controlled trials and two retrospective cohort studies were included in their review. They performed a pooled analysis of the effect of cyclosporine on proteinuria remission; the relative risk of complete or partial remission was 7.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) : 2.9, 16.8) compared with the control group. It has been noted in treatment reviews that cyclosporine use in steroid -resistant patients is associated with a high relapse rate (e.g., 43 % to 50% in a 2003 review by Cattran [ 22]). In an NIH- sponsored trial, FSG S-CT, 138 patients (adults and children) with biopsy- proven FSGS (assessed as steroid resistant and urine protein creatine ratio (UPCR) >1 g/g) were randomized to cyclosporine (n=72) or a combination of pulse dexamethasone (DEX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF ) (n=66) [ 23,24]. Treatment was administered for 12 months and patients were followed until Week 78. Steroid resistance was defined as failure to achieve sustained UPCR ≤1.0 g/g after a minimal treatment duration of 4 weeks. All patients were treated with low-dose prednisone and either an ACEI or ARB. There was no difference between the groups in the primary endpoint (mean score of a 6- level categorical assessment of remission of proteinuria at Week 52): 46% of the CsA group and 33% of the MMF/DEX group had at least a partial remission at Week 52. In patients who achieved at least a partial remission at Week 52, relapse (defined as UPCR >2.0 g/g after the withdrawal of medication at Week 52) was reported for 33% (11/33) in the CsA group and 18% (4/22) in the MMF/DEX group. These data are difficult to interpret as 28% of patients in the CsA group had baseline UPCR <2.0 g/g. Moreover, the definition of steroid resistance in this study is not consistent with standard definition of steroid resistance for adults and the data are not presented separately for adults and children. In a follow -up publication of a post -hoc analysis, Hogg et al [25] examined the outcomes in patie nts who achieved complete or partial remission after 26 weeks, completed 52 weeks of treatment, and had follow -up information through 78 weeks. In the cyclosporine group, the analysis included 22 of the 39 patients who were reported to have at least partia l remission at Week 26 in the earlier publication, and 20 of the 26 patients in the MMF/DEX group. The authors report that, in the CsA patients, the mean eGFR decreased at Weeks 26 and 52 (17%"
28,page_28,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 29 of 111 decrease and 19% decrease compared to baseline, respectively), and increased by 16% from Week 52 to Week 78. There are few studies examining the use of tacrolimus in patients with FSGS. In one study [ 26], decrease in proteinuria was similar in 18 patients treated with cyclophosphamide/prednisone and 15 patients treated with tacrolimus/prednisone, both after 6 months of treatment and at the completion of a 6- month follow -up period. Baseline renal function was not recorded and there appeared to be stability of renal function between 6 months and 12 months. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the treatment benefit of tacrolimus from this study. In summary, the available data, although largely from retrospective studies, support a treatment benefit of cyclosporine in steroid -resistant patients. There is little data supporting the benefit of cyclosporine as first line treatment. It has been reported that the relapse rate is high following discontinuation of treatment; however, it is difficult to interpret the data reported by Gipson et al [23,24] and Hogg et al [25] with respect to the effect of cyclosporine on renal function and proteinuria over 12 months and subsequent improvement in renal function and proteinuria after withdrawal, and the reported re lapse rate. The study failed to recruit the target number of patients, the criteria for steroid resistance were not consistent with standard definitions, and the changes in proteinuria and renal function were not completely reported. However, it appears th at there was a significant decrease in proteinuria at both Weeks 26 and 52. While the post -treatment effect on eGFR is not completely clear, the data suggest some increase in eGFR after withdrawal of treatment. The relevance of these findings to the long - term effect of voclosporin is not clear. 1.2.3 Voclosporin Voclosporin is a next generation CNI currently under development for use in FSGS and lupus nephritis (LN). Voclosporin is structurally similar to CsA except for a novel modification of a functional group on the amino acid 1 residue of the molecule. This alteration has changed the binding of voclosporin to calcineurin leading to a 3 - to 5-fold increase in potency when compared to CsA. This modification has also shifted metabolism away from amino acid 1, the major site of metabolism for CsA, thus altering the metabolic profile. This in turn has led to faster elimination of metabolites resulting in lower measured metabolite exposure as compared to CsA. The combination of increased potency and decreased measured metabolite exposure, for voclosporin as compared to CsA, has led to better PK /PD predictability. During the development of this investigational product , the legacy names of voclosporin, VCS, and ISA247 are referenced in discussions related to historical usage. In the Phase 3 LN clinical development program, the name of the investigational product is referred to as Orelvo, the proposed trade name. However, for the FSGS clinical development programs, the name of the investigational product will be referred to as voclosporin. All legacy names and the proposed trade name should all be considered interchangeable unless specifically identified as different."
29,page_29,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 30 of 111 Prior to the FSGS clinical development program, over 2,400 subjects have received investigational products containing voclosporin in 15 Phase 1 , and 12 Phase 2/3 clinical studies in the indications of LN, transplant rejection, psoriasis and non -infecti ous uveitis . Detailed data for these clinical studies are presented in the IB [9]. 1.2.3.1 Pharmacokinetic Considerations Voclosporin approximates linear multiexponential PKs. Exposure to voclosporin was dose-related with maximum concentrations occurring ≤2 hours with a t 1/2 of ≥30 hours. Drug accumulation was minor with accumulation factors of approximately 2 hours after twice daily (BID) dosing. Administration of voclosporin oral solution with either low - or high -fat meals decreased both the rate and extent of absorption which appeared to be related to the fat content of the meal. It is therefore recommended that voclosporin be administered on an empty stomach to ensure adequate absorption. Voclosporin has been shown to be a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A4/5 (CYP3A4/5). Concomitant administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, led to a 6- fold increase in C max and an 18-fold increase in AUC 0-12 for voclosporin. Concomitant administration of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4/5, resulted in a decrease in exposure to voclosporin. Maximum concentration decreased approximately 70%, the area under the concentration curve decreased approximately 90%, and t 1/2 decreased 85%. Consequently, both ketoconazole and rifampin are contraindicated with voclosporin. Concomitant administration of voclosporin and midazolam, a model substrate of CYP3A4/5 and potential inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, di d not result in statistically significant changes in the rate or extent of exposure to midazolam or α-hydroxy- midazolam. Voclosporin is both a substrate for and an inhibitor of P -glycoprotein ( P-gp). Concomitant administration of verapamil, a known inhibit or of P-gp, demonstrated an approximate 3-fold increase in C max and AUC 0-12 of voclosporin. Concomitant administration of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, resulted in statistically significant increases in digoxin C max and AUC 0-24 and a decrease in clearance. Therefore, concomitant administration of P-gp substrates with voclosporin would be expected to result in increased exposure to the substrate. Clinicians are advised to consider the benefit/risk of concomitant P-gp substrate dr ugs carefully. 1.2.4 Potential Toxicities of CNIs Increased blood pressure (BP) and renal dysfunction are well known potential toxicities of CNIs that are dose- related, reversible, and generally responsive to dose reduction or temporary interruption of treatment [ 27]. Voclosporin has been studied in numerous disease states. In clinical studies of voclosporin in LN [9], a small proportion of voclosporin-treated subjects experienced an early drop of ≥30% in eGFR; however, that proportion then remained stable over time.

There were more TEAEs of hypertension seen in the voclosporin- treated subjects compared to placebo ; however, overall mean systolic and diastolic BP decreased in all groups, without statistically significant differences seen between groups. Overall, only 1 (1.1%) subject, in the voclosporin high-dose group, had a TEAE of hypertension that resulted in per manent discontinuation of study treatment. There was also evidence of an increased incidence of TEAEs over placebo and with increased dose of voclosporin in the System Organ Classes of Infections and Infestations, Gastrointestinal Disorders, and Vascular Disorders."

RATIONALE The rationale for the development of voclosporin and the range of dose is to introduce a novel CNI to the population of patients with FSGS , with meaningful efficacy while minimizing toxicities common to other CNIs. In clinical studies , a favorable efficacy/safety profile for voclosporin has been demonstrated in the prevention of renal transplant rejection and in Phase 2 studies in LN . As evaluated in nonclinical and clinical studies (healthy volunteers, moderate to severe psoriasis, re nal transplantation, and uveitis) voclosporin is well tolerated and exhibits adverse events ( AEs) that are typical of other CNIs yet seen to a lesser extent than those seen historically with other CNIs. The aim of the current study is to investigate whethe r voclosporin is able to reduce disease activity over a treatment period of 24 weeks. Subjects with histologic evidence of primary FSGS with proteinuria will be eligible to enter the study . Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of voclosporin to reduce the level of proteinuria (as measured by UPCR ) while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. The primary endpoint of this study will be complete or partial remission of proteinuria at 24 weeks. 2.1 Dose Rationale This Phase 2 study is designed t o initially evaluate the treatment ben efit of voclosporin 23.7 mg BID in the first cohort of up to 10 subjects . The selection of this voclosporin dose for the first cohort (see Section 7, Study Treatments ) was based on the previous experience with this drug in the Phase 2 LN study (AURA- LV). In AURA- LV, subjects were administered voclosporin 23.7 mg BID, voclosporin 39.5 mg BID, or matching placebo. Low -dose voclosporin was significantly superior to placebo in the proportion of subjects achieving complete renal response at Week 24 (p=0.045). At Week 48, complete remission rates in both the low -dose (49.4%) and high- dose (39.8%) voclosporin groups demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to the placebo (23.9%) group, (p<0.001, p=0.026, respectively) . There was no increase in efficacy with the higher dose and no significant differences between the two voclosporin groups in achievement of renal response. This study is also designed to evaluate a further dose level of voclosporin, this dose may be higher or l ower than the initial 23.7 mg BID dosing. When the first 5-6 subjects in Cohort 1 have completed 12 weeks of treatment with voclosporin, the top line eff icacy and safety data will be analyzed to determine the dose level for Cohort 2. The maximum dose possi ble for Cohort 2 will be 39.5 mg (5 capsules) BID. If the higher dose is selected for Cohort 2, subjects still receiving treatment in Cohort 1 may have their dose increased to 39.5 mg after Week 8 if they have not demonstrated meaningful benefit from the 23.7 mg BID dose per Investigator judgement and following discussion with the Medical Monitor . Subjects enrolled after the dose decision will receive voclosporin at 39.5 mg BID and be considered part of Cohort 2."
32,page_32,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 33 of 111 To minimize safety concerns, a cau tious dose -escalation design starting with a minimal dose of one capsule (7.9 mg) per day will be employed for all subjects (see Section 7.1.2, Dosing Guidelines ). The protocol contains provisions for management of dose (including rules for stopping treatment with study mediation) based on safety concerns in particular, BP and renal function. The safety data from the use of voclosporin in LN demonstrates that these risks are dose -related, reversible, and can be managed by dose reduction and temporary interruption. Furthermore, voclosporin will be administered as fixed dose s without the use of therapeutic drug monitoring. Population PK analyses of voclosporin concentrations from the clinical development program (including healthy subjects, subjects with renal impairment, subjects with hepatic impairment, renal transplant, plaque psoriasis, and LN ) demonstrated that weight did not have a significant effect on the PK of voclosporin [ 9]."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Overall Study Design This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter, prospective, 24-week, exploratory cohort study to assess the efficacy and safety of two dose levels of voclosporin in achiev ing complete or partial remission of proteinuria in subjects with biopsy- confirmed primary FSGS. Subjects who have provided a signed and dated informed consent will be screened into the study. Subjects will be assigned a unique subject number which will be used to identify them throughout the study. The duration of the screening period will be approximately 4 weeks to 10 weeks (allowing for visit windows (14±3 days) for each stability assessment ) to ensure that subjects meet eligibility criteria, including renal disease stability assessments. If a subject has not had a renal biopsy within the 6-month (prior to screening) required timeframe for study eligibility, one may be performed to assess elig ibility into the study, provided the subject has given consent and provided the results can be obtained and reviewed before baseline ; biopsy results over 6 months prior to screening may be permitted following review with the Medical Monitor . Subjects who m eet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible to receive treatment with voclosporin. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled into Cohort 1, at a starting dose of 7.9 mg BID for Week 1, 15.8 mg BID for Week 2, and a target dose of 23.7 mg BID for Weeks 3 to 24. T he first dose of study treatment should occur in the morning on Day 2, the day after dispensing. Subjects will be contacted by telephone at the end of Week 1 and Week 2 to be reminded to increase their dose as per Section 7.1.2.1, Voclosporin Study Treatment . Evaluable sa fety and tolerability from 12 weeks of treatment in the first 5-6 subjects from Cohort 1 are required in order to determine the dose level for Cohort 2. The dose selected may be higher or lower than 23.7 mg BID. The maximum dose possible for Cohort 2 will be 39.5 mg (5 capsules) BID. Dosing in this group will follow the same cautious approach as Cohort 1, with at a starting dose of 7.9 mg BID for Week 1, 15.8 mg BID for Week 2, 23.7 mg BID for Week 3 and a maximum dose of 39.5 mg BID for Weeks 4 to 24. Dose s and dose increments smaller than anticipated or an intermediate dose may be proposed for Cohort 2 based on the safety and tolerability results from the Cohort 1. All subjects will return for assessment of efficacy and safety at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24. See Schedule of Events , for detailed information regarding visits. All subjects, completed or withdrawn from the study , will complete the End of Treatment /Early Termination assessments (Visit 8) at Week 24, or at the time of withdrawal, and should attend two Safety Follow -up visits at 1 and 2 weeks after completion of treatment (i.e., at Week 25 (Visit 9) and Week 26 (Visit 10)) (or 7 and 14 days , respectively, following withdrawal ) to collect any new AEs and concomitan t medications . At the follow -up visit, UPCR and eGFR"
36,page_36,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 37 of 111 will be assessed as well. For subject withdrawal procedures and criteria, see Section 5.5, Withdrawal of Subjects . 4.2 Duration of Subject Participation and Study The expected duration of subject participation is up to 36 weeks. The duration of t he screening period will be approximately 4 weeks to 10 weeks (allowing for visit windows) and the treatment duration is 24 weeks, with further Safety F ollow- up visit s at 1 and 2 weeks after last dose (completion or withdrawal)."

Stable proteinuria, renal function, and BP during the 2 weeks prior to baseline, as assessed by the Investigator. Changes in UPCR, eGFR, and/or BP during the screening period may be due to treatments administ ered (e.g., ACEIs and ARBs); and, therefore, may interfere with study assessments or outcomes, or may place the subject at increased risk. All subjects must be discussed with the medical monitor prior to initiation of study treatment. 7. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to dispensing study treatment . Two effective forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method.

No vaccines using live organisms, viral or bacterial, are allowed during screening and while taking the study treatment. 15. Other major physical or psychiatric illness or major traumatic injury within 6 months prior to screening that may affect study conduct or interfere with study assessments or outcome. 16. Any other medical condition which, in the Investigator’s judgment, may be associated with increased risk to the subject or may interfere with study assessments or outcomes. 17. Subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or, if of childbearing potential, not using adequate contraceptive precautions. 18. Participation in another interventional clinical study within 4 weeks prior to screening and/or receipt of investigational drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half -lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to screening. 19. Subjects treated in a previous voclosporin clinical study. 5.4 Adequate/Effective Contraception Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test during screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline. Two effective forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen method. Effective contraception must be used before beginning study treatment , during study dosing, and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of study treatment, even when there has been a history of infertility, unless due to surgical sterilization. Women not of childbearing potential are defined as women without menses for at least 12 consecutive months or surgically sterilized. Sexually active , reproductively competent men are required to use condoms during treatment and for at least 6 weeks after cessation of study treatment. In addition, female partners of male subjects are recommended to use an effective contraception during their partner’s treatment and for at least 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment . Male subjects are to refrain from making sperm donations during treatment and for at least 6 weeks after cessation of study treatm ent. An effective and medically acceptable method of birth control means the chance of pregnancy, when using that type of birth control, is less than 1% per year if used correctly. These birth control methods (i.e., reliable forms of contraception) include birth control pills (combined oral contraceptives), hormone implants, hormone shots , and some intrauterine contraceptive devices. Barrier methods (e.g., condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap/sponge) when used alone are not considered highly effective."
41,page_41,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 42 of 111 Although abstinence, when adhered to, is an effective method of birth control, other additional effective contraception methods should be used where there is any doubt. The method of contraception needs to be discussed with the Investigator and documented throughout the study period in order to confirm the method used is considered effective. 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time for any reason. Alternatively, subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion if it is in the subject’s best interest. Every effort should be made for subjects who withdraw from the study, either voluntarily or at the Investigator’s discretion, to und ergo end of study assessments (Visit 8), if possible. If possible, the subject should also be advised to come for the two Safety Follow -up visits ( Visit 9 and Visit 10) at 1 and 2 weeks after last dose. If a subject refuses end of study procedures, the reason for refusal should be fully documented in the subject’s source document and recorded in the study specific electronic case report form ( eCRF ). It is the subject’s right to withdraw from the study without providing a reason. In this case, the source doc uments and the eCRF should document the reason for withdrawal as “withdrawal of consent .” Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. 5.6 Discontinuation of Study Treatment Discontinuation of study treatment does not necessarily constitute withdrawal from the study. If any subject is discontinued from study treatment , the reason for discontinuation will be documented in the eCRF. If the reason for discontinuing study treatment is an AE or an abnormal laboratory test result, the specific event or test will be rec orded in the eCRF. If possible, s ubjects who are permanently discontinued from study treatment before the Week 24 visit should undergo all study assessments up to and including the Week 24 (or Early Termination Visit – Visit 8) and Safety Follow -up visits where appropriate. All subjects that discontinue study treatment should attend at least 2 further assessments after the last dose of study drug. Guidance on when study treatment must be discontinued is in Section 7.4, Voclosporin Dose Modification . 5.6.1 Discontinuation of Study Treatment Due to an A dverse Event Subjects may be permanently discontinued from study treatment because of the appearance of an unacceptable AE. It is vital to obtai n follow -up data on any subject discontinued because of an AE. In any case, every effort must be made to evaluate protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures (see Section 10.3, Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs, and Pregnancy). If a subject"
42,page_42,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 43 of 111 is discontinued due to an AE, the event should be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred. All AEs should be followed until resolution, stabilization or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted."

If the subject misses a dose of study treatment by less than 4 hours from the anticipated dosing time, the missed dose will be taken immediately. The next dose will be taken at the originally scheduled time. If a missed dose of study treatment is greater than 4 hours from the expected dosing time, the subject will skip the dose and take the next dose at the originally scheduled time. The variation in dosing will be recorded in the eCRFs. The dose/doses of study treatment may be held at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects must avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit -containing juice (e.g., pomelo) for the duration of their participation in the study. The dosing of voclosporin for Cohort 1 will be as follows: • Week 1: 1 capsule (7.9 mg) orally ( PO), BID • Week 2: 2 capsules (15.8 mg) PO , BID"

The selected dose may be higher or lower than 23.7 mg BID. The maximum dose possible for Cohort 2 will be 39.5 mg (5 capsules) BID. Should this dose be selected the following dosing regimen will be followed: • Week 1: 1 capsule (7.9 mg) PO, BID • Week 2: 2 capsules (15.8 mg) PO, BID • Week 3: 3 capsules (23.7 mg) PO, BID • Week s 4 to 24: 5 capsules (39.5 mg) PO, BID All subjects will be contacted by telephone at the end of Week 1 and Week 2 (and Week 3, if applicable) to be reminded to increase their dose. If the 39.5 mg dose is selected for Cohort 2, s ubjects still receiving treatment in Cohort 1 may have their dose increased to 39.5 mg BID after Week 8 per Investigator judgement and following discussion with the Medical Monitor. All unused study treatment (and any empty containers) dispensed to the subject will be returned at each study visit for capsule counts to check compliance. The Investigator will count the returned study t reatment , and this information will be used to assess subject compliance. This study treatment count must be documented in the eCRF and source documentation. 7.1.2.2 Corticosteroids Subjects entering the study with corticosteroids should have their steroid dose gradually titrated down until they achieve a daily dose of <10 mg/day prednisone by Week 12. The timing of the titration is at the discretion of the investigator, with a reduction of 5 mg/day every 2 weeks recommended. If clinically indicated , steroid tapering may start during the stability assessment period. A dose level may be maintained for up to 4 weeks or increased per investigator judge ment following discussion with the Medical Monitor. Refer to Appendix 4 for a conversion table of various formulations of steroids. Corticosteroid treatment must be documented in the eCRF and source documentation. When clinically indicated, subjects are allowed to be completely titrated off oral corticosteroids."

All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to GMP and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Study- treatment wallets provided to sites and to subjects will be labeled in the appropriate local language, according to local regulatory requirements. Wallet label information will be appropriately documented in the Drug Accountability Form after the container has been dispensed to the subject. 7.3 Site Supply, Storage, Accountability 7.3.1 Site Supply Once a site has been approved for study initiation, the site will be supplied with an initial s tock of study treatment . The need for study treatment resupply will be assessed on a regular basis taking into account the number of subjects enrolled at the site. 7.3.2 Storage Voclosporin softgel caps ules will be supplied in cartons containing 168 capsules in 4 wallets of 42 capsules each. The Investigator must ensure the availability of proper storage conditions. All study treatment supplies provided for this study will be stored in a secure area with restricted access at the study site. The capsules must be stored at a controlled room temperature between 15 and 30°C (59-86°F). The Investigator must document and inform the Site Monitor about temperature deviations outside the acceptable range. Subjects will be instructed to store the study treatment at room tem perature between 15 and 30°C ( 59-86°F). Each site should have a thermometer that records minimum and maximum temperatures daily. Maintenance of a temperature log is mandatory. The log should be updated by site personnel during normal working hours. This log must be available for review by the Site Monitor during on-site monitoring visits. 7.3.3 Accountability The Investigator at each site is responsible for study treatment supplies. The Investigator will ensure that adequate records of the receipt, dispensing, and return of the study treatment are"
47,page_47,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 48 of 111 kept and that the study treatment is used only for subjects enrolled in the study. All data regarding the study treatment must be recorded on the relevant forms provided. Each study site will maintain a drug inventory/dispensing record for all drugs dispensed and returned. At the end of the study, one copy of the drug inventory/dispensing record should be sent to Aurinia for the central study file. The original will be kept in the site files. After completion of the study, or if it is prematurely terminated, all unused materials will be returned to Aurinia. The decision to destroy study treatment at a site must be made by Aurinia. If the study treatment is destroyed at a site, the Investigator must receive Aurinia ’s approval of the process and forward the certif icate of destruction to Aurinia. 7.4 Voclosporin Dose Modification 7.4.1 Discontinuation of Study Therapy Due to Non- response During the treatment period, any case where the subject experiences a worsening of proteinuria, or no improvement in proteinuria from baseline, once the highest permitted dose of study drug has been achieved, should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Subjects may be allowed to add treatment with corticosteroids (IV or oral) while continuing with study drug, or may be discontinued from study treatment and transitioned to standard of care treatment . If the dose level of 39.5 mg BID is determined for Cohort 2, any subject still on treatment in Cohort 1 who ha s completed 8 weeks of treatment and shown no meaningful improvement in proteinuria may have their dose increased to 39.5 mg BID per Investigator judgement and following discussion with the Medical Monitor. 7.4.2 Deterioration in Renal Function Serum creatinine and eGFR utilizing the CKD -EPI formula , as reported by the central laboratory, will be used for the assessment of renal function at every visit including unscheduled visits. It is recognized that eGFR may be unreliable at higher values (>100 mL/min/1.73 m2). FSGS subjects with nephrotic -range proteinuria frequently have wide fluctua tions in serum creatinine (and therefore eGFR) which are not representative of true renal dysfunction. Chronic kidney disease is defined as eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for ≥3 months [ 28], with or without kidney damage. 7.4.2.1 Decrease in eGFR > 30% and eGFR < 90 mL/min /1.73 m2 During the treatment period, any subject experiencing a > 30% decrease in eGFR from baseline (baseline eGFR is defined as the last assessment prior to first dose of study treatment) to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 will have study treatment interrupted until a repeat test can be performed (unscheduled visit to be completed within 48 hours ).

(Note: doses of ACEIs, ARBs, diuretics, and/or lipid lowering therapy are to remain stable throughout the study.) If the eGFR decrease is not confirmed, the study treatment can be restarted at 2 capsules BID and increased as tolerated with discussion with the Medical Monitor. 7.4.2.2 Decrease in eGFR ≤30% and eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 During the treatment period, any subject having a ≤30% reduction i n eGFR to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 should have the influence of potential contributing factors (as described in Section 7.4.2.1, Decrease in eGFR >30% and eGFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2) ruled out and appropriate corrective action taken. Any subject having a > 20 to ≤30% reduction compared to baseline in eGFR to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 will have a confirmation measurement done wit hin approximately 2 weeks (at a planned study visit , if any, or an unscheduled visit should be completed). The subjects will be managed in the most medically appropriate manner in consultation with the Medical Monitor. The management of the decrease in eGF R may include reduction of dose or temporary interruption. 7.4.2.3 Recovery of eGFR Subject s experiencing a decrease in eGFR with resultant decrease in dose should be reassessed for recovery of renal function. If the repeated eGFR is >80% of baseline, the dose should be increased by 1 capsule BID and eGFR assessed within 2 weeks. 7.5 Procedures for Overdose Based on clinical experience with voclosporin, symptomatic treatment of AEs or overdoses is indicated. Treatment for renal dysfunction, hypertension, and infection may include dose reduction or dose discontinuation. Magnesium supplementation may be required for hypomagnesemia. Treatment for GI compla ints and biochemical/hematological abnormalities, and all other expected AEs, should be based on symptoms, with care taken to rule out other causes. 7.6 Prohibited Therapy and Concomitant Treatment Any concomitant treatment given for any reason during the course of the study must be recorded in the eCRF and in the subject’s source documents, including dosage, start and stop dates, and reason for use.

The physical examination will include a review of FSGS- related manifestations which will also be recorded. A complete physical examination will be conducted at the initial screening assessment , and an abbreviated physical will be performed at all other visits as per the Schedule of Events . The abbreviated examination will consist of checking the normality or abnormality of the following body systems: general appearance, cardiovascular system , and pulmonary system. Any abnormalities will be recorded in the eCRF and reported as an AE.

At stability assessments, BP only will be included. Height will be recorded at the initial screening assessment only. 9.1.3.1 Blood P ressure Management Blood pressure and HR will be measured with the subject in a sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. The procedure for standardized measurement of BP is detailed in Appendix 2. If the mean BP measure is >130/80 mmHg ( determined by the mean of the second and third repeats of 3 readings), the subject’s BP will be managed per local practice. If the BP remains uncontrolled with the maximal doses of first - and second- line antihypertensive therapies referenced i n Appendix 1, then the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to consider dose adjustment of the study treatment .

Any abnormalities will be recorded in the eCRF. Electrocardiograms will be recorded after the subject has been in a resting, supine position for at least 5 minutes. Abnormal ECG tracings can be reviewed by the Medical Monitor. Significant abnormalities, including findings that may prompt discontinuation of study treatment , must be discus sed with the Medical Monitor . Electrocardiograms will be measured at the initial screening assessment , Day 1 , and Week 24."

The subject will be asked to return for an unscheduled visit within 24 hours and the ECG will be repeated (confirmed), in triplicate (i.e., three 10 - second ECGs in rapid succession within 1 minute). If the repeat measurements confirm that the QTcF is >500 msec or >60 msec from baseline, study treatmen t will be discontinued and the subject followed until the QTcF value either returns to baseline or until, in the judgment of the Investigator, further evaluation is not clinically indicated. If study treatment is discontinued, the subject should continue in the study for all remaining scheduled study visits. 9.1.5 QoL Assessments Assessments for QoL will be conducted at Day 1 , Week 24, Week 25 an d Week 26. The PROMIS assesses physical function, pain interference, and fatigue . See Appendix 7. The KDQOL -SFTM survey is a kidney disease -specific measure of Q oL that assesses general health, kidney disease and its effects on daily life, and satisfaction with care . See Appendix 8. 9.1.6 Voclosporin Pharmacokinetic and Biomarker Assessment Blood samples for PK assessments will be taken at Week 4 and Week 24. PK samples will be drawn prior to study treatment dosing (trough sample), and at 1, 2 and 4 hours post -dose. These samples will be analyzed for voclosporin. Should a subject experience a serious adverse event (SAE ), require a dose modification or be withdrawn from treatment, a blood PK sample will be taken (with a trough sample preferred) for later determination of drug level. If a subject has discontinued from study treatment, further PK samples are not required. Blood and urine samples for biomarker assessments will be taken at Day 1, Week 4 and Week 24, samples will be collected prior to study treatment dosing. 9.2 Schedule of Assessments A detailed schedule of assessments (including all protocol -required assessments, visits , and visit windows) is located on the Schedule of Events . No study- related assessments will be performed (including changes to current medications to meet study eligibility) until the subject has provided signed and dated informed consent. Every effort will be made to keep the subject within the requested visit schedule.

The initial s creening assessment will include provision of informed consent ; complete physical examination; medical history (including FSGS history ); vital signs measurements, including weight and height ; 12- lead ECG ; blood and urine sample collection for central laboratory assessments, urinalysis, and urine microscopy ; FMV urine collection (for determination of UPCR) ; a serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential); and review of prior and concomitant medications and en try criteria. Following these assessments and if clinically indicated, subject s receiving steroids may start reducing their steroid dose as described in the corticosteroid dosing guidelines (see Section 7.1.2.2, Corticosteroids ). Any AEs which occur after informed consent will be recorded. Stability assessments wi ll occur at 14 -day intervals (±3 days) with the first assessment approximately 2 we eks after the initial screening assessment visit. Stability assessments 1 and 2 are mandatory; assessments 3 and 4 are optional if additional time is required for the subjec t’s clinical status to stabilize. These stability assessment visits will include BP determination; blood sample collection for central laboratory assessments; FMV urine collection (for determination of UPCR); a serum pregnancy test (for women of childbeari ng potential); review of any AEs; and review of concomitant medications and entry criteria. These renal disease stability assessments will be evaluated to ensure eligibility with respect to entry criteria for UPCR and eGFR. Note that the laboratory assessments and FMV results of the last stability assessment will be used as the qualifying values for eligibility. FMV urine samples (for determination of UPCR) will be collected at all visits during the screening period and must be returned and the resu lts evaluated prior to Baseline/Day 1 . If the FMV is for some reason not available at Day 1, Week 12 or Week 24, standard urinalysis from a 24- hour urine collection may be substituted as an exception but only after agreement is reached with the Medical Mon itor. Blood samples will be drawn according to Table 1. If the subject is from an area where TB is endemic or whose history suggests an increased personal risk, e.g., from contact with people with TB or travel to areas with endemic TB, the subject will be carefully evaluated for latent or active TB."

EVALUATION , RECORDING AND REPORTING OF AES AND SAE S 10.1 Definitions 10.1.1 Adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment is an AE. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 10.1.2 Adverse Drug Reaction In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medical product or its new usages, particularly as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 10.1.3 Serious Adverse Event An SAE (experience) or reaction is an untoward medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the following criteria : • Results in death (Note: death is an outcome, not an event) • Is life -threatening (Not e: the te rm “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe) • Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Results in a con genital anomaly/birth defect • Is a medically important event or reaction The definitions and reporting requirements of International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management, Definitions , and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2 will be adhered to."
62,page_62,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 63 of 111 Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These events will also usually be considered serious. Hospitalizations that have been scheduled prior to the subject signing the informed consent form (ICF), although not recorded as SAEs, must be documented in the subject’s source documents. A renal biopsy performed as part of the study to verify eligibility will not be considered a n SAE. Any complication experienced during a renal biopsy procedure resulting in hospitalization or a prolongation of the hospitalization requires SAE reporting. 10.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Any ADR that is both serious and unexpected (per the IB) that, based on the opinion of the Investigator or Aurinia, is felt to have a reasonable suspected causal relationship to a medicinal product is a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction . 10.2 Adverse Event Descriptors 10.2.1 Intensity/Severity Categorization The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); however , the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or ability to function. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. In general, the intensity of a particular AE to be recorded is the worst intensity experienced by the subject during the course of the event. The medical assessment of intensity will be determined by using the following definitions: Mild: The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with usual activity. Moderate: The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function. Severe: The AE is incapacitating and the subject is unable to work or complete usual activity. 10.2.2 Causal Relationship Categorization An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the study treatment for each AE and SAE. The Investigator must decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the"
63,page_63,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 64 of 111 study treatment . If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE/SAE must be classified as not related. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a cause-and- effect relationship between the study treatment and the occurrence of the AE/SAE, then the AE/SAE will be considered related. For SAEs, the Investigator must provide a brief comment explaining the rationale of his/her assessment of causal relationship on the SAE reporting form. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition Related Yes The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment administration indicates a causal relationship , and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. Not related No The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study tr eatment administration does not indicate a causal relationship , or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. If the causal relationship between an AE/SAE and the study treatme nt is determined to be “related”, the event will be considered to be related to study treatment for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. In circumstances where the Investigator has not yet provided his/her assessment about the relationship, the event will be considered as “related” and qualify for expedited regulatory reporting. 10.2.3 Outcome Categorization Outcome may be classified as recovered without sequelae; recovered with sequelae; improved ; worsened; ongoing; ongoing at end of study; fatal; or unknown. If the outcome is reported as recovered with sequelae for a n SAE , the Investigator should specify the kind of sequelae on the SAE reporting form. SAEs that are ongoing at the time of death will have an outcome of “unknown” recorded. SAEs resulting in a fatal outcome will have an outcome of “fatal” recorded. 10.2.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations A change in the value of a safety laboratory investigation can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant in the opinion of the Investigator or if, during treatment with the study treatment, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to a pathological value, or a further worsening of an already pathological value. If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are pathological laboratory values which were not present at baseline, further clinical or laboratory investigations will be performed until the values return to within reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) is found for the pathological laboratory values."
64,page_64,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 65 of 111 If the Investigator considers such an AE as serious it must be reported as an SAE . 10.2.5 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error All AEs of special interest such as study drug abuse, misuse, overdose , and medication error have to be documented in the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. If any occurrence of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors leads to any event that fulfils any seriousness criteria, the event has to be reported as an SAE. 10.3 Reporting Procedure for AEs, SAEs , and Pregnancy 10.3.1 Adverse Events All AEs observed from time of signing of the ICF will be recorded in the subject's source documentation. This applies to all AEs regardless of presumed relationship to the study drug. For screen failure subjects, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the screening period (after informed consent) will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation only and will not be collected on the eCRF. Adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug must be collected. If any AE is reported, the date of onset, relationship to study treatment , relationship to disease under study, any action taken, date of resolution (or the fact that it is still continuing or has become chronic), outcome, and whether the AE is serious or not , will be recorded. Use of colloquialisms and abbreviations should be avoided. Only one AE term should be recorded in the event field on the AE eCRF. Where possible, the Investigator should report a diagnosis rather than signs and symptoms or abnormal laboratory values. However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one AE r eport based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. The AE reporting period begins at the time the ICF is signed by the subject. Note that for screen failure subjec ts, any AEs and SAEs occurring during the screening period will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation only. For enrolled subjects (i.e., those who successfully complete screening), the AE reporting period ends at the second Safety Follow -up vis it (Visit 10) . Adverse events persisting at the time of study completion will be followed by the Investigator through contact with the subject until resolution or stabilization has occurred (or the subject is lost to follow -up and cannot be contacted) and recorded in the source documents. If the subject reports an AE, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to acquire sufficient information in order to assess causality. This may require additional laboratory testing, physical examinations, telephone contact s, etc. In circumstances where the Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up."
65,page_65,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 66 of 111 In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked a non- leading question, such as “How are you feeling?” It is also important to question the subject in a non- leading way about changes in their health or concomitant medication usage since their last visit. This information should be collected prior to completion of assessments at all study visits. In addition, any symptoms/conditions reported during assessments and deemed to be clinically significant by the Investigator will be considered AEs. 10.3.2 Serious Adverse Events For screen failure subjects, any SAEs occurring during the screening period (after informed consent) will be recorded in the subject’s source documentation only and will not be collected on the eCRF. For enrolled subjects (i.e., those who successfully complete screening), all SAEs occurring after the signing of the ICF will be reported to within 24 hours of the Investigator, designee, or site staff’s knowledge of the event regardless of relationship to study drug or relationship to disease under study. For enrolled subjects, all SAEs will be recorded in the AE section of the subject’s eCRF and source documentation. In the event that the site experiences a temporary disruption of the EDC system a back -up paper SAE Reporting Form will be available for site staff to co mplete. • Site staff will complete the paper SAE report form and e -mail it within 24 hours to the following address: • Only in cases where the email system is unavailable, site staff will sen d the SAE by fax to: . If notification is made via email or fax, site staff must enter the SAE information into the EDC system as soon as the system becomes available. All SAEs , regardless of causality, will be reported from the time the ICF is signed until 30 days follo wing the last study visit or 30 days after last study treatment administration , whichever is longer . No formal study visit is required but Investigators must report any SAEs that occur during this 30- day period using the SAE reporting form provided; these will be entered into the safety database only. If the Investigator has not seen the subject at a clinic visit at the end of the reporting period, the Investigator must make reasonable efforts to contact the subject to inquire about SAEs. All recorded SAEs, regardless of relationship to study treatment or relationship to disease under study , will be followed up until resolution, stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow- up and cannot be contacted. In circumstances where th e Investigator is unable to make contact with the subject, the Investigator must provide a written statement to Aurinia confirming that the subject is lost to follow -up."

A rationale for the assessment of a causal relationship must be provided by the Investigator. Any safety information that is obtained after the Follow-up Visit (Visit 9) will be documented in the safety database only. A death occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the Investigator within 30 days after the last study visit (including the Follow -up Visit ) or until 30 days after the last study treatment administration, whichever is longer, whether considered drug- related or not, must be reported to Aurinia. If the subject died, the SAE report should include the cause of death as the event term and whether or not the death was related to study treatment, a s well as the autopsy findings, if available. Preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions which will include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports/certificates and other documents when requested and applicable. Additional follo w-up information must be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness following Investigator (or site) awareness of the information. The Investigator should not delay reporting a n SAE in order to obtain additional information. Additional information, when available, should be reported to by the reporting procedures described above. The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the study Medical Monitor when the issue of seriousness is unclear or questionable. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will file it along with the IB and will notify the Institutional Re view Board ( IRB)/ Ethics Committee (EC)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC ), if appropriate according to local requirements. The sponsor or its representative will be responsible for determining and, in turn, reporting SAEs to regulatory authorities according to the applicable regulatory requirements. 10.3.3 Pregnancy Pregnancy occurring in a female subject or in the partner of a male subject should be reported to within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event using the pregnancy eCRF . The Investigator should counsel the subject , and in the case of a male subject, the subject’s partner, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. A female subject must immediately inform the Investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. Monitoring of the pregnancy in a female subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. In case of a pregnancy in the partner of a male subject, the Investigator should obtain informed consent of the pregnant partner prior to monitoring of the pregnancy."

The outcome of all such pregnancies (including normal births) should be followed up and documented, even if the subject was withdrawn from the study. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome until 90 days (or otherwise as appropriate) post -partum. It will be the responsibility of Aurinia, together with the appropriate support of the Investigator, to obtain this information. Complications of pregnancy such as abortion (spontaneous or induced), premature birth, or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and should be reported following the reporting procedures as outlined in Section 10.3.2, Serious Adverse Events.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 13.1 Statistical Methods Complete details of the statistical and analytical methods will be provided in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the database lock . A general description of the planned methods is provided below. Any deviation from the SAP will be noted and explained in the clinical study report. 13.2 Sample Size and Power Calculations The total sample size will be approximately 20 subjects, with up to 10 subjects in Cohort 1 and at least 10 subjects in Cohort 2. As this is an explorator y study, sample size calculations are not required. Descriptive statistics will be used and the results will only be hypothesis-generating. 13.3 Populations 13.3.1 Intent-to- Treat Set The intent- to-treat (ITT) set will consist of all enrolled subjects (non- screening failures) and will be used for all efficacy analyses. 13.3.2 Safety Set The safety set will consist of all subjects who have taken at least 1 dose of study treatment. 13.3.3 Per-protocol Set The per -protocol set (PPS) will consist of all subjects eligible from the ITT set who do not have any major protocol violations. Major protocol violations will be defined in the SAP . 13.4 Datasets Assessments taken at each visit will be analyzed using 2 different datasets. The first will be the observed cases dataset whereby all values collected will contribute to the dataset. A second dataset will be used for summaries and analys es incorporating data carried forward from a subject’s last known value. This dataset will be referred to as the last observation carried forward dataset and as such, all subjects with any post -baseline efficacy assessment will contribute to the Week 24 analyse s. 13.5 Background and Demographic Characteristics Demographic and clinical disease characteristics will be summarized."

73,page_73,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 74 of 111 13.9 Statistical and Analytical Methods All statistical analyses relating to the primary and secondary objectives will be undertaken at study closure and will incorporate all available data. In order to aid dose decisions for Cohort 2, an analysis of the first 5 or 6 subjects in Cohort 1 will be undertaken once the 5th or 6th subject reaches Week 12. Given the small sample size, all analyses will be descriptive in nature. Binary remission endpoints will be summarized using counts and proportions while continuous data will be summarized using means, SDs, medians, minimums and maximums. Kaplan - Meier methodology will be used for the analysis of time -to endpoints. Confidence intervals for proportions may be calculated but it is recognized that such intervals, being based on 20 patients, will be very wide. As an example, the 95% Clopper -Pearson CI for a proportion of 30% based on 20 patients is (11.9%, 54.3%). The analysis of the primary endpoint, complete or partial remission of proteinuria at Week 24, will be conducted on the ITT set and confirmed with the PPS (if applicable). Remission of proteinuria will be summarized and an exact 2 -sided 95% CI for the remission rate will be calculated. The analyses of the secondary endpoints will incorporate the use of 2- sided 95% CIs and are described be low: • Binary endpoints will be summarized using counts and proportions along with exact 2-sided 95% CIs . • Endpoints measured as a time- to-event will be displayed using Kaplan- Meier methodology. Median time- to-event along with 2-sided 95% CIs will be displayed. • Other endpoints will be summarized by visit. Absolute values and differences between baseline and each time point up to and including Week 24 will be summarized using means and 2- sided 95% CIs. Changes between last on treatment value and post treatment follow-up will also be summarized. Given the nature of the study, additional exploratory analysis will be undertaken as appropriate. This may include the reporting of individual case studies. 13.10 Safety Evaluations Specific safety endpoints are as follows: • Biochemical (including liver function tests) and hematological laboratory tests"

Adverse events and disea ses will be coded using the latest available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, the version of which will be provided in the clinical study report. Treatment -emergent a dverse events will be summarized by treatment arm, System Organ C lass, and P referred Term. SAEs , SAEs that led to death , and SAEs/AEs that led to withdrawal will also be summarized and listed . Only AEs which started on or after the date of first dose of study treatment and up until 14 days after last dose will be considered TEAEs , though all AEs after informed consent will be recorded . SAEs occurring at any time after informed consent and prior to first study medication will be listed . All prior and concomitant medications will be summarized using preferred terms and ATC Level 2. Details of these and other analyses will be provided in the SAP. All study data analyses involving laboratory values will be based on results from the central laboratory. 13.11 Interim Analyses There will be no full interim analysi s. 13.12 Other Evaluations 13.12.1 Pharmacokinetics Estimates of voclosporin exposure derived from this analysis will be examined for possible relationship to measures of efficacy and safety.

PROCEDURE FOR MODIFICATION OF PROTOCOL OR PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY 17.1 Protocol Waivers, Deviations and Violations Protocol waivers shall not be permitted. The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without written agreement from Aurinia and prior documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study. If the Investigator must implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior written approval , the implemented deviat ion or change and the reasons for it should be submitted in a timely manner to Aurinia and to the IRB/IEC as required by applicable local requirements. The Investigator, or person designated by the Investigator, will document and record the preventative an d/or corrective measures for any deviation from the approved protocol. Accidental deviations from the protocol including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed as minor or major on a case-by- case basis. The criteria describing the deviation(s) and how they will be handled will be documented in the SAP. Any amendment to the protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC prior to its implementation, unless there are overriding safety reasons. In some instances, an ame ndment may require a change to the ICF. The Investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion concerning the reviewed document prior to administering to study subjects. 17.2 Study Termination Aurinia reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a site at any time. Reasons for termination may include but are not limited to the following: unsatisfactory subject enrollment with respect to quality and/or quantity, site is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol or GCP, or data recording is inaccurate and/or incomplete. In terminating the study, Aurinia and the Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject s. Both parties will arrange the procedures on an individual basis a fter review and consultation and in accordance with the study contract."

Recommended First and Second Line T herapies for Treatment of Hypertension Titrate the following according to the timeframe given in the respective drug label: First Line - select from one of the following: • Amlodipine, 5 mg daily to achieve BP <140/90 mmHg; titrate to 10 mg daily if satisfactory results not obtained within 2 weeks • Nifedipine XL, 30 mg daily; titrate to 60 mg and possibly 90 mg daily within 2 weeks • 12.5 to 25 mg/day of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide Second Line - may add from among the following to the first line therapy if a partial response is obtained: • Labetalol, 100 mg BID; titrate to 200 mg BID, then 300 mg BID Note: If the BP remains uncontrolled with the above -referenced maximum doses of first and second -line antihypertensive therapies, reduction of study treatment dose may be considered or it may be decided to discontinue study treatment and utilize antihypertensive therapies to achieve control of BP . If at any time, in the judgment of the treating physician in consultation with the Medical Monitor, the response to treatment is inadequate, the study treatment may be discontinued."

Whenever possible, BP measurements should be undertaken by the same study site personnel at each clinic visi t. 2. Whenever possible, the BP determinations should be undertaken at approximately the same time of day for each study visit and at the same time in relations to prior study treatment ingestion. 3. The measurements should be undertaken prior to blood collection. 4. Prior to measuring BP, the study subject should be seated in a quiet room for at least 5 minutes, in a chair with his/her back supported and feet comfortably resting on the floor. 5. Due to the likelihood each arm can have a slightly different BP, it is strongly encouraged to use the same arm that was selected at screening for all measurements, supported at heart level. 6. No restrictive clothing should encircle the arm in which BP measurements are determined. 7. An appropriately sized cuff will be required where in the cuff bladder encircles at least 80% of the upper portion of the arm. 8. Three serial BP readings will be undertaken with a minimum of 2 minutes between readings and with the cuff fully deflated between each determination. 9. The mean of the second and third of these 3 readings will be used as the study day BP value. 10. All measurements, along with the calculated mean value, will be recorded in the source documents.

According to this review, FSGS “is a histologic lesion, rather than a specific disease entity, that is commonly found to underlie the nephrotic syndrome in adults and children, particularly in the United States, Brazil, and many other countries. FSGS is characterized by the presence of sclerosis in parts (segmental) of some (focal) glomeruli on light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen.” According to this review, FSGS can be classified into the following etiologies, based upon the known and/or postulated causes of this histologic pattern: • “Primary or idiopathic FSGS, which most often presents with the nephrotic syndrome.” • “Secondary FSGS, which most often presents with non-nephrotic proteinuria and, commonly, some degree of renal insufficiency. This category most commonly refers to FSGS that develops as an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyperfiltration. This includes disorders associated with a reduced renal mass and/or renal vasodilation, such as unilateral renal agenesis. In addition, a nonspecific pattern of secondary FSGS can result from scarring produced by a previous injury (due to a variety of conditions, including active IgA nephropathy, vasculitis, and LN). Other secondary causes of FSGS include drugs and toxins (including heroin, interferon, and pamidronate) and viral infections (particularly HIV). ” • “Genetic causes of FSGS, which may present early in childhood with massive proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome or in adolescence or adulthood with less massive proteinuria.” Biopsy and diagnosis : According to Reiser et al, “ precise quantification of sclerotic glomeruli requires three -dimensional morphometric analysis of entire glomeruli and the examination of sufficient glomeruli to ensure that the biopsy specimen is representative of glomeruli in the whole kidney. Kidney biopsies with few glomeruli (i .e., fewer than 15) cannot confidently exclude the diagnosis of FSGS, and, due to sampling error, some cases will be misclassified as minimal change disease. ” “In patients who are found to have a FSGS lesion by light microscopy, the following approach can be used to distinguish between those with primary and secondary FSGS:"
87,page_87,"AUR -VCS -2017 -03 – Version 4.0 (Amendment 3) Confidential 20 December 2019 Page 88 of 111 • Patients who present with nephrotic syn drome (ie, urine protein excretion >3.5 g/day and hypoalbuminemia), who exhibit extensive foot process effacement (≥80 percent) on EM [electron microscopic] examination, and who have no identifiable risk factors associated with secondary FSGS (eg, viral in fection, drugs) most likely have primary FSGS, although genetic forms of FSGS lesions cannot always be excluded with confidence. Thus, primary FSGS is always a diagnosis of exclusion. • Patients who present with subnephrotic (ie, <3.5 g/day in an adult) or nephrotic-range proteinuria and a normal serum albumin concentration (ie, without nephrotic syndrome) and segmental foot process effacement (<80 percent) on EM [ electron microscopic ] examination most likely have secondary FSGS.”"

Magnesium or aluminum containing antacids may be used, but should not be taken at the same time as study treatment ; such antacids, if required, should be taken either 1 hour before or 2 hours after study treatment. • Amphotericin or oral nystatin are permitted as infective prophylaxis against fungal infections, and low -dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim is permitted as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. • Granulocyte colony stimulating factor is allowed to manage neutropenia in the presence of ma jor infection (i.e., infections requiring IV antibiotics). • Oral or IV iron preparations for iron deficiency and/or anemia. • Erythropoietin is permitted for treatment of severe anemia (hemoglobin <10 mg/dL). • Cytomegalovirus prophylaxis is permitted for example with oral valganciclovir. • Acute intermittent administration of NSAIDs for not greater than 7 consecutive days is permitted. • At the discretion of the Investigator, subjects with hyperlipidemia may be treated with lipid lowering agents (e.g., statins) in accordance with standard clinical practice. Doses must be stable in the 2 weeks prior to baseline. • Subjects with nephrotic edema may be treated with diuretics during the screening period. Volume status should be optimized based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator and the doses of diuretics must be stable in the 2 weeks prior to baseline. • ACEIs , ARBs, and aliskerin and other therapies are recommended, as per standard guidelines, but if used their dose must be stable throughout the study.
