During the Treatment Period, study drug refers to VX -445/TEZ/ IVA and matching placebo, TEZ/IVA and matching placebo, and IVA. Active study drugs will be orally administered as fixed -dose combination (FDC) film -coated tablets (2 VX -445/TEZ/IVA tablets or 1 TEZ/IVA tablet) in the morning and as 1 film -coated IVA tablet in the evening. Active substance: VX-445, TEZ (tezacaftor; VX -661), and IVA (ivacaftor, VX -770) Activity: CFTR corrector, CFTR corrector, and CFTR potentiator (increased Cl− secretion) Strength: 100-mg VX-445/50-mg TEZ/75 -mg IVA FDC tablet Active substance: TEZ (tezacaftor; VX -661) and IVA (ivacaftor; VX -770) Activity: CFTR corrector and CFTR potenti ator (increased Cl− secretion) Strength: 100-mg TEZ/150 -mg IVA FDC tablet Active substance: IVA (ivacaftor; VX -770) Activity: CFTR potentiator (increased Cl− secretion) Strength: 150-mg tablet Study Duration The total study duration is approximately 16 weeks (4 weeks for the Screening Period, 4 weeks for the TEZ/IVA Run -in Period, 4 weeks for the Treatment Period, and 4 weeks for the Safety Follow-up Period). Study Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, dou ble-blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study. In the TEZ/IVA Run -in Period, all subjects will receive TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h). After completing the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC arm or TEZ/IVA arm for the Treatment Period. The Treatment Period dosages to be evaluated are shown in the table below. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run- in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 versus ≥70) and age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age). If the Day -14 ppFEV 1"

The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 is the same for the TC and TEZ/IVA treatment groups. The nul l hypothesis will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a within- group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, a sample size of 50 subjects in each treatment group for a total of 100 subjects will have approximately 93% power to detect a difference of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 between the 2 treatment groups, based on a 2 -sided 2-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05. The primary analysis will be based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and Week 4 as the dependent variable; treatment group, visit, and treatment -by-visit as fixed effects; with continuous baseline ppFEV 1 and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates; and an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors. The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week 4. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2- sided P value will be provided. The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit. The safety analysis will be descriptive only. IDMC Reviews An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety review of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter."

At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and water absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite prog ress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years . 2,6 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality .7 More effective treatments are needed for CF. The most common disease- causing CFTR mutation, F508del , accounts for 70% of the identified alleles in people w ith CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F) .2, 3, 8 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane, and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required. The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products that were developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco ®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. A second corrector/potentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in certain countries. VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector being developed for administration in triple combination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF. 5.2 Rationale for the Present Study This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who have an F/F genotype. These patients have continuing unmet need despite currently available CFTR modulators. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported by in vitro data and clinical data in F/F subjects; in addition, the TC of VX-445/TEZ/IVA is generally safe and well tolerated (refer to VX -445 Investigator’s Brochure)."

23,page_23,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 24 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 Rescreening Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated, except for: • CFTR genotyping • Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test during prior screening) • G6PD activity test • Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3 months of the date of informed consent, for subjects <18 years of age) If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons: • Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1) • Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria • Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, Section 11.7.6) 9.1.2 Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor Run -in Period The TEZ/IVA Run -in Period has a 4-week duration and is designed to establish a reliable on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of open -label TEZ/IVA will be administered at the Day -28 Visit. The last dose of open- label TEZ/IVA will be administered in the evening on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit). On Day -14, spirometry and SwCl will be assessed. The Day -14 spirometry assessm ent will be used for stratification of randomization ( Section 9.2). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period ( Section 9.1.5.1). 9.1.3 Treatment Period The Treatment Period will be randomized, double-blind, and active- controlled. It will last approximately 4 weeks (Day 1 to Week 4). Study drug administration details are provided in Section 9.6."
24,page_24,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 25 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and may occur on either Day -1 or Day 1. Randomization and stratification details are provided in Section 9.2. To enter the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease (as judged by the investigator) and have remained on a stable CF treatment regimen during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period. Female subjects of childbearing potential also must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 1 before receiving randomized study drug. If these conditions are not met (for example, if the subject has an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therap y [including antibiotics] for sinopulmonary disease within 28 days before the Day 1 Visit [first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period]), the subject is considered a run-in failure and cannot enter the Treatment Period or rescreen. Subjects who prema turely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and complete the assessments for all study visits, as described in Section 9.1.5.2. 9.1.4 Follow-up The Safety Follow -up Visit will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing, as described in Section 9.1.5. An open-label study will be available for subjects who complete the Week 4 Visit and are eligible. The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week 4 Visit and enroll in an open- label study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 9.1.5 Early Termination of Treatment If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possibl e after the decision to discontinue treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety F ollow-up Visit are listed in Table 3-2. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replac e the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent. 9.1.5.1 Discontinuation During the Run- in Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period. The se subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow- up Visit (as applicable; see Section 9.1.5). The Safety Follow- up Visit will be their last visit in the study."
25,page_25,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 26 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.1.5.2 Discontinuation During the Treatment Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will continue to complete all scheduled study visits for assessments following completion of the ETT Visit, as detailed in Table 3-2. Data regarding concomitant antibiotic therapy for sinopulmonary signs/symptoms will also continue to be collected for these subjects. These subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow -up Visit (as applicable; see Section 9.1.5). The Safety Follow-up Visit will be their last visit in the study. 9.1.6 Lost to Follow -up A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occur: • The subject misses 2 consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is subsequently unable to be conta cted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit) • The subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3 attempted telephone contacts. 9.1.7 Completion of Study Participation Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as one of the following: • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open- label study within 28 days of the Week 4 Visit: the Week 4 Visit • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open- label study within 28 days of the Week 4 Visit: the Safety Follow -up Visit • For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as appli cable): The ETT or Safety Follow -up Visit (if required) • For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the ETT or Safety Follow-up Visit (if required) • For subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier (Section 9.9) If subjects are lost to follow -up (Section 9.1.6), the date of completion of study participation will be defined as the date of the last contact. The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 9.1.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee This study will be monitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which wil l conduct periodic reviews of safety data from the study ( Section 12.3.6.2). Procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened."
26,page_26,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 27 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC VX- 445/TEZ/ IVA arm or to the TEZ/IVA arm. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 versus ≥70) and age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age). If the Day -14 ppFEV 1 value is not valid or not available, the most recent available ppFEV 1 value will be used for stratification. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by Vertex Biometrics or a qualified randomization vendor. 9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design This Phase 3 study will assess the efficac y, PD, safety, and PK of VX-445/TEZ/IVA TC therapy in subjects with CF who have an F/F genotype. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study design was selected to ascertain the effects of VX-445/TEZ/ IVA while avoiding observer bias. TEZ/IVA is considered an appropriate active control since the efficacy and safety of TEZ/IVA in F/F subjects have been demonstrated in Study VX14-661-106 (Study 661-106) . 14 Study 661-106 met its primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 through Week 24, with a 4.0 percentage point treatment differe nce between TEZ/IVA and placebo. In Study 661- 106, TEZ/IVA was well tolerated and no safety concerns attributable to TEZ/IVA were identified. A 4-week TEZ/IVA Run -in Period was incorporated into this study to establish a reliable on-treatment (TEZ/IVA) bas eline for comparison during the Treatment Period. The study will have a 4 -week treatment duration because previous studies of CFTR modulators (IVA, LUM/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) have demonstrated that efficacy related to lung function (ppFEV 1) can be reliably established using an endpoint at Week 4. In these studies, rapid improvements in ppFEV 1 are observed by Day 15, with a separation between the active treatment and placebo groups that is sustained through 24 weeks of treatment. These studies were conducted in patients with different genotypes, baseline ppFEV 1, and age groups, using CFTR modulators that had different magnitudes of response. The extent of response to CFTR modulator treatment may depend on the subject’s ppFEV 1 value (an index of disease severity) b efore the start of TC study drug dosing. Some subjects in this study may be receiving treatment with LUM/IVA or TEZ/IVA at Screening, while some subjects may not be receiving treatment with CFTR modulators. Therefore, randomization will be stratified by pp FEV 1 value determined during the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period after at least 13 days of TEZ/IVA (Day -14 assessment). Randomization will also be stratified by age at screening. This will ensure a balanced evaluation of adult and pediatric subjects. 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose VX-445 Dosage A VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd was selected for the current study based on an assessment of the benefit-risk profile from the ongoing Phase 2 Study VX16-445-001 (Study 445-001) Parts D and E. In Study 445-001 Part D, a range of VX-445 doses (50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, and 200 mg qd) in"

CYP: cytochrome P450; IVA: ivacaftor; OATP1B1: organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1; TEZ: tezacaftor a Ciprofloxacin is not a moderate CYP3A inhibitor on the basis of results of a drug- drug interaction study conducted with IVA, a sensitive CYP3A substrate (Kalydeco [ivacaftor] US Package Insert). 9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies, will be collected from each subject’s source documentation for medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized into the Treatment Period, details of prior medication will be documente d only in the subjects’ source documents. • Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the TEZ/IVA Run -in/Day -28 through completion of study participation. Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatme nt regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before the TEZ/IVA Run- in/Day -28. Subjects may remain on Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved) during the Screening Period and may transition directly to the TEZ/IVA R un-in/Day -28 without a washout ( Table 9-2). Subjects should not initiate long- term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the TEZ/IVA Run -in/Day -28 through completion of study participation . Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows: o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic. o Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. • Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days."

Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.6.1. 9.6 Administration 9.6.1 Dosing Study drug will be administered orally. All subjects will receive the same number of tablets each day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug will be administered with a fat -containing meal or snack, such as a standard ""CF"" meal or snack or a standard meal. 1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 2. Study drug will b e administered as fixed -dose combination (FDC) tablet(s) (e.g., 2 TC or matching placebo tablets; 1 TEZ/IVA or matching placebo tablet) in the morning and as 1 IVA tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection and the dose received on the morning of PK sam ple collection (if applicable). 4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug (TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo) will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo. 5. If a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used: • If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic. • If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo at home. • At the Day 15 Visit, the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo must be administered in the clinic to enable post- dose ECG assessments relative to the dose. 6. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 9.6.2 Missed Doses 9.6.2.1 Morning Dose of Study Drug If a subject misses the morning dose of study drug (TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo) and recalls within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours but fewer than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should take the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo but skip the evening dose of study drug (IVA). If more than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip the morning dose of TC, TEZ/IVA, or placebo and take the evening dose of IVA."
31,page_31,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 32 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.6.2.2 Evening Dose of Stud y Drug If a subject misses the evening dose of IVA and recalls within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. 9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Section 9.1.5). 9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. 9.8.1 Liver Function Tests The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples. Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administra tion must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met: • ALT or AST >8 × ULN • ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks • ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical j aundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met: • Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved All subjec ts in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or wi thout increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified , study drug administration may be resum ed once"
32,page_32,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 33 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with t he study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9.8.2 Rash Individuals who develop generalized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event. The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher ( Section 13.1.1.4), or is a serious adverse event (SA E). Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug i f considered clinically appropriate. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, beh avior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of the following criteria: • Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. These subjects must be discontinued from the study ( Section 8.1) • Meets any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria ( Section 9.8) • Becomes pregnant (S ection 11.7.7.2) Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.5.2. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.5), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. If the subject withdraws consent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If"
33,page_33,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 34 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her sample s. 9.10 Replacement of Subjects Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of the Treatment Period may be replaced.

Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accoun tability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site. 10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study. 10.7 Blinding and Unblinding This will be a double-blind study."
35,page_35,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 36 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 10.7.1 Blinding All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes. Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following: • Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safet y of the subject in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency • Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy • Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations • Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list • Vertex IWRS Manager • Vertex Clinical Supply Chain • IDMC • Vendor preparing the unblinded analysis of safety data for review by the IDMC • Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical study team member will continue to be blinded. Access to Spirometry and SwCl Results : During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry or SwCl results after the firs t dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spirometry and SwCl data will be reviewed for data cleaning purposes by a biostatistician who does not have access to the treatment codes. Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of study-related spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the stud y has completed (i.e., clinical study report [CSR] finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment. 10.7.2 Unblinding At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is"
36,page_36,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 37 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. In case of emergency, the investigator will have the final decision and unilateral right for unblinding. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center ( ) will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site pers onnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Vertex GPS or Designee for SAEs or Safety Concerns Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time. 11 ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Timing of Assessments The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight. Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will include a complete review of systems, medi cal and surgical histories, and any allergies. Height and weight will be measured with shoes off . Following screening, height will be collected only for subjects ≤21 years of age on the date of informed consent."

Pre-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have • withheld their short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment; • withheld their long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and • withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spir ometry assessment. During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing ( Section 9.6.1) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following: • If a subject’s Day 1 spirometry assessment is pre -bronchodilator, but, on a subsequent visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spir ometry assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled. • If, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be performed post-bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric measurements (according to the schedule of assessments in Table 3-2) should be performed post-bronchodilator."
41,page_41,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 42 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Each spirometry assessment will be record ed in the source documents as pre- or post-bronchodilator. All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. The investigator’s assessment of the spirometry results will be used for the screening assessment and determination of eligibility. See Section 10.7.1 for information about access to spirometry results. The measured spirometric values listed below will be converted to percent predicted values using the standard equations of GLI . 9 • FEV1 (L) 11.6.2 C ystic Fibrosis Questionnaire -Revised The questionnaires provide information about demographics; general quality of life, school, work, or daily activities; and symptom difficulties (pertaining to CF). Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ -R in their native language, if validated translations are available. 19, 20 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native language, the subject will not complete the questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ-R used will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of the CFQ -R, if available, w ill be provided for participating centers in non- English-speaking countries . 21, 22 The CFQ-R will be completed before any other assessments are performed at that visit. Subjects who are 12 and 13 years of age at the date of informed consent will complete the CFQ-R Child version themselves, and their parents/caregivers will complete the CFQ- R Parent version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject subsequently turns 14 years of age durin g the study. Subjects 14 years of age and older at the date of informed consent will complete the Adolescent/Adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. 11.7 Safety Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, and clinical evaluation of vital signs, ECGs, PEs, and pulse oximetry. For subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, ophthalmological examinations will also be performed at screening (if not done within preceding 3 months). 11.7.1 Adverse Events All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines. Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for documenting, grading, and reporting AEs.

Pregnancy (β-human chorionic gonadotropin) Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential: Any female subject who does not meet the criteria for non -childbearing potential is considered to be of childbearing potential and must have a serum pregnancy test at screening. A definition of non-childbearing potential is provided in Section 11.7.7.1. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed and analyzed at the site. The urine pregnancy test on Day -28 and Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug in the study period. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or requirements. FSH (Screening Period Only): Blood samples for FSH will be measured for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test. CFTR Genotype (Screening Period Only): CFTR genotyping will be performed for all subjects. If the screening CFTR genotype result is not received before Day -28, a previous CF TR genotype laboratory report may be used to establish eligibility. Subjects who have been enrolled and whose screening genotype is not confirmed to be F/F must be discontinued from the study (Section 9.9)."
44,page_44,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 45 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated G6PD Activity Test (Screening Period Only) : A blood sample will be collected for a quantitative G6PD activity assay, which will be performed in an established laboratory that runs the assay routinely. The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs the assay is permissible following approval by the medical monitor. Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinicall y appropriate. For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise (e.g., G6PD activity test), only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for manage ment of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits (see Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 ). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments will occur at any time if deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider. A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: EENT, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, skin, and abdomen. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed before dosing and following at least a 5- minute rest. 11.7.4 Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1). 11.7.5 Electrocardiograms Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 and Table 3-2). Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. Subjects will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an E CG performed. The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically"
45,page_45,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 46 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs. To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual. 11.7.6 Ophthalmologic Examination Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted at screening only for subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of informed consent. The examination does not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will include • measurement of best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and • pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp. The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent. Any clinically significant ab normal findings will be reported as AEs. For subjects who subsequently enroll in an open-label study, follow-up ophthalmologic examinations will be performed as per that study’s protocol. 11.7.7 Contraception and Pregnancy The effects of VX -445, TEZ, and IVA on c onception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. VX-445, TEZ, and IVA did not show genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. 11.7.7.1 Contraception Contraception requirement for a couple is waived for the following: • True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. • If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infert ility must be documented before the first dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound)."
46,page_46,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 47 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • If the female is of non -childbearing potential. To be considered of non- childbearing potential, the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria: o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH level within the laboratory’s reference range for postmenopausal females o Documented hysterectomy or bilater al oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered to be of childbearing potential. • Same-sex relationships For subjects for whom the contraception requirement is not waived, study participation requires a commitment from the subject that at least 1 acceptable method of contraception is used as a couple. Methods of contraception must be in successful use from signing of consent (or assent, when applicable), approximately 28 days before th e first dose of study drug on Day -28 (unless otherwise noted), and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. Acceptable methods of contraception are listed in Table 11-2 .

If a female subject becomes pregnant during study participation, study drug will be permanentl y discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. Male subjects with female partner s who become pregnant during the study must use a male condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal fluid. The subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow- up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 12.1 Sample Size and Power The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 is the same for the TC and TEZ/IVA treatment groups. The null hypothesis will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, a sample size of 50 subjects in each treatment group for a total of 100 subjects will have approximately 93% power to detect a difference of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 between the 2 treatment groups, based on a 2-sided 2- sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05 12.2 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets are defined: Al l Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety Set. Additional analysis sets related to the Run -in Period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate. The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. The FAS will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and receive at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The FAS will be used to summarize subject demographics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified."
48,page_48,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 49 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated The Safety Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received, unless otherwise specified. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted with the appropriate precision. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place. The baseline value , unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non -missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value. The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period for the Run -in Period will be from the first dose date of study drug in the Run-in Period to (1) the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period for subjects who complete the Run-in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or (2) 28 days after the last dose date of study drug in the Run-in Period or to the completion of study participation date, whichever occurs first, for subjects who do not continue to the Treatment Period (e.g., subjects who do not meet the conditions to enter the Treatment Period). The TE Period for the Treatment Period will include the time from the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period (TC or placebo + TEZ/IVA) to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.7), whichever occurs first. 12.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation, and entered an open- label study) will be summarized overall and by treatment group. An additional subject disposition summary related to the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate."

The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by treatment group for the FAS, and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline SwCl. Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for the FAS. No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups . 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug -Dictionary and categorized as follows: • Prior medication : any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period but not in the Run-in Period. For subjects who discontinue during the Run-in Period and whose first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period is not available, prior medication will be any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the last dose of study drug in the Run-in Period but before the first dose in the Run-in Period • Concomitant medication during the Run- in Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Run-in Period • Concomitant medication during the Treatment Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Treatment Period • Post-treatment medication : medication continued or newly received after: o the TE Period for the Run-in Period if the subject did not receive study drug in the Treatment Period o the TE Period for the Treatment Period for subjects who received study drug in the Treatment Period A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post- treatment medication. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by Preferred Name, overall, and by treatment group based on the FAS. Post- treatment medications will be provided separately in an individual subject data listing. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized for the Treatment Period only."
50,page_50,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 51 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Study drug exposure will be summarized overall and by treatment group, based on the Safety Set in terms of the duration of treatment a s ubject received (in days), defined as the last day – the first day of study drug plus 1, regardless of study drug interruption. Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as: 100 × [1- (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of study drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as 100 × [(total number of tablets dispensed for the Treatment Period) – (total number of tablets returned for the Treatment Period)] / (total number of tablets plan ned to be taken per day × duration of study drug exposure in days for the Treatment Period). 12.3.2.5 Important Protocol Deviations An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing and summarized, as appropriate. 12.3.3 Efficacy a nd Pharmacodynamic Analyses The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and IVA. The analysis in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Variable The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The analysis of this variable will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and Week 4 as the dep endent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1 and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within-subject errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed. The prima ry result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week 4. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2-sided P value will be provided. Furthermore, the treatment difference at each post -baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model. Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP. Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses by selected baseline characteristics will also be described in the SAP."
51,page_51,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 52 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 12.3.3.2 Analysis of Key Secondary Variables The key secondary variables are: • Absolute change in SwCl from baseline at Week 4 : Analysis of this pharmacodynamics (PD) variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from the Day 15 and Week 4 Visits will be included in the model. • Absolute change in the CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4: Analysis of this domain will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from the Da y 15 and Week 4 Visits will be included in the model. Details will be provided in the SAP. 12.3.3.4 Multiplicity Adjustment A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error at an alpha of 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints tested. The key secondary endpoints of absolute change in SwCl from baseline at Week 4 and absolute change in CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4 will only be tested at an alpha of 0.05 if the primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 is statistically significant. The second key secondary endpoint will only be tested if the first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant. The testing order of the key secondary endpoints is as follows: 1. First key secondary endpoint: Absolute change in SwCl from baseline at Week 4 2. Second key secondary endpoint: Absolute change in CFQ- R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4 12.3.4 Safety Analysis All safety analyses will be based on data from the TE Period for all subjects in the Safety Set. The overall safety profile of study drug will be assessed based on the following safety and tolerability endpoints: • Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) • Clinical laboratory values (i.e., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis) • ECGs • Vital signs"

When summarizing the number and percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will be counted once, only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summaries, and the strongest relationship level in the relationship summaries. In addition, a listing containing individual subject level AE data for all deaths and other serious and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre- and post- treatment AEs, will be presented in individual subject data listings. 12.3.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments For the treatment -emergent laboratory measurements, the observed values and change from baseline values of the continuous hematology, serum chemistry, and coagulation results will be summarized in SI units by treatment group at each visit. The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 threshold analysis event during the TE Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. The threshold analysis criterion shift from baseline will also be summarized for select laboratory parameters. The threshold analysis criteria and the parameter selection criteria will be provided in the SAP. Results of urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be listed in individual subject data listings only. In addition, a listing containing individual subject hematology, chemistry, and coagulation values will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled visits. 12.3.4.3 Electrocardiogram For the treatment -emergent ECG measurements, a summary of observ ed values and change from baseline values will be provided by treatment group, at each visit and time point, as applicable, for the following ECG interval measurements (in msec): RR, PR, QT, and QT corrected for HR (QTcF), QRS duration, and HR (beats per minute).

This includes any newly"
55,page_55,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 56 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tes ts, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically si gnificant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: • Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment • Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention • A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be rec orded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: • Description of the event • Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” • Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) • Severity • Causal relationship to study drug(s) • Action taken • Outcome • Concomitant medication or other treatment given"
56,page_56,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 57 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed 28 September 2017). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCA E will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3."
57,page_57,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 58 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/not resolved (continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an A E, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: • Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred"
58,page_58,"Protocol VX17-445-103, Version 3.0 Page 59 of 67 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Congenital anomaly or birth defect • Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “s erious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor med ical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours. SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) an d possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities."

The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to approval by Vertex or its designee. When determining the age of the subject, other study eligibility criteria, and timing of collection applicable assessments, the informed consent will be used as the reference (e.g., age at time of informed consent, date of informed consent, timing of AE collection). 13.2.3 Investigator Compliance No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and Vertex. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will require IRB/IEC notification before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities."
