SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A Phase II, Open Label, Randomized, Two -Arm Study to Investigate the Efficacy and Safet y of Two Doses of the Antibody Drug Conjugate GSK2857916 in Participants with Multiple My eloma Who Ha d3 or More Prior Lines of Treatment , Are Refractory to a Proteasome I nhibitor and an Immunomodulatory Agent and Have Failed an Anti -CD38 Antibody (DREAMM 2) Short Title: Open -label , randomized study of two doses of GSK2857916 in participants with relapsed/refractory multi ple my eloma who have failed prior treatment with an anti- CD38 antibody . Rationale: Multiple my eloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy and accounts for 1% of all cancers and for 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Worldwide, approximately 103,000 new cases are diagnosed annually , and an estimated 30,330 new cases and 12,650 deaths will occur in the US in 2016. Despite significant advances in treatment options, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), and novel therapies like second -and third -generation proteasome inhibitors (P Is), immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), and recent addition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), most MM patients will ultimately develop resistance to existing therapies and die of relapse. One such novel therap y, daratumumab, i s a human IgG kmonoclonal antibody that was granted first approval in the US in November 2015. Daratumumab binds with high affinity to the CD38 molecule, which is highl y expressed on the surface of MM cells. I t is believed to induce rapid tumor cell deat h through apoptosis, and multiple immune - mediated mechanisms, including complement -dependent cy totoxicity , antibody - dependent cellular phagocy tosis and antibody -dependent cellular cy totoxicity . Daratumumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of MM in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone in patients who have rec eived at least one prior therapy , in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients who have received at least two prior therapies inclu ding lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor ( PI), and as monotherap y for the treatment of patients who have received at least three prior lines of therap y, including a PI and an IMiD , or who are double -refractory to a PI and an IMiD. In Europe, daratumum ab is approved for the treatment of MM in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients who have received at least one prior therapy and as monotherap y for the treatment of patients with rel apsed and refractory MM, whose prior therapy included a PI and an immunomodulatory agent and who have demonstrated disease progression on the last therap y. Patients with MM who have proven refractory to daratumumab mono -and combination therap y, have few treatment options available, and could benefit significantl y from treatment with a next -generation regimen, such as GSK2857916. GSK2857916 is a humanized (IgG1) antibod y-drug conjugate (ADC) which binds to BCMA, a target widel y expressed on malignant plasm a cells in MM . The parent anti - BCMA antibod y is conjugated to the microtubule inhibitor, MMAF, which is released"
11,page_11,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDENTIA L 205678 12inside the malignant cell after binding and internalization of the antibody . The normal function of BCMA is to promote cell survival b y trans duction of signals from two known ligands: B -cell activating factor from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF/BLyS), and APRIL, a proliferation -inducing ligand. In addition, preclinical experiments indicate that GSK2857916 has the potential to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) in a BCMA -expressing multiple my eloma cell line. Exposure of dendritic cells to tumor cells undergoing ICD induces an antigen -specific T cell response ,which may help to exert anti -tumor effects. Preliminary clinical dat a from the ongoin g BMA117159 study as of 26 June 2017 (n=35 participants treated at 3.4 mg/kg) has demonstrated an ORR of 60% [95% CI : 42.1%, 76.1%], (complete response: 6%, very good partial response [ VGPR ]43%, partial response [ PR]9%), with 51% of participant s (N = 18/35) having deep responses of VGPR or better, in heavily pretreated participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The median duration of response (D oR) has not been achieved, the 25th percentile for DoR is 6.7 months; the median PFS in this population was 7.9 months [95% CI : 3.1, NA]. The number of prior therapies ranged from 1 -13 with 71% of participant s reporting greater than or equal to 4 prior therapies. For the 14 (40%) participants who had received prior daratumumab , the ORR was 43%, ( 95% CI : 17.7%, 71.1% ; CR: 0,VGPR: 21%;PR: 14%). In Stud y BMA117159 , the maximum clinical benefit (ORR) was observed at the 3.4mg/kg dose level, but a significant number of participant s required dose delay s and dose reductions to manage adverse events. In order to generate additional safet y and efficacy data at a lower dose while providing participant s a chance of deriving clinical benefit, the dose of 2.5 mg/kg has been selected for testing in an additional arm in this study . The two-arm design with two dose levels and a futility anal ysis is justified for this population because there is no approved comparator for the proposed treatment setting. Objectives and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Primary Objective To evaluate the cli nical efficacy of 2 doses of GSK2857916 in participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma .ORR, defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed partial response (PR) or better (i.e., PR, very good partial response [VGPR], complete respon se [CR] and stringent complete response [sCR]), according to the 2016 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Response Criteria by Independent Review Committee (IRC).

Number of Participants: The sample size calculation was performed using East 6.4 software as a starting point, based on the ORR comp arison between the GSK2857916 arm and the historical control. Based on the simulation results with the planned sample size of 65 participant s there is 86.90% power to reject the null hy pothesis within each arm with a 1-sided type I error of 1.23%. Approxi mately 170 participants were initially planned to be screened to enroll a minimum of 155 participants at approximately 60 investigational sites globally . A minimum of 130 participants (65/arm) were planned to be enrolled to 2 arms receiving frozen liquid solution of GSK2857916, which includes ~30 participants from the ocular sub-study . Approximately 200 participants will be enrolled onto the frozen liquid portion of the study . Approximately , twent y-fiveadditional participants will be enrolled into the independent lyophilized drug product cohort. Treatment Groups and Duration: In this two-arm randomized study , GSK2857916 will be administered at 2 dose levels (2.5mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg) to participants by IVinfusion onthe Q3W schedule at the study site. The dose will be based on actual body weight calculated at baseline and may be reduced to address toxicities according to protocol guidelines . GSK2857916 will be administered on Day 1 of each cy cle. Premedication is not required unless deemed medically nec essary by the investigator, in which case it should be administered according to institutional recommendations. If an infusion -related reaction (IRR) occurs during administration, the infusion rate may be reduced or halted at the discretion of the investi gator depending on the severity of the s ymptoms.

32,page_32,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 333. INTRODUCTION Multipl e my eloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy and accounts for 1% of all cancers and for 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Worldwide, approximately 103,000 new cases are diagnosed annually , and an estimated 30,330 new cases and 12 ,650 deaths will occur in the U Sin 2016 [Siegel , 2016] . There have been significant advances in treatment for MM, including novel therapies like second and third -generation proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory drugs ( IMiD s), and recent addition of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Those advances have contributed to incremental gains in PFS and OS, but most MM patients still relapse and ultimately develop resistance to existing therapies. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop treatments with novel MOA which could potentially prevent the cross resistance to existing therapies [Kumar , 2004] . Details of the characteristics of GSK2857916, nonclinical, and clinical activity are provided in the Investigator’ s Brochure (IB) [GSK285 7916GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N175128_04 ]. 3.1. Stud y Rationale Before the introduction of daratumumab, patients with disease that is refractory to both immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhib itors (PI s) had a median overall survival (OS) ranging from 9 months [Kumar , 2012] to 12 months [Kumar , 2004; Kumar , 2003] . Daratumumab [DARZALEX , 2017] , isa human IgG k monoclonal antibody that was granted accelerated approval as monotherap y for the treatment of RRMM in the US in November 2015 [Afifi , 2016] on the basis of the results from aPhase II monotherap y study (n=106) which reported 29.2% ORR and mPFS 3.7 months in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple my eloma. The median number of prior lines of treatment reported in this study was 5. Later, daratumumab has bee n approved in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, bortezomib/dexamethasone for patients who were previously treated with at least one prior line, and in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for patients previously treated with at least 2 prior lines [DARZALEX , 2017; Janssen -Cilag International NV , 2016] . While the data with daratumumab indicate that further prolongation of PFS can been achieved, it is also increasingl y recognized that patients continue to relapse after treatment with daratumumab, and will need additional treatment options to control the disease. Patients with MM who relapse after daratumumab therap y, have few treatment options available and could benefit from treatment with a novel drug s uch as GSK2857916. GSK2857916 is a first in class, ADCC enhanced, humanized im munoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody -drug conjugate (ADC) that binds specifically to B -cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a target present on mature B cells and on tumor cells in patie nts with MM [Tai, 2015; Tai, 2006 ]. The antibody is conjugated to the microtubule inhibitor monomethy l auristatin -F (MMAF), and is produced as an afucosy lated form that generates an enhanced antibod y-dependent cellu lar cy totoxicity (ADCC) response . As demonstrated"
33,page_33,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 34in the FTIH stud y this novel mechanism of action can be reasonably expected to overcome cross resistance to existing therapies. GSK2857916 has shown strong single -agent activity in the currentl y ongoing F TIH study BMA11715 9. Among the 35 participants receiving GSK2857916 at the RP2D of 3.4 mg/kg IV, Q3W, the following results were observed : Overall response rate (ORR) of 60% (95% CI: 42.1%, 76.1%) Median progression -free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months ( 95% CI : 3.1, - months). The ORR in 14 participants who failed prior daratumumab treatment was 43% (95% CI: 17.7%, 71.1%), and the PFS in this subgroup was 6.8mo. Overall, GSK2857916 was well tolerated and adverse events were manageable. This data su pports further development of GSK2857916 as monotherap y in patients who failed an anti -CD38 antibody and are refractory to PIand IMiD . 3.2. Background –BCMA and Multiple M yeloma B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA also referred to as TNFRSF17 or CD269) is a membe r of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and regulates a variety of cellular functions. BCMA is expressed in mature B ly mphocy tes and binds to two TNF family ligands BAFF (B -cell-activating factor belonging to the TNF family ) and APRIL (aproliferation -inducing ligand) which promotes B -cell survival and proliferation. Mice deficient for BCMA are viable, have normal B -cell development, and exhibit normal humoral responses [Belnoue , 2008; Varfolomeev , 2004; Jiang , 2011] . BCMA is expressed on malignant plasma cells in all MM patients [Tai, 2015; Tai, 2006] . The restricted exp ression profile of BCMA in normal tissue, combined with its up -regulation and recognized survival function in MM [Tai, 2006; Sanchez , 2012; Novak , 2004] makes BCMA an attra ctive target for a therapeutic antibody with direct cell killing activity and with minimal off target effects [Tai, 2015] . BCMA has been validated as a therapeutic target in MM [Tai, 2015] . The BMA117159 study was the first time in human (FTIH) study demonstrating single -agent activity of GSK2857916 in heav ily pre-treated MM participants . Chimeric Antigen Receptor T -Cells (CAR -T) based therapies targeting BCMA have also demonstra ted powerful activit y against MM, with substantial albeit reversible risks [Cohen , 2016] . Other approaches utilizing bispecific antibodies (BiTe) have also entered development, but clinical results have not been rep orted at the time of writing this protocol. 3.3. Antibody -Drug Conjugate GSK2857916 GSK2857916 is a first in class, ADCC -enhanced, humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that binds specifically to B -cell maturation antigen (BCMA), a target restricted to B cells at later stages of differentiation and expressed on tumor cells of all patients with MM [Tai, 2015; Tai, 2006] . The antibody moiety of GSK2857916 is produced as an afuc osylated form that generates an enhanced antibod y-"
34,page_34,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 35dependent cellular cy totoxicity (ADCC) response upon binding to Fc RIIIa receptors on the surface of human immune effector cells . The antibody is conjugated to the microtubule inhibitor monomethy l auristat in-F (MMAF). Upon binding to the cell surface, GSK2857916 is rapidly internalized and the active drug (cys-mcMMAF) is released inside the cell. The cy s-mcMMAF moiet y disrupts microtubule networks, leading to cell cy cle arrest and apoptosis (ADC mechanis m) [Alley , 2009; Pettit , 1998] . This dual mechanism of action of GSK2857916 (ADCC and microtubule disruption) enables anti -tumor activity on both dividing and non -dividing cells. In addition, when MM cell lines expressing BCMA are exposed to GSK2857916, it may act as an inducer of immunogenic cell death (I CD) [Kroemer , 2013; Krysko, 2012] , repr esenting a potential third mechanism of action . Exposure of dendritic cells to tumor cells undergoing ICD induces an antigen -specific T -cell response, and if it acts similarly in humans could induce the patient’s own immune response against the MM tumor. Expression of the target of GSK2857916 (BCMA) is restricted to B cells at later stages of differentiation . The target is also present on tumor cells of all patients with MM [Tai, 2015; Tai, 2006 ]. 3.4. Human Experience with GSK2857916 GSK2857916 is currently being evaluated in a First Time in Human (FTIH) trial in participants with RRMM ( Study BMA117159 on Q3W schedule via IV administration). As of data cut off from 26 June 2017 a total of 73 participa nts with RRMM have been treated with at least one dose of GSK2857916. The Part 1 dose -escalation phase enrolled 38 participants at doses ranging from 0.03 mg/kg IV up to 4.6 mg/kg IV. The Part 2 dose expansion phase has enrolled 35 participants with MM at 3.4 mg/kg IV, Q3W. In the Part 2 population, 57% of all participants (20/35) had 5 or more prior treatment lines. The most frequently -reported AEs ( ≥15.0%) in the All Treated Population included: vision blurred (37%), nausea (36%), fatigue (33%), anemia (29%), dry eye (29%), thrombocy topenia (26%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (25%), chills (23%), platelet count decreased (23%) p yrexia (22%), cough (18%), photophobia (16%), back pain (15%), headache (15%), and upper respiratory tract infectio n (15%). Among the participants in Part 2 (N=35), the most frequentl y reported AEs included: vision blurred (46%), platelet count decreased (37%), dry eye (34%), anemia (29%), aspartate aminotransferase increased (29%), cough (26%), chills (23%), nausea (23%), photophobia (23%), p yrexia (2 3%), fatigue (20%), thrombocy topenia (20%), back pain (17%), and diarrhea (17%). A total of 14 (40%) participant s in Part2 had an SAE. There were no fatal SAEs, and 5 participant s (14%) had SAEs considered related, as follows: Infusion -related reaction (IRR): Two participant s experienced serious, Grade 3 infusion -related reactions (preferred term) during Cy cle 1 that were characterized by tachycardia, h ypertension and pyrexia."
35,page_35,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 36Intracranial hemorrhage: A participant with a history of intracranial bleeding experienced a Grade 2 intracranial hemorrhage with concomitant Grade 4, thrombocy topenia after Cy cle 1 . At the same time, the participant ’s disease was starting to progress; the participant was taken off study and sa lvage chemotherap y was started. Pericardial effusion: A Grade 4 pericardial effusion consistent with tamponade was found prior to Cy cle9 during a routine study echocardiogram in an as ymptomatic participant who had a concurrent upper respiratory tract infe ction. The fluid was evacuated, and the effusion was resolving at the time of data cut -off. The participant received three more cy cles of treatment after this event. This SAE is listed as “not resolved” at the time of data cut, however a subsequent echo cardiogram has confirmed no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Lung infection and P yrexia: A participant experienced a Grade 2 lung infection resulting in a dose delay at Cy cle 1 . Approximately three months later, the participant developed a Grade 2 fe ver resulting in hospitalization. The fever resolved the same day ; the participant was not neutropenic. This participant remains on study treatment. In the Part 2 population, 57% of all participants (20/35) had 5 or more prior treatment lines. Overall, GSK2857916 has a manageable safety profile with thrombocy topenia and/or platelet count decreased and corneal events as the most commonly reported events, as described in the following subsections. 3.4.1. Thrombocytopenia A total of 36 participant s (49%) in the All treated population, and 20 participant s (57%) in Part 2 have experienced thrombocy topenia/platelet count decreased . GSK2857916 may cause transient worsening of thrombocy topenia in some participant s, but in most cases these events are resolved during between -dosing intervals. In the Part 2 MM population, two serious bleeding events were reported: intracranial hemorrhage in a participant with a history of an intracranial bleeding in the setting of disease progression, and hematuria in a participant with a large bladder mass in the setting of progressive disease. 3.4.2. Corneal Events Corneal AEs have been observed with various ADC drugs and represent the most commonly reported t ypes of AEs associated with GSK2857916. As there is no single term which approp riatel y captures these events, the term ‘corneal events’ includes reported preferred terms (from E ye Disorders System Organ Class )describing events associated with the corneal events related to GSK2857916. The FT IH study (BMA117159) utilized the NCI -CTCA E scale Version 4.03 for all AEs. The most commonly reported corneal events include dvision blurred, dry eye, photophobia, and lacrimation increased. A total of 42 participant s (58%) in the all treated population, and 22 participant s (63%) in Part 2 have experienced corneal events which were predominantly low-grade. I n Part 2, there were three participant s with ≥ Grade 3 corneal events: one with Grade 3 keratitis resulting in a delay and a dose reduction, one with Grade 3 ey e pain resulting in a delay ; and one Grade 3 dry eye resulting in a dose delay ."
36,page_36,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 37In Part 2, there were no serious corneal events and n o participant s permanently discontinued study treatment due to a corneal event. I n Part 1, there was one SAE of Grade 3 limbal stem cell deficiency (in a participant at the 1.92 mg/kg dose) that was characterized b y blurred vision and dry ey es. The event s resolved after treatment was discontinued, and the participant ’s vision returned to baseline. Another participant in Part 1 (4.6 mg/kg) discontinued treatment due to the feeling of a foreign object in the ey e (Grade 2). The mean time to onset of cornea l AEs was 28 day s after first dose for Part 2 MM; most participant s developed events within 42 day s of first dose though 20% of those who reported these events developed them after Day 43. In addition to the AEs describing corneal events, 89% of participan ts in Part 2 had corneal findings upon examination. These findings were generally characterized by a superficial punctate keratopathy /keratitis which was often associated with epithelial (microcy stic) edema and occasional stromal edema or opacities . Visu al acuity declined during treatment in most participant s experiencing these clinical findings, but improved on average to near baseline in participant s completing end of stud y treatment visits (n=13). Eleven of these 13 participant s (84.6%) had corneal cl inical signs at the end of study treatment visit, with most cases (9/11 or 81.8%) considered as having “mild” changes. 3.4.3. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of GSK2857916 (antibody -drug conjugate), the parent antibody , total antibody (including the complex ), and cy s-mcMMAF were investigated in 70participant s after IV administration at doses of 0.03 to 4.60 mg/kg in a preliminary analysis. Maximum concentrations of GSK2857916, parent antibody , and total antibody were observed at end of infusion ( EOI), wher eas maximum cy s-mcMMAF concentrations peaked approximately 24 hours after dosing. There was limited accumulation of GSK2857916 or cy s-mcMMAF during subsequent cy cles. The pharmacokinetics of GSK2857916 were linear over the range of doses tested, with expo sure of all anal ytes increasing proportionately with increasing dose, and were well - described in a preliminary population PK anal ysis using conventional allometry . Total plasma clearance of GSK2857916 was 0.37 L /day, and the mean steady -state volume of distribution was 4.2 L. The model -predicted terminal phase elimination half -life of GSK2857916 was 8.2 days (95% CI : 6.4 to 10. 1),in keeping with the log -linear model estimate (8.7 day s). On a molar basis, the levels of cy s-mcMMAF were <1% of GSK2857916, and the half -life of free cy s-mcMMAF was <2 hours. 3.4.4. Clinical A ctivity Preliminary clinical data from the ongoin g BMA117159 study as of 26 June 2017 (n=35 participants treated at 3.4 mg/kg) has demonstrated an ORR of 60% [95% CI : 42.1%, 76.1%], (complete res ponse: 6%, very good partial response [VGPR] 43%, partial response [PR] 9%), with 51% of participant s (N = 18/35) having deep responses of VGPR or better, in heavily pretreated participants with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM ). The median dura tion of response (D oR) has not been achieved, the 25th percentile for DoR is 6.7 months; t he median PFS in this population was 7.9 months [95% CI : 3.1, NA]. Although no responses were observed at the 2.5 mg/kg dose in Stud y"
37,page_37,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 38BMA117159 (0 in 8 participants) , one response was noted at each of the lower doses of 0.96 mg/kg (1 in 3 participants) and 1.92 mg/kg, and (1 in 4 participants). In addition, estimated receptor binding saturation was seen at doses 1.92 mg/kg. 3.5. Benefit / Risk A ssessment 3.5.1. Risk A ssessment Additional information about the known and expected benefits and risks, detailed information of nonclinical and clinical findings information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other pertinent information on GSK2857916 t hat may impact participant eligibility is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure [ GSK2857916 (IB) GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N175128_04 ]. Table 5 Risk A ssessment and Mitigation Strategy Potent ial Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Product (GSK2857916) Corneal events Reversible corneal events have been observed with various ADC s (specific corneal changes with ADCs conjugated to MMAF). Cornea -related AEs such as blurred vision, dry/watery eyes, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia are among the most common AEs associated with GSK2857916 in the clinic. The majority of events have been non -serious and transient, some requiring dose delays/ reductions. Time to recovery is variable, and in some instances the resolution may take several weeks.Active monitoring for corneal events according to the Schedule of Activities (Table 1). Preventi ve use of steroid eye drops as outlined in Table 21in Appendix 9. Timely eval uation and management by an ophthalmologist (an optometrist if an ophthalmologist is not availa ble)upon developing corneal related events. Recommendations for dose delays /reductions are provided in Section 9.4.8 and Appendix 9. Infusion related reactionWithout p re-medication, the majority of IRRs observed in the clinic to date have been G1 - 2 and non -serious; however, there have also been serious IRRs. Overall, participants who experienced an IRR during the initial infusion were pre -medicated prior to subsequent infusions and IRRs did not recur.Participants will be closely monitored for signs of IRR. Premedication prior to first infusion of GSK2857916 is not mandatory but may be considered based on investigator judgment. If an infusion -related reaction occurs du ring GSK2857916 administration, the infusion rate may be reduced or halted depending on the severity of the symptoms . The participant will receive appropriate medical treatment . When the participant’s condition is stable, the infusion may be restarted . Upon restart, the infusion rate must be half of the infusion rate at the time the infusion was paused. Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenic events of all grades (1 -4) are among the most common AEs A hematologic panel is assessed frequently. Supportive therapy (including"

Neutropenia Non-serious and serious neutropenia has been observed in the clinic with GSK2857916. A hematologic panel is assessed frequently. Supportive therapy (growth factors, antibiotics, and treatment of active infections) is provided according to standard medical practice , and dose reductions or treatment discontinuations are outlined in Section 7.2. Potential for cardiotoxicity related to an inflammatory responsePreclinical inflammatory findings were seen in the rat mandibula r and mesenteric lymph nodes, brachial/sciatic nerves, epididymi des, lung, thymus, and atrial epicardium . In the monkey, microscopic effects in spleen and bone marrow at ≥3 mg/kg/week were reflective of a systemic inflammatory response . Electrocardiogram s (ECG) were monitored in monkeys for up to 24 hours following repeat dosing and did not produce any evidence of test -article induced electrocardiographic waveform abnormalities, arrhythmias or QTc changes . Serum cardiac troponin I was also measured in the rat and monkey 3 -week studies and no treatment -related effects were observed . This potential risk was based on described preclinical findings, however to date there is no evidence of systemic inflammatory response or cardiotoxicity in the clinic. Monitoring of ECG. Treatment as medically indicated. Monitoring of other cardiac parameters as clinically indicated. Laboratory abnormalitiesReport of non -serious, asymptomatic elevations in LDH / CK levels have been observed in the clinic.Monitoring of LDH and CK levels will be performed. Hepatotoxicity Non-clinical safety experiments demonstrated increased liver weight and elevated liver enzymes in rats . Elevations in liver enzymes, and increased mitotic figures in Kupffer cells were observed in monke ys. All of these changes were dose dependent and reversible. Non-serious elevations in ALT, AST have been observed in the clinic.Only participants with well -preserved liver function per the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be allowed on study . Partici pants with Hepatitis B (HBV) and C will be excluded from the trial. Liver function tests will be monitored in all participants on study and in case of liver abnormalities management will be implemented according to clinical practice . Participants that me et liver stopping criteria (Section 8.2.1 )will be withdrawn from the study. Nephrotoxicity Non-clinical safety experiments have demonstrated primary glomerular injury and tubular degeneration (in rat and monke y). The morphologic changes were accompanied by large molecular proteinuria (albuminuria) . The renal changes were dose dependent and reversible . During the study, participants will be monitored for kidney function by assessing creatinine, epidermal grow th factor receptor ( eGFR ), electrolytes, and albumin / creatinine ratios (spot urine) . Participants will be educated about the need of maintaining adequate urinary output . Management will be implemented according to clinical practice . Dose"

To date no pneumonitis has been observed in t he clinic.Monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms potentially related to pulmonary toxicity. Further diagnostic tests and management will be implemented immediately according to recommendations provided in Section 7.2.2 . Immunosuppression In nonclinical studies GSK2857916 has been associated with decrease in immunoglobulins in monkeys. An increase in immunoglobulins was seen in rats (rats are not an antigen specific species for GSK2857916).Participants wi ll be monitored for infections . Participants will receive immediate treatment according to standard practice. Potential for overdose specific to the preparation of study drugA frozen liquid configuration of GSK2857916 will be used to initiate thistrial.An independent cohort of approximately 25 additional participants will be enrolled and administered a lyophilized configuration of compound (upon availability) . A separate set of preparation instructions will need to be followed in order to prevent pot ential overdose. Proactive communication and training will be provided to the sites ahead and at the time that the lyophilized configuration is introduced at the site . There is no specific antidote for overdose with GSK2857916 . In the event of a suspect ed overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical care should be instituted, as dictated by the participant ’s clinical status. Risks from Study Procedures Bone marrow aspiration/biopsyPain, infection, bleeding may occur after the procedureParticipants will be treated according to institution’s practice Incidental findings during imaging data acquisition:During the acquisition of imaging data (e.g.., MRI, CT, PET, ECHO), non -MM disease or drug related clinical abnormalities could be found by the radiographer or echocardiographer performing the exams.All imaging scans will be reported to the site by an appropriate imaging clinician (non-anonymized ) for non -MM Disease or drug related clinical abnormalities. TCR = T -cell receptor; m Ab = Monoclonal antibody; AEs = Adverse Events 3.5.2. Benefit A ssessment The study population enrolled in this study has a high unmet medical need. Participants failing multiple lines of prior treatments do not have many therapeutic options left, and if respons e can be achieved with currentl y available drugs, it is usually of short duration. This study is being performed to study efficacy and safet y data in participants who have been previousl y treated with multiple agents, including PI, IMiD ,andan anti -CD38 antibody . Data from single -agent study BMA117159 support further evaluation of participants with MM failing currentl y available treatments."
40,page_40,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 413.5.3. Overall Benefit -Risk Conclusions In the ongoing FTIH study , GSK2857916 has shown strong single -agent activity with an ORR of 60% (95% CI: 42.1%, 76.1%) among the 35 participants in Part 2 who received GSK2857916 at 3.4 mg/kg IV, Q3W . The ORR in the14 participants who failed prior daratumumab treatment was 43% (95% CI: 17.7%, 71.1%), and the PFS in this subgroup was 7.8months. Although maximum clinical benefit was observed at the 3.4 mg/kg dose level, frequent dose delay s and dose reductions were required to manage AEs including thrombocy topenia/platelet cou nt decreased and corneal events. Togenerate additional s afety and efficacy data at a lower dose while providing participant s a chance of deriving clinical benefit, two dose levels (2.5 mg/kg Q3W and 3.4 mg/kg Q3W) will be evaluated in stud y 205678. Considering the potential benefit to participants as well as the measures being taken to minimi ze risk, further development of GSK2857916 as monotherap y in participant s who failed an anti -CD38 antibody and are refractory to PI and IMiD is warra nted.Based on the recognized unmet medical need and limited treatment op tions available for this population , this Phase II stud y has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of GSK2857916 . 4.

STUDY DESIGN 5.1. Overall Design This is a Phase II, open -label, two-arm, randomized, multicenter stud y to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of GSK2857916 monotherap y at the dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg IV, Q3W, in pa rticipants with RRMM. Participants will be treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and will be followed for PFS and OS .An ocular sub-study will evaluate the effectiveness of steroid ey e drops in approximately 30 participants (~15 on ea ch dose arm) who sign an optional I CF. The study will use frozen solution of GSK2857916 for those participants enrolled into 2 dose arms . The design includes an independent cohort of approximately 25 participants who will receive a l yophilized configurat ion of GSK2857916 .Those participants will follow the same assessments and procedures as the main study and will be anal yzed separately from participants randomized to the frozen solution. Thelyophilized cohort will be initiated when the lyophilized co nfiguration becomes available .Itwill evaluate the 3.4 mg/kg dose level , unless the results of the IA indicate that it should not be continued. In that case, the l yophilized cohort will have a dose of 2.5 mg/kg. The study consists of a screening/baseline period, a treatment period, and a post - treatment follow -up period ( schematic is display ed in Figure 1)"

44,page_44,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 45Participants eligible for screening will be assigned a unique Participant Number by their investigational site . Upon completion of all the required screening assessments, eligible participant s will be registered into the Registration and Medication Ordering S ystem (RAMOS), GSK’s Interactive Response Technology (IRT) sy stem, by the investigator or authorized site staff. Following randomization, e ligible participants will begin C ycle 1 treatment in the assigned treatment arm . Assessments will be performed as illustrated in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 2). Selected investigative sites will participate in the ocular sub-study and will conduct additional ocular examinations on approximately 30participants who sign an additional consent to receive monocular treatment with corticosteroid ey e drops . In this specific subgroup ,the ophthalmic examinations will occur pre -dose every 3 weeks and onDay 10 after a treatment dose for the first 4 cy cles.Additional treatments and examinations will be at the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist (an optometrist if an ophthalmologist is not available) . See the SOA for the s cheduling (Section 2). Additional details of the individual assessments are provided in Section 9. An interim anal ysis (IA) for futility is planned for ORR based on investigator’s assessment after approximately 25participants per arm are evaluable for response (defined as having received at least 2doses of study treatment and hav ingcompleted at least 1disease assessment after the second dose, or progressed or died or discontinu ed treatment due to reasons other than PD ). AttheIA, given that 25 participants are evaluable for each arm, treatment arm/s will be dropped from the stud y if there are ≤4 responses. If both arms have 5 or more responses at IA, i n addition to the futili ty rule described above, the posterior probability of observing a better RR in one arm th an the other will be calculated .If such a probability is at least 97.5%,then the treatment arm with lower RR will be dropped due to lack of efficacy . The IA to as sess futility will be performed by an Independent Data Monit oring Committee ( IDMC) . Additional details of the IA are provided in Secti on 10.5.9 and will be provided in an IDMC Charter .At the time of the IA, additional partic ipants will continue to be enrolled, treated, and fo llowed as described in the SO A (Section 2). Efficacy and safet y results from the interim anal ysis will not be shared with investigat ors or other site/ study person nel. If one a rm is selected based on the results of the IA, enrollment to the futile arm will be stopped and ongoing participants from the futile arm will have the possibility upon additional consent to either continue at their current dose level or to have their dose adjusted to the dose in the selected arm based on the following rules : If the 2.5 mg/kg dose is discontinued ,participants have the option to switch to 3.4mg/kg dose if they : Did not experience an SAE, or a≥ Grade 3 non-corneal AE Provide informed consen t for the 3.4 mg/kg dose ."
45,page_45,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 46If the 3.4 mg/kg dose is discontinued, participants who are currently treated at this dose will have the option to switch to 2.5 mg/kg : In cases when the participant has not achieved a maximum benefit of CR or sCR, did not exper ience toxicity requiring a dose reduction ,and is willing to continue at the higher dose level, the participant will have the option to stay on their original dose upon signing an additional informed consent informing them that a lower dose level has been selected for the remaining participants. The final analy sis of the primary endpoint (ORR) will be performed 6 months after the last participant is randomiz ed. The study will continue and participant s will remain on treatment and continue to be followed. For participants who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than PD, disease evaluations will continue to be performed at 3-week intervals until confirmed PD, death, start of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or end of the study whichever occurs first . After PD is documented, participants will be followed for survival and subsequent anticancer therap y ever y 3 months until study ends. Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected from all participants . The collection of PK samples fo r determination of GSK2857916 plasma (ADC and total antibody) and cy s- mcMMAF concentrations will allow characterization of the PK profile and support investigation of its pharmacology . Genetic testing (in consenting participant s) and biomarker research sam ples will also be conducted on samples from all participants prior to the first dose. Patient -Reported Outcomes (PRO) data will be collected at each clinic visit. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Therefore, adherence to the study design re quirements, including those specified in the S OA(Table 1to Table 4) is essential. Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompany ing Study Reference Manual (SRM). The SRM will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not affect participant safet y. 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 170 participants were in itially planned to be screened to enroll a minimum of 155 participants at approximately 60investigational sites globally . A minimum of 130 participants (65/arm) were planned to be enrolled to 2arms receiving frozen liquid solution of GSK2857916 which in cludes ~30 participants from the ocular sub-study .Approximately 200 participants will be enrolled in the frozen liquid portion of the study . Approximately twenty -fiveadditional participants will be enrolled into the independent l yophilized drug product cohort."

Participant and Study Completion A participant will be considered to have completed the study if he or she has received at least one dose of the study treatment and, has died or is still in follow -up when the study is closed , and has not withdrawn c onsent from study participation. The study will end when 60% of the participants have died ,ORwithdrawn consent ,OR are lost to follow -up,AND all participant s with corneal events have been followed for up to 12 months after last dose of treatment . At th is time, end of study anal yses will be performed. If a participant remains on treatment at the time end of study is achieved ,they may be offered an option to extend treatment on another protocol . A participant will be considered to have withdrawn from th e study if: (a)the participant has not died and is lost to follow -up, (b) the participant has withdrawn consent, (c) the participant is no longer being followed at the investigator’s discretion, or (d)the study is terminated prematurel y. Documentatio n of the cause of death in the electronic Case Report Form (e CRF )is required for all participants who die in the study regardless of the cause of death. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Patients with RRMM who have relapse dafter prior treatment with an anti -CD38 antibody and are refractory to a PI and an IMiD represent a population of unmet medical need, for whom there is no approved treatment option. Given the clinical activity demonstrated in the BMA117159 stud y, treatment with GSK2857916 may offer a benefit to this patient population. It is also expected that due to its unique mechanism of action ,GSK2857916 may be able to overcome the resistance to previously used drugs in the MM population. GSK2857916 is the first -in-class ADC targeting BCMA. Preliminary clinical data for GSK2857916 monotherapy from Study BMA117159 among 35 participants indicate an ORR of 60% [95% CI : 42.1%, 76.1%], with 51% of participant s (n=18) having deep responses of VGPR or better. The median DoR has not been achieved, the 25thpercentile for DoR is 6.7 months; the median PFS in this population was 7.9 months [95% CI : 3.1, NA]. Of note, the ORR for participant s previously treated with daratumumab (n=14) was 43% (95% CI:17.7, -71.1). Fifty nine percent of the treated p opulation had 5 of more prior treatments. The response rate observed in this population is higher than response rates observed in similarly defined patient populations treated with other recentl y approved drugs (ORR ranging from 23.7% to 33.1% for Carfil zomib, pomalidomide and daratumumab) [Siegel , 2012; Usmani , 2016; Kumar , 2008] . Given the evide nce of clinical activity and manageable safety /tolerability profile demonstrated to date, the current evidence supports further development."
47,page_47,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 48The two -arm design with two dose levels and a futility anal ysis is justified for this population because there is no approved comparator for the proposed treatment setting. In Stud y BMA117159 , the maximum clinical benefit (ORR) was observed at the 3.4 mg/kg dose level , but a significant number of participant s required dose delay s and dose reductions. At lower dose levels, t he results were variable ,with w ide confidence intervals. In order to generate additional safet y and efficacy data at a lower dose while providing participant s a chance of deriving clinical benefit, the dose of 2.5 mg/kg has been selected for additional testing ( see Section 5.5for dose justification ). This design is appropriate for the selected patient population, since there is no approved standard of care in patients failing daratumumab. As shown in earlier studies on a similar population ,the response rate is low and the mPFS is short in those patients. For example , in the p omalidomide +dexamethasone (PomDex) vs p omalidomide (Pom) study that enrolled patients with median of 5 prior lines, among whom 61% have been refractory to the mainstay of treatmen t,lenalidomide and bortezomib had an ORR of 18%, and mPFS of 2.7months on Pom monotherap y arm [ Richardson ,2013]. A s imilar Phase 3 study of Pom with low dose dexamethasone (Pom/loDex) vs high dose dexamethasone (HiDex) has demo nstrated an ORR of 3.9%, mPFS of 1.8 months, and mOS of 8 mo nths in the HiDex arm where patients had a median of 5 prior lines, and 74% of them were double refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib [Weisel ,2013] . Further, a randomiz ed, phase III study which compared carfilzomib monotherapy against low-dose corticosteroids and optional cy clophosphamide in relapsed and refractory multiple my eloma has demonstrated an ORR of 11%, and OS of 10 months in population spreviously treated with 5 lines of therapy and 63% of patients were double refractory to bortezomib and IM iD[Hájek ,2017 ]. In summary , these examples provide indirect evidence that the prognosis of patients eligible for this protocol is poor, and that selected threshold for claimin g success (33%) is appropriate since it doubles the expected ORR for those patients when treated with available agents. 5.5. Dose Justification GSK2857916 is currently being studied in the Phase I FTIH study , BMA117159. As of the cli nical cut -off date of 26 June 2017, a total of 73 participants with RRMM have received at least 1 dose of GSK2857916. Participants in Study BMA117159 were enrolled into the dose -escalation phase of the study (Part 1) at the following dose levels : 0.03 mg/k g (n=1), 0.06 mg/kg (n=1), 0.12 mg/kg (n=4), 0.24 mg/kg (n=4), 0.48 mg/kg (n=4), 0.96 mg/kg (n=3), 1.92 mg/kg (n=4), 2.50 mg/kg (n=8), 3.40 mg/kg (n=3), and 4.60 mg/kg (n=6). Based on the data from Part 1 of the study , 35 participants were treated in the Dose Expansion portion (Part 2) at 3.4 mg/kg Q3W. Clinical activity in Study BMA117159 Clinical activity at the tested dose levels in Part 1 is summarized in Table 7. There were no dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs )observed during dose escalation; however, there was limited tolerability of the 4.6 mg/kg dose (prolonged fever, headache, severe fatigue)."

The median progression -free survi val (mPFS) was 7.9 months (95% CI : 3.1, NA). The ORR was 43% (95% CI:17.7, 71.1) in the 14 participant s who had received prior daratumumab. Clinical safety and tolerability in Study BMA117159 In general, GSK2857916 has been well tolerated; the most frequ ent AEs were corneal events and thrombocy topenia/platelet count decrease , which were manageable following protocol -defined dose modification guidelines. Most participants in Study BMA117159 experienced dose reduction and/or dose delay s; all events were gr aded using CTCAE Version 4.03 . In the All Treated population (n=73), 35 participants (48%) had AEs that led to dose reduction. The most common AEs (frequency ≥5%) that led to dose reductions were vision blurred (18%), thrombocy topenia (8%), dry eye (5%), and keratitis (5%). In the Part 2 group ( n=35), 23 participants ( 66. %) had AEs that led to dose reduction. The most common AEs (frequency ≥5%) that led to dose reductions were vision blurred (31%), thrombocy topenia (11%), keratitis (9%), photophobia (6% ), platelet count decreased (6%), and infusion -related reactions (6%). Dose delay s due to AEs were experienced b y 38participants (5 2%) in the All Treated population. The most common AEs ( ≥5%) leading to dose delay s were vision blurred (22%), thrombocy topenia (8%), dry eye (7%), and keratitis (5%). Dose delay s due to AEs were experienced by 25 participants (71%) in Part 2. The most common AEs (frequency ≥5%) leading to dose delay s were vision blurred (34%), thrombocy topenia (11%), dry eye (9%), keratit is (9%), lung infections (6%), and photophobia (6%). Rationale for evaluating 2.5 mg/kg in addition to 3.4 mg/kg in the current study A substantial number of participant s treated at 3.4 mg/kg dose required a dose delay and/or dose reduction due to an AE. Responders in the 3.4 mg/kg dose group in Part 2 maintained their responses with dose reductions and delay s. Based on the available data, evaluation of a lower dose level in addition to the 3.4 mg/kg dose is being done to ensure that the appropriate dos e of GSK2857916 has been selected for monotherapy treatment ."
49,page_49,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 50Although no responses were observed at the 2.5 mg/kg dose in Study BMA117159, one response was noted at each of the lower doses of 0.96 mg/kg (1 in 3 participants) and 1.92 mg/kg, and (1 in 4 participants). In addition, estimated receptor binding saturation was seen at doses 1.92 mg/kg. The next highest dose level to 3.4 mg/kg is 2.5 mg/kg, a dose reduction of ~25%. The preliminary population pharmacokinetic anal ysis estimated that the bet ween -participant variability in GSK2857916 clearance was ~50%, and the variabilit y in Cmax values was ~20%; therefore, some overlap in exposure is expected between the two dose levels. Despite this pharmacokinetic overlap, the Bayesian logistic regression modeling based on the full clinical dataset (see below) indicated that a dose level of 2.5 mg/kg had a lower predicted response rate as well as a lower predicted rate of Grade 2 corneal event . The next lower dose level, 1.92 mg/kg, had a much lower pred icted response rate andwas not considered suitable for further exploration. Therefore, 2.5 mg/kg was selected as the second dose level for evaluation in this study .Theinterim analy siswill help to minimize exposure to a potentially less effective dose level . Bayesian logistic regression model of dose -response for ORR and corneal event rate To further explore the dose selection, Bay esian logistic regression model (BL RM) was used to determine the dose -response relationships for both ORR and ≥Grade 2 corneal event rate (as determined by NCI CTCAE grading ) separatel y using all 73 participants with RRMM in Study BMA117159 (Figure 2). Table 8display s the predicted response rate and predicted Grade 2 corneal event rate at dose levels of 3.4, 2.5, and 1.92 mg/kg . The model show edthat the posterior probability of observing an ORR ≥30% is 100 % in the 3.4 mg/kg dose group , 83% in the 2.5 mg/kg dose group, and 29% in the 1.92 mg/kg dose group. Similarly , the posterior probability of observing ≥Grade 2 corneal event rate isalso high er in the 3.4 mg/kg dose group.

Should this global change in infusion rate be required, it will be commun icated to the sites in writing . 7.1. GSK2857916 Treatments A dministered GSK2857916 is to be administered at a calculated dose of 2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg as an IV infusion, via an infusion pump. Administration of GSK2857916 will be documented in the clinic sour ce documents and reported in the electronic case report form (eCRF). The time of start and end of infusion will be documented in eCRF. GSK2857916 will be administered on Day 1 of each cy cle. Premedication is not required prior to infusion unless deemed m edically necessary by the investigator, in which case it should be administered according to institutional recommendations. Any participant experiencing an IRR must receive appropriate medical treatment. When the participant’s condition is stable, the in fusion may be restarted at a slower rate. For details on restarting the GSK2857916 infusion after interruption for IRR, please see Table 11. In general, upon restarting, the infusion rate must be decreased b y half at the time the infusion was interrupted. Participants will be treated until disease progression, until unacceptable toxicity , or until confirmed CR (Section 8)."

Dosing delay s are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or for logistical reasons not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery , unrelated medical events, participant vacation, and/or holiday s, but not for participants’ decision to delay treatment ). Ifa dose is delay ed, the partici pant should wait for the next scheduled dose to resume treatment. In individual cases where in the judgement of an investigator waiting afull cy cle to resume treatment after delay (skipping dose) related to toxicity which has resolved would be detrimental to patient’s health -the PI should contact Medical Monitor to discuss an earli er re-start. An earlier re -start may be considered only for patients who have recovered from toxicity to at least G1 or less . The dosing with GSK2857916 cannot"

Corneal Supportive Care Guidelines Corneal events, which commonly manifests as a superficial microcy stic keratopathy , has been observed with antibody drug conjugates, including those conjugated to MMAF. Further information regarding corneal event associated with GSK2857916, including a GSK corneal event scale and prophy lactic mea sures are in Appendix 9. Sites are required to establish a close collaboration with an ophthalmologist (or optometrist, if an ophthalmologist is not available) who will be responsible for assessing participants and managing those who develop a corneal event in close communication with GSK Medical Monitor and possibly a GSK ophthalmologist. Participants will be assessed by ophthalmologists (or optometrist, if an ophthalmologist is not available )at baseline and every three weeks. If there are nocorneal events at time of the Cy cle 4 exam, participants may have their ophthalmologic exams decreased to once every 3 months. If a participant subsequently develops ocular s ymptoms, the participant should be evaluated b y an ophthalmologist (or optometrist, if an ophthalmologist is not available ). Intraocular pressure must be monitored if steroid ey e drops are used continuously for more than 7 day s. Participants who have corneal signs per the GSK Scale for corneal events present at end of stud y will continue to be followed at 3 and 6 weeks after the EoT visit and then every 6 weeks for up to 12 months, or until full resolution of ophthalmic changes, or deemed clinically stable b y an ophthalmologist/optometrist, whichever comes first. At the sel ected sites, participants in the ocular sub -study will undergo additional ophthalmic exams (see Section 9.2.10 ). 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment The Sponsor will supply a range of unique numbers to each site and participants eligible for enrolment will be assigned a unique Participant Number by the site. Before the stud y is initiated, log -in directions for the central Interactive Response Technology (IRT) s ystem will be provided to each site to be used to for stud y drug supply . Participant numbers are unique will not be reassigned to another participant if a participant assigned a number is found to be a Screen Failure. Participant s will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule. Participant s will be identified by a unique participant number that will remain consistent for the duration of the study . Upon completion of all the required screening assessments, eligible participant s will be registered into the Registration and Medicat ion Ordering S ystem (RAMOS), the GSK"
62,page_62,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 63Interactive Response Technology (IRT , by the investigator or authorized site staff. RAMOS allows study sites to register and randomize participant s, and also records stratification information. The following information for stratification must be entered into the sy stem to obtain the treatment assignment: number of prior lines of therap y (≤4 vs >4) ; cytogenetic risk categories (high risk defined as t(4;14 ), t(14;16), and 17p 13del vs non-high risk -all others) ; Randomiza tion will be done centrally using a randomization schedule generated b y the GSK Clinical Statistics Department, which will assign participant s in a 1:1 ratio to: Arm 1: 3.4 mg/kg IV Q3W Arm 2: 2.5 mg/kg IV Q3W Once a randomization number has been assigne d it must not be re -assigned even in cases of errors. In the lyophilized cohort participants will be assigned the 3.4 mg/kg dose level, unless the results of the IA indicate that it should not be continued. In that case, the 2.5 mg/kg dose level will be as signed to participants. RAMOS Study Specific User Guide and Clinical Support Helpdesk contact information will be provided to the study site in the SRM. 7.4. Blinding This will be an open -label ,2-armmonotherap y study with an additional independent cohort enr olled after l yophilized product is available . Therefore, sponsor will have access to the participant level data throughout the study . However, there will be no intention to summarize and interpret data from the ongoing stud y at an y time point except the pre-defined anal yses. In the o cular sub-study of participants (Section 9.2.10 andAppendix 9), the treating ophthalmologist will remain blinded as to which eye receive sthe proph ylactic corticosteroid treatment. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and reso lved before use of the study treatment. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment . All study treatments must be stored"

Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant’s medical condition . Refer to Section 9and the SOA (Table 3) for follow -up assessments of participants who are to be followed for disease progression and survival after they permanently discontinue from study treatment. 8. DISCONT INUA TION CRITERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants will receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or death (including but not restricted to meeting stopping criteria for significant toxicity as outlined in Sec tion 8.1). Study treatment may be permanentl y discontinued for an y of the following reasons: disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . participant has met an y of the protocol defined safety stopping crit eria (Section 7.2). deviation(s) from the protocol request of the participant or prox y (withdrawal of consent b y participant or proxy) investigator’s discretion concurrent illness that prevents further administr ation of study treatment(s) pregnancy participant is lost to follow -up study is closed or terminated The primary reason study treatment was permanently discontinued must be documented in the participant’s medical records and electronic case report form ( eCRF) If the participant voluntarily discontinues from treatment due to toxicity , AE (adverse event) must be recorded as the primary reason for permanentl y discontinuation on the eCRF. Once a participant has permanently discontinued from study treatment , the participant will not be allowed to re -enter the stud y. All participants who discontinue from study treatment for any reason other than confirmed progression or death will complete safety assessments, and will be followed up for PFS, OS, and subsequen t anti -cancer therap y after stud y as specified in the SO A (Table 1)."
66,page_66,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 67PFS Follow -up: All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment in the absence of disease progression will remain in the study and w ill be followed for progression according to the protocol schedule until : New anti -cancer therapy is initiated Progression is documented, or Death occurs OS Follow -up: All participants who permanently discontinue study treatment will be followed for survival and new anti -cancer therap yuntil the end of study as described in Section 5.3. Withdrawal from Study Treatment : A participant may withdraw from study treatment at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of an y samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 8.2. Safet y Stopping Criteria 8.2.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event. The diagram below illustrates L iver Stoppi ng Event Algorithm (Figure 3)"
67,page_67,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 68Figure 3 Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria –Liver Stopping Event A lgorithm The details on follow up procedures are outlined in Appendix 7 . 8.2.2. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge If participant meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge participant with study treatment unless: GSK Medical Governance approval is granted (as described below), Ethics and/or I RB appro val is obtained, if required, and Separate consent for treatment restart/rechallenge is signed b y the participant If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart/rechallenge participant with study treatment is not granted, then participant must permanently discontinue study treatment and may continue in the study for protocol -specified follow up assessments. 8.2.3. QTc Interval Stopping Criteria If a participant that meets the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration criteria below, study treatment(s) will be withheld. QT interval corrected for heart rate b y Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT / RR0.33) >530 msec OR"
68,page_68,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 69Increase of QTcF b y ≥60 msec from baseline Based on average QTcF value of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) to include manual over -read. For example, if an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 additional ECGs over a brief period (e.g., within approximately 10 minutes of the abnormal ECG, if possible, and approximately 10 minutes apart from each other), and then use the averaged QTc values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the participants should have study treatment(s) withheld. The QTc shoul d be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. The QT interval should be corrected for heart rate by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). 8.2.4. Left Ventricular Ejection Fracti on (LVEF) Stopping Criteria Echocardiograph y must be performed at Screening. If an ECHO is done at any point during the stud y, the following stopping criteria are to be emplo yed. Participants who have an asy mptomatic absolute decrease of >10% in L VEF and the ejection fraction is below the institution’s lower limit of normal (LLN) should temporaril y discontinue study treatment and have a repeat evaluation of LVEF within 1 week. Echocardiogram (ECHO) should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for 4 weeks or unt il LVEF recovery to above institutional LLN and within 10% of baseline. If the LVEF recovers (defined as institutional LLN and absolute decrease 10% compared with baseline) at an y time during the next 4 weeks, after consultation with and approval from the GSK medical monitor , the participant may be restarted on GSK2857916 at a reduced dose . For such participants, monitoring of LVEF will be performed 2 and 4 weeks after re -challenge, then every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks. If repeat LVEF does not re cover within 4 weeks, treatment must be permanently discontinued. Ejection fraction must be monitored every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks or until resolution (whichever occurs first). Participants with Grade 3 or 4 (s ymptomatic) left ventricular s ystolic dysfunction must interrupt treatment with GSK2857916. Ejection fraction must be monitored every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks or until resolution. If recovery occurs (LVEF  institutional LLN and s ymptom resolution) within 4 weeks, then treatment wit h GSK2857916 may be restarted at a reduced dose in consultation with the medical monitor. 8.2.5. Corneal Event Stopping Criteria All GSK2857916 dose modifications and stopping criteria are to be based on the GSK Scale for GSK2857916 Corneal Events ( Appendix 9). Corneal events willbe graded according to both CTCAE criteria for ey e disorders (see Section 9.2)and the guidelines provided in Appendix 9. The treating physician or ophthalmologist (or optometrist, if an ophthalmologist is not available) must discuss the p articipants who develop a Grade 4 corneal event according to the GSK scale with the GSK Medical Monitor ora GSK ophthalmologist to determine whether the participant can be allowed to restart treatment"
69,page_69,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 70with GSK2857916 or whether GSK2857916 should be permanently discontinued. The decision will be documented in study files, together with individual assessment of risk - benefit. For detai ls on re -start guidance (Table 13). 8.2.6. Infusion -Related Reaction Management and Stopping Criteria Premedication is not required prior to infusion unless deemed medically appropriate by the investigator following evalu ation of infusion related reactions . Premedication should be considered in an y participant who experienced an infusion related reaction at first or any subsequent infusion with GSK2857916. IRRs should be managed by guidelines provided in Table 11. A participant that experiences a Grade 4 IRR should be permanentl y withdrawn from the study. 8.2.7. Allergic and A naphylactic Reaction Stopping Criteria All participants will be monitored carefull y for evidence of allergic response . A particip ant that exhibits signs or s ymptoms of severe h ypersensitivity or anaphy laxis will receive appropriate medical treatment and be permanently withdrawn from the study treatment . 8.3. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain a nd continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SO A for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.4. Lost to Follow Up The following actions must be taken in relation to a participant who fails to attend the clinic for a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site must counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to continue or if the investigator believes that the participant should continue in the study ."
70,page_70,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 71In cases where the participant is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain conta ct with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow -up.” 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES A signed, written informed consent form must be obtaine d from the participant prior to any study -specific procedures or assessments being performed. The timing of each assessment is listed in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 1). A list of clinical laboratory tests is display ed in Table 14. Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments must occur in the following order: 12 -lead ECG, vital signs , blood draws.

Adverse events will be graded b y the investigator according to the NCI -CTCAE, (version 4.03).Corneal events associated with GSK2857916 will also be graded according to the GSK corneal event scale provide in Appendix 9. Dose modifications as a result ofcorneal events will be based on the GSK scale for corneal events ( Table 22). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until 45days following discontinuation of study treatment regardless of initiation of a new cancer therap y or transfer to hospice at th etime points specified in the SO A (Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3). However, any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., stud y treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a participant consent sto participate in the study up to and including an y follow -up. All AEs will be collected from the start o f treatment until 45days following discontinuation of study treatment regardless of initiation of a new cancer therap y or transfer to hospice at the time points specified in the SO A. Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but a fter obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs o r SAEs in former study participants . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she"
76,page_76,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 77considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or s tudy participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of clinical interest, will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.4). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for S AEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponso r has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to loc al regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor wi ll review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported."
77,page_77,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 78For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRFs are presented as queries i n response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information must be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Disease progression does not need to be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE). Death due to disease under study is to be recorded on the Death electronic case report form (eCRF). However, if the underl ying disease (i .e., progression) is grea ter than that which would normally be expected for the participant, or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment with study treatment(s) or protocol design or procedures and the disease progression, then this must be reported as a SAE. 9.2.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for GSK2857916 are corneal events, thrombocy topenia and infusion related reactions. The severit y of allAESI will be graded utilizing the National Cancer I nstitute -Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events. Severity of corneal events will also be graded using the GSK scale for corneal events provided in Table 22. Guidelines for dose modifications and interruptions for managemen t of common toxicities associated with the study treatment(s) are provided in Table 11. Dose modifications for GSK2857916 corneal events will be based on the GSK scale for corneal events in Table 22. 9.2.8. Pregnancy Do not collect pregnancy information for female participants known to be pregnant during the screening phase or before exposure to study . The need for a screening pregnancy test depends on whether a female participant is of childbear ing potential or non -childbearing potential. If a female participant is of childbearing potential, she must have a serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin ( β –HCG )pregnancy test performed within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study treatment. Participants with positive pregnancy test result must be excluded from the study . Participants with negative pregnancy test resul t must agree to use an effective contraception method as described below during the study until 80 day s following the last dose of study treatment. Details of all pregnancies in female participants and female partners of male participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until approximately 80 day s. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigat or must inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and must follow the procedures outlined inAppendix 5."

Ocular Examinations and Procedures A full baseline ophthalmic exam ination for all participant s must include , but is not limited to : 1.Best corrected visual acuity 2.Documentation of manifest refraction used to obtain best corrected visual acuity 3.Current glasses prescription (if applicable) 4.Pupillary exam 5.Extraocular muscle movements (graded from one to four with (+) si gn indicating over action, ( -) sign indicating under action and 0 representing normal movements 6.Tear film examination: Schirmer’s test with anesthesia and tear breakup time 7.Intraocular pressure measurement & time checked 8.Full anterior segment examination including fluorescein staining of the cornea : 9.Anterior segment exam (slit lamp) includes: orbit/lids/adnexa, conjunctiva, sclera, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens and anterior vitreous 10.Anterior segment photograph y of a fluorescein stained cornea 11.Dilate d funduscopic exam : fundus photograph y with interpretation . 12.Pachy metry The on treatment andfollow -up ophthalmic exam must include every thing except : dilated funduscopic exam /, including fundus photograph y, anterior segment photograph y,extraocular musc le movements, (which must be performed as clinically indicated) and current glasses prescription (if applicable). The last follow -up ophthalmic visit should also include anterior segment photography of a fluorescein stained cornea. Representative images wi ll be collected and stored centrall y. The end of study treatment visit ophthalmic exam should match the baseline (screening) exam. Additional examinations should be performed at the discretion of the treating ey e specialist. 9.2.10. Ocular Sub-Study Exam ination s Refer to Table 4for the schedule of assessments for ocular sub-study of participants Although ocular corticosteroids have been used in both published studies (Tannir , 2014; Moskowitz , 2015; Thompson , 2015; Reardon , 201 6; Macsai , 2016) and BMA117159 to ameliorate the frequency and severit y of M MAF -associated corneal events, this has y et to"
79,page_79,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 80be investigated s ystematically . Furthermore, the effect of MMAF -conjugated ADCs on the ey e has not been fully delineated in studies to date. Therefore , Study 205678 will include a sub-study of approximately 30 participants (~15 participant s each dose) to evaluate the effect of ophthalmic topical corticosteroids on GSK2857916 -associated corneal findings and to further characterize these findings. This sub-study of participants will be recruited at selected investigational sites associated with ophthalmologists with subspecialty training/expertise in the cornea . These participants will undergo additional ophthalmic examination sduring the first 4 cy cles of treatment at a minimum or as clinically indicated as d etermined by the treating ophthalmologist . A separate informed consent (in addition to the main study ICF) will be obtained from these participants. 9.2.10.1. Monocu lar prophy laxis Figure 4summarizes the prophy laxis admini stration schedule in the ocular sub-study of participants. The treating ophthalmologist, but not the participant, will be blinded as to which ey e has received the proph ylactic steroid treatment. Randomization will be done within each treatment arm centrall y using a randomization schedule, which will assign participant s in a 1:1 ratio to: receive topical corticosteroids in right ey e onl y receive topical corticosteroids in left ey e onl y. The p articipants of the sub-study will administer prophy lactic cortico steroid ey e drops (prednisolone acetate 1%,prednisolone phosphate 1%, dexamethasone 0.1%, or equivalent, 1 drop four times daily starting one day prior to dosing for a total of 7 day s). They will be instructed to administer the steroid drops in only one ey e. Corticosteroid treated eye Participant should administer 1 drop of topical corticosteroid followed b y1 drop of preservative -free artificial tears 5-10 minutes later, four times daily . This should start one day prior to dosing for a total of 7 day s. Other Eye Participants should administer 1 drop of preservative -free artificial tears followed by another 1 drop of preservative -free artificial tears 5 -10 minutes later, 4-8 times daily . This should start one day prior to dosing for a total of 7 day s. Outside the 7 -day prophy laxis period, preservative -free artificial tears should be administered in each eye at least 4 -8 times daily as needed (See Appendix 9, Section 12.9)."

Monocular treatment If a participant in the ocular sub-study develops a corneal event outside the 7 -day prophy laxis period, steroid ey e drops may be restarted in only one ey e at the discretion of the treating ophthalmologis t. If steroid treatment is started in only one ey erefer to Table 13and treat the contralateral ey e with an equal number of preservative -free artificial tears. Alternativel y, the treating ophthalmologist may start topical cortic osteroid treatment in both ey es at any time if clinically indicated and beneficial to the participant (Table 13). If such decision is made at an ytime between treatment cy cles 1 to 4,the participant will receive further proph ylaxis and treatment as an y other participant on the study according to Section 9.2.9 but will continue to undergo additional imaging as described below . The treating ophthalmologist may unblind themselves at an y time if they beli eve it to be in the best interest of the participant .This may be done by asking the clinical site staff. After C ycle 4, monocular steroid treatment will be performed at the discretion of the treating ophthalmologist 9.2.10.3. Sub-Study Exams Participants will be a ssessed by the treating ophthalmologist at baseline, every 3 weeks or prior to each dose, and on Day 10 of C ycles 1, 2, 3, and 4.After Cycle 4, the Day 10 exam may be omitted. In addition to the full ophthalmic exam (Section 9.2.9 ), the participants at these selected sites will undergo the following additional studies during screening (baseline) , at the first"

Confocal microscop y(if available at the site) 4. Lissamine green staining Given that these evaluations a re exploratory , the treating ophthalmologist has the discretion to perform them more frequently as they believe appropriate for the optimal care of the individual participant. Representative images will be collected and stored centrall y. 9.3. Treatment of Ov erdose There is no specific antidote for an overdose of GSK2857916. GSK does not recommend a specific treatment for an overdose of GSK2857916. In the event of an overdose of GSK2857916, the investigator must: contact the GSK Medical Monitor immediately monitor the participant closely for AEs/ SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until GSK2857916 can no longer be detected s ystemically (at least 3 months) . 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SO A (Table 1). 9.4.1. Physical Examinations At screening, on dosing day s, and at end of study treatment visit a full phy sical examination will include assessments of the head, ey es, ears, nose, throat, skin, thy roid, lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen (liver and spleen), ly mph nodes, and extremities. Height (once at screening onl y) and weight must also be measured and recorded. 9.4.2. ECOG Performance Status Participant performance status will be assessed at Screening, every 3 weeks starting at Week 4and End of Treatment using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale, provided in Appendix 8. 9.4.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements must include sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate. Vital signs must be measured after resting for at least 5 minutes. Vital signs must be measured more frequently if warranted by the clinical condition of the"
82,page_82,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 83participant. On day s where vital signs are measured multiple times, temperature does not need to be repeate d unless clinically indicated. 9.4.3.1. First Infusion Monitoring intervals : Vital signs must be monitored at designated time points related to drug infusion as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). In general, participa nts must also be monitored for at least 1 hour after the completion of the first infusion and may be discharged if considered clinically stable and all other study procedures have been completed. 9.4.3.2. Subsequent Infusions Monitoring intervals : Vital signs mus t be monitored at designated time points related to drug infusion as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2).Participants may be discharged after the infusion has been completed if considered clinicall y stable and all other study procedures have been completed. 9.4.4. Electrocardiogram 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECGs) must be obtained in triplicate at designated time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). The ECG machin e must automatically calculate the heart rate and measure PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT (QTc) intervals. At each assessment, a 12 -lead ECG must be performed by qualified personnel at the site after the participant has at least a 10-minute rest. At each time point at which triplicate ECG sare required, 3 individual ECG tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, but no more than 2 minutes apart. The full set of triplicate ECG s should be completed in 4 minutes or less . The QT interval must be corrected for heart rate by Fridericia’s formula (QTcF). Refer to Section 8.3for QTc withdrawal criteria. Refer to the SRM for details regarding ECG procedures. 9.4.5. Echocardiogram Echocardiograms (ECHOs) must be performed at baseline to assess cardiac ejection fraction for the purpose of study eligibility , as specified in the SO A. The evaluation of the echocardiographer must include an evaluation for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). If an ECHO is performed on study the results must be documented in the e - CRF. 9.4.6. Laboratory Assessments All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 14,must be performed according to the SO A(Section 2). Details for the preparation and shipment of samples for central laboratory assessments will be provided in the SRM. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant ch anges occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF . The"
83,page_83,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 84laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judg ed by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values that are significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 45days after the last dose of stud y treatment must be repe ated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology must be identified and the sponsor notified. Hematology , clinical chemistry , urinal ysis,and ad ditional parameters to be tested are listed, with detailed instructions and timing, in the SRM . 9.4.7. Patient -Reported Outcome Version of the Common Term Criteria for A dverse Events (PRO -CTCA E) The Patient -Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE) is a patient -reported outcome measure developed to evaluate s ymptomatic toxicity in patients on cancer clinical trials [Basch , 2014] . The PRO -CTCAE was designed to be used as a co mpanion to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), the standard lexicon for adverse event reporting in cancer trials. The PRO -CTCAE includes an item library of 124 items representing 78 symptomatic toxicities drawn from the CTCAE. PRO -CTCAE provides a sy stematic y et flexible tool for descriptive reporting of s ymptomatic treatment side effects in cancer clinical trials. In the present study , a sub-study of items selected from the PRO -CTCAE Version 1.0 Item library will be administered. The PRO -CTCAE will be administered to participants in different regions based on the availability of translated versions. 9.4.8. Visual Function Questionnaires The impact of potential ocular toxicity on function and health -related quality -of-life will be assess ed with the use of two visual function questionnaires, the NEI -VFQ -25 and OSDI . All participants will use the Self -Administered version of the questionnaires, unless their vision prevents them from being able to complete the questionnaire on their own. P articipants who are not able to complete the questionnaire on their own and require assistance must use an Interviewer Administered format. If the Interviewer Administered format is being used, it must be read to the participants verbatim, and participant responses must be recorded directly without any interpretation. For any additional assessments conducted via telephone (either during participation in the treatment period or during Follow -up), the Interviewer Administered format must be used. The NEI-VFQ-25 and OSDI will be administered to participants in different regions based on the availability of translated versions."
84,page_84,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 859.4.8.1. National Ey e Institute Visual Function Questionnaire -25 The NEI -VFQ -25 consists of a base set of 25 vision -targeted questions represe nting 11 vision -related constructs, plus an additional single -item general health rating question [Orr, 2011; Kirwan , 2012; Mangione , 2001] . These include a global vision rating (1 item); difficulty with near vision activities (3 items); difficulty with distance vision activities (3 items); limitations in social functioning due to vision (2 items); role limitations due to vision (2 item s); dependency on others due to vision (3 items); mental health sy mptoms due to vision (4 items); driving difficulties (3 items); limitations with peripheral vision (1 item), limitations with color vision (1 item); and Ocular pain (2 items). I n addition t o the core items from the NEI -VFS-25, select questions from the Appendix of Optional Additional Questions will also be administered to further assess the impact of ocular toxicity on visual function. 9.4.8.2. The Ocular Surface Disease Index The Ocular Surface Dise ase Index (OSDI) is a 12 -item questionnaire designed to assesses both the frequency of dry ey e symptoms and their impact on vision -related functioning [Schiffman ,2000; Dougherty , 2011] . The OSDI has demonstrated good reliability , validity , sensitivity , and specificit y, and can be used as a complement to other clinical and subjective measures of dry eye disease b y providing a quantifiable assessment of dry eye symptom f requency and the impact of these sy mptoms on vision -related functioning. 9.5. Pharmacokinetics 9.5.1. Blood Sample Collection for Pharmacokinetics Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis of GSK2857916 (ADC and total antibody ) and cy s-mcMMAF will be collected a t the time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities table (Section 2).Each PK sample must be collected as close as possible to the planned time relative to the dose (which is 0 h) administered to the participant on PK d ays.The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Details on PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping proce dures are provided in the SRM. 9.5.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample A nalysis Plasma analy sis will be performed under the control of GSK Platform Technology and Sciences (PTS) -Bioanal ysis I mmunogenicit y and Biomarkers (BIB) group, the details of which will be included in the SRM. Concentrations of GSK2857916 (ADC and total antibody ) and cy s-mcMMAF will be determine d in plasma samples using the currently approved bioanaly tical methodology .Raw data will be archived at the bioanaly tical site (detailed in the SRM). Once the plasma has been analyzedfor GSK2857916 (ADC and total antibody ) and cy s- mcMMAF, an y remaining plasma may be analy zedfor other compound -related metabolites and the results reported under a separate GSK PTS -BIB protocol."

Immunogenicity Immunogenicit y sample anal ysis will be performed under control of GSK PTS BIB group, the details of which will be included in the SRM. Serum samples for determination of anti -GSK2857916 antibodies will be taken from all participants in this study at the time-points specified in the SO A. Details of sample preparation, storage, and anal ysis will be provided in the SRM . Samples will be analy zed for the presence of anti -GSK2857916 antibodies by a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay . First, all samples will be tested in a screening assay to identify potentially positive samples. Next, samples that screen posi tive will be further characterized for specificit y in a confirmation assay, and, finall y, for samples that test positive in the confirmation assay , the antibody titer values will be determined. For each participant , immunogenicity results, including the i ncidence and titers, will be reported . Raw data will be archived at the bioanaly tical site (detailed in the SRM). 9.7. Translational Research See Section 9.9. 9.8. Genetics Participation in this part of the study is opti onal and all enrolled participants will be given the opportunity to contribute samples. Participation may be declined without effect on medical care during the clinical study . Separate consent signature is required for participation in genetic research. Information regarding genetic research is included in Appendix 6. In approving the clinical protocol, the IEC/I RB and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency , are also approving the genetic research described in Appendix 6unless otherwise indicated. Where required b y regulatory authorities, approval of the genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . In that case, written approval will indicate that approval of the genetic assessments is being deferred and the study , except for genetic assessments, can be initiated. If genetic assessments are not approved, they will not be conducted. 9.9. Tumor Biomarker Analy sis 9.9.1. sBCMA Sample A nalysis The BCMA receptor undergoes gamm a-secretase mediated cleavage, leading to release of the BCMA extracellular domain as soluble BCMA (sBCMA) into the circulation [Laurent , 2015] . Samples will be collected to measure concentrations of sBCMA at the time point s specified in the SO A using a validated assay . Details of sample preparation, storage, and analysis will be provided in the SRM."
86,page_86,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 87Serum anal ysis for sBCMA will be performed under control of GSK PTS -BIB group, the details of which will be include d in the SRM. Raw data will be archived at the bioanaly tical site (detailed in the SRM) . 9.9.2. Potential Tumor Related Biomarkers While BCMA expression is present in multiple my eloma, there is some variability in its expression, as well as its membranous/cy tosolic expression pattern. Therefore, it is important to determine if there is an y association between the expression levels of BCMA on multiple my eloma cells and clinical responses. Additionally , any blood, serum, and bone marrow samples collected during t his study may be used to measure novel biomarkers to identify factors associated with the biological and clinical responses to GSK2857916. If relevant, this approach may be extended to include the identification of biomarkers associated with AEs. Unless stated otherwise, these investigations may be performed irrespective of whether a response to GSK2857916 is observed. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SO A. The sample collection strategy may be adjusted on the basis of emergin g data from this study or other studies involving GSK2857916 in order to ensure optimal evaluation of an y potential biomarkers. Additionally, novel biomarkers may also be incorporated, as data warrants. These analy ses may include but not be limited to: Bone marrow BCMA expression by IHC performed on bone marrow aspirate Measurements of the serum levels of soluble BCMA (sBCMA) Soluble factors, incl uding circulating plasma cell-free DNA ( cfDNA ). 9.10. Evaluation of A nti-Cancer Activity Response willbe assessed according to the IMWG criteria , [Kumar , 2016 ] by the Investigator and b y an IRC. Standard disease assessments for MM will include serum and urine laboratory tests, bone marrow biops y at the time of CR (IHC), and MRD testing at the ti me of VGPR, CR,and baseline. Evaluation will follow the guidance of International M yeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple My eloma 2016 . Clinical efficacy measured as Overall Response Rate (ORR), which is defined as the percent age of participants with confirmed stringent complete response (sCR), complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR) as assessed b y 2016 recommendation of the IMWG Panel I [Kumar ,2016] . Other eff icacy measures of interest (see Section 9.1) The percentage of participants achieving MRD negativit y. Disease assessment will include laboratory testing and phy sical examination (as indicated for palpable/super ficial lesions), or imaging CT, MRI , PET CT , or X -ray(as indicated)."
87,page_87,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 88Laboratory -based disease assessments will be completed within 21 day s prior to the first dose of GSK2857916 then testing will be performed every 3 weeks from Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1 ). The imaging will be performed up to 30 day s prior to the first dose and will be repeated as indicated in the SO A table . See the SO A for the Schedule of Activities of anti-cancer activity . Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule and must not be affected by dose interruptions/delay s. MRD negativity rate (defined as the percentage of participants who are MRD negative by clonoSEQ). Testing will be performed at: Screen for all participants; and at the time of achieving VGPR or CR. The testing wil l be repeated 6 months and 12 months after achieving VGPR or CR. 9.11. Health -Related Quality -of-Life Three Health -Related Quality -of-Life (HRQoL) assessments will be performed in this study . More details about all patient questionnaires can be found in the SR M. The following assessments will be administered to participants in different regions based on the availability of translated versions. 9.11.1. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 -item Core module (EORTC Q LQ- C30) The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a 30 -item questionnaire containing both single -and multi -item measures [ Aaronson ,1993] . These include five functional scales (Ph ysical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social Functi oning), three s ymptom scales (Fatigue, Pain, and Nausea/Vomiting), a Global Health Status/QoL scale, and six single items (Constipation, Diarrhea, Insomnia, Dy spnea, Appetite Loss, and Financial Difficulties) . Scores for each scale and single -item measure are averaged and transformed linearl y to a score ranging from 0 –100. A high score for functional scales and for Global Health Status/QoL represent better functioning abilit y or HRQoL, whereas a high score for s ymptom scales and single items represents si gnificant s ymptomatology [Proskorovsky ,2014]. 9.11.2. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 20 -item Multiple My eloma module (EORTC QLQ -MY20) The EORTC QLQ -MY20 is a supplement to the QLQ -C30 instrument used in patients with multiple my eloma [ Aaronson ,1993; Cocks ,2007] . The module comprises 20 questions that address four my eloma -speci fic HRQoL domains: Disease Sy mptoms, Side Effects of Treatment, Future Perspective, and Body Image . Three of the four QLQ - MY20 domains are multi -item scales: Disease Symptoms (includes bone aches or pain, back pain, hip pain, arm or shoulder pain, chest p ain, and pain increasing with activity ); Side Effects of Treatment (includes drowsiness, thirst, feeling ill, dry mouth, hair loss, upset by hair loss, tingling hands or feet, restlessness/agitation, acid indigestion/heartburn, and burning or sore ey es); a nd Future Perspective (includes worry"

The Bod y Image scale is a single -item scale that addresses phy sical attractiveness . As with the QLQ -C30, QLQ - MY20 domain scores are averaged and tran sformed linearly to a score ranging from 0 – 100. A high score for Disease S ymptoms and Side Effects of Treatment represents a high level of s ymptomatology or problems, whereas a high score for Future Perspective and Body Image represents better outcomes [ Proskorovsky ,2014]. 9.11.3. Qualitative Telephone Interview s(Patient Interviews) To further evaluate disease and treatment related symptoms and associated impacts on function and health -related quality of life, parti cipants will participate in qualitative interviews conducted via telephone. The interview will be conducted b y a trained interviewer in the participant ’s native language and will be audio recorded for transcription and analy sis. The p atient interview (PRO ) should be conducted via telephone within 21 (7 day s)days following Day 1 of the fourth treatment cy cle (C4D1) . The PRO interview should also be conducted within 21 days (7 day s)of the participants end of treatment visit , unless the participant has al ready completed their interview following C4D1 within the prior 30 days. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypothesis Testing This is a two-armstudy . The primary objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of BCMA over historical control with respect t o ORR for participants with RRMM for each of the two dose levels (frozen liquid solution) studied . The study is designed to provide evidence with respect to ORR to either support the null hypothesis, H0: ORR ≤15%, or reject H0in favor of the al ternative h ypothesis, H1:ORR ≥33%. The hy pothesis testing will be performed within each arm separately . No hy pothesis testing for comparing ORR between the two arms will be performed. All randomized participants will be included in the final anal ysis to test the hy potheses of interest regardless of length of follow -up or whether or not they receive the treatment or whether or not they have a post -baseline assessment (i.e., participants will not be replaced). An interim anal ysis (IA) will be conducted after approxima tely 25randomized participants per arm are evaluable ( i.e., received at least two doses of stud y treatment and have completed at least one disease assessment after the second dose, or progressed or died or discontinued treatment due to reasons other than PD). The Final anal ysis will be performed based on a data cutoff 6 months after the last participant (in the frozen liquid solution) israndomiz ed in the study to allow sufficient data maturity of all efficacy endpoints. Time from first-subject -first vis it (FSFV )to primary ORR anal ysis will be approximately 12months . The timeline is subject to change based on the actual enrollment rate."

Sample Size Determination The sample size calculation was initially performed using East 6.4 software as a starting point ,based on the ORR comparison between the GSK2857916 arm and the historical control in order to choose a final refined study design . The following assumptions were made in the estimation of the required sample size: Normal approximation of binomial proportion A response rate of ≥33% in the BCMA arm and ≤15% for the historical control A 1.25%, one -sided risk of erroneously claiming superiority of the BCMA arm, in the presence of no true underly ing improvement A ~90% chance of rejecting the null h ypothesis when t he alternative hy pothesis is true An IA after approximately 38% of information is available (i.e., approximately after 25 particip ants out of originally planned 65 participants per arm are evaluable for IA) , with a futility rule base d on a gamma spending f unction. The operating characteristics were refined using simulation to account for both within arm futility rule and the comparative futility rule. Based on the simulation results with the originall y planned sample size of 65 participant sper arm ,there i s 86.90% power to reject the null hy pothesis within each arm with a 1-sided type I error of 1.23%. Due to over enrollment, it is estimated that approximately 200 participants (~100 per arm) will be randomized to the frozen liquid solution. At the Final ana lysis, the null hypothesis will be rejected if the lower bound of 2 -sided 97.5% exact C.I. exceeds the historical control rate of 15%. With no change to planned IA (i.e., approximately after 25participants /arm are evaluable for IA , and same futility boun dary), simulation results show that there is 92.38 % power to reject the null h ypothesis within each arm with a 1-sided type I error of 0.97% for 100 participants per arm as specified in Section 10.3 and Section 10.5. The study will also include an independent cohort of approximately 25 additional participants who will receive the l yophilized configuration of GSK2857916. The s ample size for this cohort was chosen based on feasibility in order to gain clinical experience with the ly ophilized configuration . The probability of observing a > =20% RR was retrospectivel y calculated. If the true RR is 33% there is a 95% probability of observing at least a 20% RR with 25 participants .This cohort will be ana lyzed separately from participants enrolled to the frozen liquid solution formulation. 10.3. Sample Size Sensitivity Table 15shows the various power scenarios at the final ORR analy sis under different assumption of the ORR given the sample size of 65, and 100 participants per arm and stopping rules based on group sequential design as specified in Section 10.5.9.1 ."

Interim A nalyses 10.5.9.1. Futility Stopping Rule Based on Group Sequential Design For each arm (2.5 mg/kg or 3.4 mg/kg of frozen liquid solution ), one single futility IA is planned for ORR based on investigator’s assessment, after approximately 25 participants (~38% information fraction of initially planned 65 participants ) per arm are evaluable. A user-defined gamma spending function (γ=1.1)[Hwang , 1990] was used as a beta - spending function to determine the non -binding futility boundary (as implemented in East 6.4). With this β -spending function, the stopping boundary in IA is identified as 0.16 on the proportion scale (≤4 responders out of 25 participants) , which is close to the historical control of 0.15. The spending function and assoc iated boundary were chosen to ensure good operating characteristics, specificall y, the t ype 1 error and power are well controlled. A two -step approach is used to identify the futility stopping rule based on agroup sequential design under the assumption o f exact binomial distribution. First, as described in S ection 10.2, an initial design based on theassumption of normal approximation of binomial proportion is identified by East 6.4. The interim futility and f inal efficacy analy sis boundaries were then converted to number of responders needed in 25 participants who are evaluable at IA andthe65 participants initially planned at the final analy sis. With a total sample size of 100 participants per arm and an IA with approximately 25 participants per arm ,the same futility boundary (≤ 4 responders out of 25 participants) will still apply with a user-defined gamma spending function (γ=5.4). For the final analysis, the boundary for claiming efficacy is the minimum number of responders required for the lower b ound of the two -sided 97.5% C.I . to exceed 15% (i.e. 24 responders for sample size of 100 per arm)."

Additional Comparative Futility Stopping Rule Based on Bay esian Approach If both arms pass the futility boundaries based on group sequential design described above, posterior probability of observing a better RR in one arm relative to the other will be calculated .If such a prob ability is at least 97.5%, then the treatment arm with lower RR will be dropped due to lack of efficacy .This additional guidance was put in to allow for dropping an arm with substantially inferior response rates ( e.g.absolute difference > 28%) . To calcul ate the p osterior probability , a non -informative Beta prior (0.025 , 0.1) will be used for each arm. Details about calculating the posterior probabilities are provided in Appendix 1 2.

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. Note : An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e .g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgm ent of the investigator (i .e., not related to progression of underl ying disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagn osed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses must be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy willbe reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying diseas e, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the"
116,page_116,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 117participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (e .g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hos pital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if ser ious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event . It does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires inpatien t hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment tha t would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE . If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious . When in d oubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE must be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Results in persistent disabili ty/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption."
117,page_117,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 118Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or sci entific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant o r may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events must usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as: ALT 3 x ULN and total bilirubin *2 x UL N (>35% direct), or ALT 3 x ULN and INR **>1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick . If fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3 xULN and total bilirubin 2 x ULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants . If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. Refer to Appendix 7 for liver chemistry follow -up procedures. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the sp ecific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial t hromboembolism"

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medic al records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic ormild symptoms; clinical ordiagnostic observations only;intervention notindicated. Grade 2:Moderate; minimal, local ornoninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age- appropriate instrumental ADL*. Grade 3:Severe ormedically significant butnotimmediately life-threatening; hospitaliz ation orprolongation ofhospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**. Grade 4:Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 : Death related to AE. *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for grocer ies or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden."
119,page_119,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 120Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess t he relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled o ut. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administrati on will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the in vestigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the u pdated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE  The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurement s and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultati on with other health care professionals. New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information."

SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF  Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit thisinformation to the SAE coordinator. Details provided in the SRM. In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service . Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the SRM."

If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorr hea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot be confirmed before first dose of stud y intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 1 Premenarchal 2 Premenopausal females with ONE of the following: Documented h ysterectomy Documented bilateral salpingectomy Documented bilateral oophorectom y For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (e.g., mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry . Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 3 Postmenopausal fema les A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal con traception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required . Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the no n-estrogen hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment."

The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant a. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical studies. b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistent ly and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently and correctly. c. Male condoms must be used in addition to hormonal contraception. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines , acceptable contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action. Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for this study. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction) Collection of Pregnancy Information Male participants with partners who become pregnant Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female partner of a male study participant who becomes pregnant while participating in this study .

Appendix 9:GSK Corneal Event Severity Scale and Mitigation Strategy for GSK2857916 Treatment -Related Corneal Events In or der to minimize corneal events associated with GSK2857916 , participant s must receive steroid ey e drops as prophy laxis (such a s: prednisolone acetate 1%, prednisolone phosphate 1%, dexamethasone 0.1% or equivalent ) 1 drop QID starting 1 day prior to each GSK2857916 infusion, and continuing for a total of consecutive 7 days . Omission or discontinuation of prophy lactic steroid ey e drops may be allowed under certain circumstances (e.g., in the setting of intolerability , contraindication, or toxicity secondary to steroid ey e drops) upon discussion with the Medical Monitor. Prophy lactic preservative -free artificial tears should be administered in each ey e at least 4 to 8 times daily beginning on C ycle 1 Day 1 until the EOT. Allow at least 5 -10 minutes between administration of artificial tears and steroid ey e drops. In the event of ocular symptoms (e.g., dry eyes), the use of artificial tears may be increased up to every 2 hours as needed. While not y et clinically demonstra ted, it is theoretically possible that the application of a cooling ey e mask during GSK2857916 administration, and in the first few hours after infusion may subsequently decrease ocular side effects. On the day of infusion at the discretion of the partici pant and the investigator, the following may be considered: Beginning with the start of each GSK2857916 infusion, participant s may apply cooling ey e masks to their ey es for approximately 1 hour or as much as tolerated. Participant s may continue using th e cooling ey e mask bey ond the first hour for up to 4 hours. Further use beyond 4 hours is at the participant ’s discretion. Participant s must avoid the use of contact lenses during the stud y. An ophthalmology (or optometry , if ophthalmolog yis not availabl e) consult is required for all participants who develop signs or sy mptoms of corneal events or require steroid eye drops for more than 7 day s. Following discussions with regulatory agencies, GSK developed a grading scale for corneal events to capture both corneal findings and visual acuity changes in participants treated with GSK2857916. This GSK scale is different from CTCAE criteria for ey e disorders which relies mainly on patient’s s ymptoms and patient’s ability to attend to ‘activities of dail y living’ for grading of events. A summary of prophy lactic interventions for corneal events associated with GSK2857916 is provided in Table 21.In addition to reporting ey e disorders usi ng CTCAE 4.03 criteria, corneal events associated with GSK2857916 must be graded according to the guidelines provided in Table 22. Additional guidance on visual acuity changes is provided in Table 23. In the FT IH study (BMA117159 ), eye examinations showe dthat most participants continued to receive GSK2857916 dose when either a GSK Scale Grade 2 corneal examination finding or a 2-3-linedecrease in visual acuit y was reported. With this dosing"
133,page_133,"2017N330177_04 CONFIDE NTIA L 205678 134paradigm, participants generall y showed improvement in both cor neal examination findings and visual acuity over time. Therefore, the dosing guideline has been adjusted to allow dosing with GSK2857916 if only one component on the GSK corneal event scale indicates Grade 2 corneal event.

Appendix 1 2: Statistical Consideration s for Section 10.5.9.2 Additional Compara tive Futility Stopping Rule Based on Bayesian A pproach Introductio n This document provides details about the additional comparative futility stopping rule based on the Bayesian approac h at interim anal ysis (IA) for S tudy 205678. As described in Section 10.5.9.2 , theadditional comparative ru le based on theBayesian approach will be used to further facilitate the decision of earl y stopping for futility . The arm deemed inf erior to the other will be dropped. In practice, if both arms pass the futility boundaries based on group sequential design described above, posterior probability of observing a better RR in one arm relative to the other will be calculated. If such a probabilit y is at least 90%, then the treatment arm with lower RR will be dropped due to lack of efficacy . To calculate the pos terior probability , a non -informative beta prior (0.025,0.1) will be used for each arm. Statistical Modeling In the Bay esian approach, let P1denote the response rate for arm 1; m1and X1denote the number of participants and number of responders at IA for arm 1; letP2denote the response rate for arm 2; m2and X2denote the number of participants and number of responders at IA for arm 2; We assume P1and P2are independent. We assume the prior distributions of response rates and follow a beta distribution beta ( ,). The beta distribution represents the prior knowledge or belief about the efficacy of the new drug. The quantity reflects the prior mean response rate, while the quantity + reflects the amount of information contained in the prio r. The larger value of +, the stronger belief the prior has. In both simulations and actual IA, a non -informative beta prior (0.025,0.1) will be used for each arm. We assume and Consequently , the posterior distributions of the response rates P1andP2follow beta distributions: P1|x1~beta( + x1, + m1 -x1),P2|x2~beta( + x2, + m2–x2). P1|x1and P2|x2are also independent. The comparative futility stopping rules are defined as:"

If the posterior probability P (P2> P1|x1, x2)> 97.5% , then arm 1 is considered inferior to arm 2 and will stop for futility . Let 1*=+ x1, 1*=+ m1 -x1, 2*=+ x2, 2*=+ m2–x2, Following the methods of [Dmitrienko , 2006 ], the posterior probabilities P(P1> P2|x1,x2)and P(P2> P1|x1,x2)will be computed as Where and are the cumulative distribution functions of and distributions, respectively. The integral on the right -hand side of this equation was computed using the integrate function in R. Determin ation of the Cutoff for Posterior Probabilities. The cutoff for posterior probabilities was chosen as 97.5%, to allow for dropping an arm with substantially inferior response rates (e.g absolute difference > 28%) . The posterior probabilities of (Arm 1 Response Rate > Arm 2 Response Rate) for all possible scenarios of the comparative rule at I A are shown in Table 24. Table 24 Posterior Probabilities of (A rm 1 Response Rate > A rm 2 Response Rate) at Interim A nalyses Note: For both Arm 1 and Arm 2, the IA sample sizes are assumed to be 25. The green cells represent scenarios with posterior probabilities greater than 97.5%."

Scenarios of simulation studies tested are listed in Table 25. Table 25 Scenarios of Simulation Studies to Eval uate Probabilities of Stopping forFutility ScenariosResponse Rate Arm 1 Arm 2 1 33% 60% 2 33% 45% 3 33% 33% 4 33% 25% 5 33% 20% 6 33% 15% 7 33% 10% 8 15% 15% For each scenario, K=1 0,000,000 trials are simulated based on the assumed response rates (RR) for each arm (assuming number of responders for both arms follow binomial distribution). I A and final sample sizes are fixed as 25 and 65, respectively. For each simulate trial, the posterior probabilities and are compute as specified above. For each simulated trial, both futility rules will be used to determine whether the trial should stop for futility at IA or claim efficacy at final. Such probabilities will be computed based on K=10,000,000 simulated trials. The simulation results are s ummarized in Table 20in Section 10.5.9.2 . References Dmitrienko A, Wang MD.
