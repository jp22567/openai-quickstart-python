Study Measurements: The following assessments will be completed for each subject according to the Schedule of Events (see Appendix 2)."
10,page_10,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 18 July 2019 Dosing Compliance: Measures of study drug compliance will include the duration (days) of treatment (defined as last dose date – first dose date +1), the total number of applications (determined from the doses reported in the Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied. Subjects who apply at least 80% of the expected total number of applica tions and have no other evidence of material dosing non -compliance will be considered to be compliant with study drug dosing. Primary Safety: Adverse Events All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs. Untoward events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be captured in the medical history section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) unless they are related to a study-specific procedure. Optional photographs may be obtained for areas outside of the face, as clinically indicated for the classification and management of AEs. Local Skin Reactions At each visit, LSRs will be assessed. Erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, scaling/dryness, and scabbing/crusting in the treatment area will be assessed by the PI and itching and pain in the treatment area will be assessed by the subject using a 4 -point ordinal scale where 0=absent, 1=mild (slight, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense). Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding or discontinuation of the application of the study drug, or extend 2 cm beyond the treatment area will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as an AE. LSRs will also be assessed by subjects weekly during the Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up Period using a subject diary to assess redness, swelling, erosions/ulceration, scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, itching and pain by the same 4- point scale used during clinic visits. Subjects will be asked to report the greatest severity of each LSR experienced during the previous 7 days. Limited Physical Examination The limited physical examination will include examination of the face, chest, arms, and back (i.e., relevant acne regions). Abnormalities at Screening/Baseline will be recorded as medical history. Any new or worsening abnormalities at Visit 5/EOT will be recorded as AEs. Vital Signs"
11,page_11,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 18 July 2019 Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be measured at Screening/Baseline and Visit 5/EOT. Assessments will be made after the subject has rested in a seated position for at least five minutes. Complete Blood Count CBC will be assessed locally at Screening and Visit 5/EOT and must include Differential. Urine Pregnancy Test (UPT) A UPT will be performed at Screening/Baseline and Visit 5/EOT for WOCBP. Exploratory Engraftment: Engraftment Assay Follicular engraftment sampling will be completed via use of Biore® Strips applied across the bridge of the nose extending to either cheek. Skin surface engraftment sampling will be completed via cheek swab. Exploratory Efficacy: Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Overall severity of acne will be assessed using a five-point scale where 0=Clear, 1=Almost Clear, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, and 4=Severe. This is a static morphological scale that refers to a point in time and not a comparison to Baseline (see Appendix 3). Acne Lesion Counts The number of total lesions, inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules), and non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on the face (including those present on the nose) will be counted. Counts of nodules and cysts will be reported separately and are not to be included in the inflammatory or non -inflammatory lesion counts. Acne Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire At each visit, subjects will be asked to complete the Acne QoL Questionnaire to assess subjective improvement of acne (see Appendix 5). Exploratory Sebum: Sebum Production At each visit, sebum levels will be assessed for any changes from Screening, Baseline to Weeks 2, 7, and 12 at sites 02 and 03. Sebum production data will not be available for all subjects. Site 04 did not have a Sebumeter, therefore, sebum production was not assessed for any subject. Site 03 received a Sebumeter after having started enrollment of subjects. Some of the site’s subjects will not have any sebum data while others may have only partial data with the Screening values missing. Subjects without any sebum data will be excluded from the summaries and analyses. Subjects with partial"

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 18 July 2019 data will be included in the summaries for observed values where data is available, but will be excluded from summaries and analyses for absolute change and percent change from Screening. Study Endpoints: Primary Safety: • Incidence (severity and causality) of any local and systemic AEs. • Number of subjects with presence (and severity) of each LSR and each time point. • Changes from Screening/Baseline in physical examination findings at Visit 5/EOT. • Changes from Screening/Baseline in vital signs at Visit 5/EOT. Changes from Screening in local CBC at Visit 5/EOT. Exploratory Engraftment: • For skin engraftment assay, absolute and percent change from Screening to follow-ups in Cas5/PanBac and for follicular engraftment assay, the proportion of subjects with “success” at EOT where “success” is defined as a Follicular Biore® with “yes” outcome for presence of live NB01. Exploratory Efficacy: • Absolute change in IGA score from Screening at each follow up visit. Percentage of subjects with (a) at least a one-point change in IGA score and (b) percentage of subjects with at least a two - point change in IGA score from Screening at each follow -up visit. • Absolute and percent change from Screening at each follow-up visit in total, inflammatory, and non-inflammatory lesions. • Absolute and percent change from Screening to follow-up in each of the four Acne QoL domain scores . Exploratory Sebum: • Absolute and percent change from Screening to follow-up in sebum production in a subpopulation from sites 02 and 03. Sample Size Calculations: No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study given it is an initial proof of concept study. Statistical Methods: All statistical processing will be performed using SAS®. Summary tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for screening and/or baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group. In general, continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics including sample size, mean, Standard"

Categorical variables will be summarized by frequency and percentage. The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received and applied study drug. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will include all randomized subjects who were dispensed the study drug. The Per-Protocol (PP) population will include a subset of the ITT population who completed the study without significant protocol deviations (as will be determined prior to unblinding the randomization). Dosing Compliance: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize for each treatment group the duration of treatment (defined as last dose date – first dose date +1), the total number of applications (determined from the doses reported in the Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied for the ITT and PP populations. Subjects who apply at least 80% of the expected total number of applications and have no other evidence of material dosing non -compliance will be considered to be compliant with study drug dosing. Primary Safety: All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population. Extent of Exposure Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the extent of exposure in the Safety population. The total amount of study drug used by each subject will be calculated based on the number of days the study drug was applied (according to the subject’s diary entries). Physical Examinations Findings from the physical exam will be recorded in medical history (from assessment at Visit 1/Screening) or as AEs (from assessment at Visit 5/EOT). Vital Signs Descriptive statistics of vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate) will be provided by treatment group.

Background Naked Biome hypothesizes that eliminating resident disease-associated bacterial strains and replacing them with a health-associated Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) transplant may help to improve, mitigate, treat, or prevent acne flares. In a Phase I single application study of NB01 conducted by the Sponsor, all 10 subjects completed the study without any drug - related adverse events (AEs). Genotypic and phenotypic work performed by the Sponsor has identified candidate strains sourced from healthy subjects that match all our criteria for health as defined by the literature. Genotypically, the Sponsor’s candidate strain is a P. acnes ribotype 2, deoR+ (Johnson et al. 2016 ), lipase type II+ (Tomida et al. 2013) which contains a complete CRISPR system (Johnson et al. 2016 ), does not contain the pIMPLE plasmid (Kasimatis et al. 2013), and has no identifiable genomic evidence of antibiotic resistance. Phenotypically, the candidate strain produces low levels of porphyrin, comparable to other healthy associated ribotype 2’s in the literature and is sensitive to all five antibiotics tested internally (Clindamycin, Doxycycline, Erythromycin, Minocycline, Tetracycline as was measured with Etest [bioMérieux]). Additional safety assessments were performed by CHR-Hansen, Naked Biome’s GMP manufacturer, who confirmed that no genomic antibiotic resistance genes were present and that the candidate strain was sensitive to 13 out of 14 tested antibiotics, resistant only to metronidazole which P. acnes has known natural resistance to and was additionally non - hemolytic and non-cytotoxic. Outside of known association of P. acnes with acne vulgaris, below is an accrued list of rare opportunistic infections associated with P. acnes. P. acnes has been observed in other infections such as implant-associated, soft tissue, periodontal, periocular, cardiovascular system, and deep-organ tissues infections, and may also have a role in relation to pulmonary infection as the bacteria can be isolated from lungs and lymph nodes. Routes of infection are often from the subject’s own commensal flora (normal skin or oral tract) (Kwon and Suh 2016 ). The expanded multi-locus sequence typing scheme based on 7 housekeeping genes and 2 putative virulence genes developed by McDowell et al gives a good resolution and revealed strains which seem to have an increased capacity to cause infections and others that are rarer or found mainly among healthy individuals (McDowell et al. 2012, McDowell et al. 2013 ). Strain HP4G1 has a deoR repressor gene just upstream of the porphyrin operon suggesting a mechanism for reduced porphyrin synthesis and thus may not be associated with acne vulgaris. Further, the strain has a PAp60/PAmce allele combination found in non-invasive P. acnes strains and lacks 2 of 4 genes involved in iron uptake, which is of importance for growth in the human body at conditions with low iron access. Notably, regarding CAMP factors 1-4, which are expected to be involved in pathogenicity and are involved in co - hemolysin with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ), HP4G1 had a mutation in the CAMP 2"
19,page_19,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 18 July 2019 gene leading to an extension of the gene as the stop codon was interrupted. This variant has not been observed before and as CAMP factor 2 is described as having properties for co-hemolysin and exotoxin, this may lower the pathogenic potential of the strain. Moreover, the strains belong to the CC72 clonal complex which, compared to CC5, contains strains less commonly isolated from healthy humans or individuals with infections. HP4G1 was found to be a ST100-like type not previously reported and most likely has a non-functional CAMP2 gene due to a mutation in the stop codon. Therefore, HP4G1 is most likely less virulent than P. acnes in general with a low risk of causing infections. Porphyrin is a known inflammatory metabolite involved in the pathogenesis of acne. Porphyrin is produced by the P. acnes bacterium and is a photosensitizing agent. Dermatologists routinely use blue and red-light therapies to selectively target P. acnes- produced coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin IX, respectively, thereby eliminating P. acnes and improving disease. As stated above, HP4G1 has a repressor of porphyrin production, called deoR. In vivo, the HP4G1 strain produces less porphyrin than acne- associated strains that lack the deoR repressor operon. Despite that, the HP4G1 strain is a low porphyrin producer; the fact that it is applied in significant quantities (10 5 CFU/cm2) could lead to a temporary increase in porphyrin upon application. This hypothetical increase could be photosensitizing to subjects, as such, photosensitivity has been included as a theoretical side effect of HP4G1 application. The Sponsor intends to address the risk of these opportunistic infections through the selection of genotypic and phenotypic characteristics most associated with health and with the implementation of appropriate exclusion criteria to eliminate subjects that may have increased risk of a P. acnes infection. P. acnes is most specific to facial pilosebaceous region which is the natural niche for P. acnes, and therefore the best region for application to appropriate the sensitivity and therapeutic impact of a topical P. acnes transplant (McGinley et al. 1980 ). 1.2. Investigational Medicinal Product Name 1.2.1. General Information For further information on NB01, refer to the current investigator’s brochure (IB) for NB01. 1.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology There is no animal in vivo data to date on the safety or clinical efficacy of a topical live P. acnes microbiome transplant. There are no well substantiated animal models for inflammatory acne and Naked Biome is investigating human-specific bacteria. Therefore, in vivo animal clinical and toxicology studies will not yield clinically relevant results that would be applicable for human use. Animal clinical and toxicology studies are not relevant or useful when using human-specific bacteria absent well-substantiated animal models for inflammatory acne for pre-human efficacy testing (Mirshahpanah and Maibach 2007). The best, most relevant, and only useful model to tes t NB01 is first in humans"

Additional literature on previous human studies for probiotics and acne are referenced (Baquerizo et al. 2014; Wei et al. 2016; Thiboutot et al. 2009 ). 1.2.3. Clinical Studies of NB01 The first clinical study of NB01, NB01-P1BSA, is a Phase Ib single-center open-label dose-escalation study using a single dose application with monitoring over 28 days on 10 subjects at two different concentrations (lower bound (104 CFU/cm2) and upper bound (105 CFU/cm2)). This study is ongoing, however, in meeting the safety criteria of this initial study, Naked Biome plans to expand the IND research to a Phase Ib multi-dosed study under this protocol. All subjects will have been pre-treated with a daily 5.0% BPO gel (Perrigo 5% Benzoyl Peroxide Aqueous Gel) to decrease their resident microbiome bacterial load in preparation for transplantation and successful repopulation with a healthy microbiome. 1.3. Rationale for This Study Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disease affecting 85% of the global population over a lifetime and 40-50 million people in the US currently. It impacts individuals over a large timespan ranging from 13-40 years and has a large psychosocial impact on an individu al’s self-esteem. The majority of those afflicted (50% -75%) are now resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy (Walsh et al. 2016). Acne is caused by overgrowth of P. acnes, impaction of hair follicles, excessive sebum production and hormonal dysregulation. Current standard of care includes treatment with 5.0% BPO, retinoids, and antibiotics. However, there are significant side effects of the above medications, limiting subject compliance and leading to suboptimal long -term efficacy. The heavy dependence on long treatment courses of antibiotics combined with antibiotic resistance rising upwards of 50%-75%, is resulting in treatment failures and contributing to overall global antibiotic resistance. There has been little innovation in acne therapy in the past several decades and a significant current need to develop antibiotic alternatives. Current therapeutic options include: • Topical antibiotics -erythromycin/clindamycin • Oral Antibiotics-tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline • Topical 5.0% BPO products • Topical retinoids • Oral Retinoids • Topical acids-salicylic acid, glycolic acid • Peels • Blue and red-light therapies • Dapsone (Aczone®) • Azelaic acid (Finacea®) Recent literature from the Human Microbiome Project has shown there are unique microbial signatures specific to healthy and acne disease states ( Fitz-Gibbon et al. 2013; Tomida et al."
21,page_21,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 18 July 2019 2013). Subsequent literature discovered a repressor in the porphyrin pathway in health- associated strains resulting in significantly lower porphyrin production ( Johnson et al. 2016). Porphyrin is a known inflammatory mediator in acne pathogenesis (Kang et al. 2015). Porphyrin levels inversely correlate with therapeutic improvement in acne ( Richter et al. 2016). Additional papers have highlighted other virulent factors such as the pIMPLE plasmid that may be associated with acne pathogenesis and were found to be more common in disease-associated strains (Kasimatis et al. 2013). From this data, the Sponsor believes that by eliminating resident disease-associated bacterial strains and replacing them with a health-associated P. acnes transplant, there is the potential to improve, mitigate, treat, or prevent acne flares. Naked Biome is currently testing this in an initial Phase I study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and clinical impact that a single dose application of NB01 has on adult subjects with moderate acne. Naked Biome aims to test this further in multiple dosing with NB01 on subjects under this protocol. 1.4. Risk/Benefit Assessment for the Study The risks of this study are that the applied study drug may contribute to worsening of disease and/or subjects may experience side effects including but not limited to unlikely opportunistic infections, irritation, dryness, or redness. The benefits are th at individual subjects may have improvement of their disease. Overall benefits to society include development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of acne. 1.5. Compliance This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, Good Clinical Practice, and all applicable regulatory requirements."

Dosing Compliance Measures of study drug compliance will include the duration (days) of treatment (defined as last dose date – first dose date +1), the total number of applications (determined from the doses reported in the Subject Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied. Subjects who apply at least 80% of the expected total number of applications and have no other evidence of mater ial dosing non-compliance will be considered to be compliant with study drug dosing. 3.1.2. Primary Safety Adverse Events All reported or observed AEs will be recorded. At each visit, subjects will also be questioned specifically about the status of any ongoing A Es. Untoward events that occur prior to the first dose of study drug will be captured in the medical history section of the electronic case report form (eCRF) unless they are related to a study-specific procedure. Local Skin Reactions At each visit, LSRs will be assessed. Erythema, edema, erosion/ulceration, scaling/dryness, and scabbing/crusting in the treatment area will be assessed by the PI and itching and pain in the treatment area will be assessed by the subject using a 4 -point ordinal scale where 0=absent, 1=mild (slight, barely perceptible), 2=moderate (distinct presence), and 3=severe (marked, intense). Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication), require withholding or discontinuation of the application of the study drug, or extend 2 cm beyond the treatment area will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as an AE. LSRs will also be assessed by subjects weekly during the Screening, Treatment and Follow-up periods using a subject diary to assess redness, swelling, erosion/ulceration, scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, itching and pain by the same 4-point scale used during clinic visits. Subjects will be asked to record the greatest severity of each LSR experienced during the previous 7 days. Limited Physical Examination The limited physical examination will include examination of the face, chest, arms, and back (i.e., relevant acne regions) Abnormalities at Screening/Baseline will be recorded as medical history. Any new or worsening abnormalities at Visit 5/EOT will be recorded as AEs. Vital Signs Vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature will be measured at Screening/Baseline and Visit 5/EOT. Assessments will be made after the subject has res ted in a seated position for at least five minutes."

Biomarker Samples to Address the Study Objectives The following biological specimens may be collected in this study and will be used to evaluate the association of exploratory biomarkers with study drug response, including engraftment, efficacy and/or AEs and to increase knowledge and understanding of the biology of acne or related diseases, and/or the validation of a companion diagnostic for acne . The specific analyses may include but will not be limited to the following biomarkers and assays: cheek swab and Biore® strip TaqMan Ò and microbial sequencing laboratory analysis. Because biomarker science is a rapidly evolving area of investigation, an d AEs in particular are difficult to predict, it is not possible to specify prospectively all tests that will be done on the specimens provided. The testing outlined below is based upon the current state of scientific knowledge. It may be modified during or after the end of the study to remove tests no longer indicated and/or to add new tests based upon the growing state of art knowledge. Any future testing must be approved by local authorities, as applicable, according to specific local regulations. 3.7.2. Biomarker Samples for Optional Future Research In addition to the study-specific informed consent to be signed by each subject participating in the study, a separate, specific signature will be required to document a subject's agreement to allow the use of the remainder of their already collected microbial biomarker specimens for optional future research, once approved by local authorities, as applicable, according to specific local regulations. The specimens collected for optional future research will be used to increase our knowledge and understanding of the biology of the study disease and related diseases and to study the association of biomarkers with disease pathogenesis, progression and/or treatment outcomes, including efficacy, AEs, and the processes of drug absorption and disposition. These specimens may be used also to develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance characteristics of these assays. The collection and analysis of optional future research specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future."

Procedure for Subject Randomization Subjects will be randomized to one of the two Tr eatment Groups on a 2:1 basis (NB01 or vehicle-control) using a central randomization scheme. Randomization will be stratified by sex (male/female) and age (18 -25 years old/26-40 years old). Subjects will be randomized on Day 1 after the subject has ar rived at the site and eligibility has been confirmed. To randomize a subject the PI or designee will call the contract research organization (CRO) and provide the required subject information. The CRO will have a designated unblinded staff member availab le to assign a study drug kit number to the subject, which contains the treatment specified by the randomization schedule. A subject randomization form documenting study drug kit number assignment will be provided to the site by the CRO. 5.1.2. Procedures for Breaking Treatment Codes In the event of a medical emergency where breaking the blind is required to provide medical care to the subject, the PI may obtain treatment assignment by opening the unblinding envelope for the subject kit. Sponsor recommends but does not require that the PI contact the Medical Monitor before breaking the blind. Treatment assignment should remain blinded unless that knowledge is necessary to determine subject emergency medical care. The rationale for unblinding must be clearly explained in source documentation and on the CRF/eCRF, along with the date on which the treatment assignment was obtained. The PI is requested to contact the Medical Monitor promptly in case of any treatment unblinding. Blinding of study treatment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study and therefore, if a subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the PI, the subject will have study treatment discontinued. All subjects will be followed until study completion unless consent to do so is specifically withdrawn by the subject. Sponsor may independently unblind cases for expedited reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. 5.2. Description and Handling of Study Drug 5.2.1. Formulation “Study drug” for this study refers to the blinded NB01 or vehicle-control that will be administered to the study subjects as described in the procedures in Section 6."
33,page_33,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 18 July 2019 NB01 Formulation: • Live culture of a single strain of P. acnes • Purified water • Glycerol • Phosphate buffered saline Vehicle-control Formulation: • Purified water • Glycerol • Phosphate buffered saline All excipients are generally regarded as safe and present in concentrations found on the FDA Inactive Ingredient G uide https://www.fda.gov/drugs/informationondrugs/ucm113978.htm. 5.2.2. Packaging and Labeling NB01 and vehicle-control will be packaged, labeled, and supplied in a blinded fashion for t his study. The clinical study formulation comes as a clear solution dispensed using individual vacuum-sealed cotton pads. The packaging for NB01 and vehicle-control will be identical and supplied frozen to the PI by the Sponsor in single aliquot dosages delivered as a clear, topical solution in a cotton applicator pad packaged in a vacuum-sealed plastic pouch. A sample image of the study drug and label are as follows:"
34,page_34,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 18 July 2019 5.2.3. Storage and Handling At clinical site: Study drug will be stored at the clinical site in a -80 ° Celsius lab freezer before application to study subjects at Day 1, with the exception that Site 04 will maintain drug at -70 ° Celsius. A range of ± 10 degree Celsius is acceptable for storage. Please contact the Sponsor in the event of temperature departure from that range. Subjects will be provided with study drug at their study visit, with adequate supply to apply until their subsequent visit. At home: Subjects will take the study drug home from the site in temperature -conserving travel- packs containing ice packs to maintain temperature until their arrival at home, at which time the entire travel-pack (with two different types of freezer blocks) will be stored in the subject’s residential freezer. Study drug should be removed from the freezer 5 minutes prior to application to allow it to thaw to room temperature. The study drug must be used within 5 to 30 minutes of removal from freezer storage. If for any reason application is not able to occur at the planned time within 30 minutes, the site/subject will be instructed to dispose of the study drug in a standard waste receptacle at either the clinical site or at the subject’s home. The instructions for application glove and study drug pad disposal are discussed in Section 5.3."
35,page_35,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 18 July 2019 5.3. Application of Study Drug Administerers of study drug should wash their hands and wear non-powdered nitrile gloves for application. At clinic: Subjects will wash their face with Cetaphil® right before in -office application on Day 1. Subject’s dose will be administered by the PI (or sub-investigator designee) at the Day 1 visit after swab samples have been procured. At home: From Day 2 and thereafter, subjects will apply study drug every evening after their Cetaphil® wash. Subjects will be instructed to stop study drug application 3-7 days before Visit 5. Used study drug pads, shrink-wrap packaging (bags) and application gloves will be discarded in a standard waste receptacle at either the clinical site or at the subject’s home. Once the study drug has been applied, the administerer w ill dispose of the used pad and bag by pinching the pad and bag together with the gloved hand and, using the ungloved hand, peel off the glove inside- out thereby containing the pad and bag within the glove. The subject will discard the glove (with pad and bag contained inside) in a standard waste receptacle and wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 5.4. Prior and Concomitant Medications & Therapies Current medications and any medications taken within 30 days prior to the start of the study (Baseline) will be recorded as prior/concomitant medications with the dose and corresponding indication. The medications to be recorded include prescription, OTC medications, and all vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements being taken by the subject. All concomitant medications will be coded with the current version of the WHO Drug Dictionary. Any changes in concomitant medications and/or procedures/therapies during the study must be recorded. The reason for any changes in concomitant medications and/or procedures/t herapies should be reported and should reflect either a baseline medical condition documented in the medical history or in conjunction with an AE. 5.4.1. Prohibited Medications or Therapies Subjects are excluded from the study if taking any other acne medication : • Topical anti-acne treatments including, but not limited to, OTC acne cleansers or treatments, BPO (other than the BPO pre-treatment required during Screening), antibiotics, azelaic acid, dapsone, sulfa based products, corticosteroids, and salicylic acid • Topical retinoids (e.g., prescription tazarotene, adapalene, and tretinoin, including OTC adapalene)"
36,page_36,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 18 July 2019 BPO use is only allowed once subjects have been consented to participate in the study and only as part of the Screening period. Subjects are to wait until t he end of the study before initiating any other therapy or investigational agent for the treatment of acne. 5.4.2. Allowed Medications or Therapies Contraception for WOCBP is required per Inclusion Criterion #6 (see Section 4.2). Vitamins and mineral supplements are permitted at dosages considered by the PI as reasonable for maintaining good health and will be recorded in the eCRFs. Therapies (medication and non -medication therapies) not restricted by the protocol may be us ed during the study for the treatment or prevention of disease or to maintain good health. Non- prohibited chronic therapies being used at Screening/Baseline may be continued but must be recorded. Reasonable use of OTC medications such as acetaminophen or acetylsalicylic acid for relief of headache, muscle ache, etc. is allowed during the study and must be recorded. 5.4.3. Use of Other Moisturizers, Sunscreens and Makeup Once subjects have completed the evening Cetaphil® wash, they are prohibited from using moisturizers, sunscreens (including moisturizers containing sunscreens), face makeup or other facial products, until the morning Cetaphil® wash throughout the study treatment period. The PI (or designee) will review the subject’s current topical facial product use during the Screening Period to ensure they do not contain prohibited medications such as benzoyl peroxide, retinol, salicylic acid, or glycolic acid. The site will let the subjects know which of their products are acceptable for use during the trial . Once use of topical facial products (e.g. moisturizers, sunscreens, face make-up) has been approved by the PI (or designee), subjects may continue using them after completion of the Day 1 Visit, during the daytime hours only (after the morning Cetaphil® wash and before the evening Cetaphil® wash). Subjects will be instructed to contact the PI or study staff for approval prior to the use of any new facial products. Site staff will query the subjects regarding use of topical facial products at each study visit. 5.4.4. Use of Other Cleansers The use of cleansers, other than the study-provided Cetaphil®, is prohibited throughout the subject’s participation in the study, from the Screening Visit through the Week 16/EOS visit."

Facial Shaving Shaving of the face is allowed during the study, with these exceptions: - Subjects may not shave in the morning prior to study clinic visits - Subjects are not to shave in the evening after the application of study drug. 5.5. Accountability for NB01 The PI is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused study drug. This includes acknowledgement of receipt of each shipment of study drug (quantity and condition). All unused study drug dispensed to subjects must be returned to the site at the following clinic visit for accountability and compliance assessments. NB01/vehicle-control study drug accountability records will be provided to each study site to: • Record the date and quantity of study drug kits received from the Sponsor • Record the date, subject number, subject initials, the study drug kit dispensed • Record the date, quantity of any unused study drug returned 5.6. Study Drug Product Return or Disposal Unused study drug packages may be returned to the Sponsor by the site, upon Sponsor request, after the completion of the study. Details on the return process are provided in the Study Reference Manual for this trial. 5.7. Study Drug Product Complaints The Sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies to ensure the safety of study subjects, monitor quality, and facilitate process and product improvements. All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the Sponsor or its designee will be reported to the Sponsor. All product complaints associated with other study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer. The PI or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the product complaint via email or other written communication to the Sponsor contact or respective manufacturer as noted in the packaging information. Any AE associated with a product complaint should be reported to Sponsor. If the PI is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product."

Adverse Event Definitions An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. An adverse reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adve rse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological action or m ay be unpredictable in its occurrence. An AE does not include the following: Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and transfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an AE and must be reported. Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the screening visit that do not worsen. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions). Overdose without clinical sequelae. Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol-associated procedure is not an AE. It is considered to be pre-existing and should be documented on the medical history CRF. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is n ot required or"
43,page_43,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 18 July 2019 available, the event is considered “unexpected” if it is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis wou ld be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the IB referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular accidents. ""Unexpected,"" as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are n ot specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the Sponsor and/or their designee in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby allowing: 1) protection of the safety of study subjects; 2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the study drug; 3) recognition of dose-related study drug toxicity; 4) appropriate modification of study protocols; 5) improvements in study design or procedures; and 6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements. 7.2. Adverse Event Details AEs may be either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the PI should report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their participation in the study should receive follow -up as appropriate. AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization (if possible) and, if they become serious, reported as SAEs. If possible, the outcome of any AEs that caused permanen t discontinuation or that were present at the end of the study, especially those considered by the PI to be related to the study drug, should be reported. Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written informed consent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless an event occurred as a result of a study-related procedure and is unanticipated; in such cases, the event should be recorded as an AE and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the study drug; therefore, AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of study drug until the date of the final study visit. These data are considered treatment-emergent AEs. The PI will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. At each visit, the PI should ask the subject, in non-directive fashion, about any change in the subject’s overall"
44,page_44,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 18 July 2019 health status since the previous visit. Optional photographs may be obtained for areas outside of the face, as clinically indicated for the classification and management of AEs. The PI will assign a CTCAE grade to all AEs (CTCAE Version 5.0, Appendix 4). The severity of each AE, as judged by the PI, will be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale: Mild - The AE is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate - The AE is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant. Severe - The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical status or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. The PI must determine the relationship of the AE to the study drug according to the following categories: Definitely related - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage, and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re -challenge). Probably related - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the study drug; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. Possibly related - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the study drug; but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes. Unlikely related - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the study drug, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying i llness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects. Not Related - An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes. The PI should categorize the outcome of the AE accor ding to the following categories:"
45,page_45,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 18 July 2019 Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE. Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not recuperated. Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated. Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. Recovering/Resolving - AE is improving or the subject is recuperating. Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 7.2.1. Dose Limiting Toxicity and Stopping Rules The Medical Monitor will consider DLT when reviewing the safety data and making recommendations for discontinuing a subject from the study per Section 10.2. A DLT is defined as a new onset systemic Grade 2 or higher (CTCAE Version 5.0, Appendix 4) AE for which there is no clear alternative explanation of the cause of the AE. In the event a subject is enrolled in the study with a baseline medical condition that would not exclude the subject from entering the study, but meets the classification criteria for a systemic Grade 2 (or higher) or non-systemic (local) Grade 3 (or higher) event, a worsening of the baseline condition during the study that results in an increase in one grade above their Baseline grade shall warrant assessment as a potential DLT. Non-systemic (local) AEs Grade 3 or higher for which there is no clear alternative explanation of the cause of the AE will also be considered DLTs. Any subject who experiences a DLT, as described above, must discontinue treatment and be scheduled for a fi nal visit. Any DLTs that are Grade 2 or greater systemic AEs must be reported by the PI immediately. If three or more subjects experience DLTs in the study, enrollment in the study will be halted, and a safety review will occur using an independent medical reviewer who will have access to the subject’s treatment allocation. This review shall be completed promptly within 10 business days. Subjects who are active in the study will be instructed to withhold study drug applications during the safety review period. If all of the subjects experiencing DLTs (i.e. three or more) are found to be subjects receiving the active NB01 study drug, the independent medical reviewer will provide a written recommendation to the Sponsor to continue the study, discontinue the st udy or modify the study protocol. The Sponsor is responsible for promptly reviewing the independent medical reviewer’s recommendations, accepting or rejecting these recommendations, and determining whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study con duct will be required. The Sponsor will provide the final written decision regarding the study status. In the event this is not the case, the independent medical reviewer will notify the Sponsor and Medical Monitor of how many subject’s DLTs were in subjects receiving vehicle (e.g. Y subjects). In the event Y new subjects experience DLTs, the independent medical reviewer review process outlined above will be repeated. This process will be repeated throughout the entire study until the study is complete or"
46,page_46,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 18 July 2019 the stopping rule has been met. In the event that a total of three (3) or more subjects experience DLTs related to NB01 study drug, the study will be discontinued. If an SAE occurs during the study and is determined by the Sponsor to be at least possibly related to the study drug, enrollment of new subjects and dosing of active subjects will be halted. A safety review will occur using an independent medical reviewer who will have access to the subject’s treatment allocation . This review shall be completed promptly within 5 business days. The independent medical reviewer will provide a written recommendation to the Sponsor to continue the study, discontinue the study or modify the study protocol. The Sponsor is responsible for promptly reviewing the independent medical reviewer’s recommendations, accepting or rejecting these recommendations, and determining whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct will be required. The Sponsor will provide the final written decision regarding the study status. A summary of the event should also be reported to FDA as part of an IND Safety Report in accordance with Section 7.2.2. FDA should also be notified within 48 hours of the final decision and provided an IND Safety Follow -up Report as necessary (if new information was collected since the initial Safety Report). 7.2.2. Serious Adverse Events An event that is serious must be recorded on the CRF/eCRF and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opinion of either the PI or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : • Death; the event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious criterion. • Life-threatening event; an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event and not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe. • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (for ≥24 hours). • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. • Congenital anomaly/birth defect. • Important medical events; a medical event(s) that may not result in death, be life - threatening, or require hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization , or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: • Hospitalizations for the treatment, which was elective or pre -planned, of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen; and"
47,page_47,"NB01 Protocol NB01 -P1BMA Final Naked Biome, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 48 18 July 2019 • Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospital admission. AEs classified as “serious” by either the PI or the Sponsor require expeditious handling and reporting to the Sponsor or designee to comply with regulatory requirements. All SAEs, whether related or unrelated to study drug, must be immediately reported by telephone to the Medical Monitor listed on the first page of the protocol. In the event that he/she is unavailable, contact the back-up Medical Monitor listed in the study reference manual. Written notification of all SAEs should be sent to the Trial Manager by email or confirmed facsimile transmission. These include those SAEs listed in the protocol or IB and must include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event. Any suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected represent especially important safety information that must be reported more rapidly to Health Authorit ies; therefore, it is important that the PI submit any information requested by the Sponsor or designee as soon as it becomes available. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the PI become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to study drug) that occurs within 30 days after stopping the study drug, the SAE must be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Sponsor or designee, if available. As required, the Sponsor or designee will notify participating PIs of all suspected adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are: i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; ii) Findings from other studies including epidemiological studies, pooled analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the study drugs; iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the study drugs, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure; and iv) Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions. Upon receiving such notices, the PI must review and retain the notice with the IB and promptly submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB according to local regulations. The PI and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The PI should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by the PI to Health Authorities should be handled according to local regulations."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 18 July 2019 The Sponsor or designee may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities (e.g., United States FDA) within seven calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that PIs submit any information requested by the Sponsor or designee as soon as it becomes available. 7.2.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events The PI will evaluate clinical laboratory results, physical exam findings and vital signs to determine if any findings are clinically signi ficant. Any clinically significant results that represent and new or worsening change from Baseline should be recorded as an AE. 7.3. Pregnancy Male subjects who are not surgically sterile, and are sexually active with a female partner must agree to use an effective method of birth control from the first administration of the study drug until 30 days after the last study drug application. Female subjects who are WOCBP, and are sexually active with a male partner must agree to use an effective method of birth c ontrol from the first administration of the study drug until 30 days after the last study drug application . Protocol Section 4.2, Inclusion Criteria #6, provides definitions of sterility and methods of acceptable birth control. Prior to study enrollment, subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion. WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) during the study and for 30 days after s he has completed her last test article application. If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pre gnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further test article. If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a subject was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to the Sponsor or designee. The investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study treatment and keep careful source documentation of the event, including abortion (accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous) and birth of offspring. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks and any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject or a male subject’s sexual partner that was exposed to the study drug should be documented on the pregnancy surveillance form as appropriate."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 18 July 2019 During the study, all male subjects should be instructed to contact the PI immediately if they suspect that their sexual partner might be pregnant (e.g., female sex ual partner has missed or late menstrual period). 7.4. Toxicity Management A dose mitigation strategy will be employed whereby, with Medical Monitor approval, the dose may be reduced/modified according to the individual subject’s tolerance. Typical modifica tion may include short drug holiday periods off therapy, every other day dosing, etc. Such changes however shall not be made without the written approval of the Medical Monitor."
