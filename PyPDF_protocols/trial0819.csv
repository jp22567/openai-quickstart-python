Background and Rationale Breast cancer is a biologically diverse and genetically hete rogeneous disease .1,2Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1( BRCA1 )and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 ( BRCA2 )are key components in the repair pathway for deox yribose nucleic acid ( DNA )double strand breaks ,3and mutations in these genes account for 20% to 25% of hereditary breast cancers and 5% of a ll breast cancers.4 A substantial portion of patients with gBRCA mutated breast cancer have hormone receptor -positive disease, including 20 30% of gBRCA1 carriers and 45 72% of gBRCA2 carriers .5 Approximately 15% of all breast cancers are triple negative. They can be defined by the l ack of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. They are more commonl y associated with younger women, pre -menopausal women of African American race and BRCA1 mutation carriers. Triple -negative breast cancers ( TNBCs) are generally more aggressive in na ture and associated with visceral and soft tissue disease. The incidence of BRCA 1 and 2 mutations in patients with TNBC has been reported to be between 9.6 to 10.6%.6,7 In a study of 469 TNBC patients, gBRCA1/2 mutation prevalence was also shown to vary by race: Ashkenazi Jewish (50 %), Caucasian (33.3 %), Asian (28.5 %), African Americans (20.4 %),and Hispanic (20 %). The prevalence of genetic mutations also diffe red b y age at diagnosis, with most patients <40 years (43.8 %) of age. Various studies have demonstrated that TNBCs are associated with a poorer prognosis than luminal breast cancers. A Canadian series, including approximately 1600 triple negative cancer s conducted by Dent, R et al8 demonstrated worse long term outcomes in terms of distant recurrence and death in triple negative tumors compared to non- triple negative tumors. The standard of treatment for neoad juvant treatment is variable, but mostly focuses on the use of anthracy cline -taxane regimens. Other regimens used include adriamy cin plus cyclophosphamide (AC). Cy clophosphamide methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) is another option which offers less to xicity ; however, it has a longer duration of therap y. Platinum therapies have also shown eff icacy in HER2 negative breast cancer, in particular germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (gBRCA) mutant tumors, as these tumors have defects in homologous r ecombination (hR), rendering them more susceptible to deoxy ribose nucleic acid (DNA) cross linking agents such as platinums. Retrospective neoadjuvant subject series have suggested that primary breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers is platinum - sensitive and rel ativel y unresponsive t o anthracy clines and/or taxanes9while other studies have found that BRCA1 is relativel y responsive to anthracyclines and/or taxanes while BRCA2 disease is less responsive than sporadic prim ary breast cancer t o these drug classes .10"
16,page_16,"Talazoparib (PF -06944076; MDV3800) C3441020 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 14 August 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 17The GeparSixto (NCT01426880) and CALGB (NCT00632853) trials examined the efficacy of adding platinum to neoadjuvant regimens in triple negative breast cancer. In Gepar Sixto, the pathological complete response (pCR) rates (breast/axilla) increased from 36.9% to 53.2%; in the BRCA subgroup, an increase in pCR by 25% (probability value [ p]=0.008) was observed. The CALGB/Alliance trial showed an increase in pCR with the ad dition of carboplatin for breast/axilla (54% vs 41%; p=0.0029). Since these studies were underpowered for long term outcome, it is difficult to assess long term benefit. Therefore, the role for platinum therapy in TNBC still remains unclear and warrants further investigation in larger trials with examination of long term outcomes. There have been studies resulting in improved disease -free survival (DFS) in patients who achieved pCR with platinum agents and BRCA mutation. Frasci et al11reported that in TNBC patients treated with eight cisplatin -epirubicin -paclitaxel weekl y cycles, 62% showed pCR in both breast and axilla, and the projected 5 -year DFS was 90% and 56% in pCRs and non- pCRs, respectively . The BR CA1 gene is expressed in several tissues, such as breast and ovarian tissue. Currently , more than 1600 mutations have been identified in the BRCA1 gene, and the majority of them promote frameshifts resulting in missense or non -functional protein. Women w ith BRCA1 mutations have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, while men have a higher risk, to a lesser extent, of developing prostate cancer .12 BRCA2 does not share a high degree of sequen ce homology with other known genes, and the generated protein is comprised of regions with domains that are undefined .13 Currently , more than 1800 mutations have been identified in BRCA2, that include frameshif t deletions, insertions, or nonsense mutations that lead to premature truncation of proteins. It has been demonstrated that BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes perform a critical role in the response to cellular damage through activation of specific DN A repair processes and play an important part in DNA repair and as transcriptional regulators .14 Inhibition of pol y (ADP -ribose) pol ymerase (PARP) catal ytic activit y contributes to the process of s ynthetic letha lity-defined as a combination of two DNA repair pathway defects which may be lethal to the cell- resulting in single -strand breaks that require homologous recombination DNA repair for survival. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) induce sy nthetic lethalit y in tumor cells containing mutations and/or deletions in genes involved in homologous replication or other DNA pathway s, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Clinical trials have shown that PARPi are beneficial in the treatment of patients with breast cancer that are carriers o f germline BRCA mutations. I n a phase 1 trial, olaparib (NCT00516373; 10 to 600 mg twice a day ) treatment of solid tumors of patients with breast cancer with no gBRCA mutations vs. patients with breast cancer with gBRCA mutations, resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 15% and 33%, respectivel y15in a phase 2 trial (NCT00494234) of single -agent olaparib in patients with breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutation and advanced disease, investigated two dose leve ls (cohort 1: 400 mg twice daily [bd] and cohort 2: 100 mg bd) and demonstrated an ORR of 42% and 25%, respectivel y. Progression- free survival (PFS) was 5.7 and 3.8 months for cohorts 1 and 2, respectivel y. A phase I stud y of niraparib (NCT00749502; 30 t o 400 mg once a day ) for treatment of solid"

Single agent talazoparib treatment demonstrates potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase 1 studies in patients with solid tumors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cy totoxic effects of DNA damaging chemotherapy .18,19 Despite advances in the understanding of the biology of gBRCA assoc iated TNBC, treatment options remain limited. PARPi, as well as platinum- based combination therapies, have emerged as regimens of potential interest and in particular, therap y with single agent PARPi could present significant advantages over chemotherap y regimens through potentially improved tolerability . The PARP inhibitor olaparib, which was first approved by the Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) in 2014 for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with gBRCA mutations, was assessed during a Phase 3 study (OlympiAD; NCT02000622) in metastatic gBRCA mutated breast cancer. This trial included patients with HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer that were either hormone receptor (HR) positive or triple negative; a subgroup of the patient population (approxi mately 50%) were defined as TNBC. PFS was 7 months in the olaparib group vs. 4.2 months in the chemotherap y group (observed hazard ratio=0.58; 95% CI , 0.43 to 0.80; p=0.009). The objective response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib arm vs. 28.8% in the chem otherapy arm. Olaparib was determined to be effective against triple -negative breast cancers that arise in women with inherited, germline BRCA mutations (observed hazard ratio in the TNBC subgroup=0.43) .20 The Phase 2 ABRAZO study , presented at ASCO 2017, demonstrated clinical activity of single agent talazoparib in advanced triple negative, gBRCA mutant breast cancer. ABRAZO (673 -201; NCT02034916) is an open -label Phase 2, single arm study investigating the cl inical efficacy and safet y of single -agent talazoparib in 83 heavily pre-treated patients with gBRCA positive advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoint was ORR by independent radiology review. Cohort 1 consisted of 49 patients who previously responded to platinum -based chemotherap y and subsequently developed disease progression. A 21% ORR (95% confidence interval [CI ]: 10 to 35) was observed in this group of patients. Cohort 2 consisted of 35 patients who developed disease progression following at le ast three lines of non -platinum -based therap y. This group of patients had a 37% ORR (95% CI : 22 to55)."

The primary endpoint was progression- free survival. O f the 431 patients who underwent randomization, 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib and 144 were assigned to receive standard therap y. Progression- free survival was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard -therapy group (haz ard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001; medians 8.6 months vs. 5.6 months). The hazard ratio for overall survival based on interim analy sis at the time of the final progression -free survival analysis was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.06; p=0.11 [57% of projected events]; medians 22.3 months vs. 19.5 months). The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard- therap y group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI , 2.9 to 8.8; p<0.001). In all clinically -relevant subgroups, a consistent PFS benefit in favor of talazoparib was observed in comparison with phy sician’s choice of treatment (PCT), regardless of hormone -receptor status (hormone receptor positive [HR positive ]: hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI , 0.32 to 0.70; or TNBC: hazard ratio 0.60, 95% CI , 0.41 to 0.87) BRCA mutation subty pe, history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis, visceral/non-visceral disease, or number of prior cy totoxic chemotherapies for advanced disease. Complete response was seen in 5.5% of patients with talazoparib therap y vs zero patients receiving PCT and partial response was seen in 57.1% vs 27.2%, respectively. In an exploratory analysis, time to end of first post -study therapy was longer with talzapari (haza rd ratio 0.68; 95% CI ; 0.51 to 0.91). Talazoparib was approved in October 2018 by the US FDA for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA -mutated (gBRCAm), HER2 negative locally advanced or metastatic breas t cancer. Talazoparib was generally well tolerated, and few adverse events (excluding progressive disease) led to permanent treatment discontinuation (5.9% in talazoparib arm vs 8.7% in PCT). Most non -hematologic toxicities were lower -grade, and the more common hematologic toxicities were managed b y dose interruption or dose reduction and supportive care as needed. An investigator -initiated research (IIR) stud y at MD Anderson Cancer Center titled “Neoadjuvant Talazoparib for Patients With a BRCA Deleteri ous Mutation” explored the feasibility of neoadjuvant talazoparib in a two part study (NCT02282345). Part 1, which evaluated a lead -in of 2 months of talazoparib single agent followed by standard chemotherap y and surgery , is complete and was accepted for publication in NPJ Breast Cancer .23 Decreases in tumor volume (as assessed by the investigator) occurred in 13 out of 13patients following 2 months of talazoparib monotherap y (1mg). The median tumor volume d ecrease after two months of treatment with talazoparib was 88% (range of 30 to 98%). Notabl y, all TNBC patients achieved either residual cancer burden (RCB) -0 or RCB -1 following completion of the protocol assigned therap y and surgery. In this pilot study , talazoparib was well tolerated with no Grade 4 or 5 toxicities observed, and only one patient required dose reduction due to Grade 3 neutropenia.

There will also be an additional post -surgical safety follow up, 4 weeks after surgery for assessment of wound healing. Long term follow- up will begin after date of surgery for EFS and OS after first dose of talazoparib. Study Treatments Patients will receive talazoparib 1 mg dail y for 24 weeks, followed b y breast surgery , which should occur within 4 to 6 weeks (no longer than 6 weeks) of the last dose. If hematological toxicity is present (ie, neutropenia/thrombocy topenia), the investigator will decide whether surgery will proceed according to schedule; a washout period is not needed. Statistical Meth ods Analysis populations: Evaluable population is defined as all patients enrolled in the study who receive 24 weeks of talazoparib treatment 1 mg once dail y (QD), undergo breast surgery and pCR assessment , as well as those patients who progress or die bef ore pCR can be assessed . The evaluable population is the primary anal ysis population for all efficacy endpoints at the interim anal ysis as well as the final anal ysis. Patients who progress or die before pCR can be assessed (regardless of whether or not they received 80% of study treatment) by investigator and b y ICR will be considered as non -responders in the evaluable population. If a patient receives less than 80% of the protocol required treatment, undergoes surgery and achieves pCR by ICR, the patien t will be counted as a responder in the ITT population, but will not be included in the evaluable population. The intent to treat (ITT) anal ysis population is defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of talazoparib. All efficacy anal yses will also be reported in the ITT anal ysis population. The safet y population is defined as all patients enrolled in the study who received at least one dose of talazoparib (which is the same as the ITT population in this study ). All saf ety analyses will be reported using the safet y population. The PRO anal ysis population is defined as all patients who completed a baseline and at least one post baseline qualit y-of- life assessment prior to the end of study treatment. The PK anal ysis popula tion is defined as all patients treated with talazoparib for whom drug plasma concentration results (from at least 1 visit) are available. For the PK anal ysis population, talazoparib concentrations will be summarized descriptively by nominal time and talazoparib dose strength. Additionally , a subgroup of PK samples which meet pre- defined steady -state acceptance criteria (as detailed in the study statistical anal ysis plan [SAP]) will be summarized by nominal time and a within -patient average talazoparib st eady state trough concentration will be listed by patient from this population."

Patients who progress or die before pCR can be assessed will be considered as non -responders. pCR rate will be evaluated at the time of the interim and final analyses and will be summarized along with the exact 80% and 95% CI. pCR by ICR will also be summarized in the I TT population, along with the exact 80% and 95% CI . Patients who discontinue treatment or the study prematurel y, are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent, progress or die before pCR can be assessed by central review will be considered as non -responders in the ITT population analysis. pCR rate by investigator is defined as the number and percentage of patients achieving pCR by investigator review after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks, followed by surgery , among all patients in the evaluable population. pCR rate by investigator will be evaluated at the time of the interim and final anal yses and will be summarized along with the exact 95% CI. pCR by investigator will also be summarized in the ITT population, along with the exact 95% CI . Patients who discontinue treatment or study prematurel y, are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent, progress or die before pCR can be assessed b y investigator will be considered as non -responder s in the ITT population analysis. Residual cancer burden by ICR will be reported as a categorical variable with four classes (categories) RCB 0 (pCR), I (minimal RCB), II (moderate RCB), and III (extensive RCB). Number and percentage of patients in each category will be reported along with exact 95% CI. The analy sis of RCB by ICR will be conducted in the evaluable population. pCR rate in breast b y ICR is defined as the number and percentage of patients achieving pCR in breast b y independent central review after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks, followed b y surgery , among all patients in the evaluable population. pCR in breast rate will be summarized using descriptive statistics along with the exact 95% CI . pCR rate in breast by ICR will also be summa rized in the I TT population along with 95% CI. Patients who discontinue treatment or study prematurel y, are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent, progress or die before pCR in breast can be assessed b y central review will be considered as non-responders in the ITT population analy sis. EFS is defined as the time from surgery date to first documentation of local or distant recurrence, death, or initiation of antineoplastic therap y before documentation of first relapse. Patients discontinuing study before doc umentation of first relapse or death, but after surgery , will be censored observations for EFS. EFS at 3 years is defined as the probability of being event -free at 3 y ears using Kaplan Meier methods. The 95% CI for EFS at 3 years will be calculated using the Brookmey er-Crowley method24EFS at 3 y ears will be summarized in the evaluable population."

A comprehensive review of talazoparib may be found in the single reference safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure (IB), provided by Pfizer and published August 2018. Investigators are to revie w this document prior to initiating this study . 1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. PARP inhibitors, including talazopar ib, exert cy totoxic effects via 2 mechanisms: (1) inhibition of PARP1 and PARP2 cataly tic activity , and (2) PARP trapping, a process in which PARP protein bound to a PARP inhibitor does not readil y dissociate from DNA (deox yribonucleic acid), thereb y preve nting repair, replication, and transcription .25 Figure 2. Dual Cytotoxic Mechanisms of PARP Inhibitors Source: Adapted from Reference.25 PARP = poly (adenosine diphosphate -ribose) polymerase; DNA= deoxyribose nucleic acid; hR=homologous recombination . Inhibition of PARP catalytic activity (upper pathway) interferes w ith the repair of single -strand breaks, leading to replication fork damage that requires homologous recombination DNA repair for cell survival. Trapping of PARP –DNA complexes with PARP inhibitor (low er pathway; PARP inhibitor represented by ) also leads to replication fork damage with more DNA repair processes required for cell survival. Single agent talazoparib treatment has demonstrated potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase 1 studies in patients with solid tumors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cy totox ic effects of DNA damaging chemotherap y,18,19including temozolomide and irinotecan, in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models."

These findings are consistent with the exaggerated pharmacology of talazoparib and its tissue exposure pattern. The hetamaologic and male reproductive organ findings occurred at sub -therapeutic exposure whereas the GI, ovarian and liver -related changes occurred at higher therapeutic exposure margins. The hematologic findings were generally reversible and the early hematologic changes represent sensitive and early markers of target organ toxicity. Talazoparib is clastogenic in genetic toxicology evaluations. Talazoparib caused fetal malformations, structural variations and death of fetuses in an embry o-fetal development study in rats, in line with its c lastogenic profile. Talazoparib is being investigated for the neoadjuvant treatment of earl y HER2 negative , gBRCA1/2 mutation positive breast cancers. Talazoparib has previously been investigated in both a Phase 2 study (673 -201; ABRAZO) and in a Phase 3 study (673 -301; C3441009; EMBRACA) involving gBRCA mutation patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer compared with ph ysician’s choice of capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine. 1.2.Background and Rationale 1.2.1. Breast Cancer Breas t cancer is the second leading cause of cancer -related death in women, despite improvements in screening and treatment regimens. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2017, approximately 2470 men and 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and approximately 460 men and 40,610 women will die due to the disease .26 1.2.2. Triple Negative and Germline Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1 or 2 Positive Breast Cancer Twelve to twent y percent of breast canc ers are categorized as triple -negative. TNBC is defined b y the lack of protein expression of both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), combined with an absence of HER2 receptor over -expression.27 Six different molecular subtypes of breast carcinoma have been identified. Basal -like breast cancer is defined b y the molecular phenotype of the tumor, as measured b y complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray s; approximately 75% of TNBCs are basal- like.28 The basal -like subt ype is associated with a BRCA mutation in 11 -42% of cases .29 Breast cancer is a biologically diverse and genetically heterogeneous disease .1,2 Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1(BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) are key components in the repair pathway for DNA double strand breaks (Campeau et al, 2008) ,3 and mutations in these genes account for 20% to 25% of hereditary breast cancers and 5% of all breast cancers.4A substantial portion of patients with gBRCA mutated breast cancer have hormone receptor -positive disease, including 20 -30% of gBRCA1 carriers and 45 -72% of gBRCA2 carriers.5 In the United States, women in the general population have a 12% lifetime -risk of developing breast cancer .30In contrast, 55% to 65% of women who"
35,page_35,"Talazoparib (PF -06944076; MDV3800) C3441020 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 14 August 2019 PFIZER C ONFIDENTIAL Page 36inherit a BRCA1 mutation and approximately 45% of women who inherit a BRCA2 mutation will develop breast cancer by age 70.31,32 Prognosis and best treatment practices in patients with breast cancer with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have largel y been characterized in retrospective studies from sing le institutions.33When compared to sporadic primary breast cancer, BRCA1 disease is more likely to be hormone receptor negative and BRCA2 disease is more likel y to be hormone receptor positive .33,34BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers have been reported to be higher grade and higher stage and to have more extensive and extracapsular l ymph node involvement compared to non- BRCA cancers.33,35Well- known prognostic and predictive factors for breast cancer include HR and HER2 expression .36 ER negat ive, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative tumors, known as HER2 negative breast cancer, have a poor prognosis. Metastatic TNBC has the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subt ypes, with a median PFS of 3 to 5 months and a median overall survival of <12 months.37-40 BRCA mutations can be present regardless of HR and HER2 status. Women who have BRCA1 mutations are more likely to develop TNBC than those who have BRCA2 mutations.41 The choice of treatment is informed by the tumor receptor status at the time of initiation as tumor characteristics can evolve over time. Investigational treatments based on the BRCA mutation status are being explored. The FDA granted approval to the PARP inhibitor olaparib for the treatment of germline BRCA mutated, HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer in January 2018. TNBC is a current focus due to poor prognosis and limited treatme nt options. I n comparing the low dose cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil (CAF) regimen from CAL GB8541 to the dose dense regimen of doxorubicin, cy clophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC -T) in CALGB974110, the relative reduction in risk of recur rence was 55% for ER negative tumors, and 26% in ER positive tumors. The absolute improvement in risk of recurrence at 5 years was 22.8% for ER negative tumors and only 7% for ER positive patients treated with tamoxifen. However, the rate of recurrence r emains high, with poor OS rates. Thus, a significant unmet medical need remains for new therapeutic options for women with TNBC. These patients, due to the loss of ER, PR, and HER2 target receptors, do not respond well to hormonal or trastuzumab -based therap y; traditionally , the options have been surgery or chemotherapy , individually or in combination. Retrospective neoadjuvant subject series have suggested that primary breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers is platinum -sensitive and relatively unresponsive to anthracy clines and/or taxanes9while other studies have found that BRCA1 is relatively responsive to anthracy clines and/or taxanes while BRCA2 disease is less responsive than sporadic primary breast cancer to these drug classes.10 1.2.3. Neoadjuvant Therapy For Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant therap y was traditionally used for inoperable cancers; however, in recent years there has been a paradigm shift, and neoadjuvant therap y is used more frequently in earl y breast cancer (EBC). Large studies have demonstrated comparable response rates when compared with adjuvant sy stemic therapy .42"

This could potentially expedite development and treatments for EBC. 1.2.4. Neoadjuvant Therapy For Triple Negative And Germline Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene Positive Breast Cancer Neoadjuvant therap y with platinum agents has yielded promising results. A Phase 2 study conducted b y Garber et al.43evaluated cisplatin given as a single agent for four cy cles to TNBC patients with stage 3 or 4 progression. The overall pCR was 22%. Seven percent of the women in the study were BRCA1 carriers; all achieved a pCR. There is consistent evidence to show that 10 to 20% of patients with TNBC who would not experience pCR following a taxane/anthracy cline treatment regimen, will achieve pCR when platinum is added to the regimen. The Geparsixto (NCT01426880) and CALBG (NCT00632853) trials were 2 randomized studies assessing the addition of platinum- based chemotherap y (CT) to neoadjuvant regimens in a TNBC patient population (n=400 to 600). Treatment regimens included taxol and doxil + platinum weekl y in the Geparsixto trial, and taxol + carboplatinum 3 weekly followed b y dose sense anthracy clines in the CALBG trial. pCR rates were 53% vs. 37% and 54% vs. 41% in TNBC. The pCR rate in the gBRCA subset of the Geparsixto trial was 61.7% vs. 50%. However, since increased rates of toxicity were observed as carboplatinum was added to standard chemotherapy regimens, it is not a single agent option. 1.2.5. Neoadjuvant Th erapy for ER Positive Germline Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene Positive Breast Cancer A substantial portion of patients with gBRCA mutated breast cancer have hormone receptor -positive disease, including 22% of gBRCA1 carriers and 77% of gBRCA2 carriers.5 There is an unmet need for more effective therapies fo r gBRCA mutated hormone receptor positive breast cancer as such patients are considered to have a higher risk for recurrence than patients without gBRCA muta tions as follows: Hormone receptor positive breast cancer is frequentl y characterized by a higher grade in gBRCA2 carriers than in noncarriers.5 The rate of high recurrence score ( RS)Oncot ype Diagnostics ( DX; Genomic Health, http://www.oncoty pedx.com/ recurrence score) was approximately 3-fold higher in patients with gBRCA mutated estrogen receptor positive tumors compared with the general breast cancer population. This suggests that hormone positive breast canc er in BRCA carriers may differ molecularl y from that in noncarriers.5 PARP inhibitors have demonstrated a clinical benefit in gBRCA mutated hormone receptor - positive breast cancer in both earl y and advanced setti ngs.44-46After 6 months of neoadjuvant talazoparib monotherap y in neoadjuvant talazoparib expansion Study NCI02282345, patients with gBRCA mutated hormone receptor positive breast cancer had a pCR rate of 3/5 (60%) and a combined RCB 0+1 rate of 4/5 (80%).22Although based on a limited sample size, this promising pCR rate is substantially higher than that reported for"
37,page_37,"Talazoparib (PF -06944076; MDV3800) C3441020 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 14 August 2019 PFIZER C ONFIDENTIAL Page 38patients with hormone receptor positive early breast cancer who receive dchemotherap y44-46 and is similar to the pCR rates obtained b y adding PARP inhibitors or carboplatin to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with early TNBC.44-46 These results suggest talazoparib monotherap y ma y benefit the gBRCA mutated hormone rec eptor positive subgroup of patients with early breast cancer as well. The clinical benefit of neoadjuvant PARP inhibitors seen in the small groups of patients with hormone receptor positive tumors in studies of gBRCA mutated earl y breast cancer is supporte d by the demonstrated clinical benefit in larger groups of patients in advanced settings.46,21 Data from the Phase 3 EMBRACA study and Phase 2 ABRAZO study demonstrated the benefit of talazoparib monotherap y in gBRCA mutated, hormone receptor positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. EMBRACA: Patients with hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer comprised appro ximately 60% of the randomized patients. I n the prespecified subgroup anal yses of the pr imary PFS endpoint, the hormone receptor positive subgroup had a hazard ratio of 0.47 (95% CI : 0.32, 0.71), and the TNBC subgroup had an HR of 0.60 (95% CI : 0.41, 0.81). A significant improvement in ORR was also observed in both subgroups. For the hormone receptor positive subgroup, ORR was 63.2% in the talazoparib arm versus 37.9% in the PCT arm, with an odds ratio of 2.89 (95% CI : 1.43, 4.83) p=0.0012). For TNBC, ORR was 61.8% in the talazoparib arm versus 12.5% in the PCT arm with an odds ratio of 11.89 (95% CI: 4.54, 41.37; p<0.0001). ABRAZO: For patients with hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer, ORR was 26.3% (5/19 patients) in Cohort 1 (platinum pretreated patients) and 31% (9/29 patients) in Cohort 2 (patients with 3 or more prior non- platinum -containing cytotoxic regimens). For patients with TNBC, the ORR was 17.2% (5/29 patients) in Cohort 1 and 66.7% in Cohort 2 (4/6 patients). The gBRCA mutational status appears to be a stronger biomarke r of efficacy for talazoparib than hormone -receptor status based on the consistency of the treatment effect between patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer and those with TNBC in EMBRACA and ABRAZO. Deleterious gBRCA mutations cause DNA dama ge repair deficiencies, making cells vulnerable to targeted therap y with PARP inhibitors, regardless of disease stage. 1.2.6. Pathological Complete Response as an Endpoint in Neoadjuvant Trials Von Minckwitz45conduct ed a pooled analy sis of 12 international neoadjuvant breast cancer trials. One of the key objectives was to determine the association between pCR and long-term outcome in terms of EFS and OS. In the TNBC patients, there was a 76% reduction in events and an 84% reduction in mortality when patients achieved a pCR, further supporting pCR as an endpoint for TNBC. The impact of molecular subty pe on the pCR shows that more aggressive t ypes of cancers, ie, TNBCs, achieve a higher percentage of pCR than HER positivebreast cancers.

Neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzamab, administered concomitantly with weekl y paclitaxel and followed b y 5-fluorouracil/epirubicin/cy clophosphamide, resulted in a 78% pCR rate in ER negative/HER2 positiv e cancers (the pCR rate was substantially lower in ER positive cancers). This pCR rate is among the highest reported in the literature .49 The FD A Guidance Document ‘ Pathological Complete Response in Neoadjuvant Treatment of High-Risk Early-Stage Breast Cancer: Use as an Endpoint to Support Accelerated Approval ’ published in October 201450supports the u se of pCR as an endpoint in the neoadjuvant setting. Per the Guidance, pCR is defined as: 1.The absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes on hematox ylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional l ymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant s ystemic therapy (ie, y pT0/Tis y pN0 in the current AJCC staging s ystem); or 2.The absence of residual invasive and in situ cancer on hematoxy lin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected br east specimen and all sampled regional ly mph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant s ystemic therapy (ie, ypT0 ypN0) in the current AJCC staging s ystem). 1.2.7. Poly(ADP Ribose) Polymerase Inhibition PARP1 and PARP2 play important roles in DNA repair .51,52Following DNA damage, PARP1 and PARP2 bind to single -stranded DNA breaks, cleave nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and attach multiple ADP- ribose units to the target p rotein, including itself .53-56 The outcome is a highl y negativel y charged protein, which leads to the unwinding of the DNA strands and recruitment of proteins to rep air the damaged DNA through the base-excision repair process. When PARP1 and PARP2 are inhibited, single-strand DNA breaks persist, resulting in stalled replication forks and conversion of single -strand breaks into double -strand breaks. These breaks must be repaired b y homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining or they may become lethal. Thus, inhibition of PARP cataly tic activity results in sy nthetic lethality as defects in homologous recombination DNA repair prevent double strand breaks fro m being repaired, thereb y killing the cell, including cancer cells. In addition, PARP inhibitors bind to PARP -DNA complexes (ie, become trapped), thereb y inhibiting DNA repair, replication, and transcription, which may also be cytotoxic to cancer cells. Although other PARP inhibitors possess both activities, in vitro studies demonstrated that talazoparib is a more potent PARP trapper than other PARP inhibitors in clinical development .57,58"

Poly (ADP Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors as a Potential Targeted Therapeutic in Triple Negative Breast Cancer with Germline Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene Mutations There is mounting evidence that germline BRCA1/2 breast cancers, besides having increased sensitivity to platinum agents, are also sensitive to PARP inhibitors. In a phase 1 trial, the PARP inhibitor olaparib (NCT00516373; 10 to 600 mg twice a day) treatment of solid tumors of patients with breast cancer with no gBRCA mutations vs. those patients with gBRCA mutations, resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 15% and 33%, respectively .1 Tutt et al,15in a phase 2 trial (NCT0 0494234) of single agent olaparib in patients with breast cancer with BRCA1/2 mutation and advanced disease, investigated two dose levels (cohort 1: 400 mg twice daily [bd] and cohort 2: 100 mg bd) and demonstrated an ORR of 42% and 25%, respectivel y. Pro gression free survival (PFS) was 5.7 and 3.8 months for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectivel y. A phase I study of niraparib (NCT00749502; 30 400 mg once a day ) for treatment of solid tumors resulted in an ORR of 40% in patients with breast cancer with gBRCA mutat ions vs. 18% in the general breast cancer population.16Lastly , a first in human trial of oral talazoparib (NCT01286987; 25 1100 ug/day ) resulted in an ORR of 65% and 33% in solid tumors of gBRCA patients with ovarian cancer or breast cancer, respectivel y.17 Olaparib, which was approved by the FDA in 2014 for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with gBRCA mutations, was also assessed during a Phase 3 study (OlympiAD ) in metastatic gBRCA mutated breast cancer. This trial included patients with HER2 negative, metastatic breast cancer that were either HR positive or triple negative; a subgroup of the patient population (approximately 50%) were defined as TNBC. In the OlympiAD study , 205 patients with gBRCA mutated breast cancer were treated with olaparib (300 mg orally twice dail y), compared to 91 patients (6 were not treated) treated with physician’s choice of chemotherap y (capecitabine, vinorelbine, or eribulin). Se venty -one percent had been previously treated with anthracy cline and a taxane in either an adjuvant or metastatic setting. Eligible patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to1; gBRCA1/2 mutations; and histologically or cy tologically confirmed breast cancer with evidence of metastatic disease. Prior exposure to platinum was allowed, as long as no breast cancer progression occurred on treatment or if given in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting at least 12 months before study commencement (28%). The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.58 (95% CI ; range 0.43 to 0.80; p<0.001; median of 7 months in the olaparib group vs. 4.2months in the chemotherap y group). The objective response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib arm vs. 28.8% in the treat ment of ph ysician’s choice (TPC) arm. Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 36.6% and 50.5% of the olaparib and TPC arms, respectivel y. Mean change from baseline in global health- related quality of life (HRQoL, EORTC -QLQ -C30) across all timepoints fa vored olaparib (difference vs TPC 7.5; 95% CI 2.48, 12.44; p=0.0035) .59 In summary , olaparib provided significant benefit over standard therap y among patients with gBRCA muatated breast cancer. The data for tala zoparib in TNBC patients with gBRCA positive mutations are detailed in Section 1.3.1 ."

Summary of Relevant Clinical Experience with Talazoparib Talazoparib is a potent and specific inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 that play important roles in DNA repair .60,61 PARP inhibitors exert cy totoxic effects by 2 mechanisms: inhibition of PARP cataly tic activity and PARP trapping. Inhibition of PARP cataly tic activity results in persistent single strand DNA breaks that require homologous recombination mediated DNA repair for survival. PARP trapping prevents a talazoparib bound PARP protein complex from readil y dissociat ing from DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA repair, replication, and transcription, resulting in double strand DNA breaks and consequent cy totoxicity .62PARP inhibitors induce sy nthetic lethality in tumor cells that b ear mutations and/or deletions in genes involved in homologous recombination or other DNA repair pathways. In BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient cells, treatment with a PARP inhibitor results in cell cy cle arrest and apoptosis .63 Talazoparib is more potent at inducing single agent sy nthetic lethalit y of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficient tumor cells in vitro than an y other PARP inhibitors reported to date .64 Talazoparib inhibited gro wth of MX 1 human breast cancer cells (BRCA1 deficient) and Capan 1 pancreatic cancer cells (BRCA2 deficient), with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.3 nM and 5.0 nM, respectively .65 Thetalazopar ib IC50 for growth inhibition of Capan 1cells was 50 to >2000 fold lower than the other PARP inhibitors tested. This superior cytotoxicity profile is potentially linked to the robust PARP trapping activity of talazoparib. Consistent with its cy totoxic e ffects in tissue culture studies, talazoparib demonstrated antitumor activity in xenograft tumor models. Talazoparib administered at 0.33 mg/kg/day inhibited the growth of BRCA1 mutant MX 1 breast cancer xenografts in mice, while the same model proved ref ractory to olaparib administered at 100 mg/kg/day . These in vitro and in vivo activities suggest that talazoparib may have clinical activity in patients with BRCA mutated breast cancer. As of 30 Nov 2017, (the cutoff date for the most recent Development S afety Update Report) ,66approximately 798 patients have received talazoparib in company sponsored studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Studies in solid tumors include a Phase 1 study (PRP -001) i n advanced or recurrent solid tumors, a Phase 1 study in advanced malignancies (PRP -002), a Phase 2 study (673 -201, C3441008, ABRAZO) in locally advanced and/or metastatic patients with breast cancer with a germline BRCA defect, a Phase 3 study (673 -301, E MBRACA) in locall y advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a germline BRCA defect, a Phase 1 hepatic impairment study (MDV3800- 02), a Phase 1 absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) stud y (MDV3800 -03), a Phase 1 study on cardiac re- polarization (MDV3800 -14), a Phase 1 renal impairment study (NCT02997163), and a Phase 2 response rate study in men with DNA repair defects and metastatic castration- resistant prostate cancer (TALAPRO -1). In Stud y PRP -001, a Phase 1, first -in-human, single -arm, open -label dose -escalation study of once dail y talazoparib (BMN 673) in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors with DNA repair deficiencies, a total of 110 patients were treated with talazoparib at doses ranging from 0.025 to 1.1 mg/day . During the dose -escalation phase of the study , 2of the 6 patients enrolled in the talazoparib 1.1 mg/day dose level experienced a dose -limiting toxicity : one was Grade 4 thrombocy topenia, the other was Grade 3 thrombocy topenia"

Therefore, 1 mg/day was considered the maximum tolerated dose and recommended Phase 2 dose. Between the dose -escalation and dose-expansion portions of the study , a total of 77 patients were treated with talazoparib at the 1 mg/day dose level in Stu dy PRP -001 which was generall y well tolerated and warranted further evaluation in patients with solid tumors with DNA repair deficiencies. As a result, talazoparib has been dosed at 1 mg/day in subsequent studies in patients with solid tumors, including t he breast cancer studies ABRAZO, EMBRACA, and currentl y ongoing investigator -initiated research. The first indication for talazoparib is expected to be in patients with deleterious germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and HER2 negative locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer, pending results of study (673 -301, EMBRACA). Studies include a phase 1 study (PRP -001) in advanced or recurrent solid tumors, a study (PRP -002) in patients with hematologic malignancies, a Phase 2 study (673 -201, ABRAZO) in loca lly advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer, and a Phase 3 study (673 -301, EMBRACA) in locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer. Results from company -sponsored studies are summarized in the following sections. 1.3.1. Efficacy Aphase 1 clinical study supports the efficacy of talazoparib at 1 mg/day . PRP-001 is a phase 1, open- label, safet y, pharmacokinetics, and dose -escalation (0.025-1.1 mg/day ) and expansion (1 mg/day ) study of talazoparib monotherapy in110patients with advanced or recurrent solid t umors with DNA repair deficiencies. As of the data cutoff date of 31 Jan 2018, objective responses (complete response [CR] or partial response per revised response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECI ST)1.1 were observed in 7 of 14 patients (50%) wi th breast cancer and 5 of 12 patients (41.7%) with ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer with deleterious germline BRCA mutations; clinical benefit (CR, PR, or stable disease 24weeks) was observed in 12 of 14 patients (85.7%) and 8of 12 patients (66.7%), re spectivel y. Study 673-201 (ABRAZO) is a Phase 2, 2- stage, 2 -cohort stud y of talazoparib in patients with germline BRCA mutation and locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer. ABRAZO is investigating the clinical efficacy and safet y of single -agen t talazoparib in 83heavily pre-treated gBRCA positive patients with advanced breast cancer. The primary endpoint was ORR by independent radiology review. Cohort 1 consisted of 49 patients who previously responded to platinum -based chemotherap y and subse quentl y developed disease progression. A 21% ORR (95% confidence interval [CI ]: 10-35) was observed in this group of patients. Cohort 2 consisted of 35 patients who developed disease progression following at least three lines of non -platinum -based therap y. This group of patients had a 37% ORR (95% CI : 22 to 55). Safety data for talazoparib as monotherapy are available from Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies in patients with advanced cancer. As of 31 January 2018, the confirmed objective response rate (CRs and pRs) was 20.8% for cohort 1 (prior platinum treatment, 95% confidence interval: 10.47, 34.99), including 2 CRs (4.2%), and 37.1% for Cohort 2 (3+L, non- prior platinum treatment, 95% CI: 21.47, 55.08) per independent central radiology assessment. The objective response rate across both cohorts was 27.7% (95% CI : 18.45,"

TNBC/HR positive incidence in Cohorts 1 and 2was 59%/41% and 17% /83%, respectivel y; while ORR by IRF for TNBC/HR positive was 26%/29%, respectivel y.47 Aggregate safet y data from 502 patients treated with open -label 1 mg/day talazoparib monotherap y (PRP -001, 673-201, 673-301, MDV3800- 13, and MDV3800- 14); data as of 31January 2018) provide the basis for the most common treatment emergent AEs in patients with solid tumors. The most common AEs associated with talazoparib (>20%) were myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia), gastr ointestinal toxicity (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation), fatigue, alopecia, headache, and decreased appetite. The most common (>5%) Grade 3 or 4 AEs and SAEs were associated with m yelosuppression. A total of 23 of 502 patients had a AE that led to death (8 associated with malignancies [1 pancreatic carcinoma patient; the other 7 malignancies were due to disease progression: 3 ovarian cancer patients, 2 breast cancer patients, and 1 metastatic breast cancer patient with bronchopneumonia]; 2 dyspnea ; 2 general phy sical health deterioration; 3 disease progression; and 1 each lung infection, cerebral hemmorage, cerebrovascular incident, fatigue, liver disorder, neurological sy mptoms, respiratory failure, and veno -occlusive liver disease). Of these, on ly the latter (reported in one patient in study 673-301) was assessed as related to stud y drug b y the investigator. The permanent discontinuation rate was relativel y low (20 of 502 patients, 4%) due to AEs of anemia, increased ALT and accidental overdose, increased AST, brad ycardia, metastatic breast cancer, cerebral hemorrage, dy spnea, glioblastoma multiforme, headache, metastases to meninges, muscular weakness, neutropenia, obstructive airway s disorder, thrombocy topenia, transient ischemic attack, and vomiting. Another study in the advanced breast cancer setting conducted by Litton et al. was recentl y published in the New England Journal of Medicine.21,22 This study (EMBRACA, NCT01945775) was a randomized, open- label, Phase 3 trial in which patients with advanced breast cancer and a germline BRCA1/2 mutation were assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive talazoparib (1 mg once daily ) or standard single- agent therap y of th e physician’s choice (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine in continuous 21 -day cycles). The primary endpoint was progression- free survival. Of the 431 patients who underwent randomization, 287 were assigned to receive talazoparib and 144 were assigned to receive standard therap y. Progression- free survival was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard -therapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.71; p<0.001; medians 8.6 mont hs vs. 5.6 months). The hazard ratio for overall survival based on interim analy sis at the time of the final progression -free survival analysis was 0.76 (95% CI , 0.55 to 1.06; p=0.11 [57% of projected events]; medians 22.3 months vs. 19.5 months). The objective response rate was higher in the talazoparib group than in the standard- therap y group (62.6% vs. 27.2%; odds ratio, 5.0; 95% CI , 2.9 to 8.8; p<0.001). In all clinically -relevant subgroups, a consistent PFS benefit in favor of talazoparib was observ ed in comparison with phy sician’s choice of treatment (PCT), regardless of hormone receptor status (hormone receptor positive [HR positive ]: hazard ratio 0.47, 95% CI , 0.32 to 0.70; or TNBC: hazard ratio 0.60, 95% CI , 0.41 to 0.87) BRCA mutation subty pe, h istory of central nervous s ytem (CNS) metastasis, visceral/non- visceral"

Complete response was seen in 5.5% of patients with talazoparib therap y vs zero patients receiving PCT, and partial response was seen in 57.1% vs 27.2%, respectively . In an exploratory analysis, time to end of first post -study therapy was longer with talazopari b(hazard ratio 0.68; 95% CI ; 0.51 to 0.91). In terms of hematologic toxicities, 8 of 20 (40%) patient s had Grade 3 anemia. There were no patients with Grade 4 anemia. There was one case of Grade 4 thrombocy topenia. Neutropenia occurred in 4 patients at Grade 2 (20%) and Grade 3 in 3 (15%) patients. Talazoparib was generally well tolerated, and few adv erse events (excluding progressive disease) led to permanent treatment discontinuation (5.9% in talazoparib arm vs 8.7% in PCT). Most non -hematologic toxicities were lower -grade, and the more common hematologic toxicities were managed b y dose interruption or dose reduction and supportive care as needed. An investigator -initiated research (IIR) stud y at MD Anderson Cancer Center titled “Neoadjuvant Talazoparib for Patients With a BRCA Deleterious Mutation” explored the feasibility of neoadjuvant talazopar ib in a two part study (NCT02282345). Part 1, which evaluated a lead -in of 2 months of talazoparib single agent followed b y standard chemotherap y and surgery , is complete and was accepted for publication in NPJ Breast Cancer.23 Decreases in tumor volume (as assessed by the Investigator) occurred in 13 out of 13patients following 2 months of talazoparib monotherap y (1mg). The median tumor volume decrease after 2 months of treatment with talazoparib was 88% (r ange of 30- 98%). Notably , all TNBC patients achieved either RCB -0 or RCB -1 following completion of the protocol assigned therapy and surgery . In this pilot study , talazoparib was well tolerated with no Grade 4 or 5 toxicities observed, and onl y one patie nt required dose reduction due to Grade 3 neutropenia. Following these data on efficacy and tolerability , Part 2 of the study was opened and evaluated 24 weeks of talazoparib monotherap y followed by surgery with no additional chemotherap y. This part of t he study enrolled 20 patients total who received talazoparib monotherap y for 6 months followed by surgery and assessment of pCR. All patients were BRCA positive and the majority was stage 2 or 3; most patients had triple negative breast cancer. pCR to si ngle agent talazoparib were 10/19 = 53%, (95% CI = 32%, 73%). Residual Cancer Burden was also evaluated: RCB 0 (no RCB) + RCB 1 (minimal residual disease) was 12/19 = 63%, 95% CI = 41%, 81%. TNBC/HR positive incidence in Cohorts 1 and 2 was 59%/41% and 17%/83%, respectively ; while ORR by IRF for TNBC/HR positive was 26%/29%, respectivel y.54 There were 14 patients in the TNBC cohort. Of those patients, 7 (50%) patients had RCB -0, 1 (7.4%) patient had RCB -1, 4(28.5%) patients had RCB -2 and 2 (14.2%) patients had RCB -3. Of note, pCR occurred in both metaplastic carcinoma and lobular carcinoma. Talazoparib was well tolerated with acceptable adherence and manageable toxicities. For non -hematologic toxicities, most were Grade 1 and 2. The most common toxicities occurring in >50% of patients were nausea, fatigue, and alopecia. Nineteen (19) of 20patients completed 6 months of therap y; one patient completed 5 months and then received chemotherap y prior to surge ry. Two patients had dose reductions to 0.75 mg,"
44,page_44,"Talazoparib (PF -06944076; MDV3800) C3441020 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 14 August 2019 PFIZER C ONFIDENTIAL Page 456patients reduced to 0.5 mg, and one patient had a dose reduction to 0.25 mg. All dose reductions were due to hematologic toxicities. The findings from this study demonstrate promising efficacy for talazo parib in the neo-adjuvant gBRCA positive earl y breast cancer setting. Talazoparib is the first single targeted therap y to achieve pCR in BRCA positive patients, including TNBC. This study warrants the larger confirmatory trial (C3441020). 1.3.2. Pharmacokinetic s and Metabolism The PK of talazoparib as a single agent was evaluated in 142 adult patients with cancer, including 109 patients with solid tumors (PRP -001) and 33 with hematologic malignancies (PRP -002). Doses of 0.025 mg to 2 mg were administered orally as a single dose or as once -daily doses . This dose range bracketed the 1 mg/day dose used in ongoing safet y and efficacy studies and provided a framework for assessing dose linearit y. As the PK of talazoparib was similar in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and no differences were apparent between males and females, the results are summarized collectively . Oral absorption of talazoparib was rapid and independent of dose after administration of single or once -daily doses. Peak ta lazoparib concentrations were generall y reached approximately 1to 8hours post -dose. Exposure increased approximately dose-proportionall y with increasing doses. At 1 mg/day, the mean half-life was approximately 2days; the mean apparent volume of distri bution (V/F) was 415 L, which may suggest extensive extravascular distribution. Steady state was reached in approximately 2to 3weeks with dail y administration. Apparent oral clearance (CL /F) of talazoparib appeared to be dose linear, with a mean CL /F across doses of approximately 5liters per hour (L/h). Renal excretion was a major elimination pathway for unchanged parent talazoparib. Following oral administration, 44% to 90.6% of the dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent drug over 24 hours at steady state for doses up to 1 mg/day . Mean renal clearance ranged from 1.38 L/h to 4.96 L/h independent of dose, suggesting linear urinary elimination kinetics. A preliminary population PK analy sis using data from patients in studies PRP -001 and PRP-002 assessed the effects of renal function on the PK of talazoparib. The t alazoparib CL/F in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CL CR] 60-89mL/min) was similar compared with patients with normal renal function ( CL CR90mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment ( CL CR30-59mL/min), the talazoparib CL /F was decreased b y 44% from normal, resulting in higher talazoparib exposure. Talazoparib does not induce or inhibit cy tochrome P450 (CYP) enzy mes or transporters and is therefore unlikely to demonstrate drug drug interaction liabilities. However, talazoparib is a substrate for P -gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). In a clinical drug drug interaction study , coadministration of talazoparib with a strong P gp a nd BCRP inhibitor (itraconazole) resulted in a 50% increase in talazoparib exposure (AUC 24), while coadministration of talazoparib with an inducer (rifampin) caused no change in exposure."

Talazoparib does not cross the blood brain barrier, so neurops ychiatric adverse events are not expected. Talazoparib is not mutagenic, but similar to other PARP inhibitors, is clastogenic in vitro in peripheral blood ly mphocy tes and in vivo in a rat b one marrow micronucleus assay . The inhibition of the PARP cataly tic activity is potentially linked to the clastogenic activity of talazoparib. In line with its clastogenic property, talazoparib caused fetal malformations, structural variations, and death in an embry o fetal development study in rats. The main nonclinical toxicology findings at subtherapeutic exposures of talazoparib were hematologic changes including pancy topenia, bone marrow hy pocellularit y, and lymphoid depletion. Findings in reproducti ve organs were focal atroph y and degenerative changes in the testes, epididy mis, and seminiferous tubules. Additional changes included dose dependent apoptosis/necrosis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, ovarian follicular atresia, and liver after repeat dose administration of talazoparib. The findings in the ovary were observed at greater than 5 -fold clinical margin. These findings are consistent with the exaggerated pharmacology of talazoparib and its tissue exposure pattern. The hematologic findings were generall y reversible and the earl y hematologic changes represent sensitive and earl y markers of target organ toxicity . 1.3.3. Rationale for Talazoparib Dose The doses of talazoparib in this protocol are supported by nonclinical studies and phase 1 studies in patients with advanced malignancies. Antitumor activity has been observed and warrants further exploration in a larger patient population. The expected adverse events with talazoparib include my elosuppression, gastrointestinal toxicity , and fatigue. Hepatotoxicity , febrile neutropenia, and neutropenic sepsis are potential risks per the investigator brochure, Section 7. The activity of talazoparib as monotherapy and in combination with ot her agents is being evaluated in multiple indications. Talazoparib has demonstrated efficacy at a dose of 1 mg/day . Talazoparib 1 mg/day orally will be administered until completion of protocol assigned therap y, unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of consen t, or death. For patients with moderate renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 30 -59 mL /min/1.73 m2) at screening, the starting dose will be 0.75 mg/day . The dose of 1 mg /day has been established as the recommended dose for adults with solid tumors in study PRP -001 (NCT01286987). Subsequently this dose has been used as the starting dose in studies 673- 201 (ABRAZO), MDV3800 -14, and 673-301 (EMBRACA) with a total number of approximately 403 patients having received talazoparib at 1 mg/ day . 1.4.Rationale for Study Approximately 15% of all breast cancers are triple negative. They can be defined by the lack of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. They are more commonl y associated with younger women, pre -menopausal women of African American race and BRCA1 mutation carriers. Triple negative cancers are generall y more aggressive in nature and associated with visceral and soft tissue disease."

The prevalence of genetic mutations also differed by age at diagnosis, with most patients <40 y ears (43.8 %) of age. Various studies have demonstrated that triple negative breast cancers are associated with a poorer prognosis than luminal breast cancers. A Canadian series, including approximately 1600 triple negative cancers conducted b y Dent, R et al.8demonstrated worse long term outcomes in terms of dista nt recurrence and death in triple negative tumors compared to non-triple negative tumors. The standard of treatment for neoadjuvant treatment is variable, but mostly focuses on the use of anthracy cline -taxane regimens. Other regimens used include adriam ycin plus cyclophosphamide (AC). Cy clophosphamide methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) is another option which offers less toxicity , however has a longer duration of therapy . Platinum therapies have also shown efficacy in HER2 negative breast cancer , in particular germline BRCA mutant tumors as these tumors have defects in homologous recombination rendering them more susceptible to DNA cross linking agents such as platinums. The Geparsixto and CALGB trials examined the efficacy of adding platinum to neoad juvant regimens in triple negative breast cancer. In GeparSixto, the pCR rates (breast/axilla) increased from 36.9% to 53.2% and in the BRCA subgroup an increase in pCR by 25% ( p=0.005). The CALGB/Alliance trial showed an increase in pCR with the additi on of carboplatin for breast/axilla (54% vs 41%; p=0.0029). Since these studies were underpowered for long term outcome, it is difficult to assess long term benefit. Therefore, the role for platinum therapy in TNBC still remains unclear and warrants further investigation in larger trials with examination of long term outcomes. There have been studies resulting in improved disease -free survival (DFS) in patients who achieved pCR with platinum agents and BRCA mutation. Frasci et al.11reported that in TNBC patients treated with eight cisplatin epirubicin paclitaxel weekly cycles, 62% showed pCR in both breast and axilla, and the projected 5 year DFS was 90% and 56% in pCRs and non pCRs, respectively . The BRCA1 gene is expressed in several tissues, such as breast and ovarian tissue. Currently , more than 1600 mutations have been identified in the BRCA1 gene, and the majority of them promote frameshifts resulting in missense or non -functional protein. Women with BRCA1 mutations have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer, while men have a higher risk, to a lesser extent, of developing prostate cancer.12 BRCA2 does not share a high degree of sequence homology with other known genes, and the generated protein is comprised of regions with domains that are undefined.13 Currently , more than 1800 mutations have been identified in BRCA2, that include frameshift d eletions, insertions, or nonsense mutations that lead to premature truncation of proteins."

PARP inhibitors induce sy nthetic lethality in tumor cells containing mutations and/or deletions in genes involved in homologous replication or other DNA pathway s, including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Clinical trials have shown that PARPi are beneficial in the treatment of patients that are carriers of germline BRCA mutations. Talazoparib is a potent, orally bioavailable, small molecule PARP inhibitor in development for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. Single agent talazoparib treatment demonstrates potent antitumor effects in tissue culture studies, mouse tumor xenograft models, and in Phase 1 stu dies in patients with solid tumors. Talazoparib has also been shown to enhance the cytotoxic effects of DNA damaging chemotherapy .18,19 Despite advances in the underst anding of the biology of gBRCA associated TNBC, treatment options remain limited. PARPi, as well as platinum- based combination therapies, have emerged as regimens of potential interest and in particular therap y with single agent PARPi could present signif icant advantages of chemotherapy regimens through potentially improved tolerability . The PARP inhibitor olaparib, which was approved by the FDA in 2014 for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with gBRCA mutations was assessed during a Phase 3 study (OlympiAD) in metastatic gBRCA mutated breast cancer. PFS was 7 months in the olaparib group vs. 4.2 months in the chemotherapy group (observed hazard ratio=0.58; 95% CI , 0.43 to 0.80; p=0.009). The objective response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib arm vs. 28.8% in the chemotherapy arm. Olaparib was determined to be effective against triple -negative breast cancers that arise in women with inherited, germline BRCA mutations (observed hazard ratio in the TNBC subgroup = 0.43). The Phase 2 ABRAZO study21(NCT02034916), presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017, demonstrated clinical activity of single agent talazoparib in advanced triple negative, germline BRCA mutant breast cancer. T alazoparib (1 mg/day ) was administered following platinum -based therap y (Cohort 1) or  3platinum -free cytotoxic -based regimens (Cohort 2) in TNBC, gBRCA1/2 mutation patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cance r. TNBC/HR positive incidence in Cohort 1 a nd Cohort 2 was 59%/41% and 17%/83%, respectively . ORR by IRF for BRCA1/BRCA2 was 24%/34%, and ORR by IRF for TNBC/HR positive was 26%/29%. Talazoparib was well-tolerated in both cohorts."

The stud y schematic is provided in Figure 1. Patients will be evaluated at screening for the presence of a deleterious, suspected deleterious, or patho genic germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation .Long term follow -up period is at least 5 years, which starts from the date of surgery for EFS and after first dose of drug for OS. Presence of germline BRCA1/2 mutation will confirmed b y a local CLIA (Clinical L aboratory Improvement Amendments) certified test. Germline DNA from blood will alsobe tested centrally for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 using a BRACAnal ysisCDx test (My riad Genetics), except for those patients who alread y have evidenc e of gBRCA1/2 mutation by MyriadBRCAnaly sisCDx post 2016. For all patients, disease status will be assessed at screening b y computed tomograph y (CT) scans (chest, abdomen, pelvis) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of distant metastases. For all patients, hemato logy and serum chemistry samples will be collected every 2weeks on Cycles1 and 2 and Day 1 of each cy cle for cC ycles3 to 6. Other general and laboratory assessments will be performed at regular intervals throughout the stud y according to the Schedule of Activities (Table 1). All patients entered on the trial will receive neoadjuvant talazoparib 1 mg/day PO for 24 weeks, with the exception of patients with baseline moderate renal impair ment (as defined by an eGFR  30 and <60 mL /min/1.73m2) who will receive a starting dose of 0.75 mg/day of talazoparib; followed b y surgery and assessment of pCR. For all patients, study drug treatment should continue until completion of protocol assigned therap y, followed b y surgery unless the patient is no longer clinicall y benefitting in the opinion of the investigator, there is unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of consent, or death. Dosing interruptions are permitted for a period of 28 day s to allow r ecovery from drug related toxicities. Patients who receive less than 80% of the prescribed talazoparib dose during the neoadjuvant treatment period will not be evaluable. Patients will undergo definitive breast surgery within 6 weeks of the last dose of talazoparib. Tumors must be removed by either lumpectom y or mastectom y with clinically appropriate axillary surgery . Any involved axillary nodes should be marked with a metallic indicator or other standard approach before s ystemic therapy to ensure their removal at the time of definitive surgery as recommended by FDA guidances.50For patients with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes, sentinel ly mph node biopsy , using institutional procedures such as dual blue d ye or radioisotope tracers, should be performed at the time of definitive surgery and include resection of at least two nodes whenever possible.15,67 The surgical specimens (breast and axillary lymph node tissue) will be sent to the central lab as soon as possible for evaluation of pCR (defined per protocol) by central Pathologists at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Any further post- operative therapy , either local or systemic wi ll be at the discretion of the treating ph ysician. A post -surgical follow up visit will take place after 4 weeks of surgery ."

Contraception In this stud y, fertile male patients and female patients who are of childbearing potential as applicable to the study will receive talazoparib, which has been associated with teratogenicit y/fetotoxicity in preclinical studies. Talazoparib is clastogenic in nonclinical genetic toxicological evaluations. Talazoparib also caused fetal malformations, structural variations, and death in an embry o fetal development study in rats. Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use a of highl y effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 7 or 4months for females and males, respectively, after the last dose of IP. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the patient, will confirm that the patient has selected a highl y effective method of contraception for the individual patien t (and his or her partner) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the patient has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Sche dule of Activities, the investigator or designee will inform the patient of the need to use a highl y effective method of contraception consistentl y and correctly and document the conversation and the subject’s affirmation in the patient’s chart. I n addit ion, the investigator or designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the partner. Highly effective methods of contraception are those t hat, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctl y (ie, perfect use). All sexually active male subjects must agree to prevent potential transfer to and exposure of partner(s) to drug through ejaculate b y using a condom consistently and correctl y, beginning with the first dose of IP and continuing for at least 4 months after the last dose of talazoparib. Contraception should be considered for a nonpregnant female partner of childbearing potential."

Women of Childbearing Potential (WCBP) Definition A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanentl y sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a me nstrual cy cle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WCBP: 1.Premenarchal . 2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: Documented h ysterectomy ; Documented bilateral salpingectomy ; Documented bilateral oophorectom y. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion shoul d be applied to determining study entry . Note: Documentation for any of the above conditions can come from the site personnel’s review of the patient’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the patient’s medical record for the study . 3.Postmenopausal female . A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 or older or no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the p ostmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-estrogen hormon al highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before stud y enrollment."

To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and I P identifiers, patient study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the ev ent that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patient’s participation in the study . The contact number can also be used b y inv estigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore inten ded to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study .The contact number is not intended for use by the patient directly , and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study , and per International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) guidelines, IP is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 [I CH E6 1.33]). For this study , the IP is talazoparib. 5.1.Allocation to Treatment Allocation of patients to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [I WR]). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or s elect information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, randomization number (although non- randomized, a randomization number is still required for all patients to reconcile and merge separated data files), and the patient number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when IP is being supplied via the I RT system. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containing the patient number and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system."

Patients will record the daily administration of the study drug (talazoparib). Data entered in the diary will be c ompared with drug accountability done at the site prior to dispensing additional study drug. In the event of unexplained discrepancies, drug accountability data will prevail in determining patients’ degree of compliance, which will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). Patients will be considered out of compliance if >20% of monthl y doses are missed. 5.3.Investigational Product Supplies 5.3.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Talazoparib drug product will be supplied as 2 clinical dosage strengths of 0.25 mg or 1 mg, calculated relative to the talazoparib free base, for oral administration. Depending on the prescribed dose, patients may take two 0.25 mg capsules for the 0.5 mg dose, or three 0.25 mg capsules for the 0.75 mg dose. The drug substance is a 4 meth ylbenzenesulfonate (tosy late) salt of talazoparib free base, the active moiety . The drug product consists of talazoparib tosy late drug substance formulated with silicified microcry stalline cellulose (SMCC) filled into hy droxy propyl methy lcellulose (HPMC) as immediate release capsules. The drug product should be stored at room temperature (15 to 30°C; 59 to 86°F). The capsules are supplied in induction- sealed high -density poly ethylene (HDPE) bottles. 5.3.2. Preparation and Dispensing Talazoparib will be dispensed using an Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IWRS) drug management s ystem every 4 weeks through week 24. A qualified staff member will dispense the IP via unique container numbers in bottle(s) provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The patient/caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in the bottle(s) provided throughout the course of dosing and return the bottle to the site at the next study visit. 5.4.Administration Talazoparib will be self -administered b y mouth at approximately the same time each day outside the clinic, except on day s when PK is assessed; patients will withhold their dose until after the pre -dose PK blood sample is drawn. Talazoparib can be administered with or without food. Patients will swallow the IP whole, and will not manipulate or chew the IP prior to swallowing. Patients should not make up missed or vomited doses; dosing should resume on the next calendar day unless otherwise instructed. Daily dosing of talazoparib can be interrupted for rec overy from toxicity for up to 28 day s. Thereafter, treatment at the same or a reduced dose can be considered based on a discussion between sponsor or designee and Investigator if the patient has not developed progressive disease. Dose modifications should be made based on observed toxicity as follows:"

Re-challenge with talazoparib following liver test abnormalities is not permitted if these abnormalities are accompanied with signs or s ymptoms consistent with drug -induced liver toxicity or meet permanent discontinuation criteria. Re-challenge with talazoparib may be considered at a 0.25 mg/day reduction if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, TBili) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. The investigator and sponsor should discuss and agree with any d ecision to rechallenge an y of the assigned stud y drugs. Following re -challenge, patients should be closely monitored for signs and sy mptoms of hepatitis and/or abnormal liver test results. Study drug treatment should be permanentl y discontinued permanently if any of the following criteria are met: Patients with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available (Note: in the presence of elevated alkaline phosphatase associated with bone metastases, gamma glutam yl transferase [GGT] should be tested and the results should be within the reference range); For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:"

Talazoparib is considered a cy totoxic and clastogenic agent; precautions regarding appropriate secure storage and handling must be used by healthcare professionals, including personal protective clothing, disposable gloves, and equipment. Patients should be advised that oral anticancer agents (ie, talazoparib) are toxic substances and that other caregivers should alway s use gloves when handling the capsules. IPs should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Any storage conditions stated in the talazoparib SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a l og), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products). This should be captured from the time of IP receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for exam ple, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue option s for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the IP must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the I P. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the IP after the temperature excursion. Use of the IP prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions. Site staff will instruct patients on the proper storage requirements for take home I Ps."

All I P will be a ccounted for using a drug accountability form/record. All bottles of study drug must be returned to the investigator by the patient at every visit and at the end -of-treatment visit. Patients who do not return bottles at the end-of-treatment visit will be reminded to bring them at their next visit. 5.6.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused I P (eg, at the site).

The start date, stop date, and indication for concomitant treatments and/or therapies and medications receive d from screening until end of treatment will be recorded on the CRF. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES 6.1.Screening See Table 1for screening procedures. Screening for gBRCA1/2 Mutations : If positive gBRCA1/2 status has been confirmed by a local CLIA certified test, patients may enroll and commence study treatment, provided all other inclusion/exclusion criteria are met and screening tests have been satisfactorily completed. A blood sample must be sent to MyriadGenetics for central testing (BRACAna lysisCDx test), except for those patients who alread y have evidenc e of gBRCA1/2 mutation by MyriadBRACAnal ysisCDx post 2016. In the event of discrepant results, where the local BRCA test is positive for gBRCA1/2 mutation and the central M yriad BRACAnaly sis test is negative, the decision on further trial continuation will be decided by the investigator and discussed with the sponsor based on a risk- benefit evaluation. 6.2.Treatment Period See Table 1for treatment procedures. 6.3.Safety Follow -up For safet y follow- up procedures after the treatment period, see Table 1. Safet y follow-up will occur a minimum of 28 calendar day s after the last dose of study drug or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therap y (whichever occurs first) to capture any potential AEs (see the Time Period for Collecting Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event I nformation section). Contact with the patient for AE follow -up may be done via phone call if the patient does not come to the site. There will be an additional post- surgical follow up 4 weeks after surgery . 6.4.Long Term Follow -up For long -term follow -up procedures after the treatment period, see Table 1. This period begins after sur gery for EFS and after first dose of talazoparib for OS. Survival status can be obtained by any means including telephone, during a visit, chart review, or contact with someone who is knowledgeable of the patient’s survival status (eg, relative, friend, r eferring"

If allowed by local laws and regulations, survival status may be obtained from public records for patients withdrawing consent from the study or for patients lost to follow -up. 6.5.Patient Withdrawal Withdrawal of consent : Patients who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow- up procedures. The only exception to this is when a patient specifically withdraws consent for any further c ontact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this information. Patients should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of I P or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the patient is alive or dead) is being measured, publicl y available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. Lost to follow- up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate patients to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow -up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the patient after a minimum of 2 documented phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response b y the subject to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical records. If it is determined that the patient has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. I f the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the patient’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly avai lable sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. I f, after all attempts, the patient remains lost to follow -up, then the last -known- alive date as determined by the investigator should be report ed and documented in the patient’s medical records. Patients may withdraw from the study at an y time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Patient Withdrawal section) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol -required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site."

This includes follow- up with persons authorized by the patient. “Lost to follow -up” is defined b y the inability to reach the patient after a minimum of 2 doc umented phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response by the patient to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the patient’s medical record and CRF. If it is determined that the patient has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow- up portion of the study has been includ ed in the patient’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor -retained third- party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the patient’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If, after all attempts, the patient remains lost to follow-up, then the contact date should be reported and documented in the patient’s medical records and CRF. In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y AEs. If the patient withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator upon consultation with the sponsor. Patients will be enrolled to account for a 10% drop -off rate. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps neces sary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the patient. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal process es are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be prov ided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study ."

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Pathological Complete Response The primary efficacy endpoint is the pathologic complete response to talazoparib after 24weeks of neoadjuvant therap y followed b y surgery . pCR will be assessed by histological examination of the post -surgical specimen b y ICR. The post -surgical specimen should be sent to the central lab as soon as possible. Further details can be found in the laboratory manual. 7.3.2. Assessment of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The seconda ry endpoints include pCR by investigator, RCB, pCR (in breast), EFS at 3 years and OS at 3 y ears. The study assessments of efficacy for these endpoints (RCB by ICR and pCR by investigator) will be assessed by histological examination of the post -surgical s pecimen. EFS and OS will be collected b y telephone follow up of patients every 12 weeks during the long term follow up period. Follow up for EFS will start from date of surgery . Follow up for OS will start from day of first dose of talazoparib. 7.4.Patient Reported Outcomes Assessments Global health status/quality of life, functioning, and sy mptoms data will be collected electronically using the EORTC QL Q-C30 and QLQ BR23 questionnaires. The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a standardized instrument that assesses cancer -specific patient -reported global quality of life, functioning, and disease/treatment-related s ymptoms. Patients will self -rate their self -care, activity level, pain/discomfort, and mental health during the past week b y choosing 1 of 4 possible responses tha t record the level of intensity (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much) within each dimension. The questionnaire also asks the patient to rate their overall health and overall quality of life within the past week on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is “very poor” and 7 is “excellent.” The QLQ -C30 questionnaire is provided in Appendix 2. The EORTC QLQ -BR23 (Breast Cancer Quality of L ife Questionnaire) is a breast cancer -specific module of the EORTC questionnaire that asses ses the functioning and symptoms of patients with breast cancer. The EORTC QL Q-BR23 functional scales consist of the 4 scales that assess body image, sexual functioning, sexual enjoy ment, and future perspective. The EORTC QL Q-BR23 s ymptom scales consist of the 4 scales that assess systemic therapy side effects, breast sy mptoms, arm sy mptoms, and upset by hair loss. Patients will choose 1 of 4 possible responses that record level of intensit y (not at all, a little, quite a bit, very much) within each dime nsion. The QLQ -BR23 module is provided in Appendix 3. For the global health status/QoL , functional and sy mptom scores in EORTC QL Q-C30 and QLQ -BR23, a 10 point change from baseline will be used to indicate clinically meaningf ul change .68"

Adverse Events The pr ocedures for the investigator assessment of adverse events are presented in Section 8 . 7.9.2. Physical Examinations Physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Activities . At screening, this will constitute an assessment of s ystems (eg, general appearance, head, ey es, ears, nose, mouth, throat, skin, heart, lung, l ymph nodes, gastrointestinal, genitourinary , neurologic, and skeletal). During treatment, s ystems will be assessed per standard of care at the study site or as clinically indicated by symptoms. A clinical exam of breast and axilla should be included in each phy sical exam. I f the patient has evidence of clinical disease progression, treatment on study should be discontinued. These patients should either switch to alternate s ystemic therapy or go straight to surgery so as not to preclude potentially curative surgery . 7.9.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements (blood pressure, hear t rate, and temperature) and weight will be assessed as shown in the Schedule of Activities. Height will also be measured at screening. 7.9.4. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Blood samples for hematology and serum che mistry assessments will be collected as shown in Table 1and analy zed at a central laboratory . In addition to (but not in place of) these central laboratory assessments, the I nvestigator may also collect local laboratory assessments within 3 days prior to a scheduled visit to guide decision- making at regularly scheduled visits.

Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an IP under study. I n particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow- up) information on previously forwarded reports. In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classif ication as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detaile d than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the eve nt, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a patient death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is determined b y the spon sor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE.

Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting o f SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y patient /legally acceptable representative. In addition, each stud y subject/legally acceptable representative will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Patient Withdrawal section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguishe d from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a patient withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each patient begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the patient’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing an y study -related procedure and/or receiving IP), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar day s after the last administration of the I P. For patients who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to I P must be reported to Pfizer Safet y."

If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, SAEs occurring during the above -indicated active collection period must still be reported to Pfizer Safety irrespective of any intervening treatment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events on the Case Report Form During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the recording period for non -serious AEs ends at the time th e new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the CRF during the above -indicated active collection period. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); t he investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonabl e possibility that the IP caused or contributed to an AE; generally the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the IP caused the event, then the event will be han dled as “related to I P” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to I P, this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines tha t an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting r equirements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations."

Adverse Events An AE is an y unt oward medical occurrence in a study patient administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinical ly significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; EDP; Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure. Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be recorded as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progression assessed b y measureme nt of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs."

Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , signific ant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abno rmal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Orthat is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse."

Secondary primary malignancies should be reported as an SAE. Hospitalization due to signs and s ymptoms of disease progression should no t be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the active collection period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE on the CRF, and as an SAE with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (see the Seve rity Assessment section). 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an exist ing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessaril y constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission ( eg, patient has no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y protocol);"

These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient ; Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.3. Severity Assessment Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the patient’s usual function) but would not be classifi ed as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed below. GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y 0 No change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may be used in certain circumstan ces.) 1 MILD adverse event 2 MODERATE adverse event 3 SEVERE adverse event 4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated 5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event 8.4.Special Situations 8.4.1.

Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some patients, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These patients fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Patients who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) TBili elevations (>2 ×ULN) by several day s or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/AL T is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values mi ght have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Patients who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Patients with AST/AL T and TBi libaseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For patients with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values > 2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller). Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches >3 × ULN (whichever is sma ller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor."

This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. The po ssibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary ) should be considered. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, GGT, PT/I NR, total b ile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporan eous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a co -formulated product in prescription or over-the- counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irres pective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.

Exposure to the Investigational Product during Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the I P under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfize r Safet y within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.4. Exposure during Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an EDP occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed ( eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the I P; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the IP.

In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been expos ed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will fol low the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the ti me of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings a re conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs follows: Sponta neous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the I P;"

Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preter m infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.4.4.1. Exposure during Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfize r Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.4.2. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the perfo rmance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the com pleted CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.5.

The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, an y major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their anal yses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Two anal yses are planned, including an interim and a final anal ysis. The interim anal ysis will be performed to evaluate the safet y as well as the primary endpoint (pCR) after 28evaluable patients receive talazoparib 1 mg QD for 24 weeks, followed by surgery and central assessment of pCR. The final anal ysis of the primary endpoint will be performed when the last patient en rolled who does not discontinue treatment prematurely completes talazoparib treatment 1 mg QD for 24 weeks, followed by surgery and central assessment of pCR, withdraws consent, discontinues from the study , or dies, whichever occurs first. Statistical Meth ods Analysis populations: Evaluable population is the primary anal ysis population for all efficacy endpoints at the interim analy sis as well as the final anal ysis and is defined as all patients enrolled in the study who receive 24 weeks of talazoparib trea tment 1 mg QD, undergo breast surgery and central pCR assessment or who otherwise progress or die prior to being evaluated for pCR . All efficacy analy ses will be conducted in the evaluable population unless otherwise specified in the statistical anal ysis plan. For all patients, study drug treatment should continue until completion of protocol assigned therap y, followed b y surgery unless the patient is no longer clinicall y benefitting in the opinion of the investigator, there is unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of consent, or death. Dosing interruptions are permitted for a period of 28 day s (one period up to 28 day s OR several interruptions that total a number of day s <80% of the prescribed course of treatment of 24 weeks) to allow recovery from drug relat ed toxicities. Patients who receive less than 80% of the prescribed talazoparib dose during the neoadjuvant treatment period will not be part of the evaluable population. However, patients who progress or die before pCR can be assessed (regardless of whe ther or not they received 80% of study treatment) by investigator and by ICRwill be considered non-responders in the evaluable population. The intent to treat (ITT) anal ysis and safety populations are defined as all patients enrolled in the study who rece ived at least one dose of talazoparib. All efficacy anal yses will also be reported in the ITT anal ysis population, unless otherwise specified. All safety anal yses will be reported using the safety population. Drug exposure in the safety anal ysis populat ion will be summarized using descriptive statistics. PRO analy sis population is defined as all patients who completed a baseline and at least one post baseline quality -of-life assessment prior to the end of study treatment."

For the PK anal ysis population, talazoparib concentrations will be summarized descriptively by nominal time and talazoparib do se strength. Additionally , a subgroup of PK samples which meet pre- defined steady -state acceptance criteria (as detailed in the study SAP) will be summarized by nominal time and a within -patient average talazoparib stead y state trough concentration will be listed by patient from this population. 9.1.Sample Size Determination Current standard of care in TNBC consists of chemotherapy -based regimens. Published pCR rates vary greatly from 20% to 50%. Data is limited for neoadjuvant regimens in gBRCA positive TNBC where mostly retrospective subgroup anal ysis are available54with the best chemotherap y-based regimens showing ~50% pCR rates. Also, the investigator -initiated research stud y23in neoadjuvant gBRCA positive BC where patients were treated with talazoparib monotherap y shows ~50% pCR in a HER2 negative population. Similarly , patients with gBRCA mutated hormone receptor positive breast cancer had a pCR rate of 3/5(60%) and a combined RCB 0+1 rate of 4/5 (80%).22 Although based on a limited sample size, this promising pCR rate is substantially higher than that reported for patients with hormone receptor positive earl y breast cancer who receive chemotherapy and is similar to the pCR rates obtained by adding PARP inhibitors or carboplatin to conventional chemotherap y for the treatment of patients with early TNBC.44-46These results suggest talazoparib monotherap y may benefit the gBRCA mutated hormone receptor positive subgroup of patients with early breast cancer as well. Approximately sixtypatients will be enrolled in the study and treated with talazoparib 1 mg QD for 24 weeks followed by surgery . With a sample size of 60 patients, the two -sided 80% exact Blaker CI for the pCR rate would be at most 17% wide. If a pCR=50% is observed, the lower bound of th e exact 80% CI would exclude 41%. An interim futility anal ysis, designed based on Bayesian predictive probability (PP), will be conducted once 28 evaluable patients are assessed for pCR. The PP is the probability of concluding a positive result by the end of the trial based on the cumula tive information in the current stage. The trial will be considered a success if the posterior probability that the true pCR rate exceeds 45% is ≥80%. Predictive probability <10% was set as the futility boundary and assumed a non -informative beta (1,1) p rior. Once 28 evaluable patients are assessed for pCR, if 11 responses or less are observed, the predictive probability of the trial being successful at the full sample size is less than 10%, at which point the Sponsor would recommend stopping the study due to futility . If ≥12 responses are observed in the first 28evaluable patients, the study will continue enrolling to 60 evaluable patients. In the HR positive group after 6 evaluable patients have completed treatment and undergone surgery , the pCR rate will be assessed. If 2 patients achieve pCR out of the initial 6, then the posterior probability that the true pCR rate in the HR positive group is greater than 45% would be 28.9%, assuming a non - informative Beta (0.5,0.5) prior. Therefore, if 2 or more pCRs are obser ved, the HR positive subgroup will continue to enroll. If 1 or no pCRs are observed, then closing of the HR positive subgroup will be considered.

The evaluable population is the primary anal ysis population at the interim and final anal ysis.The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who received at least one1 dose of talazoparib, regardless of whether or not they are considered evaluable. 9.2.Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary study objective is to evaluate the pCR rate by independent central review (ICR) in the evaluable population. pCR is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes on hematox ylin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen and all sampled regional l ymph nodes following completion of neoadjuvant s ystemic therapy (ie,ypT0/Tis y pN0 in the current AJCC staging s ystem ). pCR rate by ICR is defined as the number and percentage of patients achieving pCR by independent central review after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks, followed b y surgery , among all patients in the evaluable population. pCR rate by ICR will be anal yzed at the time of the interim and final analy ses and will be summarized along with the exact 80% and 95% CI . pCR rate by ICR will also be summarized in the ITT population along with exact 80% and 95% CI. Patients who discontinue treatment or study prem aturel y, are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent, progress or die before pCR can be assessed b y central review will be considered as non -responders in the ITT population analysis. For all patients, study drug treatment should continue until completion of p rotocol assigned therap y, followed b y surgery unless the patient is no longer clinicall y benefitting in the opinion of the investigator, there is unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal of consent, or death. Dosing interruptions are permitted for a period of 28 days to allow recovery from drug related toxicities. Patients who receive less than 80% of the prescribed talazoparib dose during the neoadjuvant treatment period will not be part of the evaluable population. If a patient receives less than 80% of the pr otocol required treatment, undergoes surgery and achieves pCR b y ICR, the patient will be counted as a responder in the ITT population, but will not be included in the evaluable population. 9.3.Analysis of Secondary Endpoints The following efficacy parameters will be evaluated as secondary endpoints."

Specificall y, this study is based on adequatel y performed laboratory and animal experimentation. The study will be conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by an IRB/EC/ research ethics board ( REB )and will be conducted by scientifically and medicall y qualified persons. The benefits of the stud y are in proportion t o the risks. The rights and welfare of the patients will be respected and subject participation continued as long as the Investigators conducting the study do not find the hazards to outweigh the potential benefits. Each patient, or his/her legally autho rized representative will provide written, informed consent before an y stud y-related tests or evaluations are performed."

Residual Cancer Burden The residual cancer burden is a continuous index derived from the following: primary tumor dimensions; cellulari ty of the tumor bed; axillary nodal burden. Residual cancer burden by ICR will be reported as a categorical variable with four classes (categories) RCB 0 (pCR), I (minimal RCB), II (moderate RCB), III (extensive RCB). Number and percentage of patients fo r all 4 categories in the evaluable population will be reported along with exact 95% CI . The analy sis of RCB by ICR will be conducted in the evaluable population. 9.4.2. Pathological Complete Response in Breast by Independent Central Review and Investigator pCR in breast is defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes on hematoxy lin and eosin evaluation of the complete resected breast specimen following completion of neoadjuvant therap y with talazoparib. pCR rate in b reast b y ICR is defined as the number and percentage of patients achieving pCR in breast b y independent central review after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks, followed b y surgery , among all patients in the evaluable population. pCR rate in breast b y investigator review is defined as the number and percentage of patients achieving pCR in breast by investigator review after talazoparib treatment for 24 weeks, followed b y surger y, among all patients in the evaluable population. pCR in breast rate will be summarized using descriptive statistics along with the exact 95% CI. pCR in breast rate will also be summarized in the ITT population along with exact 95% CI Patients who discontinue treatment or stud y prematurel y, are lost to follow -up, withdraw consent , progress or die before pCR in breast can be assessed, will be considered non-responders. If a patient receives less than 80% of the protocol required treatment, undergoes surgery and achieves pCR in breast, the patient will be counted as a responder in the ITT population, but will not be included in the evaluable population. 9.4.3. Event -free Survival and Event -free Survival at 3 Years EFS is defined as the time from surgery date to first documentation of local or distant recurrence or death or initiation of an tineoplastic therap y before documentation of first relapse. Patients discontinuing study before documentation of first relapse or death, but after surgery will be censored observations for EFS. Additional details regarding censoring rules will be present ed in the statistical analy sis plan."

If ≥12 responses are observed in the first 28 evaluable patients, the study will continue enrolling to 60 patients. In the HR positive group after 6 evaluable patients have completed treatment and undergone surgery , the pCR rate will be assessed. If 2 patien ts achieve pCR out of the initial 6, then the posterior probability that the true pCR rate in the HR positive group is greater than 45% would be 28.9%, assuming a non -informative Beta (0.5,0.5) prior. Therefore, if 2 or more pCRs are observed, the HR positive subgroup will continue to enroll. If 1 or no pCRs are observed, then closing of the HR positive subgroup will be considered. Interim anal ysis results may be used for internal business decisions regarding future study planning. Additional analy sis de tails will be documented in an interim analy sis SAP or final SAP. 9.10. Data Monitoring Committee This study will not use a data monitoring committee. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud yconduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/audit ors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the investigator site may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasibl e, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the patient’s medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the inve stigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process."

Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The com pleted original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investiga tor has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entrie s made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician patient chart. In these cases, data collected o n the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate doc umentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified. The study records must be transferred t o a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations."

Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the respons ibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediat e hazards to the patients. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Patient Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include patient names or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required b y law. When study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient names, addresses, and other identifiable d ata will be replaced b y numerical codes based on a numbering s ystem provided by Pfizer in order to de -identify study patients. The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study, linking each patient’s numeri cal code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patients’ personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents and an y patient recr uitment materials must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any patient recruitment materials mu st be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or her legall y acceptable representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectiv es of the study and possible risks associated with participation."
100,page_100,"Talazoparib (PF -06944076; MDV3800) C3441020 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 14 August 2019 PFIZER C ONFIDENTIAL Page 101Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally acceptable representative, the patient’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determined b y the IRB/EC. If the investigator determines that a patient’s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the patient’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the stud y patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, decis ionall y-impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legally acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained or waived. If assent is obtained verball y, it must be documented in the source documents. The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject, or the patient’s legall y acceptable r epresentative, before an y study -specific activity is performed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC. The investigator will retain the original of each patient’s signed consent document. 12.3. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new information that might influence the e valuation of the benefits and risks of the I P, Pfizer should be informed immediatel y. In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safet y measures taken b y the investigator to protect the study patients against an y immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL End of trial is defined as the time at which it is deemed that a sufficient number of patients have been recruited and completed the study as stated in the regulatory application (ie,clinical trial application [CTA]) and ethics application. Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study . 14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or IP safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. I n additio n, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of talazoparib at any time. If a stud y is prematurel y terminated, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and the hos pital pharmacy (if applicable) as quickl y as practical.
