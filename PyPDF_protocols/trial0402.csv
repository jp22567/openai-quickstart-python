Overall rationale for the amendment The main reason for the amendment is that a new anti-drug antibody (ADA ) assay has been developed with improved tralokinumab tolerance . This means that the presence or absence of ADA can be determined in serum samples with tralokinumab present . Previously, this was not possible and therefore ADA sampling at the end of the 14-week off-treatment safety follow -up was originally required for the ADA evaluation. Thus, th e new ADA assay will allow eligible subjects who have completed the treatment peri ods of trial LP0162 -1325 to continue into the long-term extension trial (conducted under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND]) without completing the safety follow -up period in the present trial. These subjects will have their safety follow -up period after end -of-treatment in the long-term extension trial. In addition, the amendment includes other changes, as presented in the table below. Note: The table below describes the changes in each section. Changes have either been summarised (written with pla in text only) or marked as tracked changes ( text added to the protocol is written in bold and deleted text has a line through it ). eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The subjects may enter ECZTEND at any time during the off -treatment safety follow -up period. For these subjects, the end of trial visit will be the last visit in trial LP0162 - 1325. The s ubjects entering ECZTEND after completion of the end of treatment visits (Week 52 or Week 68) will also be considered as trial completers . For all subjects assigned treatment, an end of treatmen t form and end of trial form will be completed in the eCRF. To clarify that eligible subjects who have completed the treatment periods of trial LP0162 -1325 may continue into the long -term extension trial (conducted under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, E CZTEND]) without completing the safety follow -up period. Section 4 Schedule of procedures (SoP), Panel 2 (footnote 5), and Panel 4 (footnote 3); Section 7.1 Overall trial design; Section 9.2 Administration of investigational medical products Subjects eligible for home -use will receive proper training at 3 dosing visits in the open -label period after additional consent has been obtained. To clarify what is considered proper training of the subjects or caregivers in home -use (that is 3 dosing visits duri ng open -label treatment). eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

From Week 16 through safety follow -up (FU1 [Week 66] or FU2 [Week 82]) subjects may use mild to moderate strength TCS and/or TCI as needed (prn usage) on lesional skin at the investigator’s discretion (see Appendix 9 for TCS classification and examples). U se of such TCS and TCI should be recorded as concomitant medication . To clarify that the use of topical treatments is permitted during the safety follow -up period. To clarify that subjects in the open -label traloki numab arm are allowed to use TCS as well as TC I. Section 9.9.2 Storage of IMPs The IMP must be stored at 2 to 8°C at the site. The temperature during storage must be monitored by a calibrated, stationary, and continuously monitoring recording system. Minimum requirement is a calibrated min/max thermometer. To clarify that the storage of IMP will be monitored. Section 9.9.3 Drug accountability Used syringes will be destroyed at the trial site provided the trial site has procedures in place for such IMP destruction ; this requires that the trial site is able to issue a certificate documenting the kit number(s) that were destroyed . Trial sites which do not have such IMP destruction procedures in place will dispose used syringes in sharps bins which will be shipped to the contract manufactur ing organisation (CMO) at the end of the trial . For more information about IMP accountability, please refer to the IMP manual. To clarify that a certificate of destruction is not required for used IMP. To also allow shipment of sharps bins to the CMO during the trial. Section 10.3.2.8 EQ-5D-5L The second section consists of a vertical visual analogue scale anchored at 0 (‘the worst best health you can imagine’) and 100 (‘the best worst health you can imagine’). To correct the definition of extremes in the vertical visual analogue scale. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

To clarify that the results from the small biomarker panel will be included in the CTR. Section 10.5.3 Skin biopsies (selected trial sites) Global gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing microarray . Overall, tThe results from the analyses of biopsy material will not be included in the CTR, except the global gene expression analysis which but will be presented in a separate report. To clarify that global gene expression analysis will be carried out by RNA sequencing and that the results from this analysis will not be included in the CTR. Section 11.1 Collection of adverse events; AEs must be collected from time of first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent form until completion of the clinical trial (defined as the safety follow -up visit 16 weeks after last injection ). For subjects entering the long-term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND ), any (S)AE with o nset before the final visit in LP0162 -1325 should be reported in LP0162 -1325 . If ongoing, the (S)AE will also be recorded as medical history in ECZTEND . To clarify how (S)AEs occurring in subjects entering ECZTEND will be collected if visits in LP0162 -1325 overlap with visits in ECZTEND . Section 11.5.1 Adverse events of special interest Panel 13 (Footnote 1) The additional data to be recorded in the eCRF are not a requirement, but are to be reported by the investigator, if available, for example as part of standard clinical practice. To clarify that additional information is to be provided only if available and is not a requirement. Section 12.3.7 Analysis of safety Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) will be tabulated and listed instead of being presented in a narrative. Tabulation and listings are considered a more practical and informative way of presenting data on AESIs. This will enable easier overview of the individual cases as well as sorting and pooling of data from several trials. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The test sample is deemed positive or negative for the presence of nAb to tralokinumab relative to a pre -determined (in assay validation), statistically derived cut poi nt. Samples positive for nAb to tralokinumab are then titrated to determine relative amounts of nAb present in each test sample. To reflect that titre information will not be available from the nAB assay. Appendix 1 Protocol summary Updated with the chang es described above, as applicable.

In its severe form, AD is characterised by widespread skin lesions, intractable itch, as well as enhanced susceptibility to bacte rial, viral, and fungal skin infections ( 1-4). AD is associated with a substantial patient burden that typically includes poor quality of life, sleep disturbance, and reductions in work productivity ( 5). Treatment recommendations for A D include topical therapies, the main being topical corticosteroids (TCS). Unfortunately, TCS and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) have limited eff icacy in patients with moderate -to-severe disease. TCS and non-biologic systemic therapies are all assoc iated with toxicities with long -term use (6-8). AD is characterised by an activated T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased skin expression of key Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)-13 (9, 10). The expression of IL -13 is increased in lesional skin compared to non -lesional skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing IL -13 is upregulated in AD patients compared to individuals w ithout AD (9, 11). IL-13 acts on keratinocytes to release C-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22) and recruit more IL-13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiation, and contribute to decreased barrier function ( 12). IL-13 also drives imm unoglobulin E (IgE) production and contributes to mast cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, drives histamine release and induces itch (13, 14). Indeed, itch is a key issue in AD, which drives significant mechanical damage to the skin and further facilitates allergen and pathogen entry. All of these effects together drive and exacerbate the disease phenotype. A review of the available preclinical literature fr om mouse and human ex vivo models suggests IL-13 as a, if not the, central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that blocking the IL-4 receptor (which is part of the receptor complex which also binds IL -13) with the monoclonal antib ody dupilumab leads to clinical improvement in AD subjects ( 15). 5.2 Experience with investigational medicinal product Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interaction with the IL -13 receptors ( 16-18). A compilation of clinical and nonclinical data on tralokinumab including pharmacokinetics (PK) is given in the current Investigator ’s Brochure. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
31,page_31,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 31 of 169 In total, 17 clinical trials have been conducted with tralokinumab, with phase 3 development ongoing in asthma and AD . Other clinical trials with tralokinumab have been conducted in subjects with ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in healthy subject s. Further information on these trials can be found in the current Investigator ’s Brochure. In a phase 2b trial (D2213C00001), adults with moderate -to-severe AD on a background of mild to moderate TCS, were treated with 3 different regimens of tralokinumab (45 mg every second week [Q2W ], 150 mg Q2W , or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary endpoints were change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) at Week 12 and the percentage of subjects achieving IGA response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in EASI and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) score s, the percentage of subjects achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI and SCOR AD score s (EASI50 and SCORAD 50). In the overall intent -to-treat phase 2b population, an improvement in EASI score at Week 12 was seen in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus placebo. 26% of subjects ach ieved an IGA of 0 or 1 in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 12% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported causally related treatment -emergent adverse event was upper respiratory tract infection (6 [3.9%] subjects in the combined tralokinumab group (45 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg) and 2 [3.9%] subjects in the placebo group). In total, more than 2,343 subjects have been treated with tralokinumab (cut -off date: 18-Aug-2017) based on actual exposure data from any completed clinical trials and the enrol ment/randomisation schemes for ongoing trials . The safety of all doses studied so far has been with an acceptable benefit -risk profile and no major safety concerns have been identified. Possible risks associated with use of tralokinumab are summarised in S ection 5.5. 5.3 Trial rationale The purpose of this phase 3 trial is to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in the treatment of subjects with moderate -to-severe AD inade quately controlled with topical therapies. Such subjects would be candidates for systemic therapy. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate that tralokinumab provides more effective control of the skin manifestations of AD than placebo. The trial will evaluate the percentage of subjects achieving IGA response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and the percentage of subjects achieving at least 75% reduction in EASI score (EASI75) at Week 16, with eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

As AD is a chronic disease requiring long -term treatment, it is also relevant to evaluate th e efficacy of tralokinumab as maintenance treatment. After the 16 -week initial treatment period , the trial will evaluate 2 different treatment options for maintenance therapy (300 mg Q2W an d 300 mg every 4 weeks [ Q4W ]). As an exploratory component, the present trial will also investig ate whether subjects who have elevated levels of biomarkers of IL -13 may be more likely to respond to an IL -13 neutralising therapy. Periostin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) were identified as key markers of IL -13 mediated activation in the phase 2b trial (D2213C00001) . In a post -hoc analysis of trial D2213C00001 , subjects with baseline serum DPP4 or periostin levels above the median were seen to derive greater benefit from tralokinumab. Further exploratory analyses of these biomarker s will be conducted so as to identify sub -populations where prospective testing may be conducted in future clinical trials . The trial will further characterise the benefit -risk profile of the drug and understand how bes t to position tralokinumab in the AD treatment pathway. 5.4 Justification for dose The selected dose for the initial treatment period in trial is subcutaneously administered 300 mg traloki numab Q2W. All subjects randomis ed to receive treatment with tralokinumab will get an initial loading dose of 600 mg on D ay 0 (baseline). The administration of the loading dose of tralokinumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach steady -state faster , and potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. The serum concentrations of tralokinumab after the 600 mg loading dose will not exceed the serum tralokinumab concentrations at steady state for the 300 mg Q2W. The tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W dose was chosen based on the results of the phase 2b trial in subjects with moderate -to-severe AD (trial D2213C00001) described in Section 5.2. The subjects were treated with 3 different fixed dose regimens o f tralokinumab (45, 150, or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate safety and efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. In the overall intention -to-treat phase 2b population, a statistically significant improvement in EASI change from baseline at Week 12 was observed in the tralokinumab 300 mg group versus pl acebo; however, formal statistical significance was not demonstrated for the co-primary endpoint IGA. The key secondary and exploratory endpoint results from trial D2213C00001 also support the selection of the tralokinumab Q2W 300 mg dose for eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
33,page_33,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 33 of 169 phase 3 devel opment; and overall , larger numerical differences were observed for 300 mg tralokinumab dose than for 150 mg compared to placebo for most of the trial endpoints. Since the safety profile in trial D2213C00001 was acceptable in all treatment cohorts and no clear safety related dose -response pattern was identified, the dose of 300 mg Q2W has been selected for evaluation in this trial . In the maintenance treatment period , 1 of the treatment arms will be dosed with tralokinumab Q4W. This approach will allow the sponsor of the trial, LEO Pharma A/S (hereinafter “LEO ”), to establish whether less frequent dosing of tralokinumab may be sufficient for long-term maintenance of efficacy. 5.5 Benefit/ risk assessment There is an unmet medical need for new therapies for use in subjects with moderate -to-severe AD as current immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine , methotrexate, and azathioprine , have associated long -term toxicities. Tralokinumab has already demonstrated efficacy in both moderate -to-severe AD as well a s in a severe asthma population in phase 2 trials , and has shown an acceptable safety profile in AD, asthma, ulcerative colitis , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in trials with healthy subjects . The evidence discussed in S ection 5.2 further supports the hypothesis that tralokinumab may benefit individuals with AD. In clinical trials completed to date tralokinumab was well tolerated. A number of theoretical potential risks have been identified that are described in the current Investigator’s Brochure , including hypersensitivity reactions, immune complex disease, severe infections , malignancies, and interference with reproductive functi on; measures are in place in this trial to protect participating subjects as follows: Close monitoring of subjects during the trial with trial visits every 2 weeks during the treatment period as described in the SoP ( Section 4). Where home -use is appropriate (open -label treatment only) , trial visits will be scheduled every 4 weeks. Close monitoring of subjects during the post -dosing period (at the first 3 investigational medicinal product [ IMP] dosing visits in initial treatment period and in open -label treatment ) as a precautionary measure aga inst hypersensitivity reactions (further details are given in Section 9.2). eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
34,page_34,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 34 of 169 Monitoring of s ubjects for both clinical manifestations that may be associated with the development of specific antibodies to tralokinumab (i .e., immune complex disease) . Exclusion of subjects with untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects who have failed to respond to standard of care therapy ( neutralisation of IL -13 might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infestation, in particular, prevention of expulsion of gastrointest inal worms (helminths) [29]) Exclusion of s ubjects with a history of tuberculosis requiring treatment within 12 months prior to the screening visit . Exclusion of s ubjects with a history of a clinically significant infection (defined as a systemic or serious skin infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, antiviral, or ant i-fungal medication; see Section 8.3) within 4 weeks prior to baseline which, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor ’s medical expert , may compromise the safety of the su bject in the trial . In conclusion, previous clinical experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or tolerability concerns and appropriate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect subjects from possible risks that have been previously identified and to clo sely monitor each subject. The current risk/benefit ratio is favourable and supports the administration of tralokinumab for the purposes of achieving the objectives of this trial. 5.6 Ethical consideration s No children or other vulnerable subjects incapable o f giving informed consent will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Furthermore, women who are pregnant , breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant will not be enrolled in this clinica l trial. Women of child -bearing potent ial have to agree to use a highly effective method of contraception to prevent pregnancy during the clinical trial and until 16 week s after discontinuation of treatment with the I MP. In addition , all female subjects of child -bearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed before, during and at End of Treatment to ensure that no foetuse s are exposed to the I MP. In this clinical trial, the efficacy of tralokinumab will be evaluated in adult subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are other wise healthy. Tralokinumab treatment will be compared with a placebo control group. Subject s who do not achieve a clinical response (IGA 0/1 or EASI75) at Week 16 will be transferred to open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment with optional use of TCS. Similarly, during the maintenance treatment period, subjects who eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Altogether, the risks associated with participating in this clinical trial are considered ve ry low and outweighed by the benefit of a potential future treatment option for moderate -to-severe AD. Moreover, 75% of the subjects will be randomi sed to active tr eatment with tralokinumab in the initial treatment phase and those who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 16 (including subjects randomised to placebo) will be treated with open -label tralokinumab in th e maintenance phase with a potential effect an d benefit for the individual subject. In accordance with the current version of the International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines , qualified medical personnel employed by LEO will be readily available to advise on trial-related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the trial. Safety data will be reviewed regular ly by Global Pharmacovigilance, LEO and an independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ; see Appendix 4 H) to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed, to maximise patient safety. In conclusion, the trial design chosen for this efficacy and safety trial on tralokinumab is regarded as ethically justified and adherent with ethical requirements. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The trial will consist of a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks (Weeks -6/-2 to 0), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks 0 to 16) and a maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks (Weeks 16 to 52) . The primary endpoint is assessed at Week 16, and the final efficacy assessment will be conducted at Week 52. A 14-week off -treatment follow -up period for the assessment of safety is also included (Weeks 52 to 6 6). Subjects not achieving a clinical response at Week 16 as well as those who meet certain criteria during maintenance treatment will be transferred to open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment with optional use of TCS up to Week 52 . An overview of the different parts of the trial is provided in Panel 1 and Panel 9. Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0) The screening period has a minimum duration of 2 weeks and a maximum duration of 6 weeks and includes 1 or 2 screening visits . The exact duration of the screening period depends on the washout period defined by the exclusion criteria ( Section 8.3). If a washout is not required, screening will be reduced to 2 weeks and only requires 1 visit (Week -2; visit 2), i.e., the 2 screening visits will be merged. Similarly, if only a 2 -week wash -out is required , screening visits 1 and 2 will be combined (Week -2; visit 2). Eligibility will be assessed at the (first) screening visit and on Day 0 prior to randomisation. All s ubjects will attend a screening visit 14 days before baseline ( Week -2; visit 2) where they will receive electronic diary ( eDiary ) training and start the eDiary. Data entered in the eDiary during the 2 weeks before randomisation will be used to calcul ate baseline values of the patient -reported outcomes (PROs). All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation and will continue this treatment throughout the trial. Subjects will initiate emollie nt treatment no later than the Week -2 visit. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Once informed consent is obtained, a subject identification number (subject ID) will be assigned by a central interactive web response system (IWRS) and the screening evaluations to assess eligibility criteria may begin . The subject ID will be used to iden tify the subject during the screening process and throughout trial participation, if applicable. A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the trial site. Screen ing failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the trial but are not subsequently randomly assigned to trial treatment. A minimal set of screen ing failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen ing failure subjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (C ONSORT) publis hing requirements (27) and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen ing failure details, eligibility criteria, and any adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (S AEs).

However, if the reason for screen ing failure is administrative and not d ue to the subject failing to meet the eligibility criter ia, re -screening may be permitted (this will require approval by the sponsor ’s medical expert after thorough review of all data from the original screening visit in the electronic case report form [ eCRF ]). Individuals who are re-screened will get a new sub ject ID. The investigator will maintain a list of all randomised subjects at the trial site including each subject ’s identity, date of enrolment and corresponding subject ID so that any subject may b e identified if required for any reason. The list must not be copi ed or retained by LEO . Note that enrolment is defined as the period from screening to randomisation (i.e., subjects are not enrolled until randomised) ( 27). 8.5 Discontinuation A subject may withdraw from trial or from treatment at any time (prior to first dose or during treatment period) at his/her own request. A subject may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator. Discontinued subjects will not be replaced.

The first day of dosing is considered Day 0 (visit 3 ). Each subject will receive 4 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab or placebo to receive a total loading dose of 600 mg tralokinumab or placebo (4.0 mL) . At subsequent visits (Q2W) in the initial treatment period , each subject will receive 2 SC injections (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab or placebo to receive a total dose of 300 mg tralokinumab or placebo . Subjects in the maintenance period will rece ive either Tralokinumab Q2W (2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of 150 mg tralokinumab) . Tralokinumab Q4W (alternating dose administrations 2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of 150 mg tralokinumab and placebo) . Placebo (2 SC injections [each 1.0 mL] of placebo) . Subjects who have been transferred to open -label treatment will receive 2 SC injection s (each 1.0 mL) of 150 mg tralokinumab at each dosing interval. Dosing visits are shown in the SoP ( Section 4). The last administration of IMP under this protocol will occur at Week 50 (or Week 66). IMP will be administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional (HCP; see Section 9.3.1 for blinding details) , or by the subject or the subject ’s caregiver (open -label treatment only; selected countries) . A minimum interval of 7 days is required between 2 dosing visits. The injections will be administered into the SC tissue of the upper arm, anterior thigh , or abdomen, separated by at least 3 cm. The injection site must be recorded in the source documents at each treatment visit and recorded in the eCRF. Further details on I MP administration are provided in an IMP manual .

Vital signs will be d ocumented in the eCRF. As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Allergy Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups : allergic anaphylaxis (mediated by an immunologic mechanism ) and non allergic anaphylaxis (which has a nonimmunologic cause ) (31). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this trial are listed in Appendix 6 (35). Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc ., and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at trial sites, and trial personnel should be trained to recognise and respond to anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a b lood sample will be drawn from the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis of serum tryptase at the central laboratory. Conditions requiring IMP administration rescheduling If any of the following should occur, the investigator should reschedule the visit and I MP should not be administered until the rescheduled visit: The subject has an intercurrent illness, that in the opinion of the investigator may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial (e.g., viral illnesses) . The subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C; ≥100.4 °F) within 72 hours prior to IMP administration . If the trial visit cannot be rescheduled in order to maintain minimum of 7 days to subsequent dose, the sponsor ’s medical expert should be contacted . Home -use Subjects transferring to open -label treatment will have the option to self -administer tralokinumab – or have tralokinumab administered by a care giver – in their home after training and at the investigator ’s discretion (selected countries only) . Subjects who do not want to self -inject may have the staff at the trial site administer all the injections at the trial site. Subjects who are found eligible for home -use will have to provide additional informed consent and home -use will only commence after 3 doses of tralokinumab have been administered at the trial site (i.e., starting no earlier than Week 22, see Section 7.1 and the SoP eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
55,page_55,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 55 of 169 [Panel 4]). Home -use will start no later than Week 50 (this also applies for subjects in the short -term extension). Prior to self -administration at home, the individual who will be administering the injections (i.e., the subject and/or the caregiver) will receive proper training (that is, at 3 dosing vi sits during open -label treatment after additional consent has been o btained ) in SC injection technique and on procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency during or following home -use of tralokinumab . This training will be conducted by the unblinded HCP. The subject and/or the caregiver must also undertake SC ad ministration under HCP supervision on one or more occasions such that the HCP is satisfied with the individual ’s understanding and confidence of the procedure. Subjects or their caregivers will only self-administer tr alokinumab at home every 4 weeks, i.e., in weeks where no efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled (Panel 4 and Panel 5; see also Section 9.9.3 ). Where trial visits with efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled (every 4 weeks) , tralokinumab injections will be administered at the trial site, preferably by the subject or their caregiver , alternatively by the unblinded HCP, when all assessments have been completed. At each trial visit it will be recorded in the eCRF whether tralokinumab was administered by the subject or the unblinded HCP. 9.3 Treatment assignment Subjects who have been found to comply with all the inclusion criteria and not to violate an y of the exclusion criteria will be randomised at baseline (Day 0) to receive treatment with either tralokinumab or placebo in the initial treatment period . Treatme nt assignment will be pre-planned according to a computer -generated randomisation schedule in a 3:1 ratio (tralokin umab:placebo) stratified by region (North America, Japan, and Europe) and b aseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4). Subjects found to be eligible for maintenance treatment at Week 16 will be re -randomised to the maintenance treatment period in a 2:2:1 ratio (tralokin umab Q2W:tralokin umab Q4W:placebo) stratified by region and IGA response at Week 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1). Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieve a clinical respons e at Week 16 ( IGA 0/1 or EASI75 ) will continue to receive placebo Q2W in the maintenance treatment period. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

IWRS will be used to control randomisation and stratification factors, along with IMP supply chain and expiry tracking. 9.3.1 Blinding This is a double -blinded trial in which tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct from each other. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects wil l be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the IMPs will contain no evidence of their identity. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualifi ed, unblinded HCP at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects and who will not perform any of the assessments . In the event that the treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator o r other study staff invo lved in the management of trial subjects, LEO must be notified immediately. Should an issue arise with the IMP (e.g. , damaged kit or syringe that has been assigned to a subject prior to administration, or any other unexpected event with the kit or syringe [e.g., a malfunction during IM P administration]), the unblinded HCP at the site will contact the clinical research associate ( CRA ) to determine whether any specific actions are required. The trial site will maintain a written plan detailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind. 9.3.2 Emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment While the safety of a subject always comes first, it is still important to carefully conside r if unblinding is necessary to ensure a subject ’s safety. An emergency unblinding request can be made by the investigators, HCPs who are not members of the trial staff , or authorised LEO personnel.

IMP dosing may resume after the medication leading to suspension of IMP is discontinued. A decision to discontinue IMP temporarily or to reinstitute IMP treatment must be discussed with sponsor ’s medical expert. However, t he investigator may suspend trial treatment at any time, even without consultation with sponsor ’s medical expert if the urgency of the situatio n requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the subject ’s best interest. In such cases , sponsor ’s medical expert should be informed as soon as possible. 9.9 Treatment logistics and a ccountability 9.9.1 Labelling and p ackaging of IMPs The IMP will be packaged in individually numbered kits , each contain ing 1 syringe (tralokinumab 150 mg or placebo ). Primary and secondary packaging materials (syringe and outer carton, respectively) will be individually labelled. The labelling of IMPs will be in accordance with Annex 13, local regulations and trial requirements. Label text will be translated into local languages, as required. The inner labe l will be in English for k its used at trial sites. 9.9.2 Storage of IMPs All LEO supplied IMPs must be stored in a secure and restricted area under the conditions specified on the label and remain in the original container until dispensed. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
62,page_62,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 62 of 169 The IMP must be stored at 2 to 8 °C at the site. The temperature during storage must be monitored by a calibrated, stat ionary and continuously monitoring system. Minimum requirement is a calibrated min/max thermometer. A temperature log must be kept to document the storage within the right temperature interval . Storage facilities should be chec ked at least every working d ay. Storage of IMP may be delegated, e.g. to a hospital pharmacy, as locally applicable. Note that in the cases liste d below, site staff should not use the affected IMP and should immediately contact their CRA for further guidance: Temperature excursion upon receipt or during storage at the trial site . Damaged kit upon receipt . Damaged syringe/cartridge . Damaged IMP should be documented via IWRS (refer to the IWRS manual for further details). Damaged IMP should not be used. 9.9.3 Drug accountability The investigator is fully responsible for the IMPs at the trial site and for maintaining adeq uate control of the IMPs and for documenting all transactions with them. An inventory ( trial medication inventory log) must be kept of the IMP administered to each subject randomised in the trial. The trial medication inventory log must be available for inspection during monitoring visits and will be checked by the CRA to ensure correct dispensing of the IMP. Full drug account ability will also be performed i n the IWRS. Used syringes will be destroyed at the trial site provided the trial site has procedures in place for such IMP destruction . Trial sites which do not have such IMP destruction procedures in place will dispose used syringes in sharps bins which will be shipped to the contract manufacturing organisation (CMO ). The trial site will maintain trial kit cartons from used kits until reconciliation. The IMP must be fully accounted for by the CRA with the help of the unblinded HCP.

Following reconciliation, the trial kit cartons from used kits may be discarded. All unused IMP supplied by the CMO on behalf of LEO will be returned to the CMO. IMP may be returned from the trial site either to the CMO directly or via the LEO Pharma A/S affiliate or CRO responsible for the running of the clinical trial. The IMP returned to the CM O will be reconciled with the individual drug accountability forms. For more information abou t IMP accountability, please refer to the IMP manual. Where home -use is appropriate , the following apply : Subjects will only attend trial visits every 4 weeks, i.e., in weeks where efficacy and safety assessments are scheduled (Section 9.2). At these trial visits, s ubjects will be provided with IMP to be administered at home at the next dosing interval . Subjects will be provided w ith sharps bins for used syringes. Filled s harps bins will be returned to the trial site. Subjects will return trial kit cartons , and any unused IMP at each trial visit. Unused IMP returned by the subjects to the trial site can be stored at room temperature and must be stored separately from non -allocated IMP. The trial medication inventory log will document all IMP handed out to and returned by each subject. 9.9.4 Trial product destruction Unused IMP(s) as well as used syringes returned to the CMO will be destroyed by the CMO according to approved procedures and/or local requirements. 9.9.5 Treatment compliance IMP injections will be performed by site staff who will also keep the accountability records up to date. Any non -compliance and the reason for it must be recorded in the eCRF. Where home -use is appropriate , the following apply : Subjects will record date and injection site for each administration in a log of drug administration ; these data will then be transcribed into the eCRF by site staff at the next trial visit.

It will be completed electronically on the device supplied to the trial site and is included in the investigator trial file . 10.3.2.9 SF-36 The SF -36v2 (Acute Recall) is a 36 -item general health status assessment. Subjects will be asked to answer each question by s electing one of 3 to 6 categorical response options. The instrument instructions do not state a specific recall period; however, a recall period is defined within most items. The acute recall version, which asks subjects about the last week, will be used i n this trial (32). The SF -36v2 (Acute Rec all) yields scores for 8 health domains (physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and men tal health) and 2 psychometricall y derived summary scores (a physical component summary and a mental component summary ). The SF -36 will be completed according to the SoP in Section 4. It will be completed electronically on the device supplied to the trial site and is included in the investigator trial file. 10.3.2.10 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health The impact of AD on the subject ’s ability to work and perform regular activities will be assessed by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health ( WPAI -GH). The WPAI -GH questionnaire is an instrument to measure impairments in both paid work a nd unpaid work (40). It consists of 6 items and measures absenteeism, presenteeism as well as the impairments in unpaid activity because of health p roblem during the past 7 days. The following 4 main outcomes can be generated from the WPAI -GH: Percent work time missed due to health for th ose who were currently employed. Percent impairment while working due to health for those who were currently employed and actually worked in the past 7 days. Percent overall work impairment due to health for th ose who were currently employed. Percent activity impairment due to health for a ll respondents. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The TSQM will be completed electronically on the de vice supplied to the trial site according to the SoP (Section 4) and is included in the investigator trial file . 10.4 Safety assessments 10.4.1 Vital signs Vital signs (resting blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature) must be assessed according to the SoP ( Sectio n 4). Vital signs will be measured in supine position following at least 5 minutes rest. If an abnormal vital sign at screening is considered by the investigator to be clinically significant, it will be up to the investigator ’s discretion if the subject should be r andomis ed into the trial (respecting exclusion criterion no. 26). In case of abnormal findings , the vital sign measurement c an be repeated approximately 15 minutes later with subjects resting in a supine position to verify the first measurement. Should the repeated measurement result in a normal value , the measurement must be repeated once more. If the third measurement verifies the second (normal) value, the first measuremen t should be considered as false. If the third measurement confirms the first measurement (abnormal) the second measurement will b e considered as false. Only the last value measured and considered as correct will be recorded in the eCRF. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

If an unacceptable abnormal finding is identified during the physical examination at the screening visit, the subject must not be randomi sed into the clinical trial (respecting exclusion criterion no. 26). Refer to Appendix 4 D for principles for data entry in to the eCRF. 10.4.3 Digital ECG A single 12 -lead resting digital ECG will be recorded after the subject has been supine for at least 5 minutes at the visits indicated i n the SoP ( Section 4). A pre -evaluation of the ECGs will be performed by the investigators to evaluate immediate subject safety. At a minimum , date of ECG collection will be recorded in the source documents. The ECG data will be transferred to a central ECG service company for central evaluation. A cardiologist at the ECG service company will analyse and interpret the ECG data. The ECG service company will provide ECG evaluation reports to the trial sites. The investigator must evaluate all abnormal ECG results (‘clinically significant ’ or ‘not clinically significant ’) and sign and date. The investigator has the final decision on the clinical significance of ECG abnormalities. If a result is abnormal at the screening visit and considered by the investigator to be clinically significant, it will be up to the investigator ’s discretion if the subject should be enrolled into the tria l (respecting exc lusion criterion no. 26); if such a subject is enrolled, the investigator will provide a justification in the medical record .

The skin microbiome is complex and diverse, and varies between individuals and anatomical sites (37). It has been known for years that some skin diseases are associated with dysbiosis of the skin microbiome. AD, in particular , has long been associated with increased skin colonisation with S. aureus. Indeed, S. aureus colonisation has been proposed to play an important role in AD pathophysiology via bacterial production of specific virulence factors (38). Increased colonisation with S. aureus in AD is accompanied by decreased colonisation with many commensal bacterial species, resulting in overall decreases in bacterial diversity (39). Resolution of active disease in AD in response to therapy correlates with reduction of S. aureus colonisation and increases in microbiome diversity (39). A recent phase 2b trial in subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who were sampled with skin swabs on lesional skin showed a reduced frequency of S. aureus positive subjects following treatment with tralokinumab compared with placebo. A similar evaluation will be performed in the present trial. Since global analyses of microbiome diversity were not undertaken in the phase 2b tralokinumab trial, t he present trial will use gene sequencing to identify specific strains of bacteria present on the skin and thus characterise treatment effects on the skin microbiome in AD subjects. 10.5.1.2 Staphylococcus aureus colonisation (all subjects) Samples (skin swab s) from a representative lesion will be taken from all subjects to detect presence or absence of S. aureus colonisation . Samples will be c ollected according to the SoP (Section 4) and the body location will be documented in the eCRF (upper limb, lower limb, trunk, head) . Efforts will be made to swab the same skin site (lesion) at all time -points, even if the lesion has cleared. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
80,page_80,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 80 of 169 S. aureus colonisation will be determined using an RNA -based method ( quantitative real -time polymerase chain reaction ). This will provide data on treatment effects on subclinical infection s with S. aureus that is very frequent in AD patients. Collection, handling and shipment i nstructions for skin swabs are provided in a separate laboratory manual. 10.5.1.3 Skin microbiome characterisation (selected trial sites) At selected trial sites, subjects will be asked to participate in an exploratory component involving skin microbiome characterisation . Participation in this exploratory component which also includes skin biopsies and additional serum biomarker testing requires that the subject provides additional informed consent. Skin swabs will be taken from a representative lesion . Samples will be c ollected according to the SoP ( Section 4) and t he same lesion will be sampled throughout the trial. The location of the lesion will be documented in the eCRF (upper limb, lower limb, trunk). Isolates will be cultured and the microbi ome will be characterised using next-generation sequencing . Subjects should not shower, bathe , or otherwise wash the lesion where the swab will be taken from within 12 hours of sample collection. Collection, handling and shipment instructions for skin sw abs are provided in a separate laboratory manual. Since subjects will also have skin biops ies taken from the lesion selected for microbiome characterisation, the trial will provide a unique opportunity to combine gene expression, histology, and microbiome data from the same lesions in AD subjects. T he results will help to clarify the role of IL -13 pathways in regulation of the skin microbiome and may shed light o n the role of the microbiome in the pathophysiology of AD. The skin microbiome result s will not be included in the CTR but will be presented in a separate report. 10.5.2 Serum biomarkers 10.5.2.1 Rationale Serum biomarkers will be evaluated as an exploratory part of the tralokinumab phase 3 program me to profile the molecular response and to identify subpopulations of AD patients with increased re sponse to treatment. Collection, handling and shipment instructions for biomarker samples are provided in a separate laboratory manual. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The biomarkers to be analysed include, but are not limited to, the following: periostin, DP P4, CCL17 ( also known as thymus and activation regulated chemokine [ TARC ]), IL-13, IL -17, IL-22, and beta-defensin 4A (DEFB4A ). These samples will be taken according to the SoP (Section 4). LEO may only analyse s amples from a subset of subjects. 10.5.2.3 Large b iomarker panel ( selected trial sites) At selected trial sites, subjects will be asked to participate in additional biomarker testi ng. Participation in this component of the trial which also includes skin microbiome characterisation and skin biopsies requires that the subject provides additional informed consen t. Subjects consenting to additional biomarker testing will have an extra blood sample taken to measure additional serum biomarkers. These samples will be taken according to the SoP (Section 4). To allow unbiased biomarker discovery, a large panel of biomarkers will be assessed. 10.5.3 Skin biopsies (selected trial sites) At selected trial sites, subjects wi ll be asked to participate in an exploratory component involving skin biopsies. Participation in this component of the trial which also includes skin microbiome characterisation and additional serum biomarker testing requires that the subject provides additional informed consent. Two 3 mm skin biopsies (1 for histology, 1 for gene expression analysis ) must be taken from lesional skin at the time -points specified in the SoP ( Section 4). At baseline, 2 skin biopsies will also be taken from non -lesional skin at an anatomically similar site (i.e., a total of 4 biopsies at baseline) . The lesional skin biopsies must be taken from the same lesion used for microbiome characterisation (Section 10.5.1.3 ). The body location of each site will be documented in the eCRF (upper limb, lower limb, trunk). A check of skin biopsy wound healing including removal of suture, if applicable, will b e performed at the next trial visit (i.e., at Weeks 2, 6, and 18).

The biomarkers to be analysed include, but are not limited to, the following: Histology/ immun ohistochemistry /in-situ hybridisation T cells (e.g., CD3+ and CD8+ ), dendritic cells (e.g., CD11c+, Fc εR1), monocytes/macrophages (e.g., CD68) , epidermal markers (e .g., epidermal thickness, keratin type I cytoskeletal 16, proliferation marker protein Ki-67, protein S100 -A, filaggrin , loricrin ). Gene expression analysis Global gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing . Quantitative real -time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of the following genes : IL-1B, IFN G, IL-13, IL -31, CCL17 (TARC), CCL26, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10 ), IL-12/IL -23p19, IL -17A, CCL20, IL-19, IL -20, IL -22, S100A9, S100A12 . Rationale for selection of biomarkers in biopsies The biomarkers to be analysed in the biopsies have been selected to assess the effect of IL -13 inhibition on cell types and cytokines that play a key role in AD skin. Effective treatments of AD are known to reduce the number of inflammatory cells in lesional skin as well as to modulate epidermal markers towards a non -diseased phenotype ( 25). A quantitative real -time polymerase chain reaction analysis of markers of specific subsets of T cells (e .g., Th1, Th2, Th17 , and Th22) will allow analysis of the mechanism of action of tralokinumab in diseased AD skin. Overall, t he results from the analyse s of biopsy material will be included in the CTR , except the global gene expression analysis which will be presented in a se parate report. 10.5.4 Storage of biological samples Samples collected as part of the exploratory component (microbiome characterisation, biomarkers, and skin biopsies) will be retained for as long as the quality of the material permits evaluation but for no longe r than 12 months after completion of the CTR unless specific additional consent has been obtained that allow s storage for future research (see below) .

The samples will be transferred from the relevant laboratory to the biobank. The samples will be labelled with the trial ID, subject ID , and the sample date to protect the privacy of the subjects and to allow continued blinding for future analyses . The samples from this trial will be stored for 10 years after the end of the trial and will then be destroyed. 10.5.5 Photography (selected trial sites) At selected trial sites, subjects will be asked to participate in a photography component involving digital photography assessments to show disease progression over time. Participation in this photography component requires that the subject provides additional informed consent. Digital colour photographs will be taken of the disease area and a representative lesion according to the SoP ( Section 4). The trial sites will use their own equipment to take the photographs. Instructions for photography will be provided to the sites in a photography manual. Photography standards and procedures are provided to the trial sites by the central photography vendor. The photographs will have no other subject identifier than the subject ID and will be transmitted electronically to the photography vendor using a secure file transfer protocol . Printed copies of the photographs must be included as part of the individual subject source documentation. LEO may at its discretion use the photographs in publications, poste rs and similar types of information material or media targeting patients and HCPs . The photographs can also be part of training material used for training and educational purposes. Steps will be taken to ensure that the identity of the subject is protected to the extent possible. 10.6 Estimate of t otal blood volume collected Blood samples will be drawn for safety ( chemistry, haematology, serology , PK, ADA ) and biomarkers .

Once a subject leaves the clinical trial, the investigator should follow up on the outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable relationship to the IMP for 2 weeks or until the final outcome is determined, whichever comes first. SAEs must be followed up until a final outcome has been established, i.e. the follow -up may continue beyond the end of the clinical trial . For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during study or safety follo w-up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final outcome sho uld be considered recovered and a statement that the SAE has stabilised should be added to the narrative in the SAE form. 11.7 Handling of an urgent safety measure An urgent safety measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation under an emergency. This is defined within the EU Directive as “…the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal pr oduct where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. ” (33). If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in the clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so without prior approval from LEO, regulatory authority(ies) , or IRB(s)/IEC(s). eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The sample size is chosen to ensure that sufficient safety information is collected and to ensure a s ufficient number of responders are re-randomised to maintenance treatment. The primary endpoints for initial treatment IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16 are to be evaluated hiera rchically testing both hypotheses of no difference between active and placebo at the 5% significance level. The hypothesis for IGA 0/1 will be tested first; if significant, the EASI75 hypothesis will be tested. For the endpoint IGA 0/1 at Week 16 , a sample size of 780 subjects randomised at 3:1 will provide >99% power to detect a diffe rence between the 2 arms of 30% for tralokinumab and 10% for placebo at a 5% 2 -sided level of significance. For the endpoint EASI75 at Week 16 a sample size of 780 will likewise provide >99% power to detect a difference between tralokinumab and placebo at Week 16, assuming EASI75 response rates of 40% and 15%, respectively. With an IGA response rate of 30% at Week 16, 175 IGA responders initially treated with tralokinumab are expected to enter the maintenance treatment period (70 subjects on tralokinumab Q2 W, 70 subjects on tralokinumab Q4W, 35 subjects on placebo). Assuming IGA response rates at Week 52 of 80%, 50% and 5%, respectively for Q2W, Q4W , and placebo, the power to show a difference at the 4% significance level will be >99% between Q2W and placebo and >99% between Q4W and placebo. With an EASI75 response rate of 40% at Week 16, 235 EASI75 responders initially treated with tralokinumab are expected to enter the maintenance treatment period (94 subjects on tralokinumab Q2W, 94 subjects on tralokinuma b Q4W, 47 subjects on placebo). Assuming EASI75 response rates at Week 52 of 90%, 55% and 5%, respectively for Q2W, Q4W , and placebo, the power to show a difference at the 4% significance level will be >99% between Q2W and placebo and >99% between Q4W and placebo. 12.2 Trial analysis sets All screened subjects will be accounted for in the CTR . eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

If the test is significant, EASI75 at Week 16 between tralokinumab and placebo is evaluated at a 5% significance level. If both these tests are significant, the significance level (alpha) will be split between th e analyses of the 3 secondary endpoints at Week 16 and the analyses of the 2 maintenance endpoints at Week 52. These groups of tests are tested in parallel with alpha=1% for the endpoints at Week 16 and with alpha=4% for the maintenance endpoints at Week 52. The evaluations of the 3 secondary endpoints at Week 16 between tralokinumab and placebo will use the Holm method ( 26) for 3 ordered p -values at a 1% significanc e level to adjust for multiplicity. The hypotheses for the maintenance treatment endpoints will be tested sequentially in the specified order at the 4% significance level. The next hypothesis will only be tested if the former was significant. If all p -values for the 3 secondary endpoints at Week 16 are significant, then the hypotheses for the maintenance treatment endpoints can be evaluated at a 5% significance level .

96,page_96,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 96 of 169 The applied estimands incorporate two main types of events that influence how the treatment effects are estimated: Initiation of rescue medication : Some of the estimands use the initiation of rescue medication as an event that modifies the applied value of an endpoint, e.g. by defining a subject receiving rescue medication as a non -responder. Permanent discontinuation of IMP : This event occurs when a subject is permanently withdrawn from the treatment or the trial as described in Section 8.5. This can either happen at his/her own initiative or at the investigator ’s discretion. The event also includes the possibility of a subject being lost to follow -up. The timing of the event is defined as the date of the early termination visit for withdrawn subjects or – in the case of a subject lost to follow -up – the date of the last known visit to the clinic. As for the rescue medication, the event type is used to modify an applied endpoint value. All analyses will be based on the full analysis set unless otherwise specified. 12.3.5.1.1 Primary estimand: ‘composite ’ The primary estimand for the primary endpoints will be: Treatment difference in response rates of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks achiev ed without rescue medication, regardless of treatment discontinuation. The primary estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates (defined as response obtained without initiation of any rescue medication) after 16 weeks, resulting from initiat ion of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab compared to a treatment regimen with placebo. Primary analysis for the primary estimand Data retrieved at Week 16 for subjects who have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16 will be included in the anal ysis. Subjects who prior to the Week 16 visit have received rescue medication will be considered non -responders, reflecting an assumption that initiation of rescue medication indicates failure of the randomised treatment to achieve response, and that a (po ssible) observed positive response after initiation of rescue medica tion is not attributable to the randomised treatment. Missing data for subjects who d id not attend the Week 16 visit and where rescue medication has not been used prior to Week 16, will be imputed as non -responders. The difference in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by region ( North America, Japan , and Europe) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4).

The null hypothesis of no difference in response rates between tralokinumab and placebo will be tested against the 2-sided alternative that there is a difference. The primary endpoints will be tested sequentially at a 5% significance level. IGA 0/1 will be tested first, and, if significant, then EASI75 will be tested. If both primary null hypothese s are rejected, the secondary endpoints and the maintenance endpoints will be tested. Sensitivity analyses for the primary estimand Two sensitivity analyses are specified for the primary esti mand. In both cases the same Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test as used for the primary analysis will be applied including stratifi cation by region and baseline disease severity . The purpose of the analyse s is to assess the robustness of results of the primary analysis wi th respect to the retrieved data at Week 16 and assumptions regarding missing Week 16 data. Sensitivity analysis 1 : All su bjects who have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16 will be imputed as non -responders, even if no rescue medication has been used. This is to reflect a situation where retrieved efficacy data and concomitant medications could be registered less a ccurately for subjects who have discontinued treatment. Sensitivity analysis 2 : Rather than imputin g all subjects who do not attend the Week 16 visi t and where rescue medication has not been used as non -responders, the following approach will be applied. If subjects have withdrawn due to an AE or due to lack of efficacy, they are still considered non -responders. Data missing for other reasons will be imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF), hereby assuming that the last value is a more reliab le estimate of the missing response (than a non -response).

The underlying assumption is that the effect of tralokinumab following rescue medication or permanent treatment discontinuation is similar to the effect of placebo . It should be noticed that this assumption is pronouncedly conservative in favour of placebo as it tends to minimise the differences between arms. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tral okinumab arm as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from observed data in the placebo arm (using a so -called copy -reference approach). With this exemption, the stepwise multiple imputation procedure and subsequent analysis will be conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand. 12.3.5.1.3 Tertiary estimand : ‘treatment policy ’ The tertiary estimand for the primary endpoints will be: Treatment difference in response rate after 16 weeks between tralokinumab and placebo regardless of rescue medication and treatment discontinuation. The tertiary estimand assesses the average difference in response rates, resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab and additional rescue medication as compared to a tr eatment regimen with placebo and additional rescue medication. Primary analysis for the tertiary estimand Data retrieved at Week 16 for subjects who have permanently discontinued treatment prior to Week 16 will be included in the analysis. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using multiple imputations within 4 groups defined according to randomised treatment arm and whether or not subjects have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16. Within a given treatment arm, retrie ved data from discontinued subjects will be used to impute missing data for other discontinued subjects. Similarly, the available data from not discontinued subjects will be used to imput e data for such patients where the Week 16 value is missing. For not discontinued subjects, the stepwise multiple imputations procedure will be conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand. For discontinued subjects, it is expected that the number of subjects with retrieved data at Week 16 will be too small to facilitate the same imputation model as mentioned above. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Some factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects only come from one region or if they all have the same baseline severity. The imputed datasets will be analysed in the same way as specified for the pr imary analysis of the secondary estimand. Sensitivity analyses for the tertiary estimand Rather than imputing Week 16 data as described in the primary analysis of the tertiary estimand, missing observations will be imputed as ‘non-responder s’. The assumption reflects that discontinued subjects without retrieved data at Week 16 are more likely to be non - responders than resembling discontinued subjects with retrieved data at Week 16. 12.3.5.2 Analysis of secondary endpoints The 3 secondary endpoints evalu ate the impact of 16 weeks of treatment on (i) severity and extent of AD, (ii) itch, and (iii) HRQoL. The corresponding endpoints are (i) the change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD, (ii) reduction (Y/N) of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS average score for the past week (hereinafter ‘Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average ’) of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16, and (iii) change from baseline to Week 16 in DLQI score.

The estimates will be presented with nominal p -values and 95% CI at each visit. The primary comparison between tralokinumab and p lacebo will be at Week 16. Sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints) Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm it is assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication in the tralokinumab arm will resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who do not discontinue treatment/receive rescue medication.

For each of the 100 imputed dataset, the change from baseline in SCORAD at Week 16 will be analysed using an ANCOV A model with effects of treatment, region, baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4), and baseline SCORAD value. The estimated difference at Week 16 will be derived together with the associated standard error. The estimates and standard errors from the 100 analyses are pooled to one estimate and associated standard error using Rubin ’s rule to draw inference.

The secondary estimand assesses the average difference in change from baseline in SCORAD and DLQI after 16 weeks, resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab and additional rescue medication as compared to a treatment regimen with pl acebo and additional rescue medication. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Missing We ek 16 data will be imputed using multiple imputations assuming that data is missing at random within the groups used for imputation. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using multiple imputations within 4 groups defined according to randomis ed treatment arm and whether or not subjects have discontinued treatment prior to Week 16. Within a given treatment arm, retrieved data from discontinued subjects will be used to impute missing data for other discontinued subjects. Similarly, the available data from not discontinued subjects will be used to impute data for such subjects where the Week 16 value is missing. For not discontinued subjects, the stepwise multiple imputations procedure will be conducted in the same way as specified for the imputa tion of the underlying EASI values in the primary analysis of the secondary estimand for the binary endpoints . For discontinued subjects, it is expected that the number of subjects with retrieved data at Week 16 will be too small to facilitate the same imp utation model as mentioned just above. Consequently, an imputation model with only region and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and baseline SCORAD / DLQI as a covariate) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some factors may have to be omitted, depen ding on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects o nly come from one region or if they all have the same baseline severity. Each of the 100 imputed datasets will be analysed and the resulting estimates and standard errors pooled as described in the sen sitivity analyses for the primary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints. Sensitivity analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints) Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random, it is assumed that missing dat a from subjects in the tralokinumab arm who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to Week 16 will resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to Week 16. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will b e done using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tralokinumab arm as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from the placebo arm (copy -reference approach).

This estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates (defined as response obtain ed without initiation of any rescue medication and without transfer to open -label treatment ) after 52 weeks in patients responding to tralokinumab at Week 16 (as measured by a positive IGA 0/1 or EASI75 response), resulting from a maintenance treatment regimen with tralokinumab Q2W or tralokinumab Q4W compared to a treatment regimen with placebo. Primary analysis for the maintenance estimand All s ubjects who prior to the Week 52 visit have received rescue medication, including TCS, and/or been transferred to the open -label tralokinumab arm will be considered non-responders . This reflect s an assump tion that initiation of rescue medication or transfer to open -label treatment indicates failure of the re-randomised treatment assigned at Week 16 , and that a (possible) observed positive response thereafter is not attributable to the treatment received from Week 16 .

The multiple testing procedure planned to control the overall type 1 error rate for the trial is described in detail in Section 12.3.4 . The maintenance endpoints will be evaluated in the following order: No difference between Q2W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52. No difference between Q2W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52 . No difference between Q4W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52 . No difference between Q4W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52 . For the IGA 0/1 endpoint, the analysis will be based on the subjects in the maintenance analysis set who obtained an IGA of 0/1 at Week 16 without rescue medication .

Statistical methods Primary endpoints The differ ence in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by region and disease severity. The primary endpoints will be tested sequentially at a 5% significance level. First IGA 0/1 and, if signific ant, EASI75. If both primary null hypotheses are rejected, the secondary endpoints will be tested. Secondary endpoints The change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD will be analysed using a repeated measurements model on the post b aseline responses up to W eek 16. Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least 4 is a binary endpoint, and as such it will be analysed as described for the primary endpoint. Change from baseline to Week 16 in DLQI will be analysed the same way as change in SCORA D. Maintenance endpoints The 4 hypotheses of primary interest for maintenance treatment will be tested sequentially with the next hypothesis in the sequence only being tested if the previous one was significant. The maintenance endpoints will be evaluated in the following order: No difference between Q2W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52. No difference between Q2W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52. No difference between Q4W and placebo for IGA 0/1 at Week 52. No difference between Q4W and placebo for EASI75 at Week 52.

An AE can therefore be any unf avourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. (ICH Harmonized Tr ipartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1)). This definition includes: accidental injuries, events related to trial procedures, reasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose), clinically significant worsening of pre -existing conditions, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgical procedures unless these were planned before enrolment. It also includes AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. In addition, any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by the investigator must be recorded as an AE. Serious a dverse event definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death . is life -threatening . requires inpatient hospitalisat ion or prolongation of existing hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation or planned prolonged hospitalisation do not fulfill the criteria for being an SAE but should be documented in the subject ’s medical record. results in persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity . is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . or eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Events that may not be immediately life - threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronc hospasm , blood dyscrasias and convulsions that do not result in hospitalization , development of drug dependency or drug abuse. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"
126,page_126,"Trial ID: LP0162 -1325 Date: 14-Aug-2018 Version: 4.0 Page 126 of 169 Appendix 3 : Classification of adverse events Severity The severity of the AE should be described in terms of mild, moderate or severe according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement. Mild An AE that is usua lly transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. Severe An AE that interrupts u sual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded. Causality The causal relation of the AE to the use of the IMP shou ld be described in terms of probable, possible or not related according to the following: Probably related Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. Could not be reasonably explained by the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject . Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP. Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge . Possibly related Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the IMP. Could also be reasonably explained by the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject . Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

Is better explained by other factors like the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject . Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge . Does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. Outcome The outcome of the ev ent should be classified and handled as follows: Recovered/ resolved The event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded. Recovering/ resolving The subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet completely resolved. Not recovered/ not resolved Event is still ongoing. Recovered /re solved with sequelae The event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after stroke. The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae should be specified. Fatal The subject has died as a consequence of the event.

Processing of person al data This protocol specifies the personal data on trial subjects ( for example age, gender, health condition, height, medical history, test results, etc.) which shall be collected as part of the clinical trial and processed during and after trial complet ion. Personal data collected as part of the clinical trial will be transferred to/from the institution/investigator , LEO and third parties acting on behalf of LEO. Processing of personal data on behalf of LEO requires a written agreement between LEO and the relevant party which covers collection, processing and transfer of personal data in the clinical trial. In certain cases an agreement on transfer of personal data may also be required. Investigators and LEO must ensure that collection, processing and transfer of personal data are in compliance with applicable legislation on data protection and privacy. Subjects (or their legally acceptable rep resentative) must be asked to consent to the collection, processing and tran sfer of their personal data to EU and non -EU countries for the purpose of conducting the clinical trial, research and development of new or existing products/services, improving existing products/services, applying for marketing authorisations for products/services, marketing of products/services and other related activities.

These visits have the following objectives: (i) to perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents; (ii) to confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) to confirm that the trial is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protoc ol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate, the complia nce of the trial site with the protocol and GCP. In order to perform their r ole effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance and inspections will need direct access to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail , the investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). Protocol compliance Protocol deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . LEO will assess all protocol deviations and decide if any of these deviations must be reported to the regulatory authorities as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol, as required by local legislation. Protocol deviations will be included in the CTR. Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by LEO or inspections from domestic o r foreign regulatory authorities or from IRBs/IECs. Audits and inspections may take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct access to al l source documents and other documents at the trial site relev ant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the trial site is contacted for an inspection by competent authorities, LEO must be notified immediately. Data handling Subject data should be entered into the CRF as soon as possible after each visit in accordance with the requirements described in the Clinical Trial Agreement , if appl icable . Queries for discrepant data will be generated automatically by the system upon entry or manually by the eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

All queries will be raised electronically within the electronic data capture system. This sy stematic validation will ensure that a clean and consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis. An e lectronic PRO (ePRO) solution will be used to capture patient -reported data ( data from questionnaires completed at the trial site and eDiary data). By the use of an ePRO, data will be available immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site personnel, including the investigator, with read access only. The ePRO system is a separate application from the eCRF and data captured fr om the eCRF and the ePRO will be stored on different servers during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final trial database. External data transfers from vendors to LEO will be transmitt ed and handled via a secure file transfer pr otocol site.

In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source docume nts so that the trial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial (for example in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities). The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the investigator leaves the trial site or retires before the end of the required storage period. No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of LEO . No records may be transferred to another location or party without written acceptance from LEO . The destruction process must ensure confidentiality of data and mus t be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. For archiving purposes, each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the eCRFs and ePRO data for all subjects enrolled at the trial site. This is done after completion of the trial and before access to the eCRF/ePRO is revoked. Audit trail information will be included. eCRFs and ePRO data must be available for inspection by authorised representatives from LEO, from regulatory authorities and/or IEC/IRBs. Appendix 4 E: Registration, reporting an d publication policy Basic information of this clinical trial will be registered in the global data registry, www.clinicaltrials.gov before the first subject enters into the trial.

If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by applicable regulatory requirements, the investigator or LEO must promptly inform IRB/IECs and provide a detailed written explanation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed. The trial must be terminated if the perception of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes unfavourable for the continuation of the trial. Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by LEO or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, LEO ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator. Discontinuation of further IMP development. Completion of trial Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease. Trial enrolment will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the clinical trial has been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number. Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO will undertake arrangements for the collection and disposal of any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to keep in his/her files. A trial site is cons idered closed when all required documents and trial supplies have been collected and a trial site closure visit has been performed. When the randomisation code has been broken, the investigators will receive information about the treatment allocation for t he subjects randomised at their respective sites and will be asked to record this in the subject ’s medical record. eDoc-00631888 - Version 4. 0"

The primary analysis provided in the statistical analysis plan in the original protocol dat ed 03-Mar-2017 is unchanged. Clarification has been added on the analysis set for the maintenance endpoints IGA of 0/1 at Week 52 and EASI75 at Week 52. The sensitivity analysis allowing TCS treatment under certain conditions has been removed ( mild to moderate strengths [WHO classification] TCS, on ≤250 cm2 affected BSA, for ≤5 consecutive days, not more often than every 4 weeks, <3 courses from Week 16 to Week 50 and last course is completed prior to the Week 50 visit, allowing at least a 2 -week washout prior to the Week 52 assessment) . An LOCF sensitivity analysis has been introduced.To conduct a sensitivity analysis which is similar to the sensitivity analysis no. 2 for the primary estimand for the primary endpoints . The sensitivity analysis described in the original protocol – which allowed TCS under certain conditions – is inconsistent with the rescue medication algorithm applied in the initial treatment period. Section 12.3.6.2.1 Time to relapse Initiation of rescue medication is now considered an event of relapse, rather than a censoring of the time to relapse. A clarification has been added that only subjects who achieve response at Week 16 without rescue medication will be included in the analysis. Clarification that the log -rank t est will be stratified by region and that this test is considered a supplementary exploratory analysis . Initiation of rescue medication is unlikely to be independent of the time to relapse, hence it is not considered appropriate to consider it a censoring event.
