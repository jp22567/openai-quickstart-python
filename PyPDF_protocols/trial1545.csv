Study Treatments Experimental arm. Luspatercept will be provided by the Sponsor as a lyophilized powder in vial. Luspatercept will be administered after reconstitution (see Secti on 7)as a subcutaneous (SC) inject ion to the subjects by the study staff at the clinical site. Subcutaneous inject ions will be given in the upper arm, abdo men, or thi gh, every 3 weeks during the Treatment Period s, unless dose delay or treatm ent di scont inuat ion is indicated. Subjects will start luspatercept at 1 .0 mg/kg dose level and can be dose escalated up to 1.25 mg/kg. Control arm. Placebo to be used in the study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for inject ion) administered as a SC inject ion.Designated individuals will prepare the placebo syringes to m atch the active syringe. Subcutaneous injections will be given in the upper arm, abdomen, or thi gh every 3 weeks during the DBTP , unless dose del ay or treatm ent discontinuat ion is indicated .

Overview of Pharmacokinetic Assessments Popul ation pharmacokinet ics will be evaluated, and the relationship between serum drug exposure and clinical endpo ints of interest will be explored. Statistical Methods The analysis populat ions for this study include: intent -to-treat subj ects (ITT) ,per protocol s et (PPS) ,and safet y popul ation (definit ion of each populat ion is provided in Section9). Subjects will be rando mized to receive luspatercept or placebo in a 2:1 ratio. Subjects will be stratified as described in the Secti on 3, Overall Study Design. Based on the assumption o f a targeted primary endpoint response rates at least 50% in the luspatercept group and 10% for the placebo g roup, and 2:1 randomization, a total sample size of 150 (100 in the luspatercept group, 50 in the placebo group) will have at least 99% power to detect the difference between the 2groups with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and assumed 10% drop - out rate. For NTDT -PRO tiredness and weakness ( T/W)domain scores, assume the mean change fro m baseline scores at Week 24 are 1.2 and 0.5 for luspatercept and placebo group, respectively, with a commo n standard deviat ion of 1.2, the statist ical power will be 91%. Primary Efficacy Analysis :The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is ery throid response, defined as an increase fro m baseline ≥1.0 g/dL in mean of hemoglo bin values over a continuous 12-week interval fro m Weeks 13 to 24 of treatment in the absence of tr ansfusio ns. Hem oglobin ( Hb)values wi thin 21 days following a transfusio n may be influenced by the transfusio n and will be excluded from this analysis. Baseline Hb is the average of 2 or more Hb measurements at least 1 week apart within 4 weeks before Dose 1. For di scont inued subjects who"

Further descript ion of the analyses is provided in Secti on 9. Secondary Efficacy Analys e s. Secondary endpo ints will be measured at Week 24 and Week 48. The results will be presented by treatm ent groups. The statist ical tests will be conducted to compare the treatm ent groups. Detailed description sof the analyses areprovi ded in Section 9. Secondary efficacy analyses will include: Mean change in NTDT -PRO , mean change and responder analysis in Hem oglobin, mean change in FACIT -FFatigue subscale ,mean change in SF-36 v2, LIC / ICT responder analysis , mean change in LIC, mean change in serum ferritin, transfusio n-freeperiod, duration of mean hemoglobin increase , mean change in the 6MWT . Interim Analysis :No interim analysis is planned. Timing of Analyses: The primary clinical study report (CSR) will include safet y and efficacy param eters wi th a cut -off date at the time when th e last subject enrolled in the DBTP has completed 48 weeks in the DBTP or discontinued earlier (ie, at the time of the unblinding of the study ),whichever occurs l ater. Thus, the analysis will be conducted after all required information is available for these endpo ints (ie, after all subjects have com pleted 48 weeks in the study or discontinued earlier). The final CSR will include efficacy and safet y data at the time of the End of the Trial (EOT definit ion in Sect ion3.3)."

OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Study Design This is a Phase 2, doubl e - blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, mult icenter study to determine the efficacy and safet y of luspatercept (ACE -536) versus placebo in adults with non- transfusio n dependent beta ()-thalassemia. The study is divided into the Screening Period, Double-blind Treatment Period (DBTP) , Open -label Phase (OLP) and Post -treatment Fo llow-up Peri od (PTFP) .The overall study design is described in Figure 7. It is planned to randomize approximately 150 subjects at a 2:1 rati o of luspatercept versus placebo. 3.1.1. Screening Period Upon giving written informed consent, the subject enters the Screening Period to determine eligibilit y.A subject ident ificat ion docum ent (ID)number will be allocated via the Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT )system as detailed in Section 7.3.The Screening Period will last up to4weeks with an administrative window of + 3days to allow all laboratory results to be available at sitefor evaluating the subject’s eligibilit y.During the Screening Period, the subject will undergo safet y and other assessments to determine eligibilit y for the study as detailed in Table 3,Table of Events. If the subject received transfusions during the 24 weeks prior to randomizat ion, 24 weeks of transfusio n history (including units or volume transfused and pre -transfusio n hemoglo bin level ), shoul d be recorded in the subject’s ele ctroni c case report form (eCRF) . If subject sreceived ICT during the 24 weeks prior to randomization, 24 weeks of ICT use history (incl uding t ypes of ICT and doses) should be recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF). Re-screening is allowed, and a new subject ID number will be as signed (see Section6.1). Subjects will be stratified at the time of randomizati on based on: 1.Baseline hemoglo bin level: ≥ 8.5 g/dL < 8.5 g/dL 2.Baseline NTDT -PRO T/W score : ≥ 3points < 3points 3.1.2. Double -blind Treatment Period Subjects will enter the Double -blind Treatm ent Period (DBTP) once they have com pleted the requi red assessments in the Screeni ng Peri od and been randomized via the IRT sy stem , as detailed in Sect ion 7.3.The DBTP will begin on Dose 1 Day 1 and will end when all subjects have co mpleted 48 weeks of treatment or have discontinued earlier. At that time, the study will be unblinded ."

Eligible s ubjects will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1, luspatercept versus placebo ,at a starting dose l evel of 1.0 m g/kg administered by subcutaneous (SC) inject ion once every 3 weeks. The maximum total dose per administration is 120 mg. Best supportive care is allo wed in both the luspatercept and placebo groups. This will include RBC transfusio ns, iron-chelat ing agents, use of antibiot ic therapy, an tiviral and ant ifungal therapy ,nutritional support as needed, and other medicat ions that are not prohibited (see Secti on8.2),thus minimizing the safet y risk to patients. Please,also refer to Section 8.1.2 for concomitan tmedicat ion for anemia, Section 8.1.3 for concomitant iron chelat ion therapy use and Secti on 8.1.4 for concomitant RBC tra nsfusio ns. Study visit s and seri al measurements of safet y and efficacy parameters will be perform ed as described in Table 3,Table of Events. After the study is unblinded , and after DMC’s recommendat ion : Subjects who received placebo and have been assessed as per protocol at least up to 48weeks after the first dose of IP (even if the IP is discont inued before complet e 48 weeks of treatment), may access the Open Label Period ( OLP )to receive luspatercept for amaximum 15 monthsbefore m oving to the rollo ver protocol for longer treatm ent. Subjects receiving luspatercept maycontinue their treatment in the OLP for maximum 15monthsbefore m oving to the rollo ver protocol for longer treatment (ie,5 years fro m Dose 1 in the DBTP, or un til treatm ent di scontinuati on, whichever occurs later ). Subjects who received luspatercept and discontinued the IP in the DBTP may continue and/or completethePTFP of5 years fro m first dose of IP, or 3 y ears fro m last dose (whichever occurs later), to complete the Post- treatment Follow -up Peri od under the rollover proto colin this study untiltheofEnd of Tri al (see Secti on3.3). Subjects m ay be di scontinued from treatment and/or the study for reasons described in Sect ion 11.1 and Table 5. The decisio n to di scont inue a subject fro m study treatm ent is the responsi bility of the treati ng physician; the Sponsor will not delay or ref use it. However, pri or to deciding to discontinue a subject, i t is recommended tha t the Investigator contact the Medical M onitor of this study and provi de any supporting informat ion for review and discussio n.Possible dose modificati ons are detailed in Sect ion7.2.1 . 3.1.3. Open -label Phase The start of this Open -label Phase ( OLP )will be determined by the availabilit y of primary analysis data that just ify the use of luspatercept in an OLP , which will be reviewed by the independent external DMC. After review of safet y and efficacy , theDMC will determine if the use of luspatercept in subjects previously randomized to receive placebo in this OLP is safe and recommended, and if subjects already on luspatercept can conti nue to be treated at their current dose l evel (best supporti ve care i s allowed). In the OLP , subjects m ay receive luspatercept for maximum 15 mo nths or discont inue."

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS 7.1. Description of Investigational Product(s) Luspatercept will be provided by the Sponsor. Luspatercept for injection is formulated as a sterile, preservat ive-free, ly ophilized cake/powder. Luspatercept for inj ection is available in 25 mg and 75 mg vials , and when reconst ituted, each consists of 50 mg/mL luspatercept in a 10 mM citrate buffer -based so lution (10 mM citrate, pH 6.5, 9% sucrose, 0.02% polysorbate 80). The recommended storage condit ion for luspaterc ept for Inject ion (25 mg/vial and 75 mg/vial; lyophilized powder form ulation) is 2°Cto 8°C . Reconstituted luspatercept in its original container closure system may be held for up to <10 hours at 2°C to 8°C, however it should be administered at room tempe rature. It i s recommended that the reconstituted luspatercept for inject ion be used immediately. If not used immediately, the total in -use t ime of the reconstituted luspatercept for inject ion, fro m reconst itution to administration, must not exceed 10 hours . Samples o f luspatercept drug product, held at the recommended storage condit ion, have been shown to be stable through the labeled shelf -life. Placebo to be used in the study will be sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride for inject ion) administered as a SC inject ion.Designated individuals will prepare the placebo sy ringes to match the active sy ringe. All staff except unblinded pharmacists and designated personnel will be blinded .The m anufacturer’s di rections for placebo storage and handling are to be fo llowed, as are standard clinical pract ices for ensuring sterilit y of the placebo. 7.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule Luspatercept or placebo will be administered as a SC inject ion to subjects by the study staff at the clinical site and administrati on will be documented in the subject’s source record. Subcutaneous inject ions will be given in the upper arm, thigh, and/or abdomen. Calculated doses requi ring reconst ituted volume greater than 1.2 mL should be divided into two separate similar volume injections across 2separate body sites using the same anatomical locat ion but on the opposite sites of the body (example left thi gh and right thi gh).The m aximum volume per SC inject ion shoul d not exceed 1.2 mL. The injection sites can be rotated according to Invest igator ’s judgment, and the inject ions can be given in the following order as needed, for example: 1) right upper arm, 2) left upper arm, 3) right upper thigh, 4) left upper thigh. In the DBTP, s ubjects will be assigned to be administered treatment a s per one of the following regimens: Luspatercept starting dose level 1.0mg/kg SC every 21 days Placebo SC every 21 days In the OLP, subjects previously rando mized to receive placebo will be assigned to be administered l uspatercept starting dose level 1.0 mg/kg SC every 21 days and subjects previously rando mized to luspatercept will cont inue on their last assigned dose."

IMPORTANT REMINDERS : The above treatment administration criteria numbers 2, 3, and 4should not be applied onDose 1 Day 1(except for the absence o f leukocytosis) forthe DBTP. Hem oglobin not influenced by a transfusio n, defined as Hb ≥ 21 day s post -transfusio n, should be considered to allow IP dose administration. If a transfusion occurred within 21 days prior to dosing, and predose Hb is ≥ 11.5 g/dL, the pre -transfusion Hb may be considered for dosing purposes. If IP dose is delayed due to Hb level not meeting the above dose administration criteria, the Hb level should be retested on a weekly basis or at a frequency decided by the Invest igator. Subje cts m ust have Hb and WBC count assessed and results available prior to each IP administration , therefore, l ocal laboratory resul ts can be used . However, in the DBTP central laboratory resul t will be used, when available, to confirm Invest igator’s decisio n,therefore, blood sam ples will be also collected and shipped to the central laboratory ,as detailed in the Table of Events, Table 3.

See Secti on10.1 for the reporting of adverse events associated with overdose. 7.3. Method of Treatment Assignment The treatment assignment (randomization) will occur at the end of the Screening Period, once all the required screening procedures have been completed and all required data have been submitted to the Sponsor or its authorized represent ative. Upon receiving acknowledgment of subjects’ eligibilit y from the Sponsor or i ts authorized representative, subject can be assigned for treatm ent using IRT. This study will utilize the IRT for rando mizat ion. Designated research personnel at each inve stigational site will be assigned password protected, coded i dentification numbers which allows them to access the IRT to enroll subjects. For drug assignment at each dose start and in the event of any dose reducti on, dose escalati on si te staff must contac t IRTto record the new dose level and obtain the new study treatment assi gnment. The rel ationship of the rando mizat ion number to the subject ID number will be described by a rando mizat ion algorithm. The rando mizat ion algorit hm will be emplo yed by the IRT system to assign a subject to a treatment based on the prespecified rules, such as double -blind study , stratified rando mizat ion withrandomizat ion rati o active v ersusplacebo on a 2:1; subjects will be placed into the appropriate stratum per the responses/ data entered/collected for questions collect ing stratificat ion and based on the combinat ion of these data points, the IRTwill place the subject in the next available slot within the appropriate stratum for that subject. The IRT will be utilized to ensure an equal weight central rando mization based on block randomizat ion method according to stratificat ion factors defined in Secti on3.1, Desi gn of Stud y. The rando mizat ion number corresponds to a particular treatment arm within a stratum. The rando mizat ion number, by itself, will not unblind a user to the subject’s treatment. The randomizat ion number should be coupl ed wi th all the unblinded code informat ion, in order the subject to become unblinded. 7.4. Packaging and Labeling The l abel(s) for luspatercept will include Sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP nam e, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), m edicat ion ident ificat ion/kit number, dosing instructi ons, storage condit ions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory statements as applicable. Addit ional information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulati ons. 7.4.1. Blinding For thi s trial, all subjects, study site staff ,and Ce lgene Corporation representatives with the exception of designated individuals (eg, the pharmacist at the invest igational site), will remain blinded to all treatment assignments until all subjects enrolled in the study have completed 48 weeks of double -blind treatm ent or di scont inue before reaching 48 weeks of double -blind treatm ent, whi chever is the earlier date, or at the time the study is unblinded (per DMC recommendat ion) and the data base is locked."

Thus, the designated site individual at the invest igational site will be unblinded and will give Invest igators and their staff luspatercept and placebo in a blinded manner. Randomization, drug dispensing, dose reduction/escalat ion, and drug discontinuation will be accomplished by an IRT system. Authori zed si te personnel must contact the IRT for rando mizat ion, study drug assignment at the beginning of each cycle, to register dose reductions or escal ations, and treatment discont inuat ion. Confirmation o f each call will be sent to the investigat ional si te and Celgene. For em ergency unblinding ,refer to Secti on12.2. 7.5. Investigational Product Accountability and Disposal Accountabilit y for study drug that i s administrated during the course of the study is the responsibilit y of the Investigator or designee. Investi gational clinical supplies must be received by a designated person at the clinical site and kept in a secure and temperature -controlled location.The invest igational site must m aintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amounts of study drug received, to whom it was administered (subject -by-subject accounting), and accounts of any luspatercept accidentally or deliberately destr oyed or returned. Accurate recording of all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section o f the subject’s eCRF and source documents. Unless otherwise notified, all vials o f study drug, both used and unused, must be saved for drug accountabilit y.The used vials may be discarded, per the inst itution’s standard practice, after drug accountabilit y has been co mpleted by the m onitor.The Invest igator must return all unused vials o f study drug to the Sponsor at the end of the study , or the study drug may be destroy ed at the clinical site wit h the permission o f the Sponsor. For ei ther scenario, the outcom e must be docum ented on the drug accountabilit y log.The Sponsor will provide direction for the outcome of all unused vials. Celgene (or desi gnee) will review wi th the Invest igator and relevant site personnel the process for invest igational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the site versus Celgene (or designee). 7.6. Investigational Product Compliance Study drug will be administered as a SC injection at the clinical site by the study staff. Moni toring for pati ent com pliance wi th the treatment regimen is therefore unnecessary . Accurate recording o f all IP administration will be made in the appropriate section o f the subject’s eCRF and source documents. The Investigator or designee is responsible for accounting for all IP that is administered during the course of the study ."

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 9.1. Overview The proposed Phase 2study is a doubl e-blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, mult icenter study to determine the efficacy and safet y of luspatercept (ACE -536) versus placebo in adult NTDT subjects. The study popul ations, study endpoints, and statistical plan arediscussed below. 9.2. Study Population Definitions Study popul ations to be analyzed are defined as fo llows: Intent -to-treat (ITT): The ITT populat ion will consist of all rando mized subjects regardless o f whether or not the subject received IP. Per Protocol Set (PPS): Subjects in the ITT who have taken at least 1dose of IP and do not have major protocol deviat ions (details will be specified in the SAP prior to database [DB]lock). The PPS popul ation might be used in addit ion to ITT population to analyze primary and secondary endpo ints as detailed in the SAP. Safety: The safet y populati on will consist of all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1dose of IP. Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually received. QoL Evalua blePopulation : The QoL evaluable populat ion consists of all subjects in the ITT popul ation who completed the health -related QoL assessment at baseline (screening) and at least one postbaseline assessment visit. Statistical methods to handle missing data will be described in the SAP. The SAP will also describe detailed rules for data handling and analysis (eg, time windows, visit -by-visit analysis, endpo int analysis, protocol deviat ions). 9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations Based on the assumption o f a targeted primary endpoint response rates at least 50% in the luspatercept group and 10% for the placebo group, and 2:1 randomization, a total sample size of 150 (100 in the luspatercept group, 50in the placebo group) will have at least 99% power to detect the difference between the 2groups with a 2- sided alpha of 0.05 and assumed 10% drop - out rate. For NTDT -PRO T/W domain scores, assume the mean change fro m baseline scores at Week 24 are 1.2 and 0.5 for luspatercept and placebo group, respectively, with a commo n standard deviat ion of 1.2, the statist ical power will be 91%. Randomization and Stratification Subjects will be rando mized to receive luspatercept or placebo at a 2:1 ratio. Randomizat ion will be acco mplished by an IRTto ensure timely registration and randomizat ion. A stratified block rando mizat ion schedule will be implemented. Randomizat ion will be stratified by :"

Background and Demographic Characteristics Subjects’ age, height, weight, and baseline characterist ics will be summarized using descript ive statist ics, while gender, race ,and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency tabul ations by dose cohort. Prior transfusio n history will be summarized. Medi cal history data will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions by Medi cal Dict ionary for Regul ator Act ivities (MedDRA )system organ cl ass and preferred term. Beta-thalassemia diagnoses as well as RBC transfusio n burden will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions. 9.5. Subject Disposition Subject disposit ion (analysis population allocat ion, entered, di scont inued, alon g with primary reason for discont inuat ion) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both treatment and fo llow-up phases. A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol deviat ions will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions. 9.6. Efficacy Analysis Primary analysis will be done after ALL subjects completed 48 weeks or discont inued earlier. Then at the end of the OLP phase, updated safet y and efficacy analysis will be done. 9.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint of t his study is erythro id response, defined as an increase fro m baseline ≥1.0 g/dL in mean of hemoglo bin values over a continuous 12 -week interval fro m Weeks 13 to 24 in the absence of transfusio ns. The Hb values within 21 days fo llowing a transfusio n may be influenced by the transfusio n and will be excluded fro m this analysis. Baseline Hb is the average o f 2 or m ore Hb measurements at least 1 week apart within 4 weeks before Dose 1 .For discontinued subjects who do not complete 24 weeks of the Double -blind Tr eatm ent Peri od, Hb data will continue to be collected (see Table 3). The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT populat ion. Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel (CMH) test will be performed wit h randomizat ion stratificat ion factor(s) in the model to com pare the treatment and placebo groups at 2 -sided 0.05 level; the corresponding 95% confidence interval for odds rati owill also be provided . For a su bject, if the Hb average over Weeks 13 -24 interval cannot be calculated due to missing data, the closest Hb 12- week average will be used."

Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis The analyses of keysecondary efficacy endpoints will be performed on the ITT populat ion. The three key secondary endpoints are as follows: 1) Mean change fro m baseline in NTDT -PRO Ti redness and Weakness (T/W) domain score over a continuous 12- week interval fro m Week 13 to Week 24. 2) Mean change fro m baseline in mean of hemoglo bin values over a c ontinuous 12 -week interval from Week 13 to Week 24 in the absence of transfusio ns. 3) Proporti on of subjects who have an increase from baseline ≥1.0 g/dL in mean of hemoglo bin values over a continuous 12 -week interval from Week 37 to Week 48 in the absence of transfusio ns. To control the overall Type 1 error rate for three key secondary endpoints, the testing procedure will be implemented strictly in order: after the result from the primary efficacy analysis in the ITT populat ion shows statist ical significa nce, the key secondary endpo int 1 will be tested next. The key secondary endpoint 2 will be tested only if the test resul ts for both primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint 1 are significant. The key secondary endpoint 3 will be tested only if the test resul ts for primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoints 1 and 2 are all significant. The details o f the multiplicity control will be specified in the SAP. 9.6.2.1. NTDT -PRO (T /W Domain) Mean Change Between Weeks 13 to 24 Mean NTDT -PRO (T/W domain) change fro m baseline over a 12 -week window between Weeks 13 to 24 will be analyzed using analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA )method with treatment group andrandomization stratificat ion factor(s) in the model score as covariate s. 9.6.2.2. Hemoglobin Mean Change Between Weeks 13 to 24 Mean H emoglobin change fro m baseline over 12 -week window between Weeks 13 to 24 during the treatment period will be analyzed using ANCOVA method with treatment group and rando mizat ion stratificat ion factor(s) in the model value as covariate s. 9.6.2.3.

Definition of NTDT -PRO Minimum Clinical Importan t Difference (MCID )and Responder Definition (RD)Thresholds The minimum clinical important difference (MCID) is the amount of difference in a PRO measure between treatment groups in a clinical trial that will be interpreted as a treatment benefit. The res ponder definit ion (RD) thresho ld is the individual subject score change over a predetermined time period that will be interpreted as a treatment benefit. In case of MCID and RDRD threshol ds for the NTDT -PRO will be primarily determined with longitudinal anchor - based methods priorto database lock and unblinding using data collected over a 12 -week window between Weeks 13 to 24 . Distribut ion-based m ethods will also be used as addit ional supporting evidence. Anchors to be considered include the PGI-C, PGI-S,SF-36v2 Vitalit y and Physical Funct ioning scales, and FACIT -F score. PGI-Sis included as an extra i tem administered at the end of each NTD T-PRO assessment (see Secti on6.8). After the database lock and unblinding, statist ical analysis will be performed for unblinded data. Proporti on of subjects wi th a decrease fro m baseline ≥ RD in mean NTDT -PRO T/W score, over Weeks 13 to 24 and Weeks 37 to 48 in the luspatercept group will be co mpared with the placebo group.

ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury , or any concomi tant impai rment of the subject’s healt h, including laboratory test val ues (as specified by the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensi ty of a pre - exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF rather than the individual signs or symptom s of the di agnosis or syndro me. Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity,or toxi city to an investigational product should be reported as an AE.Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associ ated wi th an AE should be reported on the overdose eCRF . (See Section 7.2.1.3 for the definit ion of overdose. ) Any sequela of an accidental or intent ional overdose of an investigat ional product should be reported as an AE on the AE eCRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE eCRF. The overdose result ing in the SAE shoul d be ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and eCRF but should not be reported as an SAE i tself. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary . There is no known specific ant idote for luspatercept overdose. Actual treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience o f the treating physician. All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study . Asses sments m ay include m onitoring of any or all o f the following parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical , radiological or surgical findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. All AEs regardless of causalit y will be recorded by the Invest igator fro m the time the subject signs informed consent until 9 weeks after the last dose of IP as well as those SAEs made known to the Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being rela ted to IP. In addition, SAEs that are suspected to be related tothe IPas well as new malignancies or prem alignancies regardl ess of causalit y(see Secti on10.5.3 ) will be recorded by the Investiga toruntil at least 5 years fro m first dose of IP, or 3 y ears f rom last dose (whichever occurs later) in this study or rollover study .Inform ation will be collected at scheduled visits (see Table of Events, Table 3, and Section6.3for addi tional information.AEs and SAEs will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF and in the subject ’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method , using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form."

Evaluation of Adverse Events A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 10.2.1. Seriousness An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (i e, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate risk of death fro m the AE); Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on (hospi talizat ion is defined as an inpatient admissio n, regardl ess of l ength of stay ); Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions); Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect; Const itutes an important medical event. Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may jeopardi ze the subject or requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for: a standard procedure for protocol therapy administrati on.However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of therapy administrati on will be reported as an SAE. routi ne treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deteri oration in condit ion. the administration o f blood or pl atelet tran sfusionsas a routine treatment of the studi ed indicat ion.However, hospitalization or prolo nged hospitalizat ion for a complicat ion of such transfusio n rem ains a reportable SAE. a procedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, e ndoscopy , sampling for laboratory tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable SAE. hospi talizati on or prol ongati on of hospi talizati on for technical , practica l, or social reasons, in absence of an AE. a procedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study ); must be docum ented in the source document and the eCRF. Hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospi talizati on for a com plicati on remains a rep ortable SAE."

If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the eCRF and the SAE Report Form must be completed. For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, relationship to the IP, action taken regarding the IP, and outcome. 10.2.2. Severity/ Intensity For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/ intensity of the event. The severit y/intensity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms accordi ng to the current active minor versio n of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Versi on 4.0); http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40 AEs that are not defined in CTCAE should be evaluated for s everit y/intensity according to the following scale: Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical intervent ion/therapy requi red Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may be need ed; no or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy required Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalizatio n is possible Grade 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation i n activit y, significant assistance requi red; significant medical intervent ion/therapy requi red, hospi talizat ion or hospice care probable Grade 5 =Death -the event results in death The term “severe ”is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific ev ent (as in mild, moderate , or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious”which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or funct ioning. Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory obligat ions. 10.2.3. Causality The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration of the IP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic"

Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship betw een the IP and the adverse event. Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available inform ation.Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes available. If an event is assessed as suspe cted of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a r ecord of the start and stop dates of the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable (eg, di scont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if concomi tant and/or addi tional treatm ents were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs. All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE ). 10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality: resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study; requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic intervent ion; or is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease process and/or organ toxicity oris an exacerbat ion or worsening o f an exist ing condi tion. Regardless of severit y grade, only laboratory abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion need to be documented as a serious adverse event.

If possible, the la boratory abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an abnorm al laboratory resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than decreased platelets). 10.4. Pregnancy All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events. 10.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential: Females of childbearing potential (FCBPs) are advised to avoid beco ming pregnant during study and for 12 weeks after the last dose of IP. Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or posi tive pregnancy test in a femal e subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP , or wi thin 9 weeks of the subject ’s last dose of IP, are considered immediately reportable events. Invest igational product is to be discontinued immediately . The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy test m ust be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y immediately by email , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form , or approved equivalent form. The female subject may be referred to an obstetrician- gyneco logist or another appropriate healt hcare professio nal for further eva luation. The Investigator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy and must notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately about the outcom e of the pregnancy (either norm al or abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy Follow-up Report Form orapproved equivalent form. If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any o f the seri ous criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celg ene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report Form , or approved equivalent form . All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, witho ut regard to causalit y, as SAEs. In addit ion, any infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 ho urs of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form . 10.4.2. Male Subjects If a female partner of a male subject taking IP becomes pregnant, the male subject taking IP shoul d notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their healt hcare provider immediately . Males are advised to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with FCBP prior to starting investigat ional product and continue for 12 weeks fo llowing the last dose of IP, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy."

Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the complet ion of an SAE Report Form in addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the eCRF. All SAEs m ust be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator ’s knowledge of the event by facsimile, or other appropriate method (eg, via email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.This instructi on pertains to init ial SAE r eports as well as any follow-up reports. The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent. This requi rement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relatio nship to IP) that occur during the study (from the time the subject signs informed consent unt il 9 weeks after the l ast dose of IP in the DBTP and/or OLP ) or any SAE m ade known to th e Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured. The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary of hospi tal records and other relevant documents. If a subject died and an autopsy has been perform ed, copi es of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug Safety as soon as these beco me available. Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safet y. Where required by local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE inform ation on file including correspondence wit h Celgene and the IRB/EC. 10.5.1. Safety Queries Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m Celgene Drug Safet y to the si te via facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is expected to be no m ore than five (5) business days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causalit y assessment) m ay be handled by phone. 10.5.2. Thromboembolic Events The occurrence of a thromboembo lic event will be monitored as an event of interest and should be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study . Invest igators are to report the occurrence of thromboembo lic events as SAEs to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours , regardl ess of causal relationship to IP, occurring at any time for the duration of the study , from the time of signing the ICF through 9 weeks post last dose. Beyond 9weeks post last -dose peri od, only related thromboembolic events shoul dbe reported. 10.5.3. Malignancy and Premalignancy Reporting The occurrence of a new malignancy or premalignant lesio n will be monitored as an event of interest and shoul d be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study .

Docum entati on of the diagnosed m alignancy must be provided at the time o f reporti ng as a serious adverse event ( eg, any confirmatory histol ogy or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, CT scans, etc.). Malignancies or cancerous tumorsare lesions capable of invading into adjacent tissu es, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues. A benign tumor has none of those properties. Malignancy or cancer is characterized by anaplasia, invasiveness, and metastasis. Prem alignant or precancerous lesio ns refer to a state of disordered morph ology of cells that i s associ ated wi th an increased ri sk of cancer. If left untreated, these condit ions may lead to cancer. Such condit ions are usually eit her dy splasia or benign neoplasia (and the dividing line between those is sometimes blurry). Somet imes the term “precancer ”is used to describe carcino ma in situ, whi ch is a noninvasive cancer that has not progressed to an aggressive, invasive stage. Not all carcino ma in situ will progress to invasive disease. Prem alignant l esions are m orphol ogically at ypical ti ssue which appears abnormal under microscopic examinat ion, and in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparent ly norm al counterpart. 10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y willdetermine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to luspatercept based on the Investigator Brochure. In the United States, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported in an expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32. For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authori ties and Ethi cs Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S USARs) in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verificat ion and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on invest igational products for human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with coun try-specific requirements. In addit ion, any report of hematologic malignancy regardl ess of causalit y in the l uspatercept arm will be reported to the Regul atory Authori tiesin an expedited manner , if requested . Celgene or i ts authori zed representative shall notify the Invest igator of the fo llowing inform ation: Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studi es that is both serious and unexpected (ie, SUSAR); Any finding fro m tests i n laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicit y, teratogeni city, or carcinogenicit y."

Emergency Identification of Investigational Products (Emergency Unblinding) The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinio n of the Invest igator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically imperat ive to know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discont inued if, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, continuing IP can negat ively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment. The decisio n to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibilit y of the treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor. However, the Investigator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the subject. The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance wit h the protocol. The Invest igator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Invest igator in the subject’s source documentation. Emergency unblinding shoul d only be perf ormed by the Invest igator through the IRT."

Subject Information and Informed Consent The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative prior to any study related procedures. Docum entati on that inform ed cons ent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date. The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person conse nting the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Invest igator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. In addition, if a protocol is amended and i t impacts on the content of the informed conse nt, the ICF must be revised. Study subjects participat ing in the study when the am ended protocol is implemented must be re - consented with the revised versio n of the ICF. The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consent ing the study subject m ust be m aintained in the Invest igator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. 13.4. Confidentiality Celgene affirmsthe subject's ri ght to protection against invasio n of privacy and to be in compliance wi th ICH and other l ocal regul ations (whichever i s most stringent). Celgene requi res the Invest igator to permit Celgene representatives and, when necessary , representati ves fro m regul atory authori ties, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. Shoul d direct access to m edical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibilit y of the Invest igator to obtain such permissio n in writing fro m the appropri ate individual. 13.5. Protocol Amendments Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by theCelgene Clinical Research Physician/Medical Monitor. Amendments will be subm itted to the IRB/EC for written approval. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended versio n occurs. The written si gned approval from the IRB/EC shoul d specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are administrative in nature do not require IRB/EC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/EC for inform ation purposes. 13.6.

This documentation must also include a list of the members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualificat ions. If the IRB/EC will not disclo se the names, occupations and qualificat ions of the committee members, it should be asked to issue a statement confirming that the composit ion of the committee is in accordance wit h GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Numb er may be accepted as a subst itute for this list. Formal approval by the IRB/EC should ment ion the protocol t itle, number, amendment number (if applicable), study site (or regi on or area of jurisdict ion, as applicable), and any other docum ents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decisio n was made and must be officially signed by a commi ttee m ember. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study , all ethical and l egal requi rements m ust be m et. The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, mu st be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments in accordance wit h local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICFshoul d also be revised. The Investigator must keep a record of all co mmunicat ion with the IRB/EC and, if applicable, between a Coordinat ing Invest igator and the IRB/EC. This statement also applies to any communicat ion between the Invest igator (or Coordinat ing Investigator, if applicable) and regul atory authori ties. Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by Celgene and the IRB/EC prior to use. 13.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board/ Ethics Committee If required by legislat ion or the IRB/EC, the Investigator must sub mit to the IRB/EC: Inform ation on serious or unexpected adverse events as soon as possible; Periodic reports on the progress of the study; Deviat ions from the protocol or any thing that may involve added risk to subjects. 13.8. Termination of the Study Celgene reserves the right to terminate this study prem aturely at any time for reasonable medical or administrative reasons. Any premature discont inuat ion will be appropriately documented according to l ocal requi rements (e g, IRB/EC, regulatory authori ties, etc). The Sponsor m ay consider cl osing this tri al when data supporting key endpoints and objectives of the study have been analyzed. In the case where there are subjects still being administered the investigat ional product, and it is the opinio n of the investigato r(s) that these subjects continue to receive benefit from treatment ,the subjects may transit ion toa rollover protocol (ACE - 536- LTFU - 001) to allow these subjects continued access to luspatercept following thei r participati on in this study (ACE -536-B- THAL - 002 )until the drug is commercially available and reimbursable ."

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE All aspects of the study will be carefully mo nitored by Celgene or its authori zed representative for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns wit h respect to current GCP and SOPs. 15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study .All aspects of the study are reviewed wit h the Invest igator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study , a Celgene representati ve will review the protocol, eCRFs, procedures for ob taining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator. Moni toring will include on -site visi ts with the Investigator and his/her staff as well as any appropriate communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During m onitoring visi ts, the f acilities, investigat ional product storage area, eCRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study docum entat ion will be inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative in accordance wit h the Study Moni toring Pl an. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of the entries made onto the eCRFs against the appropriat e source documentation. Any result ing discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary correcti ons will be made direct ly to the eCRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures req uire that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclusion criteria and docum entati on of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Addit ional monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an. 15.2. Audits and Inspections In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Pract ice Qualit y Assurance unit exists wit hin Celgene. Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activit ies in accordance with Celgene appropriate SOPs to evaluate complian ce wi th Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulat ions. The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilit ies where the study took place, source documents, eCRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject parti cipat ion for audits and inspect ions by IRB/ECs, regulatory authori ties (eg, Food and Drug Administration [FDA ], European Medicines Agency [ EMA ], Health Canada) and com pany authorized representatives. The Invest igator should make every effort to be available for the audits a nd/or inspections. If the Investigator is contacted by any regul atory authori ty regarding an inspect ion, he/she shoul d contact Celgene immediately. 15.3.
