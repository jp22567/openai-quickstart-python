Provision for 25mcg to be included at a later date has also been added. Randomisation ratio has been updated to add the 12. 5mcg dose strength and to allow for the 25mcg dose strength. Explanation for this change has been added where appropriate and wording related to the planning of this change has been removed.Additional lower dose strengths have been added to fully profile the dose response. This was planned in the original protocol Section 6.2, Exclusion 20Exclusion criteria related to QTc adjusted to permit triplicate ECGs as opposed to single ECGs for assessment of QTc interval criteria.Adjusted in line with permissib le GSK safety requirements. Section 6.2, Exclusion 13, Appendix 10Exclusion 13 adjusted to clarify wording and to remove the restriction of theophylline. Associated Appendix 10 removedTheophylline can be used in accordance with standard practicein ligh t of emerging drug:drug interaction data. Section 6.2, Exclusion 16, Section 7.7Exclusion 16 removed and wording in Permitted Medication section clarifiedDiscussion between respiratory and sleep experts indicate that if participants are on a stable dose of CPAP or NIPPV that started prior to screening this is acceptable and won’t interfere with efficacy endpoints. Section 8.1, 8.2 The following events were moved from the Withdrawal From Study section to the Discontinuation of Study Treatment section: Pneumonia Acute Respiratory Acidosis/invasive mechanical ventilation Significant changes to ECG, Vital signs, Lab tests. PregnancyNone of these events require withdrawal from study. Participants that discontinue IP due to these events may remain in the stu dy. Section 9.2.1 Time period for collection of SAES has been adjusted to only collect SAEs between ICF and start of study treatment if they are assessed to be related to study participation, or related to a GSK product.Collection of ALL SAEs between the signing of ICF and start of study treatment was agreed to be unnecessary. The requirement has reverted to the GSK standard for the time period for collection of SAEs.

Synopsis , Overall Design , Section 3.1, 5.1, 5.5, 7.1Clarification provided that dosing at V2 can be performed up to 3pm, extended from 12midday in the previous protocol.Extended in recognition that there a large number of assessments to be performed and Visits 1 and 2 prior to dosing. Accumulation of drug is observed in the repeat dose pharmacokinetics of nemiralisib of approximately at least 2- fold and therefore dosing up until 3:00 pm on Day 1 does not pose a risk of overd osing on Day 2 when the Day 2 dose is administered in the morning (as early as 6:00 am [i.e., approximately 15 hours after the previous day’s dose]) Section 6.2, Exclusion 9, Section 9Exclusion 9 clarified to allow randomisation ahead of receipt of virol ogy results, with participants to be withdrawn if subsequently found to be positive. Other sections updated to further explain thisTurnaround time of virology is greater than the 48h screening window Synopsis, Study Rationale, Section 5.1, 7.1Start of SoC was defined This was not clear previously Section 7.1, S ection 9 Clarified throughout that the time of randomisation is anchored to the start of SoC (i.e. 48hrs from start of SoC)This was clarified because some sections anchored time of randomisation to completing screening assessments whilst other anchored time of randomisation to start of SoC which was difficult to interpret/manage. SoA, Section 9.1Confirmation added that V1 and V2 can be combined and clarification given on what assessments to be done if V1 and V2 combinedClarified following feedback from investigators SoA Removed requirement for Laboratory assessments at V2 Recognition that only one laboratory assessment is required prior to randomisation. 3.3 Benefit/Risk AssessmentInformatio n about interaction with inhibitors of CYP304 inhibitors and CYP3A4 substrates has been addedThis risk was omitted previously 2019N398117_00"

Benefit:Risk assessment remains unchanged. Synopsis, S ection 5.1, 7.2, Appendix 3Required membership of the iSRC has been adjusted. Independent clinician with experience in respiratory and general medicine was agreed t o be adequate by the safety group in place of a respiratory clinician and a cardiologist. SoA SoA updated to add IRT visit at Week 3 Previously omitted in error Section 5.1 Definition of moderate and severe exacerbations added in Section 5.1 for clarityPreviously this was only in the appendix which could have been overlooked Section 6.3.4 Clarification that if participants are unable to withhold their usual scheduled COPD medications on the day of a clinic visit the visit may still take place.This was added to recognise the fact that some patients may not be able to withhold their usual COPD medications if experiencing an exacerbation. Section 7.1 Clarification provided that treatment of subsequent exacerbations during the study do not need to follow t he SoC definition for the Index exacerbationClarified following feedback by investigators SoA, Section 7.6 The requirement to enter dose counter information, and date and time of each dose administered in the clinic into the eCRF in countries where the p ropeller health sensor is used has been addedPreviously omitted in error Section 7.7 Reference to prohibited CYP3A4 inhibitors and narro w therapeutic index substrates added here directin gthe reader to Exclusion no. 13Added so that important prohibited medication information is not missed. Section 9 Central lab volumes updated in line with central lab specificationsPrecise central lab volumes were not available at writing of the protocol Section 9 Clarification added that local laboratory results must be received prior to randomisation to allow review of Exclusion 9 and 1 8This was not previously clear. Section 9.1 Reminder added to the section on spirometry that rescue medication and usual daily COPD medications should be withheld on the moring of sp irometry assessmentsAdded because this is an important element of the spirometry assessment. 2019N398117_00"
6,page_6,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 7Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale Section 9.1 Clarification added that the first EXACT -PRO will be completed in the morning whilst for the remainder of the study it will be performed in the eveni ng.This is because it is important that at randomisation the EXACT -PRO is completed before any other assessments are completed. Section 9.2.7, Appendix 9The section relating to DREs was simplified as previous wording was not clear. Appendix 9 was updat ed in line with this.To clarify how and when to record exacerbations, which are considered DREs, in the eCRF Section 9.3 Text regarding the treatment of overdose was adjusted To ensure that definition of an overdose and required actions are clear and appropriate for a double -blind study. Section 9.4.1 Clarification added around when a complete physical exam is required and when a brief physical exam is requiredPreviously this was not documented in the protocol. Section 9.4.2 Timing of vital signs was a djusted Previously it was not consistent with other sections. Section 9.4.3 Paragraph referring to other QT correction formula has been removedPreviously this was inconsistent with other paragraphs/sections Section9.4.3 Clarification added that a local ECG can be used to assess eligibility criteria however a central ECG must be performed at screeningThis was implicit previously and so has ben mad explicit following feedback from investigators Section 9.4.4, Appendix 2Use of local labs at screening ha s been made mandatory This is because the turnaround time of safety labs results from the central lab is longer than the 48hr screening window. Section 9.4.4 Requirement to record non protocol specified local labs in the eCRF has been remo vedThere is no facility in the eCRF to record local labs Seciton 10.2 Definition of All Patients Enrolled (APE) Population redefined To define a more appropriate APE population in line with the RAP Appendix 9 Further information provided for the definition of Severe COPD exacerbationClarified following feedback from Investigators Various Sections Repetition of information was removed from various sections To simplify the protocol 2019N398117_00"

SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A Phase IIb, Randomized (Stratified), Double -Blind (Sponsor Open), Parallel -Group, P lacebo -Controlled, Dose- Finding Study of Nemiralisib (GSK2269557) Added to Standard of Care (SoC) Versus SoC Alone in Participants Diagnosed with an Acute Moderate or Severe Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Short Title: A Dose -Finding Study of Nemiralisib (GSK2269557) Added to Standard of Care (SoC) Versus SoC Alone in Participants Diagnosed with an Acute Moderate or Severe Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Rationale: GSK2269557 (hereafter referred to a ccording to the generic name ‘nemiralisib,’ with the exception of reference to a previous study [ies] that used an earlier formulation of GSK2269557) is a potent and highl y selective inhaled Phosphoinositide 3- Kinase Delta (PI3Kd) inhibitor being developed as an anti -inflammatory for the treatment of inflammatory airway s disease. To date, nemiralisib has been administered to participants with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and to health y volunteers (both smoker s and former smokers). This study will be undertaken in COPD participants diagnosed with an acute moderate or severe exacerbation of COPD requiring treatment with SoC. Standard of Care (S oC) for the index exacerbation is defined for this protocol as treat ment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroid(s) (prednisone 40 mg/day or equivalent) for 5 days and antibiotic[s] for 7 days; the dose and/or duration of prednisone (40 mg or equivalent) and/or the antibiotic can be modified according to the Investigator’s/medic ally qualified designee’s judgement or according to local country /institution practice. The start of SoC is defined as the start of either oral/sy stemic corticosteroids[s] or antibiotic[s] whichever is earliest . Participants will be treated with nemiralis ib or placebo in addition to SoC. The study is designed to assess the dose response, efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of nemiralisib across a range of doses (up to 750 mcg) compared with placebo for 12 weeks, with an additional 12- week post -treatment follow -up period. The range of doses to be evaluated in this study should be sufficient to enable full characterization of the dose response curve of nemiralisib, with respect to the primary endpoint (change from baseline in Clinic Visit trough forced e xpiratory volume in one second [FEV 1] measured post - bronchodilator at Day 84). This study is also designed to estimate the rate reduction of re-exacerbations on a selected dose of nemiralisib compared with placebo. The information obtained from study 2008 79 will be used to select the optimally effective and safe dose of nemiralisib for further COPD studies. I n addition, this study will evaluate and confirm the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nemiralisib within a subset of the patient population. 2019N398117_00"

This study consists of a Screening Period, a 12- Week Treatment Period and a 12 -Week Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period. Participants will visit the hospital (participants who are hospitalized for the index exacerbation of COPD)/clinic a minimum of eight (if Screening and Randomization visit combined) to nine times over a 24 -week period as shown in the Study Schematic below.

The option to add a dose strength of 25 mcg following the results of an unblinded interim analysis has been included if further characterization of the lower end of the dose response curve is required PK Subgroup: Sparse PK sampling will be conducted at selected sites. The PK Subgroup will be identical to the main study in terms of the study population, design, and conduct, with the exception of blood draws (3 per visit on Day s 14 and 28) for PK analysis. An internal Safet y Revi ew Committee (iSRC) will have study oversight to ensure that it meets the highest standards of ethics and participant safet y and to carry out the planned interim safet y data anal yses/data reviews. Data will be reviewed b y the iSRC on a periodic basis, as defined in the iSRC Charter. The iSRC, which will comprise a minimum of 3 people (including an independent statistician, and an independent clinician with experience in respiratory and general medicine ), will be authorized to review unblinded interim safe ty anal yses/data during the study . Number of Participant s: Approximately 1,667 participants will be screened (assumes an approximate 25% Screen Failure rate) to achieve approximately 1,250 randomized participants who present with an acute moderate or sever e exacerbation of COPD, such that approximately 1,000 participants (assumes an approximate 20% withdrawal rate) complete the 12 -Week Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified by index COPD exacerbation severit y (moderate or severe) and b y whether or not that participant is in the PK Subgroup, to ensure a balance across treatments within each strata. The plan is to randomize approximately 340 participants each to the placebo and nemiralisib 750 mcg groups and approximately 570participants across the other nemiralisib groups. The reason for inflating the sample size for a selected dose of nemiralisib (planned as the 750 mcg dose) and the placebo group is for the aim to increase precision around the pair -wise comparison between them for the key secondary objective of the reduction in the rate of re-exacerbations. Treatment Groups and Duration: The term ‘stud y treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe an y combination of products received b y the participant as per the protocol design. Stu dy treatment may therefore refer to the individual study treatments or the combination of those study treatments. 2019N398117_00"

Participants will visit the hospital/ clinic a minimum of eight to nine times over a 24 -week period as shown in the Study Schematic above . Following determination of eligibility , participants will be randomized into the study at Visit 2 (Randomization/Day 1). The total duration of study participation is approximately 6 months (170 day s). Participants will be required to participate in the following: Screening ( -2 to -1/0 Days Prior to Visit 2 [Randomization/Day 1]): Following diagnosis of an acute moderate/severe exacerbation of COPD during outpatient assessment by the Investigator, or designated phy sician, or during an Emergency Department visit or acute admission to hospital: 1. The start of the SoC for the index exacerbation is defined as the start of either oral/sy stemic corticosteroids[s] or antibiotic[s] whichever is earliest and is expected to start shortly after diagnosis, though it may alread y have been started before formal diagnosis of COPD exacerbation. If SoC is started >48 hours prior to diagnosis, the participant is not eligible to participate, but may be re -screened in the future as described in the main protocol. 2.All Screening/baseline assessments should be completed within 48hrs of start of SoC . 12-Week Double -Blind Treatment Period : Once -daily study treatment admi nistration will start on Day 1 (Visit 2). At the end of the Screening Period ( -2 to -1/0 days), participants who meet all of the Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion Criteria will complete Visit 2 (Randomization Visit/Day 1). If a participant meet s all of the eligibility criteria, it is possible for him/her to complete the Screening Visit and the Randomization Visit on the same day (e.g., outpatient participant who presents with an acute moderate exacerbation of COPD). At this visit, participants will be randomized to receive one of the doses of nemiralisib QD or placebo QD in addition to SoC for 12 weeks. Randomization and the first dose of the double- blind study treatment administration should take place in the morning, as soon as possible follo wing determination of eligibility and completion of the baseline PRO measures, including the EXACT -PRO questionnaire for the day of randomization, and FEV 1measurement and no later than 48hrs after the start of SoC . Note: In the event that completion of the assessments/procedures at Visit 2 (or in cases where Visit 1 and Visit 2 are conducted on the same day ) extends past noon, the first dose of the double- blind study treatment administration may occur up until 3:00 pm on Day 1.

20,page_20,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 21Participants will be permitted to continue taking inhaled maintenance COPD medications (e.g., long -acting bronchodilators, long- acting beta 2- agonist/corticost eroid combinations, long -acting muscarinic antagonist/long -acting bronchodilator combinations, etc.). Study -supplied rescue medication (albuterol [salbutamol] metered -dose inhaler [MDI ] or nebules) for treatment of acute symptoms of COPD will also be perm itted. Other concomitant medications, may be allowed at the discretion of the GSK Medical Monitor and/or Investigator Participants will then dose at home each morning until Day 84 (– 4 / + 3 day s), with the exception of the day s when participants come to the clinic. On those days, they will dose at the clinic. During the 12 -week Treatment Period, participants will return to the clinic on an outpatient basis for Visits 3 -6 on Study Day s 14 (± 3 day ), 28 (± 3 day s), 56 ( –4 / + 3 days) and 84 ( –4 / + 3 day s) to complete the assessments described in the Schedule of Assessments. Participants who withdraw from the stud y before completing the 12 -week Treatment Period will be asked to return to the clinic within 24 hours (or as soon as possible) for end of treat ment assessments (Earl y Withdrawal Visit). If a participant is withdrawn from study treatment, he/she will continue existing maintenance COPD therapy or will be prescribed appropriate treatment for COPD and will move directl y tothe 12- Week Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period for collection of data starting with Visit 7, 28 day s after the discontinuation of study treatment. 12-Week Post -Treatment Follow -up Period: The 12 -week period following the last dose of double -blind study treatment.

Participants who withdraw from the stud y before completing the 12 -week Post - Treatment Follow-Up Period will be asked to return to the clinic within 24 hours (or as soon as possible) for end of study assessments (Earl y Withdrawal Visit). Interim anal yses may be performed, recruitment rate permitting, to potentially adapt the randomization ratio across the doses to help characterize the dose response profile of FEV 1, to stop the study for futility , to assess the initial study assumptions and to change theproportions for the stratification of index exacerbation by severit y (moderate or severe). Also, depending upon the findings of the iSRC reviews (See Appendix 3 ), participants in this protocol will continue to be randomized accordi ng to the current randomization schedule (i.e., 3: 1:1:1:1:1:3) or randomization to a given stud y treatment arm(s) may be reduced/halted and the randomization allocation for the given study treatment arm(s) may 2019N398117_00"

Screening: Due to the short screening window, local laboratory results will be used for purposes of determining subject eligi bility for randomization. If local laboratory results are already available within 48 hours from diagnosis of the index COPD exacerbation, these results can be used for determination of subject eligibi lity; there is no need to take another sample for local analysis. A sample for central laboratory analysis should also be obtained . 10. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or positive hepatitis C antibody test result at Screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment or positive test for HIV antibody is exclusionary. NOTE: Participants with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained. Positive hepatitis C RNA test result at Screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study trea tment is exclusiona ry. NOTE: Hepatitis C RNA test is optional and participants with negative Hepatitis C antibody test are not required to also undergo Hepatitis C RNA testing. Because of the short window for Screening, double - blind study treatment may start before the resu lts of the hepatitis and HIV tests have been received. If subsequently the test(s) is(are) found to be positive, the participant will need to be withdrawn from study treatment and may also be withdrawn from the study as judged by the Principal Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 11. If the urine pregnancy text result is positive, a blood sample for serum pregnancy testing will need to be conducted to confi rm pregnancy status 12. Approximately 20 mL (4 teaspoons) of blood will be collected in all participants at each time point noted; at Screening, the sample should be collected as soon as possible after the participant has completed the informed consent and PRO assessments 13. Informed consent for optional sub -studies (e.g. genetics research, PK) must be obtained before collecting a sample/performing procedure 14. Collected at Visit 2 or any time post -randomization if unable to collect at Visit 2 15. A spontaneous sputum sample will be collected at Screening/Day 1 (pre -dose) and Day 56 in participants who are willing and able to spontaneously produce sputum 16. PK Subgroup: Subset of participants (approximately 300) at selected sites –blood samples will be collected on site at Visit 3 (Day 14) and Visit 4 (Day 28) at trough (pre -dose), between 0 -1 hour post- dose a nd between >1 hour to 6 hours post -dose (total of 3 samples at each visit). 17.

Stud y Rationale Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) refers to the two disease processes chronic bronchitis and emphy sema. Inflammation in the lung has been linked to the pathogenesis of COPD. In COPD, tobacco smoke or other irritants activate epithelial cells and macrophages to release inflammatory mediators such a s chemokines that attract neutrophils and T cells to the lung. The inflammation associated with COPD is characterized b y a prominent infiltration of neutrophils in lung tissue and the airways. It is believed that the neutrophil, via elaboration of tissue destructive proteases and inflammatory mediators, play s a key role in the tissue destruction and decline in lung function that occurs in COPD. Phosphoinositide 3 -Kinase Delta (PI3Kd), a lipid kinase expressed predominately in leukocy tes, is thought to hold much promise as a therapeutic target for inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. PI 3Kd is a member of the Class IA family of phosphoinositides 3 -kinases (PI3Ks) that are involved in many cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation and migration. PI3Kd is thought to play a role in various epithelial responses relevant for the development of COPD. Therefore ,a PI3Kd inhibitor may suppress a number of these processes [ Kim, 2010]. Macrophages appear to be alternativel y activated in COPD and their competence to phagocytose infective pathogens is reduced as a result of this alternative action. PI 3Kd is one of the mediators involved in determining this alterna tive phenoty pe and therefore its inhibition could rebalance the macrophage activation towards a classic phagocy tic phenoty pe [Weisser , 2011]. Macrophages would then be more competent in clearing bacterial infection, a major cause of exacerbations in COPD. The neutrophil and T cell are the two major inflammatory cells ty pes of COPD and both are targeted b y PI3Kd inhibitors. For example, a PI 3Kd inhibitor prevents release of neutrophil elastase and reactive ox ygen s pecies (ROS) [ Sadhu , 2003] and therefore could be useful in limiting tissue damage and prevent remodeling of the airway s which leads to compromised lung function. I n contract, PI 3Kd should not globally inhibit neutro phil functions required for innate immune defense such as phagocy tosis and bacterial killing. 2019N398117_00"
29,page_29,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 30PI3Kd inhibitors may also provide benefits in preventing infections by common airway bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumonia [ Fallah , 2011]. I n this report PI3Kd is shown to reduce the macrophage -derived cy tokines required to mount an effective antibody response to S. pneumonia in the elderl y. Furthermore, PI 3Kd inhibition restores age - associated aberrant neutrophil migrati on [Sapey , 2014]. Activation of the PI3Kd pathway in criticall y ill patients has been linked to impairment neutrophil phagocytosis, which could be restored with a PI 3Kd selective inhibitor [ Morris , 2011]. Finally , PI3Kd activating mutations have recently been identified in groups of primary immunodeficient patients that suffer from viral infections and recurring lung bacterial infections due to mainly S. pneumonia and H. influen za. This results in progressive pulmonary sepsis and increasing morbidity and mortality [Angulo , 2013; Lucas, 2014]. Nemiralisib is a potent and highl y selective inhaled PI 3Kd i nhibitor being developed as an anti -inflammatory for the treatment of inflammatory airway s diseases. Therefore, it has the potential to be a novel therap y in patients with COPD. This double -blind (Sponsor Open) stud y is primarily designed to assess the dose response, efficacy and safety of sixdose regimens of nemiralisib ( 12.5, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 mcg QD) and placebo in addition to standard of care (SoC) for 12 -weeks in participants with COPD who present with a moderate or severe acute exacerbati on of COPD . The option to add a dose strength of 25 mcg following the results of an unblinded interim analy sis has been included if further characterization of the lower end of the dose response curve is required. Standard of Care (SOC) for the index exace rbation is defined for this protocol as treatment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroid(s) (prednisone 40 mg/day or equivalent) for 5 days andantibiotic[s] for 7 day s; the dose and/or duration of prednisone (40 mg/day or equivalent) and/or the antibiotic can be modified according to the Investigator’s/medicall y qualified designee’s judgement or according to local country /institution practice. The start of SoC is defined as the start of either oral/sy stemic corticosteroids[s] or antibiotic[s] whichever is earl iest. In addition, this study includes a 12 -week Post- Treatment Follow -up Period to assess the potential benefit of nemiralisib following completion of treatment. All study treatments will be administered once -daily in the morning (with the exception of Visit 2where the dose may be administered up to 3:00pm, in cases where completion of the study assessments/procedures extends past noon) via the ELLIPTA inhaler with the clip-on Propeller Sensor (where available) . In addition to double -blind study treatme nt and SoC treatment for the COPD exacerbation, other treatment(s) for the exacerbation (i.e., bronchodilators) and regular COPD maintenance therap y are permitted. The information obtained from study 200879 will be used to select the optimally effective a nd safe dose of nemiralisib for further COPD studies. I n addition, this study will evaluate and confirm the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of nemiralisib. 3.2. Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation 2019N398117_00"
30,page_30,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 31that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused b y significant exposure to noxious particles or gases [ GOL D, 2017]. CO PD is a major cause of disability , morbidity , and mortality , resulting in millions of deaths annuall y worldwide [ GOL D, 2017] contributing significantly to health care costs [ Darne ll, 2013; Chapman, 2006]. I n the United States, COPD is now the third leading cause of death [ National Center for Health Statistics , 2016]. The morbidity and mortality associate d with COPD are continuing to increase. Globally , it is estimated that about 3 million deaths were caused by COPD in 2015 (that is, 5% of all deaths globally in that y ear); and, b y the year 2030, COPD is expected to be the third leading cause of death wor ldwide [ WHO , 2016]. COPD is characterized by s ymptoms of chronic and progressive breathlessness (or dyspnea), cough, and sputum production which can be a major cause of disability and anxiety associated with the disease. Most COPD patients also suffer from periodic worsening of their COPD sy mptoms (COPD exacerbations). COPD exacerbations account for a significant proportion of COPD- related and total health care costs and are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, health status, and increased risk for mortality with the cumulative risk for a next exacerbation or mortality increasing with each successive exacerbation [ Donaldson, 2006; Suissa , 2012]. Despite several available therapies that have been shown to impact COPD exacerbations, many COPD patients continue to experience exacerbations of their disease, resulting in a large unmet medical need. Thus, therapies effective in further reducing COPD exacerbations and improving the respiratory symptoms associated with COPD will have a substantial impact on healthcare utilization and most importantly improvement in COPD patients' qualit y of life. COPD refers to the two disease processes chronic bronchitis and emphy sema, and inflammation in the lung has been linked to the pathogenesis of COPD. In COPD, tobacco smoke, other irritants, and/or bacterial colonization activate epithelial cells and macrophages to release inflammatory mediators such as chemokines that attract neutrophils and T cells to the lungs. Exacerbations in COPD are driven b y episodes of acute inflammation, usually following a viral or bacterial infection. The rate of moderate exacerbations (i.e., those treated with antibiotics and/or oral corticosteroids), as reported in a large observational clinical cohort study of patients diagnosed with COPD in the United States and the United Kingdom (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints, ECLIPSE) was 0.99 per patient y ear [Hurst , 2010]. The rate of severe exacerbations (i.e., those resulting in hospital admission) from the same observational study was 0.22 per patient y ear [Hurst , 2010]. Between a quarter (25% [ McGhan , 2007]) and half (50% [Corral -Gudino , 2011]) of patients hospitalized for a COPD exacerbation will be re- hospitalized for another COPD exacerbation within the following 12 months. While current maintenance therapies may reduce the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations in patients with COPD, some patients are particularl y susceptible to repeated exacerbation events, resulting in frequent use of o ral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics and, in some cases, recurrent hospital admissions. This patient phenoty pe is referred to as ‘frequent exacerbator’ [ Hurst , 2010]. ‘Frequent exacerbators’ are now recognized as a major phenoty pe of COPD [ Wedzicha , 2013; Miravitlles 2013]. 2019N398117_00"
31,page_31,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 32The ECLI PSE clinical cohort study demonstrated that the prevalence of ‘frequent exacerbators’ varies by severit y of COPD, from 22% in patients with Moderate COPD (GOLD Stage 2) to 47% in patients with Very Severe COPD (GOLD Stage 4) [ Hurst , 2010]. Despite treatment, some patients do not regain their baseline lung function following a COPD exacerbation [ Seemungal , 2000] and repeated events can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function, resulting in a worsening overall health related quality of life for patients and a sign ificant burden on healthcare resources. COPD patients with a viral infection have a significantly increased risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection [ George , 2014]. Moreover, exacerbating patients with co- infections experience significantly increased lung impairment and longer hospitalizations [Papi, 2006]. There is an increased risk of a recurrent exacerbation during the first 8 weeks following an initial moderate to s evere exacerbation [ Hurst , 2009]. Thus ,there is an unmet need for novel therapies that can treat moderate to severe COPD exacerbations more effectivel y by reducing the duration and severity, and can then also prevent the occurrence of respiratory bacterial infections. It is widely recognized that antibiotic resistance is a significant and growing global public health issue [Antibiotic Resistance. WHO Fact Sheet, 2016 (WHO , 2016 ), ;FDA : Combating Antibiotic Resistance, Consumer Health Information, 2011 (FDA , 2011) ; Public Health England ESPAUR Report , 2016 (ESPAUR , 2016 )]and FDA and CHMP guidelines on develo pment of drugs for treatment of bacterial infections [ FDA , 2012; CPMP/EWP/558/95 ; 2011 ; EMA/CHMP/351889/2013 , 2014 ] recognise the importance of the development of new anti-bacterials to human health; an y medicine that has the potential to reduce the need for repeated courses of antibiotics will be an important addition to the treatment options in this setting. PI3Kd is a lipid kinase expressed predominantly in leukocy tes and thought to hold much promise as a therapeutic target for inflammatory respiratory conditions such as COPD and asthma [ Barnes , 2003; Stark, 2015]. PI 3Kd is a member of the Class IA family of phosphoinositides 3 -kinases (PI 3Ks) that are involved in many cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation and migration. PI 3Ks convert the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5- biphosphate (PI P2) into phosphatidy linositol 3,4,5 - trisphosphate (PI P3). PIP3 is a second messenger in many cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation and migration. PI3Kd has specific roles in mediating antigen receptor and cy tokine signalling in T -cells, mast cells and B -cells [ Okkenhaug , 2007] and roles in neutrophil chemotaxis and activation [ Sadhu , 2003]. A PI 3Kd inhibitor has the potential to inhibit major cell types responsible for the inflammation associated with both COPD and asthma. In COPD, tobacco smoke or other irritants activate epithelial cells and macrophages to release inflammatory mediators such as chemokines that attract neutrophils and T cells to the lungs. PI3Kd is thought to play a role in a number of epithelial responses relevant for the development of COPD. Therefore ,a PI3Kd inhibitor may be able to suppress a number of these processes [ Kim, 2010]. A greater proportion of macrophages appear to be alternativel y activated in COPD and their ability to phagocy tose infective pathogens is reduced as a result of this alternative activation. PI3Kd is one of the mediators involved 2019N398117_00"
32,page_32,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 33in determining this alternative phenot ype in macrophages and therefore it is proposed that inhibition o f PI3Kd might rebalance macrophage activation towards a classic phagocy tic phenoty pe [Weisser , 2011] facilitating clearance of bacteria, a major cause of exacerbation in COPD. The neutrophil and T cell are the two major inflammato ry cell types involved in the pathogenesis of COPD and both are targeted by PI3Kd inhibitors. Nemiralisib has demonstrated the abilit y to protect against and control bacterial infections in preclinical rodent models. This is coupled with recent observatio ns that PI3Kd inhibition leads to a correction in vitro of aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis directionality in the blood of COPD patients. Furthermore, a human point mutation which results in a constitutively activated version of PI3Kd has recentl y been chara cterized where the majority of affected patients have recurrent lung infections with the same bacterial species which are seen in COPD patients and are known to drive exacerbations. Collectively these data suggests that repeat dosing with nemiralisib could potentially reduce the impact of an acute exacerbation, or prevent the onset of a secondary exacerbation. Proinflammatory cytokines have been reduced by nemiralisib, both in preclinical rodent bacterial models, and COPD patient samples treated in vitro. To date, nemiralisib has been administered to: Participants with COPD in three, Phase IIa studies: oCompleted Studies: PII115119: A double -blind (sponsor unblind), placebo controlled, randomised, parallel group study to evaluate the safet y, tolerability andpharmacokinetics of multiple doses of GSK2269557 administered as a dry powder to COPD patients and assessment of dose response using sputum biomarkers. PII116678: A randomised, double -blind (sponsor unblinded), placebo controlled, parallel -group, multicen tre study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK2269557 administered in addition to standard of care in adult subjects diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease oOngoing Study 201928: A randomised, double -blind, place bo-controlled study to evaluate the safet y, efficacy and changes in induced sputum and blood biomarkers following dail y repeat doses of inhaled GSK2269557 for 12 weeks in adult subjects diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Participants with asthma in a concluded (i.e., study conduct complete, reporting ongoing), Phase IIa stud y 2019N398117_00"

Nemiralisib may be a victim of cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 )drug interactions There is a risk that co -administration of nemiralisib with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase systemic exposure to nemiralisibNemiralisib is an in vitro substrate of CYP3A4CyP3A4. Currently only limited in vivo information is available on the in vivo metabolism of nemiralisib in humans. In toxicology studies, no systemic toxicities were observed in any species following administratio n of nemiralisib via a variety of routes in studies of up to 3 -month duration. These studies included Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are not permitted. Acute administration (up to 14-day dosing) of some of the 3A4 inhibitors voriconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin is, however, permitted. The extent of drug interaction between these inhibitors and midazolam (as a very worst case) can be interrogated using the Washington database [Hachad , 2010]. 2019N398117_00"

Considering the lo w sub milligram maximum dose selected of 750mcg, any impact on metabolic inhibition by C YP3A4 inhibitors to increasing systemic exposure to above those tested i n early studies (at/up to 6400 mc g) is considered minimalChanges in systemic exposure to midazolam on co-administration with voriconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin are predicted as < 10-fold, which is judged to be a safe acute threshold for nemiralisib, considering the lack of systemic toxicology in animal studies. Itraconazole, ketoconazole, and ritonavir are fully excluded since changes in systemic exposure are predicted as > 10 -fold. Intravenous clarithromycin is permitted since the intravenous dose also reduces fir st pass exposure to the intestine and liver and it is only likely to be given for short durations. It is not necessary to exclude CYP3A4 enzyme inducers since any resulting decrease in systemic exposure (due to upregulation of CYP3A4) will reduce systemic exposure, thus reducing the risk of systemic toxicity. Nemiralisib may be a perpetrator of CYP3A4 drug interactions due to the time dependent inhibition of 3A4 by nemaralisbib There is a risk that co -administration of nemiralisib with potent narrow ther apeutic CYP3A4 substrates may increase systemic exposure of the 3A4 substrateNemiralisib is time -dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Although nemiralisib is a low dose inhaled drug, with predicted free Cmax at steady state < 1 nM, the influence of CYP3A4 time dependent inhibition is yet to be fully explored .Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic range; alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus are contraindicated.

The start of SoC is defined as the start of either oral/sy stemic corticosteroids[s] or antibiotic[ s] whichever is earliest. In addition to double -blind study treatment and SoC treatment for the COPD exacerbation, other treatment(s) for the exacerbation (i.e., bronchodilators) and regular COPD maintenance therapy are permitted. Participants will be ra ndomised in a ratio of 3:1 :1:1:1:1: 3to receive placebo, or nemiralisib doses of 12. 5mcg, 50mcg, 100 mcg, 250 mcg, 500 mcg or 750 mcg.

The iSRC, which will comprise a minimum of 3 people (including an independent statistician, and an independent clinician with experience in respiratory and general medicine ), will be authorized to review unblinded interim safet y analyses/data during the study ;see S ection 10.3.5 . 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 1,667 participants will be screened (assumes an approximate 25% Screen Failure rate) to achieve approximately 1,250 randomized participants (assumes an approximate 20% withdrawal rate) such that approximately 1,000 par ticipants complete the 12- week Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified by index COPD exacerbation severity (moderate or severe) and by whether or not that participant is in the PK Subgroup, to ensure a balance across treatments within each stra ta. The plan is to randomize approximately 340 participants each to the placebo and nemiralisib 750 mcg groups and approximately 570participants across the other nemiralisib groups. The reason for inflating the sample size for a selected dose of nemirali sib (planned as the 750 mcg dose) and the placebo group is for the aim to increase precision around the pair- wise comparison between them for the key secondary objective of the reduction in the rate of re- exacerbations. See Section 10.1 Sample Size Determination for additional details, including how screening failures and non -evaluable participants are defined. 5.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the Treatment Period ,if he/she has completed the last on -treatment study visit (Visit 6) and completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the last scheduled study visit (Visit 9) . The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) for the last participant in the trial globally . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, stratified, double-blind (Sponsor Op en), parallel -group design. This is a well -established design to evaluate the dose response, efficacy and safet y of an investigational drug in this phase of development. The 12 -week Treatment Period duration detailed in this Protocol is considered adequa te in order to evaluate efficacy (including lung function and PROs) in response to treatment intervention and to collect adequate safet y measurements. The choice of a lung function endpoint (change from baseline in Clinic Visit trough FEV 1at Day 84 measu red post - bronchodilator) as the primary efficacy endpoint is a robust, well established, and objective means of demonstrating efficacy . The 12- Week Post -Treatment Follow- Up Period is considered adequate to evaluate efficacy and safet y after stud y treatmen t has completed. 2019N398117_00"
49,page_49,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 50PK samples from a subset of randomized participants will also be collected in this study . Defining the optimum dose for later stages of development can be made more efficient b y understanding the variability in the PK of a drug. In addit ion to the efficacy and safet y endpoints, the study will evaluate the relationship between nemiralisib drug exposures and an y other associated pharmacod ynamic responses (e.g. efficacy , heart rate, clinical laboratory anal ytes and blood biomarkers). This study will include a placebo arm to allow a comprehensive determination of the dose-response and to measure the absolute effect of nemiralisib. Inclusion of a placebo arm will also allow a more robust exploration of the therapeutic index of nemiralisib . All participants in each of the nemiralisib treatment groups and in the placebo group will also receive SoC for their exacerbation of COPD and continue their regular COPD maintenance treatment throughout the stud y. 5.5. Dose Justification Sixdoses of nemiralisi b (12.5, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 750 mcg QD) and placebo will initially be evaluated in this study .An additional dose strength of 25 mcg may be added following the results of an unblinded interim analysis if further characterization of the lower end of th e dose response curve is required . This study will, in an adaptive manner, aim to provide the data to select the minimal, optimally effective and safe dose of nemiralisib for use in further clinical studies of COPD. The range of doses ( 12.5 mcg to 750 mcg QD) of nemiralisib in this study was selected based upon the results of the Proof -of-Concept (PoC) study PII116678 (similar population) in combination with additional clinical study PK and PK/PD information in patients and health y volunteers. The PD endpoint used for dose prediction is based upon pharmacology , in particular the expected effect on the inhibition of the target PI 3Kd enzy medue to the lack of precedence for this target mechanism as well as the patient population . Therefore, a dose predicted to achieve a certain level of target inhibition may not translate into the same level on downstream processes, in particular FEV 1, for example. Further information on these nemiralisib studies may be found in the Nemiralisib (GSK2269557) Investigator’s B rochures (IB). The 12.5 mcg dose is expected to result in <50% target inhibition within the dosing window which for an inhibitor is not expected to translate to an y patient outcome measure . However; since the precise dose response relationship is unknown within the patient population, target inhibition levels of <50% will be explored. The adaptive design of the study will a llow the modification of the dose range based on efficacy . The nemiralisib 100 mcg, 250 mcg and 500 mcg doses are expected to achieve > 80% target inhibition and, therefore, could potentially define an efficacious dose level. The 750 mcg dose is included as a potential supra -therapeutic dose, to help establish the therapeutic index for nemiralisib and to assess whether or not a n efficac yplateau has been achieved. Data from this trial will enable a better understanding of the relationship of the target engagement prediction with the downstream translation to other more clinically relevant (e.g., FEV 1) outcomes within this population. 2019N398117_00"
50,page_50,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 51Byevaluating a range of doses from 12.5 mcg to 7 50 mcg of nemiralisib , it will be possible to assess the dose response of nemiralisib as measured by change from baseline in FEV 1. The data will provide information in determining the therapeutic index of nemiralisib and in selecting the minimal effective and safe dose to be carried forward in the Phase III COPD program. 6.

It is recommended that posaconazole is used as the oral antifungal treatment of choice. Antibiotics such as telithromy cinand troleandomy cin(macrolide). Short courses up to 14 day s areallowed for mibefradil (cal cium channel blocker), ery throm ycin and clarithrom ycin (including intravenous clarithrom ycin) but chronic administrations are not permitted. Azithromy cin may be used chronically and is recomm ended as the macrolide antibiotic of choice. Anti- epileptic trea tments; and anti -tuberculous therap y. These medications must all have been stopped at least 14 day s prior to first dose of study treatment.  Sensitive narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates: Nemiralisib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and co -administration of CYP3A4 substrates with nemiralisib may result in increased sy stemic exposure to the CYP3A4 substrate. Regular or chronic treatment with medications that are considered sensitive narrow therapeutic index substrates of CYP3A4 are, therefore , not permitted: Alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, fentan yl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus and tacrolimus. Intravenous and oral theophy lline will be allowed according to the approved label/Prescribing Information ,since a specific mechanistic model constructed for nemi ralisib co-administered with theophy lline, suggests a negligible effect of nemiralisib on theophy lline exposure. Monitoring of patients receiving IV theoph ylline will be required in line with normal practice. 14. Oxygen th erapy: Chronic treatment with long -term oxy gen therap y (LTOT) or nocturnal ox ygen therap y required for >15 hours a day. Ox ygen prn use (i.e.,  15 hours per day ) is not exclusionary . Oxy gen use during an exacerbation is permitted. 15. Immunosuppressive therapy :Chronic treatment with anti -Tumour Necrosis Factor (anti -TNF), anti -Interleukin -1 (anti -IL1), or an y other immunosuppressive therap y within 60 days prior to the first dose of double -blind study treatment. 2019N398117_00"

TREATMENTS Study treatment is defined as an y investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device (s)intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol. 7.1. Treatments A dministered GSK Clinical Trials Supplies will provide the investigational products for use in this study . All blinded study treatments will be delivered via the ELLIPTA. The ELLIPTA will includ ethe clip -on Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA for countries where the Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA is ava ilable . The ELLIPTA provides a total of 30 doses. Participants will be assigned to treatments in accordance with the randomisation schedule generated b y Clinical Statistics, using validated internal software. The randomization will be stratified by sever ity of the index exacerbation, moderate or severe (per definitions in S ection 5.1and Section 12.9),and by whether or not the participant is in the PK Subgroup. Following Screening, eligible participants will be randomized (3:1: 1:1:1:1:3) to receive placebo or one of the following six treatments, administered as one inhalation each morning for 12 weeks: Placebo nemiralisib 12.5 mcg [nemiralisib 25 mcg ]* nemiralisib 50 mcg nemiralisib 100 mcg nemira lisib 250 mcg nemiralisib 500 mcg nemiralisib 750 mcg * The additional dose strength of nemiralisib 25 mcg may be added following the results of an unblinded interim analy sis if further characterization of the lower end of the dose response curve is requi red. In accordance with the adaptive design of this protocol, r andomisation ratios may change following results of an unblinded interim analy sis. 2019N398117_00"
59,page_59,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 60Double- blind study treatment will be started as soon as possible after screening and baseline assessments (e.g ., EXACT, CAT, SGRQ, FEV 1) are completed and should be within 48 hrs of the start of SoC . Note: In the event that completion of the assessments/procedures at Visit 2 (or in cases where Visit 1 and Visit 2 are conducted on the same day ) extends past noon, t he first dose of the double- blind study treatment administration may occur up until 3:00 pm on Day 1. After Day 1, dosing should take place in the morning each day through the end of the 12- Week Double -Blind Treatment Period. In addition, all participants will receive rescue medication e.g., supplemental albuterol [salbutamol] MDI or nebules to be used on an as -needed basis throughout the study up through Visit 7. MDI will include the clip- on Propeller Sensor for MDI for countries where the Propeller Sens or for MDI is available . For all sites, this medication will be sourced locally where possible. After Visit 7, Investigators will prescribe appropriate rescue medication. A web -based Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will be used to assign participants to treatment.

Medical Devices There are no GSK -manufactured medical devices (or devices manufactured for GSK by a third part y) provided for use in this stu dy. Other medical devices (not manufactured by or for GSK) provided for use in this study are the valved- holding chamber and the clip- on Propeller Sensor. Instructions for medical device use are provided in the corresponding manufacturer’s instructions for use. GSK medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be detected, documented, and reported by the investigator throughout the study (see Section 9.2). 7.2. Dose Modification This protoc ol allows some alteration from the currently outlined dosing schedule as discussed in this section; however, the maximum daily dose of nemiralisib is not planned to exceed 750 mcg and the total number of participants to be randomized is not planned to exceed approximately 1,250. Depending upon the findings of the iSRC reviews (See Appendix 3 ), randomization to a given stud y treatment arm(s) may be halted and the randomization allocation for the given stud y treatment arm(s) may be re -allocated to another study treatment arm(s). Depending upon the findings of interim analy ses adjustments to the randomization ratio across the nemiralisib doses may be made to help optimize the characterization of the dose response profile . The additional dose strength of nemiralisib 25 mcg may be added following the results of an unblinded interim analy sis if further characterization of the lower end of the dose response curve is required. 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment All participants will be centrally randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Before the study is initiated, the log -in information and directions for the I RT will be provided to each site. A centrall y randomised schedule will be utilized to randomize participants into one of the seven treatment arms . Participants will be stratified by severit y of the index exacerbation (moderate or severe) and whether or not the participant will provide PK samples. If required, additional schedules will be created for each change to the randomization ratios . Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA. Returned study treatment should not be dispensed to the participants. 2019N398117_00"

The 12- Week Tre atment Period will be a double -blind (Sponsor Open) study and the following will appl y. The investigator or treating ph ysician may unblind a participant’s treatment assignment onl y in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant as judged b y the investigator. Note: GSK must be notified of the decision to unblind. If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the investigator must notify GSK as soon as possible after unblinding. The date and reason for the unblinding must be fully documented in the eCRF. A participant will be withdrawn from study treatment if the participant’s treatment code is unblinded by the investigato r Specific members of the statistics and programming teams will have access to the unblinded randomization schedules, where participants are onl y unblinded once randomization has taken place and purel y for the purposes of unblinde d efficacy interim analyses. Specific members of the stud y team (defined in the RAP and Study Results Dissemination Plan [SRDP]) will be presented unblinded summary level data at interim analysis time points (See Section 10.3.5 ). Members of the iSRC will have access to the unblinded randomization schedules, where participants are only unblinded once randomization has taken place and purely for the purposes of unblinded safety review. Members of the iSRC will be provided unblinded summary level data at interim anal ysis time points (See Section 10.3.5 ). Members of the iSRC and method of receipt of data will be documented in the iSRC charter. GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participan t’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability 1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained dur ing transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. 2.Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer stud y treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. 2019N398117_00"

In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. 6.A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent docu ment describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 7.6. Treatment Compliance 7.6.1. 12-Week Double -Blind Treatment Period During stud y Visit 2 (Randomization Visit/Day 1) through Visit 6 (Day 84) during the 12- week Treatment Period, when participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment directly from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be documented in the eCRF for all participants. F or countries where the clip-on Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA is available, date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will also be c aptured via the Sensor. Between stud y visits during the 12 -week Treatment Period, when participants self - administer study treatment at home, compliance with double -blind study treatment will be assessed b y the study site staff by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA during the inhaler dispensing and return visits and by recording the compliance in the eCRF . For countries where the clip-on Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA is available , compliance will also be captured via the Sensor . A record of the numb er of ELLI PTA inhalers dispensed to and taken by each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delays will also be recorded in the eCRF. Partic ipant compliance with double -blind study treatment will be assessed at Visits 3 through 6, b y reviewing the clip -on Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA data (for countries where the Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA is available) or b y reviewing the dose counter on th e ELLIPTA (countries where the Propeller Sensor for ELLIPTA is not available). Partici pants must be ≥80% to ≤120% compliant in taking stud y treatment between-on- treatment visits. Participants who fall outside this range should be re -educated on treatment compliance b y their site. This re -education should be documented in the participant’s source document. If the double- blind study treatment is prematurel y discontinued during the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period or stud y treatment 2019N398117_00"

However, all concomitant medi cations (COPD and non- COPD) will be captured in the source documents and eCRF. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy For participants who are randomized, any medication or vaccine (including over -the- counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) th at the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment (Screening Visit) or receives during the study (including the 12 -week Double -Blind Treatment Period and the 12 -week Post - Treatment Follow- up Period) must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF along with: reason for use dates of administration including start and end dates dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . In addition, all COPD medications taken within 3 months prior to Visit 1 (Screening) should be recorded in the participant’s source and in the eCRF. 7.7.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies 7.7.1.1. COPD Medications and Non -Drug Therapies To be eligible for this protocol, at Screening, participants must present with a moderate or severe acute exacerbation of COPD requiring treatment with SoC. Standard of Care (SoC) for the index exacerbation is defined for this protocol as treatment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroid[s] (40 mg /day prednisone or equivalent) for 5 day s andantibiotic[s] for 7 day s, to be confirmed by an experienced ph ysician (See Inclusion Criterion 4); the dose and/or duration of prednisone (40 mg/day or equivalent) a nd/or the antibiotic can be modified according to the Investigator’s/medicall y qualified designee’s judgement or according to local country /institution practice. The start of SoC is defined as the start of either oral/sy stemic corticosteroids[s] or antibiotic[s] whichever is earliest. SoC must be documented in the participant’s source documentation and in the eCRF. The use of other medications for treatment of the index COPD exacerbation and any subsequent COPD exacerbation(s), if applicable, is at the discretion of the Investigator or medically qualified health care personnel.

However, participants must withhold the morning dose of usual scheduled COPD medications (permitted and/or double- blind study treatment) on the morning of and prior to the start and during the spirometry assessments, with the exception of albuterol [salbutamol] for post- bronchodilator spirometry assessment and if the usual scheduled COPD medication is needed for treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD , where possi ble. oNote: Modification(s) of the dosing regimen for the regular COPD treatments is(are) permitted as deemed medically appropriate by the Investigator/medically qualified designee; the modifications will be recorded in source documents and eCRF Other conco mitant COPD medications may be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator following consultation with the GSK Clinical I nvestigation Leader/Medical Monitor, with the exception of short -acting anticholinergics for use as rescue medication (See Section 7.7.2.1 ). Oxygen for intermittent use or PRN therap y ≤15 hours per day is allowed. LTOT or nocturnal ox ygen therap y required for >15 hours is excluded throughout the stud y. The study site will supply each randomi zed participant with albuterol [salbutamol] MDI for use in performing the post -bronchodilator FEV 1assessments and as rescue medication for use as needed throughout the 12 -Week Treatment Period for treatment of acute symptoms of COPD. Albuterol [salbutamo l] will be provided locall y by GSK. In addition, participants may use albuterol [salbutamol] nebules if they have a nebulizer. Although the use of rescue albuterol [salbutamol] medications is allowable at any time during the stud y, its use should be delay ed for at least 4 hours prior to completing the pre - bronchodilator spirometry assessments, unless required for treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD. The participants’ use of the study -supplied albuterol [salbutamol] will be captured via the clip -on P ropeller Sensor for MDI (for countries where the Propeller Sensor for MDI is available) or via the eDiary (for countries where the Propeller Sensor for MDI is not available or for participants who are supplied nebulized albuterol [salbutamol]). For assessm ent of change from baseline in Clinic Visit FEV 1post-bronchodilator, the bronchodilator will be standardized as albuterol [salbutamol], administered as either four inhalations via the MDI (i.e., 400 mcg) with valved-holding chamber or one nebulized treatm ent. It is anticipated that participants who are enrolled into the stud y will receive albuterol as part of the routine treatment of AECOPD during visit 2. In this instance 2019N398117_00"
66,page_66,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 67spirometry should be scheduled to coincide with this treatment to allow post- bronch odilator recordings to be measured. 7.7.1.2. Non-COPD Medications and Non -Drug Therapies All medications for other disorders are permitted as long as the dose remains constant wherever possible and their use would not be expected to affect the efficacy (especially lung function) or safety assessments. The use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device or non- invasive positive pressure ventilation (NI PPV) is permitted during the study , provided that this therapy was initiated prior to Screening and the participant is on a stable regimen. If CPAP or NI PPV therap y is initiated during the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period, the participant will need to be withdrawn from double -blind study treatment but can continue in the study for collection of data. Patients that require acute use of CPAP or NIPPV may not be enrolled. Use of this therapy is to be recorded in the source document and eCRF. Participation in the acute or maintenance phase of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program during the stud y (double -blind Treatment Period and/or Post-Treatment Follow-up Period) is permitted. Participation is to be recorded in the source document and eCRF. 7.7.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies 7.7.2.1. COPD Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Short -acting anticholinergics ( e.g., ipratropium bromide) for use as a rescue medication are excluded from the Screening Visit through completion of Visit 7, unless required for treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD if albuterol [salbutamol] is not prescribed or readil y available. If medically appropriate, the use of the rescue anticholinergic up through Visit 7 may be replaced with the study -provided albuterol [salbutamol] MDI at the discretion of the Investigator/medically qualified designee. 7.7.2.2. Non-COPD Medications and Non -Drug Th erapies Concomitant use of strong inhibitors of cy tochrome P450 3A4 and concomitant use of sensitive narrow therapeutic index CYP3A4 substrates is not permitted. See Section 6.2 Exclusion Criteria 13 for detail. 7.8. Treatment afte r the End of the Study GSK will not provide treatment after the end of the 12 -week double -blind treatment period. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the care of the participant’s medical condition on completi on of 12- week double -blind treatment period . Participants will be prescribed appropriate COPD therap y at the completion of Visit 6 or at the Earl y Withdrawal Visit, which may or may not be the usual COPD daily medication that form their maintenance therap yduring the 12 -week treatment period. 2019N398117_00"

DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA A participant may voluntarily discontinue participation in this study at any time (including during the Screening Period, the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period or during the 12 -Week Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period). The Investigator may also at his/her discretion discontinue a participant from this study at any time. Every effort should be made by the Investigator to keep the subject in the study. Participants who are withdrawn from the st udy will not be replaced and cannot be re - screened. The primary reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF (see Section 8.2). 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment A participant may be discontinued from study treatment but continue in the study for collection of data (including efficacy and safet y data) and to minimize missing data. Participants who discontinue from stud y treatment will move directly into the 12 -Week Post Treatment Follow Up Period starting with Visit 7, 28 day sfollowing the discontinuation date. If a higher than expected number of participants prematurel y discontinues double -blind study treatment or prematurely discontinues from the study , additional participants may be randomized, at the discretion of the Sponsor. 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follow -upCriteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinica l liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safety guidance: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid ances/UCM174090.pdf. Discontinuation of study treatmen t for abnormal liver tests is required when: a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm below in the presence of abnormal liver chemistries not meeting protocol -specified stopping rules, the investigator believes study treatment discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant. 2019N398117_00"

QTc Stopping Criteria In this stud y, GSK is contracting with an external vendor to provide standardized 12 -lead ECG equipment and centralized ECG overreads for all participating sites (Section 9.4.3 ). The same QT correction formula (Fridericia’s) must be used throughout the study for all participants. Safet y ECGs and other non- protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc criteria should be based on the averaged QTc value of triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period. A participant who meets either bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc >530 msec (with or without underlying Bundle Branch Block) OR Un corrected QT >600 msec Change from baseline of QTc > 60 msec 2019N398117_00"
69,page_69,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 70In addition, participants should be excluded (Screening) or be discontinued from study treatment if they have an abnormal, clinicall y significant ECG finding as defined in the ECG manual. 8.1.3. Pneumon ia Presumptive diagnosis or radiographically confirmed (See definition in “COPD Exacerbation” Section 9.1.2 )requires discontinuation of study treatment. If a subject is withdrawn due to pneumonia, the AE/SAE se ction and the pneumonia/ chest X -ray section, if applicable, of the eCRF should be completed and the subject should be followed until clinical resolution of the pneumonia. 8.1.4. Acute respiratory acidosis/invasive mechanical ventilati on A pH < 7.30 or the need for invasive mechanical ventilation requires discontinuation of study treatment . 8.1.5. Other Safety Stopping Criteria For a study participant, other safet y stopping criteria include, but are not limited to: Severe signs or s ymptoms or significant changes in any of the safet y assessments, that put the safet y of the participant at risk (e.g. ECG, vital signs, laboratory test, etc.), as judged b y the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor if necessary . 8.1.6. Pregnancy A female participant must be discontin ued form study treatment if a positive serum pregnancy test is obtained. 8.1.7. Temporary Discontinuation A participant may be withdrawn from study treatment as discussed in Section 8.1but continue in the follow -up period of the study for collection of efficacy and safet y data. 8.1.8. Rechallenge 8.1.8.1. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Stu dy A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time during the stud y (including the Screening Period, the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period or the 12 -Week Post - Treatment Follow- Up Period) at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. 2019N398117_00"
70,page_70,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 71If a higher than expected number of participants prematurel y discontinues double -blind study treatment or prematurely discontinues from the study , additional p articipants may be randomized, at the discretion of the Sponsor. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use an y data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA (Section 2) for data to be collec ted at the time of study withdrawal and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. Treatment failure or recurrent exacerbation does not mandate withdrawal from the study , unless there is a safet y concern as judged b y the Investiga tor, in consultation with the Medical Monitor if necessary . The primary reason for subject withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF. Primary reasons for withdrawal will be categorized as: adverse event withdrew consent lost to follow -up protocol deviation lack of efficacy subject reached protocol -defined stopping criteria study closed/terminated investigator discretion Specific regard should be given to distinguishing withdrawals due to an adverse event, lack of efficacy and protocol deviation. Participant compliance with study treatment during the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period will be assessed as described in Section 7.6.1 . 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participa nt and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining 2019N398117_00"
71,page_71,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 72the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equiv alent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 9. STUD Y ASSESSMENTS A ND PR OCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Medical Monitor immed iately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section 2), is essential and required for stud y conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purpos es provided the procedure met the protocol- specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA (Section 2). The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed the following: Males: oMain Study : approximately 189mL (including blood samples for genetic research and biomarkers) oPK Sub -group: approximately 199mL (including the above bullet and the serial PK samples) Females oMain Study : approximately 214mL (including blood samples for pregnancy testing, genetic research, and biomarkers) oPK Sub -group: approximately 224mL (including the above bullet and the serial PK samples) 2019N398117_00"
72,page_72,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 73Repeat or unscheduled blood samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. The following procedures must be completed to ensure that the participant is eligible for the study : Obtain informed written consent Review inclusion/exclusion criteria, including concomitant medications. Full source documentation for the above qualify ing procedures and related results are required . Any protocol -specified study qualification procedures not already done as part of routine care will need to be conducted after the participant signs the ICF and before randomization. The results of all stud y qualification procedures, whether performed as part of routine care or as a study -specific procedure, are required to assess participant inclusion/exclusi on criteria and should, if possible, be available prior to randomization. Forprompt assessment of the participant’s eligibility local laboratory samples should be taken at Screening and the results received and reviewed prior to randomisation to allow review of e xclusion criteria 18. I t is important that a sample for analy sis by the central laboratory is obtained at the same time and promptly sent to the central laboratory . The local lab results will not be entered into the CRF; however, they will be fil ed in the respective participant’s source documentation. Samples for Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis C virus antibody , and HIV antibody will be submitted to the central laboratory only for anal ysisand do not need to be submitted to the local labora tory. Participants who are otherwise eligible may be randomized prior to the receipt and review of these results. If the result for one or more of these parameters is positive, then the participant will need to be withdrawn from the study .Therefore, it is important that a detailed medical history is performed at Screening (Visit 1), in order to minimize the potential for randomization of participants who are positive for one or more of these parameters . Those samples taken prior to or at the time of randomization and sent to the central laboratory will serve as the baseline for assessment of potential treatment effect (see the Schedule of Activities in Section 2). The screening process ends when randomization occurs. Randomization and first dose of the double -blind study treatment administration should take place as soon as possible following diagnosis of acute moderate/severe exacerbation of COPD and completion of the EXACT -PRO questionnaire and FE V1measureme nt and no later than 48hrs after start of SoC . 9.1. Efficacy Assessments Efficacy will be assessed via spirometry assessments, subsequent exacerbations of COPD, and patient -reported outcomes (PROs). PRO assessments carried out at study 2019N398117_00"
73,page_73,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 74visits will be completed as the first assessment in the visit schedule before spirometry or any other study procedure. 9.1.1. Spirometry Testing Spirometry assessments will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the ATS [ Miller , 2005]. All participating sites will use standardized spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor contracted b y GS K. All participants will perform lung function maneuvers to assess FEV 1, and FVC at ea ch study visit. For each testing session, at least 3 valid spirometry efforts should be attempted (with no more than 8) using the ATS guidelines [ Miller , 2005]. The highest FEV 1from the valid forced expiratory curv es for each testing session will be used. Protocol -specified spirometry will be performed in the morning (i.e., initiated between 6:00AM and 12:00PM) during visits when clinic FEV 1is performed as shown in the SoA (Section 2). In addition, protocol- specified clinic FEV 1must be completed in accordance with the lifesty le restrictions as defined in Section 6.3.1 - Section 6.3.5 . During Visits 2 through Visit 6, spirometry will be performed prior to administering double -blind study medication at two time points: pre- bronchodilator (albuterol [salbutamol)] and post -bronchodilator. Post -bronchodilator FEV 1will be conducted approximately 10 to 30 minutes after the participant-administers 4 inhalations of albuterol (salbutamol) via MDI (i.e., total of 400 mcg) using a spacer/valved -holding chamber or via one nebulized treatment. It is anticipated that participants who are enrolled into the study will receive albuterol as part of the routine treatment of AECOPD during visit 2. In this instance , spirometry should be scheduled to coincide with this treatment to allow post-bronchodilator recordings to be measured. During Visits 6 -9, spirometry will be performed prio r to administering maintenance COPD medication(s) at two time points: pre -bronchodilator (albuterol [salbutamol)] and post -bronchodilator (as defined above). Rescue albuterol [salbutamol] should be withheld for 4hrs prior to spirometry measurements , where possible . Usual daily COPD medications should be withheld on the morning of spirometry assessments, where possible . Baseline Clinic Visit FEV 1is defined as the post -bronchodilator FEV 1performed at Visit 2. Spirometry assessments should be made as close to the scheduled time points as possible. Where multiple assessments are scheduled at the same time point, the sequence of assessments should ideally be as shown below. However, during the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and/or the Randomization Visit (Visit 2), this order may be modified as needed, including instances where some or all of these procedures are performed as part of routine/urgent/emergency/inpatient hospitalized care . 1.

Spirometry assessment Detai ls regarding the spirometric procedures are provided in the instruction manual provided b y the external vendor. 9.1.2. COPD Exacerbation Following recovery of the index exacerbation, COPD exacerbation assessments will be performed throughout the 12 -week treatment period and the 12- week post treatment follow up period at study visits and using the eDiary data . Additional details on guidelines for COPD exacerbation identification, categorization, reporting and treatment are provided in Section 12.9.5 . 9.1.3. Patient -Reported Outcomes (PRO) Participants will complete the following PROs during this study : Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT- PRO) ( which includes the Evaluating Respiratory S ymptoms in COPD [E -RS: COPD] subscales of the EXACT -PRO) at randomization and every evening following day of randomization, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ-C) as defined in the SOA (Section 2). COPD Assessment Test (CAT) as defined in the SOA (Section 2). CAT will also be triggered to appear in the e- dairy on the evening following EXACT -defined recovery from the index acute moderate or severe exacerbation of COPD. For participants who are hospitalized, if a participant is too ill to complete the PRO questionnaires without assistance on a given day , a member of the stud y staff may verball y recite the questions verbatim to the participant and the staff membe r may enter the participant’s verbal response in the eDiary . The participant’s confirmation of the accuracy of the staff member’s transcription will be documented in the source document/eDiary . Hospitalized participants will be encouraged to complete the eDiary personall y as soon as possible and will be trained to do so before discharge. 9.1.3.1. EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool Patient (EXA CT- PRO and Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E -RS: COPD) The Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT -PRO) is a 14- item, PRO instrument designed to capture information on the occurrence, frequency , severit y, and duration of exacerbations of disease in patients with COPD. EXACT -PRO captures information on the severity of the respiratory and sy stemic manifestations of a COPD exacerbation as reported by the patient [ Leidy, 2011]. 2019N398117_00"
75,page_75,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 76The instrument is to be completed every evening (ty picall y at bedtime) using an eDiary. However, at Visit 2 (Randomization) only ,the EXACT -PRO is to be completed as the first assessment before randomization and hence will be completed in the morning . Participants will be trained to complete the eDiary before completing the first EXACT assessment. The daily recording of information allows an assessment of the underl ying day to day variability of a patient's sy mptoms and facilitates the detection of s ymptom worsening indicative of a COPD exacerbation. The total score for EXACT -PRO ranges from 0 – 100. The entire instrument is intended to be completed in about 3 minutes or less (typically the time required for completion decreases as the patient becomes more familiar with the tool and the eDiary ). The Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS: COPD) consists of 11 items from the 14- item EXACT -PRO instrument. E -RS: COPD is intended to capture information related to the respiratory symptoms of COPD, i.e., breathlessness, cough, sputum production, chest congestion and chest tightness. The E- RS has a scoring range of 0-40 [ Leidy, 2014]. Three subscales of the E -RS: COPD are used to describe different s ymptoms; dy spnoea, cough and sputum and chest sy mptoms. Additional details are provided in the SRM/vendor manual. In addition to the collection of EXACT -PRO, subjects will also complete daily diary questions to provide the information on other s ymptoms suggestive of exacerbation: sputum purulence (color), wheezing, sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) and fever without other c ause. 9.1.3.2. COPD A ssessment Test (CA T) COPD -related health status will be assessed using the CAT at the visits noted in the SoA (Section 2). The CAT will be administered on the eDiary . Participants will complete the CAT at relevant study visits, prior to performing any other study procedures (including concurrent medication assessment, adverse event assessment, clinic spirometry, etc.), and prior to completion of the SGRQ -C. The CAT (www.CATestonline.org) is a validated, short and simple patient- completed questionnaire, which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is designed to measure overall COPD - related health status for the assessment an d long -term follow -up of individual patients. The CAT is an 8 -item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, participants rate their experience on a 6-point scale, ranging from 0 (no impa irment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 -40 [ Jones, 2009; Jones, 2012]. Additional details are provided in the SRM/vendor manual. 2019N398117_00"
76,page_76,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 779.1.3.3. St. George’s Respiratory Questi onnaire for COPD Patients (SGRQ -C) Health-related qualit y of life will be assessed using the SGRQ -C at the visits noted in the SoA (Section 2). The SGRQ -C will be administered on the eDiary . Participants will complete the SGRQ -C at relevant study visits, prior to performing any other study procedures (including concurrent medication assessment, adverse event assessment, clinic spirometry , etc.), but after completion of the CAT. The SGRQ- C is a COPD -specific questionnaire designed to measure the impact of COPD and its treatment on the subject’s health -related quality of life [ Meguro , 2006 ]. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of s ymptoms, activity and impacts are also produced. It has been used in studies of COPD subjects and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -C is derived from the original SGRQ, and produces scores equivalent to the SGRQ instrument [Meguro , 2006 ]. Research has demonstrated that it is s ensitive to change and interpretation of the results has been enhanced b y determination of the score change necessary to achieve a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life [ Jones, 2005]. The SGRQ- C is self -completed by participants. It is recommended that the SGRQ -C should be conducted at the same time during each applicable visit (see the SoA [Section 2]). Adequate time (at least 20 minutes) should be allowed, although the participant will not be given an y stated or implied time limit for completing the questionnaire. The investigator/designee will ask the p articipant to complete the questionnaire as accuratel y as possible. If the participant requests help or clarification of an y question in the questionnaire, the investigator/designee is to instruct the participant to re -read the instructions to give the be st answer possible. The investigator/designee will not supply the participant with an answer to an y question. Additional details are provided in the SRM/vendor manual. 9.1.3.4. Rescue Medication Use Participants’ use of stud y-supplied rescue medication (albuterol [salbutamol]) will be captured via the clip -on Propeller Sensor for MDI (for countries where the Propeller Sensor for MDI is available) or via the eDiary (for countries where the Propeller Sensor for MDI is not available or for participants who are supplie d nebulized albuterol [salbutamol]). For the nebulized formulation, the number of nebulized treatments over the previous 24 hours will be recorded dail y in the eDiary. For participants who are hospitalized and the clip -on Propeller Sensor for MDI is not available and/or if the participant is too ill to complete the eDiary on his/her own on a given day , a member of the study staff may enter the participant’ s use of non -nebulized rescue medication or the number of nebulized treatments over the previous 24 ho urs in the eDiary as applicable. The participant’s confirmation of the accuracy of the staff member’s transcription will be documented in the eDiary/source document. Additional details are provided in the SRM/vendor manual. 2019N398117_00"
77,page_77,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 789.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs tha t are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment or study (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SAE Information All SAEs will be collected from the start of stud y treatment until Visit 9 in the Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period, at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). However, any SAEs assesse d as related to study participation (e.g., study intervention, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study . All AEs w ill be collected from the start of double -blind study treatment until Visit 9 in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2 ). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee as soon as possible and not more than 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former st udy participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Dete cting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. 2019N398117_00"
78,page_78,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 799.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 9.2.5), will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatmen t under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with cou ntry-specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information eg , summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Adverse Events of Special Interest (A ESI) –Post -Inhalation Cough Immediately Following Dosing In the Proof -of-Concept (PoC) study PII116678, which was conducted in 126 randomized participants from a population similar to this protocol and a previous formulation of nemiralisib (DI SKUS formulation blended with only one e xcipient, lactose), there was a higher incidence of treatment -related, mild and moderate adverse events of cough (Preferred Term) reported immediately after dosing in exacerbating subjects in the GSK2269557 DI SKUS 1000 mcg QD group (n=22 [35%] compared exa cerbating subjects in the placebo DISKUS group (n=2 [3%]). For the 22 subjects in the GSK2269557 1000 mcg group, the events of cough for 20 of the subjects were considered b y the Investigator to be related to study treatment. From the review of reported events , cough often occurred immediately after dosing and in some subjects it seemed to repeat on most of the dosing day s. Cough was reported to be generall y mild or moderate and resolved after stopping dosing. Three subjects (all in the GSK2269557 DISKU S 1000 mcg QD group) discontinued the study due to cough. Additional details are provided in the Nemiralisib (GSK2269557) Investigator’s Brochure. 2019N398117_00"
79,page_79,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 80Therefore, to further evaluate this finding of post -inhalation cough immediately following dosing, during st udy Visits 2-6 in the 12- Week Double -Blind Treatment Period, I nvestigators (or medically qualified designees) will monitor participants for potential study treatment tolerability issues, including post -inhalation cough, within 5 minutes immediately following dosing. If tolerability issues, including coughing are observed, details will be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF. The iSRC will have study oversight to ensure that it meets the highest standards of ethics and participant safet y and to car ry out the planned interim safet y data analyses/data reviews as discussed in Appendix 3 and Section 10.3.5 . Data (including adverse event reports of post -inhalation cough immediately following study treatment dosing) will be reviewed b y the iSRC on a periodic basis, as defined in the iSRC Charter. 9.2.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV M edDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of d eath is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.7. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es The following disease related events (DREs) are common in participants with COPD and can be serious/life threatening: exacerbation of COPD Because these events are ty picall y associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAE s to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of a SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page , in this study the exacerbation page in the participant’s eCRF within 72 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by a Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis. NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions apply, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (See Section 9.2): The even t is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or 2019N398117_00"

Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participant s will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 14 day s after the last dose of study treatment. Details of pregnancies for female partners of male participants will not be routinely collected; however, voluntary reports of such incidents w ill be captured through the GSK standard reporting mechanism. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5 Abnorma l pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 9.2.9. Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices, the study -supplied valved- holding chamber and the clip- on Propeller Sensors to be attached to the double -blind study treatment ELLIPTA inhalers and the study -supplied albuterol [salbutamol] MDIs, are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of standardizing the conduct of the post- bronchodilator F EV 1measurements and capturing compliance with double -blind study treatment and rescue albuterol [salbutamol] use, respectively . In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and document ation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a Medical Device Incident can be found in Appendix 8 . NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 9.2and Appendix 4 of the protocol. 9.2.9.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in which the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and such incident is considered reasonabl y related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptl y notify the sponsor. The method of documenting Medical Device Incidents is provided in Appendix 8. 2019N398117_00"

STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS The primary objective of this study is to characterize the dose response of nemiralisib when administered in addition to SoC on change from baseline in Clinic Visit FEV 1at Day 84 (measured at trough and post -bronchodilator), in participants diagnosed with an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroid(s) (prednisone 40 mg/day or equivalent) for 5 days and antibiotic(s) for 7 days; the dose and/or duration of prednisone (40 m g/day or equivalent) and/or the antibiotic can be modified according to the Investigator’s/medically qualified designee’s judgement or according to local country /institution practice. There are initially six doses of nemiralisib to be investigated in this study ; however, one additional dose may be included during the course of the stud y. A key secondary objective is to evaluate treatment effect of nemiralisib compared with placebo on the rate of subsequent exacerbation(s) (moderate and severe) over the 12 - Week Treatment Period. I n order to increase precision around the estimate of the treatment effect from a pair-wise comparison of the rate of subsequent exacerbation(s) of COPD, the sample size will be increased for the 750 mcg dose of nemiralisib and placebo. 10.1. Sample Size Determination The sample size has been determined b y considering the probability of achieving the end of study success criteria for both the primary and key secondary objectives. Assuming a 20% withdrawal rate, approximately 1,250 participants will be randomized in total into the study to ensure approximately 1,000 participants complete the 12- Week Treatment Period. Initiall y, the randomization ratio between placebo and the the six doses ( 12.5 mcg , 50 mcg, 100 mcg, 250 mcg, 500 mcg, and 750 mcg) of nemiralisib will be 3: 1:1:1:1:1:3 . Randomization will be stratified b y index COPD exacerbation severit y (moderate or severe) and whether or not the participant will provide PK samples, to ensure a balance across treatments. Table 2shows the expected sample sizes allocated to the sixdoses of nemiralisib and placebo at the end of stud y. These figures are approximate and assume that no further adjustments to the randomization ratio are made. The actual samp le sizes at the end of the stud y may be different, depending upon whether changes are made following the results of the unblinded interim analy sis of change from baseline in clinic visit FEV 1. 2019N398117_00"

Sample Size for Primary Objective: To Characterize the Dose Response of Nemiralisib when A dministered in A ddition to SoC on Change from Baseline in Clinic Visit FEV 1at Day 84 Simulations of change from baseline FEV 1data have been performed to evaluate the probability of achieving end of study success criteria given the estimated sample size for each dose for various assumed scenarios. Three scenarios were considered, each based on different assumptions of the chang e from baseline FEV 1for each of the treatment arms. The scenarios are described in Table 3. The estimate of the dose response profile were obtained from fitting a 3 -parameter Emax dose response model to simulated change from baseline FEV 1data for the expected end of study sample size given these assumed true scenarios. A 3 parameter model was used rather than a 4 parameter model to improve the model convergence under simulation conditions. For the purpose of simulations, a frequentist anal ysis technique was used which should provide analogous results to fitting non -informative prior distributions for all modelling parameters using a Bayesian framework. A baseline and a single post dose observation were simulate d for each subject using the bivariate normal distribution, assuming the between participant standard deviation of 300 mL for both time points, and a correlation of 0.7 between them. The average baseline was considered to be 1.383 L. These values were obta ined from the PoC Study PII1116678 (a randomised, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GSK2269557 administered in addition to standard of care in 126 participants diagnosed with an acute exacerbatio n of COPD). For each simulation, the appropriate number of participants was simulated using the expected sample size completing Day 84 as described in Table 2. For each scenario, 5,000 iterations of simulations were run with each simulation anal yzed using proc nlmixed in SAS. 2019N398117_00"

Although the probability of achieving the key end of success criterion for the primary endpoint is high for scenarios 1 and 2, the true nature of the dose response profile is 2019N398117_00"
90,page_90,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 91currentl y unknown. In addition to these simulations, consideration of the probability of achieving the end of study success for the secondary endpoint of reduction in exacerbation rate has also been given. 10.1.2. Sample Size for Key Secondary Objective: To Evaluate Treatment Effect o f Nemiralisib Compared with Placebo on the Rate of Exacerbations The key secondary endpoint of number of exacerbations over the 12- Week treatment period will be anal ysed using a Bay esian generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial distribution fo r the underl ying exacerbation rate. Non -informative prior distributions will be used for all modelling parameters. The probability of achieving the end of study success criterion for this secondary endpoint was calculated assuming a placebo exacerbation ra te of 0.51 per 12 weeks and dispersion parameter of 3.5, observed in the PoC Study PII116678. With 340 participants in the selected exacerbation dose arm versus 340 participants in the placebo arm, the probability of declaring success (assuming that the t rue rate reduction over placebo is 25%) is 76% , where success is defined as demonstrating >80% posterior probability that the true rate reduction over placebo is greater than 0%. Estimates of the variability (dispersion parameter) and placebo exacerbation rate have been taken from PoC Study PII116678, however have large associated uncertainty . The probability of achieving the end of study success criterion has therefore also been calculated using different assumptions for the dispersion and placebo exacerba tion rate and are presented in Table 5. The table shows that the probability of achieving the end of study success criteria for the secondary endpoint varies substantially depending on these assumptions. These assu mptions will be assessed during the course of the study .

Full details of the specification of prior distributions will be documented in the RAP. The post erior mean change from baseline, along with 95% Credible Intervals, will be presented for each of the studied doses along with the placebo corrected results obtained from the non -linear model. Graphical representation of the dose response across the full d ose range will also be produced to allow inference to be made for the non -studied doses based upon the model fit. Posterior probabilities that the true improvement is greater than 0 mL, 50 mL and 100 mL will also be presented. Full details of the statistic al analysis will be documented in the RAP. Secondary The key secondary endpoint of number of exacerbations (moderate and severe) over the 12 -Week treatment period will be analysed using a Bayesian generalized linear model assuming a negative binomial dist ribution for the underlying exacerbation rate with a log link and an offset to account for the length of time in study for each participant. Non- informative priors will be used for all modelling assumptions.

A covariate analy sis will be undertaken to evaluate any subject factors (including demographic, phy siological, co - medication, pharmacogenetic markers) likel y to influence the s ystemic exposure to nemiralisib in this participant population. Appropriate validation of this population analysis will be performed i n line with the European and US regulatory guidance documents on population PK analy sis [EMEA -CHMP/EWP/185990/06, 2008 and the FDA , 1999 ]. Full details of anal ysis will be provided in the RA P. 10.3.4. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacody namic A nalyses A longitudinal population dose- FEV 1response analy sis will be undertaken using trough FEV 1at all measured time points over the duration of the study . Quantification of dose – response relationship, covariate effe cts, and time courses such as placebo effect onset, disease progression, and dose -related effect onset and offset will be characterized if data are amenable. This analy sis may provide additional support for dose selection in future studies. In addition, an exposure- driven clinical safet y analysis will be performed using participant -specific exposure data and corresponding s ystemic safet y signals, if data allow. If data are amenable, an y relationship between stead y state individual average drug levels (Css) with corresponding PROs will be assessed. The above anal ysis will be conducted in alignment with the FDA and ICH E4 guidance documents [FDA Guidance for Industry .

Interim anal yses of the primary endpoint of change from baseline in clinic visit FEV 1at Day 84 will be performed to determine whether or not any adjustments to the randomization ratio across the nemiralisib doses would help optimize the characterization of the dose response profile. Adjustments could include starting randomization to a nemiralisib dose of 25 mcg QD and/or ceasing randomization to an existing dose(s) of nemiralisib and/or modification of the allocation ratios for the existing nemiralisib doses. Change from baseline in clinic visit FEV 1will be anal yzed by fitting a Baysesian Emax dose response model, as described in Section 10.3.1 . The timing of interim anal yses of FEV 1will be pre -specified in the RAP, prior to any unblinding taking place. In addition, interim analyses will be used to assess the study for futility , to amend the stratification proportions by index exacerbation severity status (moderate or severe) and 2019N398117_00"

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrenc e in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the star t of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.

Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at r isk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifie s that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications t hat occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 2019N398117_00"

These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not re sult in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs a nd SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolis m Revascularization 2019N398117_00"

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator w ill make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a categ ory utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 2019N398117_00"
114,page_114,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 115Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include i n the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y ofany post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 2019N398117_00"

Medical Device Incident Def inition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have le d to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circu mstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incident associated with a device happened and The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deter ioration in state of health can include any of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to bod y structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal d istress, fetal death, or any congenital abnormality or birth defects 2019N398117_00"

Guidelines for Identifying an A cute Exacerbation of COPD For this protocol, eligible participants must have an acute exacerbation of COPD requiring an escalation in therap y to include oral/sy stemic corticosteroid(s) and antibiotic(s) as defined in I nclusion Criterion 4. Acute exacerbation is to be confirmed b y an experienced ph ysician and to represent a recent worsening in at least two major and one minor sy mptoms, one major and two minor sy mptoms, or all 3 major sy mptoms. a.Major sy mptoms: i. Subjective increase in d yspnea ii. Increase in sputum volume iii. Change in sputum color b.Minor sy mptoms: i Increased cough ii. Increased wheeze iii. Sore throat iv. Colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) v. Fever (oral temperature >37.5 C) without other cause 12.9.2. COPD Exacerbation Severity For the purposes of this study , each COPD exacerbation (including the index exacerbation at Screening and subsequent exacerba tion[s]) will be categorized based upon the GOLD [ GOLD, 2017] classification of severit y as follows: Mild COPD exacerbation: Worsening s ymptoms of COPD treated with short - acting bronchodilators (SABDs) onl y Moderate COPD exacerbation: worsening s ymptoms of COPD treated with SABDs plus antibiotics and/or oral/sy stemic corticosteroids Severe COPD exacerbation: worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require hospitalization or visit to the emergency room. Severe exacerbation may also be associate d with acute respiratory failure. 2019N398117_00"
127,page_127,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 128For this study , mild, moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD will be captured in the eCRF (See Section 12.9.4 .). Note: Use of oral/systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the participant experiences worsening s ymptoms of COPD, which match the definition of an exacerbation as given above. 12.9.3. Subsequent COPD Exacerbat ion(s) After the index exacerbation of COPD at Screening (Visit 1) has resolved, any randomized participant who experiences worsening of COPD for >48 hours should: Contact his/her study investigator and/or research coordinator immediatel y, and report to th e study clinic as required If the participant is unable to contact his/her stud y investigator and/or research coordinator, he/she should contact his/her primary care ph ysician (or other health care practitioner as required) and contact their study site as soon as possible Continue to complete the eDiary If the participant seeks emergent/acute care for worsening respiratory symptoms, he/she should inform the caring Health Care Provider (HCP) to contact the investigator as soon as possible. Participants with presence of worsening respiratory symptoms will be classified by the Investigator as having: A mild/moderate/severe COPD exacerbation and/or pneumonia A lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [i.e., other than pneumonia] Background variability of COPD A non-respiratory -related disease Other respiratory -related disease Investigators and site/hospital staff should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in patients with COPD, as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the sy mptoms of COPD exacerbations (See Section 12.9.7). If, based upon these criteria, a participant’s s ymptoms do not fulfil the diagnosis of a COPD exacerbation and/or pneumonia, then the investigator should use his /her clinical judgment to assess the participant’s symptoms (including increased volume of sputum production and/or change in the sputum color) for a diagnosis of L RTI (e.g., acute bronchitis), background variability of COPD, a non -respiratory -related dise ase or other 2019N398117_00"
128,page_128,"2017N317218_05 CONFIDENTIA L 200879 129respiratory -related disease. Investigator judgment should be used in deciding whether to report the signs and s ymptoms (and/or determined diagnosis) as an AE/SAE in the eCRF. 12.9.4. Collection of COPD Exacerbation Data COPD exacerbations (mild, mode rate, severe) will be collected for all participants who are randomized and receive at least one dose of double -blind study treatment (Visit 2). The time period for collection of exacerbations will begin with the index exacerbation at Visit 1 (Screening) and will end when Visit 9 (last study visit) has been completed. COPD exacerbations are considered DREs (see Section 9.2.7 ). Because these events are typicall y associated with the disease under study, they will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs to GSK (even though the event may meet the definition of a SAE). These events will be recorded on the DRE page , in this study the exacerbation page in the participant’s eCRF within 72 hour s after the Investigator becomes aware of the event. These DREs will be monitored by a Safet y Review Team (SRT) on a routine basis NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions apply, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (See Sect ion 9.2): The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant, or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event is related to study treatment If an exacerbation is caused by pneumonia then pneumonia should be considered the event and must be recorded in the AE or SAE form in the eCRF and on the pneumonia form in the eCRF (See Section 9.1.2 ) 12.9.4.1. Guideline for Determining Exacerbation Onset and Resolution Dates The date of onset of the exacerbation is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms of COPD as described in Section 12.9.1 . The date of resolution of the exacerbation should be based upon when the Investigator/treating physician and/or participant determines that the COPD symptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration should be given to eDiary recordings and/or participant evaluation. 12.9.4.2. Guideline for A ssessing Multiple Mild Exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined into one, per the Investigator’s ju dgement, if a participant’s diary reveals that the two mild COPD exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation -free day s. 2019N398117_00"

Guideline for A ssessing Exacerbations that Increase in Severity If an exacerbation begins as mild, but becomes modera te or severe or begins as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity. 12.9.5. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations To be eligible for this protocol, at Visit 1 (Screening), partic ipants must present with a moderate or severe (requires hospitalization) acute exacerbation of COPD requiring treatment with SoC (defined for this protocol as treatment with oral/s ystemic corticosteroid[s] and antibiotic[s]) to be confirmed by an experienc ed ph ysician (referred to as the ‘index COPD exacerbation;’ See Inclusion Criterion 4). SoC must be documented in the participant’s source documentation and in the eCRF. For the index COPD exacerbation at Scree ning and any subsequent COPD exacerbation(s) during the study (Screening, 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period, and the 12- Week Post -Treatment Follow- Up Period), the Investigator/medically qualified health care personnel should treat the participant’s COP D exacerbation as deemed medically appropriate. If medically necessary , the Principal I nvestigator or other medically qualified health care personnel may stop the participant’s double -blind study treatment temporarily in order to treat the COPD exacerbation. All medications (COPD and non -COPD) used for the treatment of an exacerbation(s) must be recorded in the source documents and in the COPD Exacerbation form in the eCRF. 12.9.6. Guidelines for Distinguishing Between Continuation of an Existing Exacerbation vers us a Subsequent New Exacerbation Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previ ous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 12.9.7. Pneumonia Participants who develop pneumonia during the 12 -Week Double -Blind Treatment Period should discontinue study treatment. For the purpose of this study, pneumonia is defined as ne w auscultatory findings compatible with parenchy mal lung infection and/or radiographic evidence of parench ymal/air space disease. All suspected cases of pneumonia are encouraged to be confirmed radiographically within 48 hours of diagnosis. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed or unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable). Information regarding chest X -ray-confirmed cases of pneumonia will be recorded in the eCRF. Details regarding the information to be captured for pneumonias will be provided in the SRM. 2019N398117_00"
