9,page_9,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 9 LY30091041.Synopsis Title of Study: A Phase 3,Multicenter, Doubl e-Blind, Rando mized, Pl acebo -Controlled Study Evaluat ing the Safety and Efficacy of Bar icitinib in Co mbinat ion with Topi cal Co rticosteroi ds in Pat ients with Moderate -to-Severe Atopic Dermat itisWhoHave Experienced Failure to Cyclo sporine or are Intol erant to, or have Contraindicat ion to,Cyclosporine . Rationale: Atopic derm atitis (AD) is a pruritic, chronic ,or chroni cally relapsing, highly symptomat ic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive T cell act ivation leading to significant skin infiltrat ion by T cells and dendrit ic cells (Bieber 2008). Presentation is varied, but includes skin manifesta tions and pruri tus, wi th associ ated sl eep di sturbances and subsequent skin infect ions. The course of disease includes relapses of varying duration and severit y. Mild AD can be controlled by appropriate skin care and topical treatments; moderate and severe AD usually require addit ional treatments such as phototherapy or sy stemic immunosuppressants (Wollenberg et al.2016). Cy closporine A (CyA) has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe AD in Europe and for the treatment of patients with re sistance to exist ing therapies in Japan and is used off -label in the United States (US) and other geographies (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). Cyclosporine A is usually considered a first -line option for patients requiring immunosuppressive treatment. However , the safety pro file of CyA limits its use to the short -term treatm ent of acute flares; for chronic severe AD, treatment duration should not exceed 1year ( Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). Hence, there is a need for alternat ive therapy for patients with moderat e-to-severe AD requiring systemic therapies. Baricitinib is an orally available, select ive Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with potency and select ivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2) (Fridman et al. 2010). The pathoge nesis of AD is thought to be modulated through thymic stromal lymphopoi etin (TSLP), interleukin (IL) -13, IL-4, IL-5, IL -22, and IL -31, many o f which act ivate receptors with downstream signaling through intracellular JAK1/JAK2/TYK2 (Nomura and Kabashima 2015). Thi s activity profile suggests that baricit inib woul d inhibit cy tokines involved in AD pathogenesis . Clinical studies have established that baricit inib is effect ive in autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases invo lving the jo ints, kidneys, and skin. Bari citinib was effect ive at reducing swo llen and tender jo ints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Genovese et al. 2016; Dougados et al. 2017; Fleischmann et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2017); was effective at reducing disease severit y in patients wi th moderat e-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Papp et al. 2016); was effect ive at reducing the urinary albumin- to-creati nine rat io in patients with diabetic kidney disease (Tuttle et al. 2015); and in a recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG) was effect ive at reducing disease severi ty in pat ients with moderate -to-severe AD. The mechanism of act ion, combined with dem onstrati on of clinical benefit in inflammatory diseases invo lving jo ints, kidneys, and skin, provides the rationale for evaluat ing baricit inib in m oderate -to-severe AD ."

After rerandomization, patients will remain on the same dose of baricit inib for the remainder of the study. Nonresponders who were randomized to bari citinib 4 -mg wil l remain on 4 -mg. Period 4: Bridging Extensio n: fro m Week 104 (Visit 22)and up to Week 200 ( Visit 28 ). Subjects who have completed Week 104 and have not met criteria o f perm anent discontinuat ion will have the possibilit y to remain in the trial for up to 96 additional weeks (up to Week 200) . Period 5 : Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period: from last treatm ent peri od visi t or early termination visit (ETV) to 4 weeks after the last dose of invest igational product. Treatment Arms and Duration: At baseline, p atients will be randomized at a 1:1:2:1 ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1-mg QD, baricit inib 2-mg QD, or baricit inib 4- mg QD for up to 200weeks."

Treatment comparisons of discre te efficacy variables will be made using a logistic regressio n analysis with treatment ,baseline disease severit y (vIGA AD) and baseline score in the model. Region may be added to the m odel if patient numbers allow. The proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatm ent com parisons will be reported. If a patient needs to use rescue m edicati on, the data from that point forward will be considered missing and missing data will be imputed using the nonrespond er imputati on (NRI) m ethod. Addi tional analyses will be conducted using all observed data regardless of whether rescue medicat ion was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) model with treatment, baseline severit y (vIGA AD), visi t, and treatment -by-visit interacti on as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interacti on as fixed continuous effects. Region m ay be added to the m odel if patient numbers allow. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-patient variance–covariance errors. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LS Ms) will be used for the statist ical com parison and contrasts will be set up within the model to com pare treatm ent groups at specific t ime points of interest. Fisher exact test will be used for all adverse events (AEs), baseline, discont inuat ion, and other categori cal safet y data. Conti nuous vital s igns and laboratory values will be analyzed by an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and baseline values in the model."

Background Atopic derm atitis (AD), or atopic eczema, is a co mmo n, chronic, relapsing, highly symptomatic inflammatory skin disease (Bieber 2010). Patients with AD may present wi th skin lesi ons that can be acute with oozing, crusted, eroded vesicles or papules on ery thematous pl aques. Pati ents may also present with lesio ns that have a subacute appearance, with thick and excoriated plaques, or chroni c appearance, with lichenified, slight ly pigmented, excoriated plaques (Bieber 2010). Atopic dermatit is causes pruritus throughout the day, which is the primary source of morbidity in this disorder (Simpson 2012). Pruritus often leads to an “itch –scratch” cycle, further com promising the epidermal barrier and result ing in dry skin, microbial co lonizat ion, and secondary infections (Krakowski et al. 2008), with 36% of patients reporting that they often or always scratch unt il their skin bleeds (Langenbruch et al. 2014). Pruritus from AD can worsen at night, result ing in sleep disturbances, with approximately 27% of adult pat ients with AD experiencing sleep disturbance as a result of itching (Langenbruch et al. 2014). In adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD, sleep qualit y and l atency were significant ly associated with poor qualit y of life (QoL) (Yano et al. 2013) . In cli nical pract ice, AD is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on a variet y of clinical features, including severit y of skin lesi ons and pruri tus, and extent of disease (body surface area [BSA] invo lved). Whereas mild AD can be controlled by appropria te skin care and topical anti-inflammatory treatm ents (topi cal corti costeroi ds [TCS] and topi cal calcineurin inhibitors [TCI s]), m oderate and severe AD usually require addit ional treatments such as phototherapy or sy stemic immunosuppressants (Wo llenberg etal. 2016). Cyclosporine A (CyA) has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe AD in most Europe an countries and for AD not con trolled with exist ing therapies in Japan and is used off-label in the USand other geographies (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). Cyclo sporine A is usually considered a first -line option for patients requiring immunosuppressive treatment. However, the safet y profile of CyA limit s its use to the short -term treatment of acute flares; for chronic severe AD, treatment duration shoul d not exceed 1 year ( Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). Hence, there is a need for alternative therapy for pati ents wi th moderate -to-severe AD requiring systemic therapi es, parti cularly those who have experienced failure to cy closporine or are intolerant to, or have c ontraindicat ion to, cyclosporine. Until recent ly, there were no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved systemic treatm ents for pati ents wi th moderate -to-severe AD, with the exception o f systemic corticosteroi ds. In March 2017, Dupixent (dupilumab) inject ion, an IgG4 m onocl onal ant ibody that inhibits interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13, was approved by the FDA for thi s pat ient populat ion (Dupixent package insert, 2017) . In the European Unio n, only cyclosporine has b een approved for the treatm ent of patients wi th severe AD (Bi eber and Straeter 2015). A recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG [JAHG]) evaluated the safety and efficacy of baricit inib (a Janus"

Janus kinases are a family o f tyrosine kinases that m ediate cy tokine receptor signaling through phosphorylat ion and activat ion of signal transducers and activators of transcript ion (STAT) proteins. There are 4 known JAK family members: J AK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Clark et al. 2014). The relat ive affinit y of JAK inhibitors for different members of the JAK kinase family allows for different iation of JAK inhibitors in relatio n to thei r enzymat ic inhibitory profile. In vitro assays indicate that baricit inib is a select ive inhibitor of JAKs with potency and select ivity for JAK1/2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 (Fri dman et al . 2010). The balanced JAK1/JAK2 inhibitory profile o f baricit inib suggests that baricit inib will have the greatest modulatory effect in cy tokines signaling through a JAK1/JAK2 heterodimer intracellularly (or a JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), such as IL -6, TSLP, IL-13, or IL -31 (Vaddi and Luchi 2012; Zhong et al 2014)."

Period 1: Screening and Baseli ne Period The durati on of the Screening Period is between 8 and 35 days pri or to Visit 2 (Week 0). At Visit1, the pati ent will sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being performed (see Appendix 3 ). All screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). Patients who receive a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) skin test at Visit 1 will need to return within 48 to 72 hours later to read the skin test. Prior to randomizat ion, treatm ents for AD will be washed out: 5 half -lives for biologic treatm ents, 4weeks for sy stemic treatm ents,and 2 weeks for topical treatments (not including emo llients). Patients will be required to use emo llients daily during the 14 days preceding rando mization andthroughout the study . On study visit days, pati ents are requested not to apply emollients unt il after the assessments are completed. If patients have been using emollients daily at the time of screening, then those cumulat ive days can be ut ilized to meet inclusio n criterion [9]. Addit ionally, collect ion of data through daily diaries will be requi red throughout the screening period. The baseline for the daily PRO assessments will be the average score of the 7 days prior to randomizat ion; thus the minimum screening window was set at 8days. All eligible patients who have not previously received the herpes zoster vaccine by screening will be encouraged (per local guidelines) to do so prior to randomizat ion. Refer to the exclusio n criterion [29] in Secti on6for addi tional information regarding herpes zoster vaccinat ions. Invest igators should review the vaccinat ion status of their patients and fo llowthe local guidelines for vaccinat ion of those ≥18years of age with nonlive vaccines intended to prevent infect ious di sease pri or to entering pat ients into the study .

Patients will also apply background TCS therapy (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% oint ment)on active lesions, as described in Secti on7.7.2 (Use of Topical Corticosteroi ds). Use of TC Isand/or crisaborol e (where approved) will be permitted as background therapy on areas where applicat ion of TCS i s considered inappropriate by investigator ( e.g., face, neck, skin fo lds, genital areas ;see Sect ion7.7.1 [Permitted Medicatio ns and Procedures]). High -or ultra-high potency TCS (Class I to III; see Appendix 7 )and all systemic therapies used for treating ADwill not be allowed, unless used as directed as part of rescue therapy (see guidelines in Sect ion7.7.5 [Rescue Therapy]) and only at the discretion of the invest igator. Rescue to baricit inib will not occur during treatmen t Peri od2. Assessments of disease severit y will be perform ed by the investi gator at all study visits incl uding unscheduled and early terminat ionvisits (ETVs).

Patients eligible for the substudy will be rerando mized at a 1:1 ratio at Week 52 based on the baricit inib treatm ent group assigned at baseline:  4-mg QD rerandomized to bari citinib 4 -mgQD, or bari citinib 2 -mgQD  2-mg QD rerandomized to bari citinib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 1 -mg QD Note: Intensificat ion of emo llients and TCS may be cont inued or init iated to control worsening and unacceptable symptoms of AD any time during this treatm entperiod . For management of TCS, follow the guidelines in Section7.7.2 . Retreatment During the substudy , if worsening of AD symptoms occurs such that IGA increases to ≥3, the patient will be autom atically retreated wi th their presubstudy baricitinib dose . When the IGA is ≥3, the investigator should reinit iate background TCS therapy (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% oint ment), provided the patients are not currently using TCS, and may prescribe high -or ultra-high-potency TCS f ollowing the guidelines for use of Rescue Therapies ( Secti on7.7.5 [Rescue Therapy]). An unscheduled visit may be needed to assess worsening of symptom s and to perform clinical safety and efficacy assessments immediately before retreatment. Invest igators wi ll be aware of the patients not meeting the first 3 eligibilit y criteria for rando mized downtitration substudy; however, they will not be aware of the patient’s dose assigned at randomizat ion. As such, IGA ≥3 will be the criterion for both retreatm ent (in the substudy ) and rescue for pati ents not eligible for the substudy , as described below , to ensure that all patients are treated similarly and thatthe blind ingto treatm ent group is preserved. In addition, a ll pat ients, regardless o f whether entered int o the substudy or not, willfollow all study procedures in Period 3 to maintain the blind. 5.1.3.2.

Pati ents in the baricit inib 4 -mg group will remain on 4- mg. This option for rescue is only available once for each pat ient and will be assigned by IWRS; investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignments. The investigator may reini tiate background TCS therapy (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% oint ment), provi ded the pati ents are not currently using TCS , and may prescribe high -or ultra-high-potency TCS fo llowing the gui delines for use of rescue therapies (see Section7.7.5 ). Once a pat ient has an IGA ≥ 3in Period 3, the investigator will know that a pati ent is on the highest dose of baricit inib that he/she will receive in the study; therefore, if AD symptom s remain unacceptable then discont inuat ionshoul d be consi dered. 5.1.4. Period 4: Bridging Extension Patients who have completed Week 104 and have not met criteria for permanent discontinuation will have the possibilit y to rem ain in the tri al for up to 96 addit ional weeks (up to Week 200) .

If a patient permanent ly discont inues invest igational product for any reason before Week 16 (Visit 8), the pati ent is encouraged to remain in the study through Week 16 (Vi sit8) and fo llow the regular visit schedule to provide the primary efficacy and safet y data (See Section 5.1.3 ). 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 500participants will be enrolled; approximately 714 patients will be screened to achieve this enro llment . 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f Activities(Secti on2) for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationa le for Study Design This study will enroll pat ients with moderate -to-severe AD who have a history of failure to cyclosporine or who are intolerant to, or have contraindicat ion to,cyclosporine ,for whom a systemic treatm ent such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate. Topi cal corti costeroi ds are the first -line ant i -inflammatory treatment, even for patients treated with systemic treatm ents. For this reason, this study will assess the efficacy of baricitinibin combinat ion with background mild -to moderate -potency TCS, used as determined appropriate by the investigator. Both EASI score and Invest igator’s Global Assessments are commonly used in clinical trials , both for qualifying patients for enrollment and f or evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langle y et al. 2015; Futam ura et al . 2016 ; Bożek and Reich, 2017 ).There is no single “go ld standard ” disease severit y scale for AD; however, IGA scales provide clinically meaningful measures to patients and invest igators that are easily described and that correspond to disease severit y categori es (for example, moderate to severe) and a 75% improvement fro m Baseline (EASI75) is a commo nly used m easure of treatm ent effect in AD clinical trials. The IGA scale that will be us ed in this trial, the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermat itis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA) assesses AD severit y using a 5 -point scale (0 to 4). It was developed in partnership wit h a m ulti-stakehol der cons ortium,including experts in AD, industry partners, and academia . Devel opment of the vIGA -AD also included the development of a training video and certificat ion exam to ensure consistency across raters. The scale and all training materials are available to all other pharm aceuti cal com panies, as well as any academic investigator interested in using the scale through the International Eczema Council. During the screening period (Period 1), a washout of systemic and topical treatments for AD is incorporated prior to randomizat ion to minimize confounding effects due to background treatm ent."
37,page_37,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 37 LY3009104The 52-week doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled treatment period (Period 2) is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of 3doses of baricit inibrelative to placebo, in co mbinat ion with TCS, both in short -term and l ong-term treatm ent of pat ients with moderate -to-severe AD. Study JAIN will include the possibilit y to down titrate barici tinib in patients who are responders (IGA 0 or 1) or partial res ponders (IGA 2) in the context of a rando mized downtitration substudy starting at Week 52. Study JAIN will also evaluate the possibilit y to upti trate nonresponders (IGA ≥3) during Peri od3. A 1:1:2 :1 randomizat ion scheme of placebo, 1 -mg baricit inib, 2 -mgbaricitinib, and 4 -mg baricit inib was implemented in JAIN to obtain addit ional efficacy and safet y data for the 2 -mg dose of baricit inib relat ive to other studies conducted with baricit inib in AD. All patients in Study JAIN will be assigned invest igationa l product with concomitant mild-to moderate -potency TCS until Week 104 (Visit 22) and i nvest igators mayrescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable orworsening symptoms of A Dwith high -or ultra-high-potency TCS. (See Section 7.7.5 for all rescue options ). Topi cal rescue treatm ents (as outlined in Sect ion7.7.5 ) will be available during Study JAIN to facilitate the management of disease ,as there are instances where patients will remain on the same dose of baricit inib during episodes of worsening. The 16 -week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is likely that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h bari citinib wit hin this timeframe based on the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD, and for consistency wit h other studies in AD. This timing will all ow adequate durati on on a stabl e dose of baricit inib to assess the benefit/risk profile of the dose regimens. During the l ong-term extensio n (Peri od3), eligible patients will participate in a downtitration substudy . The object ive of the substudy is to ev aluate the possibilit y of maintaining efficacy with a lower dose of baricit inib in pat ients with response (IGA 0 or 1) or partial response (IGA 2) to baricit inib 2 -mg QD or 4 -mg QD in combinat ion with TCS. Period 4 will provi depatients who have co mpleted Week 104 visit and have not met criteria for perm anent discont inuat ion,the possibilit y to rem ain in the tri al for up to 96 additional weeks (up to Week 200). This will allow for addi tional long-term efficacy and safet y informat ion to be collected, and provi de pati ents the opportunit y to continue study treatm ent until the ant icipated approval of baricitinib in this indicat ion. The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od5) is for safet y monitoring after the patient has been o ff invest igational product f or approximately 28 days. 5.5. Justification for Dose The doses proposed for AD Phase 3 studi es are baricit inib 1 -mg, 2 -mg, and 4 -mg QD . These doses were chosen primarily based on the recently completed Phase 2 AD study , JAHG, and are additionally supported by pharm acokinetic ( PK), safet y, and efficacy data for bari citinib in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studi es and a Phase 2 psoriasis study ."
38,page_38,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 38 LY3009104In the Phase 2 Study JAHG, both the 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses showed benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints (EASI, IGA , SCORing Atopic Dermat itis [SCORAD ], Patient-Oriented Eczem a Measure [POEM ],and Derm atology Life Qualit y Index[DLQI ]) as compared to pl acebo, and both doses had an acceptable safet y profile at Week 16. The 4-mg dose appeared to demonstrate a more rapid benefit (at 4 weeks) on the more stringent endpo ints (EASI75, EASI90, and IGA 0 or 1) compared to 2 -mg dose particularly in the subgroup of patients with baseline EASI scores ≥16. The 4- mg dose resulted in statist ically significant improvement in these en dpoints at Week 4 and this level o f response was maintained through Week 16. Addi tionally, stati stical signific ance for EASI75 for the 4- mg dose compared to placebo also occurred at Week 4, and thi s level of response was maintained through Week 16. A sim ilar trend between the baricit inib 4 -mg and 2 -mg doses was observed in pat ients with RA. However, on other endpoints including EASI50, and EASI change from baseline, 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses show similar efficacy compared to placebo. Thus, based on available data, 3 doses will be included in Phase 3, including a 1- mg dose, to cover the range of exposures where clinical responses could be ant icipated . 5.5.1. Rationale for Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment Baricitinib exposure increase s with decreased renal funct ion. Based on PK simulat ions of baricit inib exposures for the mild and moderate categories o f renal funct ion (stratified as estimated glo merular filtrat ion rate [eGFR] 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2and eGFR 30 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively ), dose adj ustmentis not required for patients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2.Patients with eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2who are randomized to the 4-mg dose will receive a dose of 2 –mg QD, which will ensure that exposures do not exceed those of the 4- mg QD dose in pat ients witheGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. For patients rando mized to the 2- mg dose or 1- mg dose, there wil l be no dose adjustment based on renal funct ion. The dose adjustment for renal impairment will be managed by IWRS to ensure maintenance of the treatm ent blind. Thi s study will not enroll patients with screening eGFR <40 mL/min/1.73 m2. See Secti on8.1.1 for eGFR thresho lds that tri gger interrupti on of invest igational product. The procedure fordose adjust ment based on renal funct ion (eGFR) during the study is detailed in Secti on 7.2.2 ."

Packaging for each dose will include 3 tablets per day . Each tablet has a dist inctive shape and color, 4-mg versus 2-mg v ersus 1-mg, and each strength tablet has a matching placebo. Each"
50,page_50,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY3009104active dose package will contain the appropriate active strength tablet, and correspo nding placebo tabletsfor the other strengths, as noted in Table JAIN. 3. Invest igational product tablets will be provided in blister packs. Clinical trial materials will b e labeled according to the country ’s regul atory requi rements. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1 -mg QD, 2 -mg QD, or 4 -mg QD to double -blind treatm ent at Visi t 2 (Week 0). Randomization will be stratified by geographic regi on if the planned country allocat ion justifies, and disease severit y at baseline (IGA 3 versus 4 ). Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generate d random seque nce using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign cartons, each containing 4 blister packs of doubl e-blind investigat ional product tablets to each patient , starting at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at each visit up to and including Visit 28 (Week 200). Site personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct carton by entering a confirmat ion number found on the carton into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The invest igational product (3 tablets fro m blister pack) should be taken once da ilywithout regard to food and, if possible, at approximately the same t ime every day, usually at the start of the pati ent’s day , to ai d pati ent com pliance. 7.2.2. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment The rati onale of dose adjust ment for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2) is detailed in Sect ion5.5.1 . The dose adjust ment for renal impairment will be managed by IWRS to ensure maintenance of the treatment blind. The eGFR value from the screening visit (Visit 1) will be entered into IWRS atVisit 2, and IWRS will assign the treatment doses accordingly. Patients wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2), who are randomized to the 4-mg active treatment arm will receive a dose of 2-mg QD by the IWRS .For patients randomized to the 2 -mg dose or 1-mg dose , there will be no dose adjustmentbased on renal function. No dose adjust ment will be made for p atients with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients who are randomized to active treatment will receive their assigned dose, either baricit inib 4 -mg, 2 -mg, or 1 -mg, respectively . During the study, f or patients with documented renal impairment when the subsequent eGFR falls <30mL/min/1.73 m2, investigational product will be wi thheld until their eGFR becomes ≥40mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the investigational product dosing may resume. For patients with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2, when the subsequent eGFR falls to <40mL/min/1.73 m2, investigational product will be wi thheld until their eGFR becomes ≥50mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the investigational product dosing may resume (Section 8.1.1 )."
51,page_51,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 51 LY30091047.3. Blinding This is a double -blind study . To pres erve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. All study assessments will be performed by study personnel who are blinded to the patient’s treatm ent group. Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, invest igators, Lilly study team, and any personnel interact ing direct ly wit h pat ients or investigat ive sites will remain blinded to baricit inib and placebo assignment until after completion of the double -blinded treatment periods. It is expected that the need for unblinding a patient’s treatment pri or to com pletion of the double -blinded treatment periods will be extremely rare. Every effort shoul d be m ade to preserve the blind unless there is a co mpelling reason that knowl edge of the specific treatment would alter the medical care of the patient. In case of an emergency, the invest igator has the sole responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatme nt assignment is warranted for medical management of the event. Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatment assignment is unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately. If the invest igator deci des that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to prompt ly document the decisio n and rationale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . This option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding events are recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblinded, the patient m ust be di scont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician for the patient to con tinue in the study . Process es to m aintain blinding during the interim analysis conducted by the DMC are described in Section 10.3.7.1 . 7.4. Dosage Modification Not applicable . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability All invest igational product (used and partially used) will be returned to the sponsor or destroyed at site level with the sponsor’s wri tten approval . In so me cases, sites may destroy the material if, during the invest igative site select ion, the evaluator has verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and written procedures to dispose of clinical trial materials. Follow storage and handling instructions on the investigational product packagin g. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Patient com pliance wi th study medicat ion will be assessed at each visit during the treatment period (Vi sit 4through Visit 28) by counting returned tablets."

Similarly , a pati ent will be considered significant ly noncom pliant if he o r she i s judged by the investi gator to have intent ionally or repeatedly taken 20% more than the prescribed amount of medicat ion during the study . Patients will be counseled by study staff on the importance of taking the invest igational product as prescribe d, as appropri ate. Patients’ com pliance will be further defined in the statist ical analysis plan (SAP). 7.7. Concomitant Therapy All conco mitant m edicat ion,whether prescription or over the counter, used at baseline and/or during the course of the study , must b e recorded on the Concomitant Medicat ion electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients will be instructed to consult the invest igator or other appropriate study personnel at the site before taking any new medicat ions or suppl ements during the study . For A D therapies permitted as part of rescue therapy , see Secti on7.7.5 . 7.7.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures Treatment with conco mitant AD therapies dur ing the study is permitted only as described below. Daily use of emo llients i s requi red as background treatment up to Week 104. After Week 104, the continued use of emo llient sis encouraged. Moisturizers wi th antiprurit icsor antiseptics are not permitted up to Week 104. If daily applicat ions are missed, i t will not be consi dered a protocol violation. Emollients will not be supplied by the sponsor , unless required by local regulations. oPatients shoul d not apply emo llients on the day of their study visit prior to the procedures to allow for adequate assessment of skin dryness. Background TCS therapy (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocortisone 2.5% ointment)are to be used on active lesio nsin Periods 2 and 3, as d escribed in Secti on7.7.2 . High-or ultra-high-potency TCS are only permitted as rescue therapy as described in Secti on7.7.5 (Rescue Therapy). During Peri od 4, concomitant use of TCS may be continued , as di rected by the investigator, as per clinical pract ice. TCIs(e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), or topical PDE -4 inhibitor (i.e., crisaborole , where approved) are permitted in place of TCS on areas where applicat ion of TCS i s considered inappropriate by the investigator; use should be limited to problem areas (e.g., face, neck, skin fo lds, genital areas, etc.) as described in Secti on7.7.2 . Phototherapy , including therapeut ic phototherapy (psoralen and ultravio letA, ultravioletB, excimer laser), is permitted as rescue therapy in Peri ods 2 to 4(see Secti on7.7.5 , Rescue Therapy); however, it requires a temporary interrupti on of investigat ional product (see Section 8.1.1 ). In addit ion, the fo llowing therapies are permi tted during the study :"

For those patients on stable dosing of prescription sleep medications at entry , downward dose adjustm ents or discont inuat ion of treatment may occur during the study. No more than 1 intra -articular or sof t tissue (bursa, tendons, and ligaments) corticosteroid injection is allowed up until the 16 -week primary endpoint. After 16 weeks, such injections are permitted. Any changes tothese conco mitant m edicati ons m ust be recorded in the Concomitant Therapy of Speci al Interest eCRF. Treatment with conco mitant therapi es for other m edical condi tions such as diabetes and hypertensio n is permitted during the study . 7.7.2. Use of Topical Corticosteroids A washout period of 14 days is required for all TCS prior to randomization a t Visit 2. At baseline (Week 0, Visit 2)and up to Week 104 (Visit 22) , patients will receive triamcinolone 0.1% cream (or equivalent -potency TCS) and hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (or equivalent -potency TCS). See “Choice of Background Topical Corticosteroid” below. Triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate- potency TCS) should be applied at least once daily to affected areas until lesions are under control (clear or almost clear). Patients should then switch to hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low -poten cy TCS) and treat previously affected areas once-daily for 7days and then stop. Hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low -potency TCS) may also be used to replace triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency TCS) on areas of thin skin (face, neck, folds, and genit al areas) and areas with skin atrophy. If lesions reappear during the course of the study, the patients should resume the once-daily applications of triamcinolone 0.1% cream (moderate -potency TCS) or hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (low-potency TCS) as descri bed above. For patients whose lesions persist or worsen despite the use of emollients and low -and/or moderate -potency TCS and/or patients who require daily applications on large surfaces may be considered for topical rescue with high -or ultra -high-potenc y TCS (see Secti on7.7.5 for details). On the days of study visits, topical therapy including TCS should not be applied before the patient has under gone all study procedures and clinical evaluations in order to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness."
54,page_54,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY3009104After Week 104, use of TCS may be cont inued as directed by the invest igator, as per clinical practi ce.

Temporary Interruption ofInvestigational Product In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnorm al laboratory values that m ay have an unclear relationship to invest igational product. For example, investigational product sh ould be temporarily interrupted if the patient experiences a cardi ovascular AE considered to be related tostudy treatm ent,isgraded asmoderate (Grade 2 according to Common Termino logyCriteriaforAdverse Events [CTCAE] Version 3.0), and that does not resolve promptly withsupporti vecare. Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that the invest igator cons ult with Lilly (or i ts desi gnee) before tem porarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than those defined in Table JAIN. 4. For the abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regardless of re latedness) listed in Table JAIN. 4,specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatm ent m ay be restarted. Retest frequency and timing of fo llow-up laboratory tests to m onitor the abnormal finding are at the discret ion of the invest igator.

Appendix 2 and Appendix 4 listthe laboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days o f recei pt of confi rmed test resul ts. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessment Eczema Area and Severity Index scores : The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1) ery thema, (2) i ndurati on/papulat ion, (3) excoriat ion, and (4) lichenificat ioneach on a scale o f 0 to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Hanifin et al 2001). Body surface area affected by AD will be derived from data collected as part of the EASI assessment. 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA AD) The IGA used in this study , the vIGA AD (referred to as the IGA throughout the protocol) measures the investigator’s global assessment of the pati ent’s overall severit y of their AD, based on a stati c, numeri c 5 point scale from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of ery thema, papul ation/indurat ion, oozing/crust ing, and lichenificat ion. 9.1.2.2. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD )index uses the rule o f nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6clinical characterist ics to determine disease severit y: (1) ery thema, (2)edema/papulat ion, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation ,(5) lichenification , and (6) dryness . The SCORAD index also assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep l oss. These 3aspects: extent of disease, disease severit y, and subjective symptoms combine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder and Taieb 1993; Oranje et al 2007). 9.1.3.

Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale The Hospi tal Anxiet y Depressi on Scal e (HADS) i s a 14 -item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiet y and depressio n that a patient is experiencing over the past week. The HADS utilizes a 4 -point Li kert scal e (e.g., 0 to 3) for each quest ion and i s intended for ages 12 to 65 years (Zigmo nd and Snait h 1983 ; White et al. 1999). Scores for each domain (anxiet y and depress ion) can range from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicat ing greater anxiet y or depressio n (Zigmo nd and Snait h 1983; Snait h 2003). 9.1.3.2. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM i s a simple, 7- item, pati ent-administered scale that assesses disease severit y in children and adults. Patients respond to questions about the frequency o f 7symptoms (itching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week. Response categories include “No day s,” “1 to 2 days,” “3 to 4 day s,” “5 to 6 days,” and “Every day” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Scores range from 0 to 28, with higher total scores indicat ing greater disease severit y (Charman et al . 2004 ). 9.1.3.3. Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch N umeric Rating Scale (NRS) is a pati ent-administered , 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” The o verall severit y of a pati ent’s i tching i s indicated by select ingthe number that best describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours (Naegeli et al. 2015; Kimball et al. 2016) . 9.1.3.4. Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale The Atopic Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) is a 3 -item, patient -administered quest ionnaire developed to assess the i mpact of i tch on sleep including difficult y falling asleep, frequency of waking, and difficult y getting back to sleep last night. Patients rate their difficult y falling asleep and difficult y getting back to sleep, Items 1 and 3, respectively , using a 5 -point Likert -type scale with response opti ons ranging fro m 0 “not at all” to 4 “very difficult.” Patients report their frequency of waking l ast ni ght, Item 2, by select ing the number of times they woke up each night, ranging fro m 0 to 29 times. The ADSS is designed to be com pleted each day with respondents thinking about sleep “last night.” Each item is scored individually. 9.1.3.5. Skin PainNumeric Rating Scale Skin Pain NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 represent ing “no pain” and 10 re p resent ing “worst pain imaginable.” The overall severit y of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst level o f skin pain in the past 24 hours. 9.1.3.6. Patient Global Impression of Severity The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty–Atopic Derm atitis (PGI -S -AD) is a single -item question asking the patient how they woul d rate thei r overall AD symptoms over the past 24hours. The 5 categories o f responses range from “no symptoms” to “s evere.”"
65,page_65,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 65 LY30091049.1.3.7. Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -item, validated, qualit y-of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatm ent. The recall period of this scale is over the “last week.” Response categories include “not at all,” “a lot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respectively ,and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as 0. Scores range from 0 to 30, wi th higher scores indicating greater impairment of QoL . A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 i s considered as having no effect on a patient’s healt h-related QoL (Hongbo et al. 2005) , and a 4-point change fro m baseline is considered as th e minimal clinically important difference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002; Basra et al. 2015 ). 9.1.3.8. European Quality of Life –5Dimensions – 5Levels The European Qualit y of Life –5 Dimensi ons– 5 Levels (EQ-5D -5L) is a standardized measure of healt h status thatprovide sa simple, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic apprai sal. The EQ -5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 -to 100 -mm visual analog s cale (VAS ). The descript ive system co mprises the fo llowing 5 dimensio ns: m obility, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extrem e probl ems. The respondent is asked to indicate his or her healt h state by ticking (or pl acing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropri ate statem ent in each o f the 5dimensions. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no arith metic properties and should not be used as an ordinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vertical VAS where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure of healt h outcome. The EQ-5D- 5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D- 5L descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n (Herdm an et al . 2011; EuroQol Group 2015 [WWW]). 9.1.3.9. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire –Atopic Dermatitis The Work Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment Questi onnai re–Atopic Dermat itis (WPAI -AD) records impairme nt due to AD during the past 7 days. The WPAI -AD consists of 6items grouped into 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presentee ism (impai rment at work/reduced on -the-job effect iveness), work productivit y loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism p lus presenteeism), and activit y impairment. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993) ,with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y."

Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 Acute (SF-36) The SF -36v2 Acute m easure is a subject ive, generic, health -related QoL instrument that is patientreported and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical funct ioning, bodily pain, rol e limi tations due to phy sical problems, role limi tations due to em otional probl ems, general healt h perceptions, mental health, social funct ion, and vitalit y(Ware and Sherbourne 1992) . Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale ,with higher scores indicating better health status or funct ioning. In addition, 2 summary scores, the PCS (physical component score) and the MCS (mental component score), will be evaluated based on the 8 SF -36v2 Acute domains. 9.1.4. Appropriateness of Assessments All assessments utilized in this study are standard, wi dely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant except ADSS and Skin Pain NRS, which are current ly being developed and validated according to regulatory guidances. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing , through an appropriate healt h care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, considered related to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patientto discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resol ves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, becaus e the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. The invest igator will record all relevant AE and SAE informat ion in the eCRF. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record in the eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatm ent in the study . In addi tion, si te personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs . Invest igators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to invest igational product, via eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a stu dy procedure, taking into account the disease, concomitant treatment, or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a"
67,page_67,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 67 LY3009104cause- and-effect relationship between the invest igational product, study device and/or study procedure ,and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational prod uct is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, cl arifying if possible the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificat ionsor discont inuat ions of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in 1of the f ollowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardi ze the pati ent or may requi re intervent ion to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above. Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour not ificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation.Patients w ith a serious hepat ic AE should have addit ional data collected using the hepat ic safet y eCRF. Pregnancy ( during m aternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligat ed to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the pati ent disposit ion CRF has been completed)."
68,page_68,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 68 LY3009104However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been di scharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adve rse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. US21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requi rements in parti cipat ing countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be fo llowed f or the i dentificat ion, recording ,and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo balregulat ions and the associ ated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Adverse Event s of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will include the following: infect ions(including TB, herpes zoster, or opportunist ic infections) malignancies (except for successfully treated basal or squamous cell skin carcino ma) hepat ic events (see Section 9.4.10 ) major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (see Sect ion9.4.9 ) thrombotic events (such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmo nary embo lism). Sites will provide details on these AEs as instructed on the eCRF and may be asked for additional descripti on by Lilly. 9.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety Any clinically significant findings fro m ECG testi ng, physical examinat ion, vital signs measurements, or laboratory measurement sthat resul t in a di agnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee a s an AE via eCRF."

Electrocardiograms A single 12- lead standard ECG will be obtained lo cally at Visit 1 and read by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site to determine whether the patient meets entry criteria. Electrocard iogram s may be obtained at addi tional times, when deemed clinically necessary . 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vital signs shoul d be measured according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). 9.4.3. Physical Examination For each patient, acomplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic and rectal examinat ions) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening). A symptom -directed physical exami nation will be perform ed at other visits as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). A com plete physical examinat ion may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion at any time a patient presents with physical co mplaints. 9.4.4. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Wit h the ex cepti on of laboratory test resul ts that m ay unblind the study , Lilly or i ts desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. 9.4.5. Columbia Suicide Sever ity Rating Scale The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/clinical experience. The tool was developed by the National Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categorizat ion of suicidal events. For this study, the scale has been adapted (with permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale t hat captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs shoul d be fo llowed."
70,page_70,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 70 LY30091049.4.6. Self-Harm and Follow -Up Supplement Forms Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit, with the administrati on of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral events is greater than zero, it will lead to the complet ion of the self -harm fo llow-up form. The self -harm follow-up form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases. 9.4.7. Chest x -ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or–anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained l ocally at screening (V isit1), unl ess resul ts from a chest x -ray obtained wi thin 6 months prior to the study are available. The chest x-ray will be reviewed by the invest igator or his or her designee to exclude pat ients with active TB infect ion. In addi tion, pati ents will be tested at screening (Visit 1) for evidence o f active or latent TB as described in the exclusio n criteria (Secti on6.2) . Invest igators should fo llowlocal guidelines for m onitoring pat ients for TBif a pat ient is at hi gh risk for acqui ring TB or reactivat ion of latent TB. 9.4.8. Hepatitis B Virus DNA Monitoring Patients who are HBcAb posit ive and HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require periodic measurement of HBV DNA as per study schedule (Sect ion2), regardless of their hepat itisB surface antibody (HBsAb) status. The fo llowing acti ons shoul d be taken in response to HBV DNA test results: If a single result is obtained with a value “below limit of quant itation, ”the test should be repeated within approximately 2weeks. If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” HBV DNA monitoring willbe performed per study schedule (Section 2). If the patient has 2or more test results with a value “below limit of quantitation” or a test result above the limit of quant itation, the patient will be permanent ly discont inued from investigat ional product (see Section 8.1.2 ) and should be re ferred to a hepatology specialist. 9.4.9. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members of the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data; refer to Interim Analyses sectio n [Secti on10.3.7 ]) can conduct addit ional analyses o f the safet y data. The Lilly clinical research physician will mo nitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames m andated by com pany procedures. The Lilly clinical"
71,page_71,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 71 LY3009104research physician will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist and peri odically review trends in safet y data and l aboratory analy tes. Any concerning trends in frequency or severit y noted by an investigator and/or Lilly (or designee) may require further evaluat ion. All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These reports will be reviewed to ensure completeness and accuracy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or a clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to invest igational product, only Lilly G lobal Pat ient Safety will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring. Invest igators will mo nitor vital signs and carefully review findings that may be associated with cardi ovascular and venous thrombotic events. Adverse event reports and vital signs will be collected at each study visit. The cardi ovascular moni toring plan includes the fo llowing: regul ar monitoring of lipid l evels potenti al MA CE (cardi ovascular death, MI, stroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospi talizati on for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resusc itated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularizat ion such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervent ion), venous thrombotic events ,and noncardiovascular deaths will be identified by the invest igative site or through m edical review and will be sent to a blinded Clinical Event Committee for adjudicat ion at regul ar intervals. 9.4.10. Hepatic Safety Monitoring If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3 x ULN, ALP ≥2 x ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2 x ULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be ini tiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medical mo nitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST , TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Discontinuati on cri teria of investigational products, either temporary interruption or permanent discontinuat ion, due to abnormal ALT, AST, TBL, or ALP, are det ailed in Section8.1. 9.4.10.1. Hepatic Safety Data Collection Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the hepat ic eCRF if 1 or more of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5 x ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥2 x ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2 x ULN on 2 or more consecutive blood tests"

Ignoring stratificat ion, the proposed sample size will ensure a >90% power based on the Chi -square test to detect an absolute difference of approximately 25% between the 4- mg baricit inib and the placebo treatm ent groups, and the 2 -mg baricit iniband the pl acebo treatm ent groups, each using a 2-sided alpha of 0.025 and assuming approximately 20% placebo response rate for the primary endpo int. These assumpt ions are based on what was observed in the Phase 3 study (JAIY). Sample size and power esti mates were obtained from nQuery ®Advisor 7.0. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and healt h outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion, defined as all rando mized patients ,even if the patient does n ot receive the correct treatment, or otherwise d idnot fo llow the protocol. Unless otherwise specified, s afety analyses will be conducted on all rando mized pat ients who receive at least 1 dose of invest igational product they were randomized to in Study JAIN and who did not discont inue from the study for the reason “Lost to Follow -up” at the first postbaseline visit . Patients will be analyzed for efficacy , heal th outcomes, and safet y according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Further detail s will be described in the SAP, including but not limited to, addi tional popul ations for the randomized down -titration substudy . Significant protocol violations will be described in the SAP. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly or i ts desi gnee. A detailed SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be developed by Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will requ ire an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report. Addi tional expl oratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deem ed appropri ate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit h baseline disease severit y (vIGA AD), baseline score and treatment group in the model. Region may be added as an addit ional factor if the planned country allocation justifies, and stratificatio n has not resulted in empt y strata. This will be finalized in the SAP. If appropriate, t reatment -by-region interacti on may be added to the"
75,page_75,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 75 LY3009104model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interact ion is significant at a 2-sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative ( i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direction but not size o f the effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial for so me but not all regio ns). The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. The p -value fro m the Fisher exact test will also be produced. Addit ional relative measures, for example, odds ratio, may be reported as appropriate. When evaluat ing cont inuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed model for repeated m easures (MMRM) will be used. The model will include treatment, baseline severit y (vIGA AD), visi t, and treatm ent-by-visit interacti on as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction as fixed cont inuous effects. Region may be added as an addit ional factor if the planned country allocation justifies. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between -and within -patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward –Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees of freedo m. TypeIII sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statist ical co mpar ison; 95% CI will also be reported. Contrasts will be set up within the model to test treatment groups at specific t ime points of interest. Further details on the use of MMRM will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables may also be made using analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) with disease severit y, treatm ent group, and baseline value in the model. Regio nmay be added as an addit ional factorif the planned country allocat ion justifies. TypeIII tests for LSMs will be used for statist ical com parison between treatm ent groups. The LSM difference, standard error, p -value, and 95% CI may also be reported. The methods used to handle missing da ta will be specified in the SAP. Time -to-event analysis may be done and would be analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model with disease severi ty and treatm ent group i n the m odel. Regi onmay be added as an additional factor if the planned country allocati on justifies . Hazard ratio with CIs may be reported. Kaplan –Meier curves may also be produced. Diagnostic tests for checking the validit y of the proporti onal hazards assum ption may be perform ed and these woul d be described in detail in the SAP. If the assumption of proportional hazards is not just ified, nonproportionalit y may be modeled by stratificat ion, as the most likely variable that interacts with time is categorical, that is, disease severit y. Fisher exact test will be used for the AEs, discont inuat ion, and other categorical safet y data for between -treatm ent group com parisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuous safet y variables including laboratory variables will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value in the model. Shift tables for categorical safet y analyses (e.g., “high” or “low” laboratory resul ts) will also be produced."

Missing Data Imputation Nonresponder imputation (NRI): All patients who discont inue the study or the study treatm ent at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI50/75/90 fro m the time of discontinuat ion and onward. Patients who receive rescue therapy (high or ul tra-high potency TCS, photo therapy , or sy stemic therapies for treatment of AD, see Secti on7.7.5 ) will be analyzed as nonresponders from the point of rescue and onward. An addit ional analysis will be performed that includes all available data regardl ess of whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. Continuous variables such as EASI and SCORAD scores will be assumed to be missing fro m the point of rescue or discontinuation and then anMMRM analysis will be perform ed. An addit ional analysis will be perform edthat includes all available data regardless o f whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. Last observed carried forward: An ad ditional analysis will be performedthat uses the last observed value prior to discont inuat ion or rescue therapy . Thi s will then be analyzed using a logist ic model for categori cal variables or ANCOVA for continuous variables as described above. There will be further discussio n on the relevant estimands including appropriate methods for analysis and imputation of missing data in the SAP. This will include specificat ions of additional sensi tivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints such as tipping point as well as a reference -based mult iple imputation method. 10.3.1.2. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons Multiplicity controlled analyses will be conducted on the primary and maj or secondary endpoints in order to control the overall family -wise typeI error rate at a 2 -sided level of 0.05. The graphical mult iple testing procedure described in Bretz et al. (2011) will be used. The graphical approach i s a cl osed testing procedure, hence it strongly control s the family -wise error rate across all endpo ints (Alosh et al. 2014). Details o f the specific graphical test ing scheme (including testing order, interrelat ionships, typeI error allocat ion, and the associated propagation) will be prespecified in the SAP.

Synopsis … Summary of Study Design: Study I4V-MC-JAIN (JAIN) is a Phase 3, multicenter, doubl e-blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled study evaluating the safet y and efficacy of baricitinib 1 -mg once daily ( QD), 2-mg QD ,and 4 -mg QD co mpared with placebo in patients with moderate -to-severe ADwho are receiving background topical corticosteroid (TCS) treatment and who have experienced failure to cyclosporine or are i ntolerant to, or have a contraindi cation to,cy closporine. The study consists of 54 periods: Period 1: Screening Period (Visit 1), up to 5 weeks prior to randomizat ion Period 2: 52-week Double -Blind Treatment Period: from Week 0 (Baseline; Visit 2) up to Week 52 (Vi sit 14) Period3: 52-week Double -Blind, Long -Term Extensi onPeriod: from Week 52 (Visit14) to Week 104 (Visit 22) d.Randomized Down - Titration Substudy (Week 52) Responders who are e ligible to enter the substudy will be rerandomized as follows: baricit inib 4 -mg treatm ent group 1:1 to baricit inib 2- mg, or baricit inib 4-mg. baricit inib 2 -mg treatm ent group 1:1 to baricit inib 1- mg, or baricit inib 2-mg. e.Responder s who are not eligib le to enter the randomized down titration will continue on the treatment regimen assigned at b aseline; however, rerandomizat ion to either 4 -mg or 2 -mg baricit inib is available for the place bo, bari citinib 2 -mg, and 1 -mg treatment groups if pat ientshave a worsening of symptoms . f.Nonresponders in the placebo, baricit inib 2- mg,or baricit inib 1 -mg treatment groups will be rerando mized at a 1:1 ratio to bari citinib 4 -mg or baricit inib 2 -mg QDatWeek 52. After rerandomization, patients will remain on the same dose of baricit inib for the remainder of the study. Nonresponders who were randomized to bari citinib 4 -mg will remain on 4 -mg. Period 4: Bridging Extensio n: fro m Week 104 (Visit 22) and up to Week 200 (Visit 28). Subjects who have completed Week 104 and have not met criteria o f perm anent discontinuat ion will have the possibilit y to remain in the trial for up to 96 additional weeks (up to W eek 200) . Period 45: Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period: from last treatm ent peri od visi t or early termination visit (ETV) to 4 weeks after the last dose of invest igational product."
109,page_109,"I4V-MC-JAIN(e) Clinical Protocol Page 109 LY3009104Treatment Arms and Duration: At baseline, p atients will be randomized at a 1:1:2:1 ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1-mg QD, baricit inib 2-mg QD, or baricit inib 4- mg QD for up to 104200 weeks. … Statistical Analysis Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and healt h outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion and safet y analyses will be conducted on those patients who receive at least 1 dose of invest igational product. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables will be made using a logistic regressio n analysis with treatment and,baseline disease severit y (vIGA AD) and baseline score in the model. Regi on may be added to the model if pat ient numbers allow. The proportions and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the treatm ent com parisons will be reported. If a patient needs to use rescue m edicati on, the data from that point forward will be considered missing and missing data will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation (NRI) method. Addit ional analyses will be conducted using all observed data regardless of whether rescue medicat ion was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variables will be made using mixed -effects m odels for repeated measures (MMRM) m odel with treatm ent, baseline severit y (vIGA AD),visit, and treatment -by-visit interacti on as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interacti on as fixed continuous effects. Region m ay be added to the m odel if patient numbers allow. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within-patient variance–covariance errors. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LS Ms) will be used for the statist ical com parison and contrasts will be set up within the model to com pare treatm ent groups at specific t ime points of interest."

Assessments of efficacy may be performed beyond Week 104 up to Week 200. The timing of the data lock(s) for the analysis of the efficacy data from the randomized withdrawal sub -study will be determined by the retreatment rates (see Sectio n 10.3.7). … 5.1. Overall Design Study I4V-MC-JAIN (JAIN) is a Phase 3, multicenter, doubl e-blind, rando mized, placebo -controlled study evaluating the safet y and efficacy of baricitinib 1 -mg QD, 2 -mg QD , and 4 -mg QD in co mbinat ion with TCS in pati ents with moderate -to-severe atopic dermat itis (AD) who have experienced failure ofcyclosporine ,or are intol erant to, or have a contraindicat ion to,cyclosporine. The study is divided into 45periods: a 5- week Screening period, a 1 -year Double -Blind Treatme nt period (Week 0 through Week 52), a 1 -year double- blind, l ong-term extensio n (Week 52 through Week 104) that includes a rando mized downti tration substudy , a bri dging extensio n that may last up to 96 weeks (Week 104 to up to Week 200) and a 4 -week Post -Treatment Fo llow-Up period. …"

Scientific Rationale for Study Design … All patients in Study JAIN will be assigned invest igational product with concomitant mild-to moderate -potency TCS until Week 104 (Visit 22) and i nvest igators mayrescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable orworsening s ymptoms of ADwith high -or ultra-high-potency TCS. (See Section 7.7.5 for all rescue options ). Topi cal rescue treatm ents (as outlined in Sect ion7.7.5 ) will be available during Study JAIN to facilitate the management of disease ,as there are instances where patients will remain on the same dose of baricit inib during episodes of worsening. The 16-week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is likely that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h bari citinib wit hin this timef rame based on the Phase 2 study resul ts in AD, and for consistency wit h other studies in AD. This timing will allow adequate duration on a stable dose of baricit inib to assess the benefit/risk profile of the dose regimens. During the l ong-term extensio n (Period3), eligible patients will participate in a downtitration substudy . The object ive of the substudy is to evaluate the possibilit y of maintaining efficacy with a lower dose of baricit inib in pat ients with response (IGA 0 or 1) or partial response (IGA2) to baricit inib 2 -mg QD or 4 -mg QD in combinat ion with TCS.

The Post -Treatmen t Foll ow-Up Peri od (Peri od45) is for safety mo nitoring after the patient has been o ff invest igational product for approximately 28 days. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized in a 1:1:2:1 ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1 -mg QD, 2 -mg QD, or 4 -mg QD to double -blind treatment at Visit 2 (Week 0). Randomization will be stratified by geographic regi on if the planned country allocat ion justifies, and disease severit y at baseline (IGA 3 versus 4 ). Assignment to treatment groups will be determined by a computer -generated random seque nce using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign cartons, each containing 4 blister packs of doubl e-blind investigat ional product tablets to each patient , starting at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at each visit up to and including Visit 2228 (Week 104200) . Site personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct carton by entering a confirmat ion number found on the carton into the IWRS. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Patient com pliance wi th study medicat ion will be assessed at each visit during the treatment period (Vi sit 4through Visit 2228) by counting returned tablets. 7.7.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures Treatment with conco mitant AD therapies du ring the study is permitted only as described below. Daily use of emo llients i s requi red as background treatment up to Week 104. After Week 104, the continued use of emo llients is encouraged. Moisturizers wi th antiprurit icsor antiseptics are not permitted up to Week 104. If daily applicat ions are missed, i t will not be consi dered a protocol violation. Emollients will not be supplied by the sponsor , unless required by local regulations. oPatients shoul d not apply emo llients on the day of their study visit prior to the procedures to allow for adequate assessment of skin dryness. Background TCS therapy (e.g., triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocortisone 2.5% ointment)are to be used on active lesio nsin Periods 2 and 3, as described in Secti on7.7.2 . During Peri ods 2 and 3 , hHigh-or ultra-high-potency TCS are only permitted as rescue therapy as described in Section7.7.5 (Rescue Therapy). During Peri od 4, concomitant use of TCS may be continued, a s directed by the investigat or, as per clinical pract ice. TCIs(e.g., tacrolimus and pimecrolimus), or topical PDE -4 inhibitor (i.e., crisaborole , where approved) are permitted in place of TCS on areas where applicat ion of TCS i s considered inappropriate by the investigator; use should be limited to problem areas (e.g., face, neck, skin fo lds, genital areas, etc.) as described in Secti on7.7.2 . Phototherapy , including therapeut ic phototherapy (psoralen and ultravio letA, ultravioletB, excimer laser), is permitted as rescue t herapy in Period s 2 or 3to 4 (see"

Use of Topical Corticosteroids A washout period of 14 days is required for all TCS prio r to randomization at Visit 2. At baseline (Week 0, Visit 2)and up to Week 104 (Visit 22), patients will receive triamcinolone 0.1% cream (or equivalent -potency TCS) and hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment (or equivalent -potency TCS) … After Week 104, use of TCS may be continued as directed by the investigator, as per clinical practice. Background TCS will no longer be provided nor reimbursed to study participants by the sponsor, unless required by local law. Choice of Background Topical Corticosteroid Where possible, t riamcino lone cream 0.1% and/ or hydrocortisone 2.5% oint ment will be supplied by the sponsor for use as background TCS up to Week 104 (Visit 22). In the event of these specific TCS being unavailable, an alternate, equivalent -potency TCS m ay be p rovided by the sponsor (see below). Topical corticosteroid use, when supplied by the sponsor, should be recorded via weight of dispensed and returned tubes as indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). In the event that the sponsor is unable to supply TCS, commercially available triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment may be supplied by the sites. 7.7.3.

General Statistical Considerations … All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discret e efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit hbaseline disease severit y (vIGA AD), baseline score and treatment group in the model. Region may be added as an addit ional factor if the planned co untry allocation justifies, and stratification has not resulted in empt y strata. This will be finalized in the SAP. If appropriate, t reatment -by-region interacti on may be added to the model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity anal ysis. If this interact ion is significant at a 2 -sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative ( i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direction but not size o f the effect) or qualitat ive (the treatm ent is beneficial for som e but not all regio ns). The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. The p -value fro m the Fisher exact test will also be produced. Addit ional relative measures, for example, odds ratio, may be reported as appropriate. When evaluat ing cont inuous measures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed model for repeated m easures (MMRM) will be used.

Region may be added as an addit ional factor if the planned country allocation justifies. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between- and within -patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward –Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees o f freedo m. TypeIII sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statist ical co mpar ison; 95% CI will also be reported.
