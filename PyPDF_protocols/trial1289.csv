The study will include an initial dose -escalation phase designed to determine the RP2D for idasanutlin when given in combination with c ytarabine and daunorubicin in induction . The dose - escalation phase includ es patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML who have favorable or intermediate risk to maximize accumulated safety data on consolidation by minimizing the number of patients moving to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) instead of systemic consolidation. A post- consolidation phase, run in parallel to the dose -escalation phase, includes idasanutlin treatment naive patients who received induction and chemotherapy consolidation for AML outside the study and had MRD -positive remission after induction. Patients enrolled in the post -consolidation phase will be treated with idasanutlin at a set dose of 150 mg. An expansion phase, to be conducted after completion of the dose -escalation phase, includes two distinct cohor ts of patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML: patients with favorable or intermediate risk and patients with high risk. High risk is defined as patients with adverse risk or secondar y AML (i.e., AML evolving"

Patients enrolled in the expansion phase will be treated with induction therapy consisting of idasanutlin at the RP2D in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin . After completion of induction therapy, patients enrolled in the dose -escalation phase or expansion phase will receive idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine in consolidation, followed by single -agent idasanutlin in maintenance.

Investigational Medicinal Products Test Product (Investigational Drug) Idasanutlin: Patients will self -administer idasanutlin tablets by mouth each day in the morning according to the schedule of activities. On day s when idasa nutlin is given in combination with chemotherapy, idasanutlin should be administered first. During consolidation when idasanutlin is given in combination with cytarabine, idasanutlin should be administered first.

Dose and regimen can be lowered per investigator choice in the second induction cycle Cytarabine will be administered in consolidation at a dose of 1.5 g /m2once a day ( QD)for 5days as an IV infusion over a minimum of 3 hours, immediately after corresponding dose of idasanutlin. The dose of cytarabine should be calculated based on a body weight measuremen t within 2days of the first day of each cy cle. Daunorubicin: Daunorubicin will be administered in induction at a dose of 60mg/m2QD for 3days as IV infusion, immediately after the corresponding dose of idasanutlin. Dose and regimen can be lowered per investigator choice in the second induction cycle. The dose of daunorubicin should be calculated based on a body weight measurement within 2days of the first day of each cy cle. Statistical Methods Primary A nalysis The primary efficacy analy sis will be t he estimation of the proportion of patients with a CR at the end of induction treatment. Determination of Sample Size Dose finding will be conducted during the dose -escalation phase of this study. The estimated sample size follows from the dose -escalati on rules for a modified continuous reassessment method (m CRM) algorithm. It is anticipated that enrollment of up to five cohorts of 3 6patients each, for a total of 9 15 evaluable patients, will be required to establish the RP2D during the dose -escalation phase. Assuming 5 not -evaluable patients ;the expected maximum sample size will be approximately 20 patients. Approximately 40 patients (20 favorable/i ntermediate riskpatients and 20 h igh-risk patients in two separate cohorts) w ill be enrolled during the expansion phase. A sample size of 20 patients in the high-risk cohort is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision for the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90 % CItorule out a clinically uninteresting probability of response of 50% with an observed CR proportion of 70%. Depending on the proportions of patients with adverse risk or secondary AML enrolled, a CR proportion up to 50%55% is expected for high-risk patients under current 7 3 standard of care ."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON FRONT -LINE ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMI A Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy arising from hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow and is characterized by accumulation of blasts that fail to mature and differentiate. It is the most common form of ac ute leukemia in adults, with a median age of 67 years atdiagnosis ( Howlader et al. 2014 ). The yearly incidence of AML in European adults is 5 8cases per 100,000 individuals , with a steep increase in the population aged over 70 years ,where the incidenc e reaches 15–25 cases per 100,000 individuals per annum ( Fey and Buske 2013 ). Approximately 20,000 patients were diagnosed with AML with greater than 10,000 AML patient deaths in the United States during 2015 ( Siegel et al. 2015 ). Specific genetic markers have been shown to correlate with prognosis (Döhner et al. 2017 ) and therefore are the basis of risk classification in AML ,which drives the treatment strategy ( see Appendix 7). Development of targeted t herapies in the past 2years led to recent approvals (FLT3 inhibitors, IDH inhibitors ) (Döhner etal. 2017 ) but only for a subset of patients ,and for the majority of patients the treatment shave not change din decades. Patients fit for intensive chemo therapy receive up to 2cycles of induction followed by a consolidation phase with cytarabine- based regimen or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT ); unfit patien ts receive a low -intensity regimen given in consecutive cycles . Amajor field of research has included a maintenance phase, but no conclusive data have yet shown clinical benefi t. Intensive treatment of de novo AML in adults using standard cytarabine -and anthracycline based chemotherapy induction regimens achieves complete remission (CR) proportions ranging from 50% to 80% ( Estey 2001 ;Appelbaum et al. 2006 ). Nonetheless, 60%70% of patients under the age of 60 years who achieve a CR will relapse, an d only less than 20% of elderly patients are long -term survivors (Burnett etal.2011 ). Secondary AML (s -AML) includes patients with a history of an antecedent hematologic disorder (AHD) , such as myelodysplas ticsyndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasms , whose disease hasprogressed to AML. s- AML accounts for 10% 20% of AML and is associated with poor outcomes (Granfeldt Østgård et al. 2015; Hulegardh et al 2015; Zeichner and Arellano 2015). Survival after relapse in patients with AML is poor, especially in elderly patients. Although some patients with AML benefit from chemotherapy -based regimens, these therapies are rarely curative . There continues to be an unmet need for novel treatments that can significantly extend overall survival ( OS). The use of therapies that specifically target signaling pathways known to be dysregulated or aberrant in AML may improve outcomes in AML ."
23,page_23,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 23/Protocol GO40800 , Version 11.2 BACKGROUND ON IDASANUTLIN Idasanutlin is a potent, selective ,and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of MDM2. In cell -free assays, idasanutlin has been shown to bind to the MDM2 protein with high affinity and to inhibit MDM2 p53 binding. Exposure of tumor cells, including lymphoma cells ,to the compound leads to a dose -dependent accumulation of p53 protein and activation of its transcriptional targets and the p53 pathway. As a result, cancer cells undergo a cell -cycle block during G1 and G2 phases followed by apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (see Figure 1) (Ding et al. 2013). See the Idasanutlin Investigator's Brochure for additional details on nonclinical and clinical studies.

The most common adverse events across the study groups were from thegastrointestinal (GI) disorders system organ class ; in particular, patients experienced diarrhea and nausea, and to a lesser extent, vomiting. These events were also the most common adverse events considered by investigators to be related to study treatment. Serious adverse events occurred in 71 of 122 patients during the study; the most common were infectious and hematologic events. Infectious adverse events were more common for patients with AML compared with patients with solid tumors (S tudies NP27872 and NP28902). The most frequent serious adverse events that were considered by investigators to be related to study treatment (febrile neutropenia and sepsis ) occurred in 25 of the 71 patients. Although the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD)wasnot reached in a formal manner for the 56 patients with AML during dose escalation, the clinical experience for patients treated at 800 mg twice a day (BID)was evaluated by investigators as not tolerable for those patients, primarily due to GI adverse ev ents (mainly diarrhea) and bone marrow failure ( a dose -limiting toxicit y [DLT]), and the 600 mg BID dose was therefore selected as the recommended Phase II dose ( RP2D ). In a Phase Ib/II study (GH29914) in elderly unfit patients with R/R AML, 34patients had received combination therapy with venetoclax (daily dosing) and idasanutlin (Days 15) as of cutoff date of 6April 2018 . As of this date , the most frequent adverse events in the venetoclax plus idasanutlin arm were GI toxicities (diarrhea, nausea , and vomiting) and hematologic toxicities (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia). The most frequent Grade 3adverse events in the venetoclax plus idasanutlin arm were febrile neutropenia , neutropenia, thrombocytopenia ,andanemia. The Phase III study WO2951 9 in patients with R/R AML fit for intensive chemotherapy is designed to compare 300 mg idasanutlin (adjusted for formulation differences) BID plus 1g/m2cytarabine with placebo plus 1 g/m2cytarabine. This study is currently ongoing. For further details on clinical studies, please refer to the Idasanutlin Investigator’s Brochure . 1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT RISK A SSESSMENT Patients newly diagnosed with AML and treated with standard induction chemotherapy (such as cytarabine on Days 1 7plus daunorubicin on Days 1 3 [73regimen] ) will achieve a CRrate of 50%80%,depending on their risk classification. Nevertheless ,a"
25,page_25,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 25/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1vast majority of patients will relapse within months and OSin patients with AML remain s poor ( Döhner et al. 2017 ). Improvement of the CR rate at end of induction and sustainability of the response through consolidation to achieve deeper and more durable remissions remains a high unmet need. Furthermore, therole of maintenance treatment to prevent relapse remains to be assessed . This study will combine idasanutlin with cytarabine and daunorubicin in induction andidasanutlin with cytarabine in consolidation followed by single- agent idasanutlin asmaintenance. One additional cohort will investigate the benefit of singl e-agent idasanutlin as maintenance therapy in idasanutlin treatment naive patients who were minimal residual disease ( MRD )positive at end of induction. Those patient sare known to have a higher rate of relapse (Jongen -Lavrencic et al. 2018) . Cytarabine and daunorubicin are both myelosuppressive and, as such ,havean overlapping toxicity profile with idasanutlin. In the AML population ,this combination appears nevertheless desirable because the additive effect might lead to increased clearance ofblast sand deeper responses for the combination treatment . Comorbidities and characteristics such as older age, frailty, and presence of prolonged cytopenias prior to study initiation are common among patients with AML . The induction and consolidation treatment proposed in this study is anticipated to lead to cytopenias , rendering patients susceptible to infections. To reduce the risk to patients enrolled, this study will rely on stringent enrollment criteria for performance status, diligent clinical observation, and management (for detailed information on toxicity management guidelines, please refer to Appendix 5), and pharmacovigilance. Doses for 7 3 chemotherapy in induction and cytarabine in consolidation have been chosen in accordance to standard clinical practices and aim to minimize combination toxicities. A maintenance phase will be investigate d in this study in both idasanutlin predosed patients and idasanutlin treatment naive patients with the goal to decrease relapse rate following consolidation hence improving OSin all comers (regardless of cytogenetic risk). Idasanutlin will be given as single agent every month for a year . 2.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 3.1.1 Overview of Study This Phase Ib/II, open -label, multicenter, non -randomized study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin when given in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin in induction, in combination with cytarabine in consolidation ,and as a single agent in maintenance . The study will include an initial dose -escalation phase designed to determine the RP2D for idasanutlin when given in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin in induction . The dose -escalation phase includes patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML who have favorable or intermediate risk(see Appendix 8)to maximize accumulated safety data on consolidation by minimizing the number of patients moving to allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo -HSCT )instead of systemic consolidation. A post-consolidation phase, run in parallel to the dose- escalation phase, includes idasanutlin treatment naive patients who received induction and chemotherapy consolidation for AML outside the study and had MRD -positive remission after induction . Patients enrolled in the post -consolidation phase will be treated with idasanutlin at a set dose of 15 0 mg (see Figure 2). An expansion phase, to be conducted after completion of the dose -escalation phase, include s two distinct cohorts of patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated AML: patients with favorable or intermediate risk and patients with high risk (see Figure 2).High risk is defined as patients with adverse risk orsecondary AML (i.e., AML evolving fr om AHD). Patients enrolled in the expansion phase will be treated with induction therapy consisting of idasanutlin at the RP2D in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin . After completion of induction therapy,"

New experimental arms may be added during the study by amending the protocol. 3.1.2 Dose -Escalation Phase All patients in the dose -escalation phase will undergo the treatment sequence of induction, consolidation, and maintenance (see Figure 3). The purpose of the dose - escalation phase is to identify the RP2D for idasanutlin when combined with fixed doses of cytarabin e and daunorubicin in induction .The dose- escalation phase willalso allow identifying the idasanutlin dose to be used in consolidation based on all available safety data. The consolidation dose will match the induction dose un lessprevented by unacceptable toxicitie s.As a result, there could be two different idasa nutlin doses in induction and consolidation.

A minimum of 9 patients and a maximum of approximately 15evaluable patients will be enrolled during the dose -escalation phase. Cohorts of 3 6 patients each will be treated at escalating doses of idasanutlin (starting at 200 mg) in accordance with the treatment regimens and dose- escalation rules described in Section 3.1.2.2 . A Bayesian modified continual reassessment method (mCRM )(see Section 3.1.2.3 ) is planned to guide the dose -escalation phase to determine the MTD that achieves the efficacious exposure observed. The principle underlying this trial design is the asses sment of the dose toxicity relationship in a safe and efficient manner, allowing for enrollment of patients at subsequent dose levels and/or defining the MTD with robust data."
32,page_32,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 32/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Patients will be closely monitored for adverse events during the DLT assessment window, defined as the first induction cycle . Adverse events meeting the criteria for DLT, as defined in Section 3.1.2.1 , will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours (see Section 5.3.1 ). Patients experiencing a DLT during the DLT window (first induction cycle) may continue treatme nt after consultation with the Medical M onitor based on safety, tolerability , and clinical benefit . Patients who discontinue from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window for reasons other th an a DLT will be considered non- evaluable for dose -escalation decisions and MTD assessments and will be replaced by an additional patient at that same dose level. Patients who miss more than one dose of idasanutlin, cytarabine ,or daunorubicin during the DLT assessment window for reasons other than a DLT will also be considered non -evaluable an d will be replaced. Additional cohorts may be added following the Sponsor’s decision to explore idasanutlin’s therapeutic advantage (e.g., change of regimen ). The decision for opening such cohorts will be based on available safety and tolerability data. 3.1.2.1 Definition of DLT In this study, a DLT is defined as at least oneof the following events occurring during the first induction cycle of treatment and assessed by the investigator as clearly not attributable to the patient’s underlying disease or concurrent medications : Any Grade 5 adverse event unless unequivocally due to the underlying malignancy or extraneous causes Any clinically significant, non -hematologic adverse event Grade 3 unless clearly unrelated to the treatment (except GI toxicity, fatigue, anorexia, and alopecia) GI toxicity: nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea if Grade 3 severity despite adequate supportive care measures ( 72hours of treatment, requiring tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition, or requiring or prolonging hospitalization) whichis attributable to study treatment Grade 3 AST or ALT toxicity lasting for 7 days, or Grade 4 lasting for any duration of time not attribu table to disease progression Prolonged myelosuppression : hypocellular ( 5% cellularity) bone marrow without evidence of leukemia, lasting 28 days from first ob servation (i.e., the first post-treatment bone marrow examination showing 5% cellularity or aplasia [Kantarjian et al. 2007] ) Other toxicities that are considered clinically relevant and related to study treatment as determined by the investigator and the Medical Monitor may also be considered DLTs. 3.1.2.2 Treatment Regimens and Dose -Escalation Rules During this first dose -escalation phase, patients will be enrolled as described below."
33,page_33,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 33/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Three patients will initially be enrolled in each dose cohort, and up to an additional 3patients can be enrolled in a cohort at the Sponsor’s discretion. A minimum of 3patients enrolled in a cohort must complete at least the first induction cycle (i.e., the DLT assessment window) before enrollment commence s in the next cohort(s). Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted with the exception of the maintenance dose , which can be increased to 200 mg on the basis of safety, tolerability and clinical benefit and after consultation with the Medical M onitor (see Table 1).

If safety and tolerability in the first cycle allow (the DLT assessment window) ,the next cohort will be enrolled. Patients in this cohort will receive an escalated dose of idasanutlin (see Table 2). During the dose- escalation phase, study treatment will be administered as outlined in Table 1.Patients who achieve remission ( CR, CRi, CRp, or CRh) after up to 2induction cycles will receive chemotherapy consolidation treatment up to 4cycles or allo-HSCT consolidation at the investigator 'sdiscretion . Patients who achieved a confirmed remission attheend of chemotherapy consolidation or allo-HSCT or who underwent allo-HSCT in MLFS after induction (see definition of MLFS in Appendix 19) will receive maintenance treatment for 12 cycles (see Table 1). In cases where the patient receives allo-HSCT consolidation, m aintenance should start within 90days o f the transplant and a full pre -transplant hematologic response assessment must be provided if the transplant is performed more than 4 weeks after end of induction .Patients receiving chemotherapy consolidation should start maintenance right after completion of the consolidation. On the basis of safety, tolerability ,and clinical benef itand after consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients may be allowed to continue maintenance at the same dose beyond 12 cycles. Allpatients will be followed for disease progression and survival.

The dose for consolidation will not exceed the dose the patient received during induction. After the last patient in each cohort has completed the DLT assessment window (first induction cycle) , the Sponsor will evaluate the next dose recommended according to the mCRM (see Section 3.1.2.3) and determine doses for the subsequent cohort(s), taking into account relevant demographic, adverse event, laboratory, dose administration, and PK (if available) data.

The design is based on the primary safety variable, that is, the occurrence of a DLT. The MTD is defined as the dose that maximizes the probability of a DLT being in the targeted toxicity interval of 25% 35%, subject to the probability of theDLT being in the"
35,page_35,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 35/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1excessive toxicity interval of 35% 100% being 35%. Simulations of the designs under various scenarios of true toxicity are presented in Appendix 18. Patients within a phase will be enrolled in cohorts of at least 3 patients each, which, if required, can be expanded with additional pat ients. Each patient will be observed over 1cycle of treatment for DLT assessment. After the last patient in each cohort has completed the first cycle of the observation period, the next dose recommended by the mCRM design will be evaluated and that anal ysis will support the dose decision for the subsequent cohort. At each dose- escalation step, the dose can be escalated, the dose can be de-escalated, or an additional cohort at the same dose level can be enrolled . The idasanutlin starting dose will be 200 mg QD onDays15 ,and maximum allowable increments for the highest dose already tested will not exceed 150 mg, with a minimum increment of 50 mg. In addition, t he dose of idasanutlin will not be escalated above 800mgQD.The selection of the next dose will be subject to clinical judg ment and mandated safety constraints that limit the size of the dose increments. Clinical judgment will always override m CRM recommendations in the dose -selection process. Dose escalation will stop when the maximum allowe d sample size, approximatively 15evaluable patients, has been reached or if there is enough confidence in the prediction of the MTD (e.g., at least 6 patients have been recruited at the MTD dose and there is a 40% probability of having a DLT rate of 25 %35%).

In order to define the prior distributions (priors) for the parameters of the model, the Sponsor's clinical team completed Bayesian prior elicitation to reach a consensus on the following questions , based on expert knowledge and previous idasanutlin data (e.g. , Studies NP27872 and BH29812) : What is the (low) probability that the DLT rate for the lowest -tested dose (200 mg) is above a threshold of 30%? What is the (low) probability that the DLT rate for the highest potentially tested dose (800 mg) is below a threshold of 30%? These probabilities reflecting the prior knowledge of dose toxicity were chosen by the team to be 40% and 25%, respectively , forthe first a nd second questions . Of note, a lower or a higher probability would reflect respectively more or less prior knowledge that is borrowed by the model ."
36,page_36,"Idasanutlin —F.

If 3 patients are given the starting dose of 200 mg and none develop a DLT, then the nex t mCRM dose recommendation is 350 mg. Afterward the mCRM recommendations are 450 and 600 mg if the next cohorts of 3 patients also have no DLT observed each time. If DLTs are observed, the next recommended dose is (almost) equal to or lower than the current dose. Specifically, if the first cohort isat 200 mg QD with 3 patients when one DLT is observed, then the dose recommended for the second cohort is again 200 mg QD. If the first DLTs are observed in the second cohort of 3 patients at 300 mg QD and none in the first cohort of 200 mg QD, the dose for the third cohort is recommended as 300 mg QD. When twoor three DLTs are observed in a cohort, a dose de -escalation is always recommended by the model (even if no DLTs were observed in previous cohorts). A summary of dose recommendations among same principle is provided in Table 2.Of note,these recommendations are subject to the constraint that the dose increase in the subsequent cohort cannot exceed a 50% increment of the previous cohort dose ."

The expansion phase is designed to further assess the safety and efficacy of idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin at its RP2D in induction and in combination with cytarabine in consolidation followed by a single-agent maintenance. The expansion phase (approximately 40 patients) is composed of two cohorts: 20 patients with favorable or intermediate risk and 20 patients with high risk (see Table 3 ). All expansion patients will be enrolled and treated as described in Table 4, and patients in the post-consolidation cohort will receive maintenance treatment as described in Table 5."

Patients will be followed up to 2years after last p atient is enrolled or all patients have died, whichever occurs first. The total length of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is expected to be approximately 6years. 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for Idasanutli n Dose and Schedule Idasanutlin dosing for this study isbased on experience in both single- agent testing (Studies NP27872 and NP28902) in solid tumors and from the combination with 1 g/m2 cytarabine in Study NP28679 in patients with both R/Rand elderly front -line AML. The lowest dose where responses were seen in AML was 200 mg adjusted for formulation differences in combination with cytarabine 1 g/m2,and as this dose has been proven safe and allowed for escalation (see the I dasanutlin I nvestigator’s Brochure) , it has been chosen a s the starting dose for idasanutlin . A lower dose of 150 mg has been chosen in maintenance to minimize side effects as patients in remission would not require aggressive treatment. This dose is below the MTD in s olid tumor ( see the Idasanutlin Investigator’s Brochure) where patient shave functional bone marrow and is used in polycythemia vera studies over multiple cycle s (see the Idasanutlin Investigator’s Brochure) . The QD5-day schedule was proven safe and efficacious in the Phase I AML study NP28679 and is investigated in the ongoing registrational R/R AML study (WO29519) . Therefore ,it was chosen also for the front -lineregimen . 3.3.2 Rationale for Study Population The dose -escalation phase includ es patients with favorable or intermediate risk to maximize accumulated safety data on consolidation by minimizing the number of patients moving to HSCT instead of systemic consolidation. The expansion phase of the study is separated in to two cohor ts, patients with favorable or intermediate and patients with high r isk, on the basis of their significantly different relapse rate s toallow a proper assessment of the benefit within all cytogenetic categories based on a defined sample size. The post -cons olidation cohort will e nroll patients in remisssion who received chemotherapy consolidation for whom no transplant is for eseen, but only those who have been identified as MRD positive at the end of induction ,andwho have not been previously treated wi th idasanutlin. MRD -positive patients are known to have a higher"
41,page_41,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 41/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1riskof relapse and are in greater medical need than patient swith MRD -negative status (Jongen- Lavrencic et al. 2018) .This cohort will assess the safety and benef it of maintenance regardless of previous treatment in idasanutlin nai ve patients .Additional cohorts might be opened to test mai ntenance in a post -HSCT setting or to explore combinations with other drugs, after amendment of the protocol. 3.3.3 Rational e for Population PK /Pharmac odynamic A nalysis Minimal blood sampling is required for conducting population pharmacokinetics analyses to characterize the pharmacokinetics of idasanutlin ,cytarabine, and daunorubicin in plasma in the patient population. The population and individual P K parameters will be estimated and the influence of covariates (such as age s, sex, body weight, ethnicity, and disease status ,including organ impairments) on these parameters will be investigated in order to determine any subpopulations with higher -or lower-than-expected exposure. With these PK exposure data, the exposure response relationship of idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin on efficacy measures, such as clinical response and OS, as well as the relationship between the exp osure of idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine and daunorubicin and the occurr ence of serious adverse events  such as GI disorders, pancytopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia (i.e., acute versus delayed) if relevant, will be explored. The impact of potential influential covariates will be investigated. Covariates thatindicate whether subpopulations may be at increased risk will be investigated. 3.3.4 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments MDM2 is overexpresse d in approximately 50% of AML ( Fenaux et al.1992 ; Hu et al. 1992 ; Wattel et al. 1994 ). This is believed to result in decreased levels of the tumor suppressor p53. Idasanutlin inhibits the interaction of MDM2 with p53, leading to accumulation and activat ion of p53and thus inhibition of cancer cell growth and induction of apoptosis. P53 function can also be lost through mutations. However, mutations occur along the entire sequence of the gene and may not always be detrimental to p53 activity . The p53 mutations status , as well as that of other mutations associated with AML biology and amenable to therapy is therefore important . Activated p53 induces or inhibits the expression of multiple genes, some of which are secreted (e.g.,Mic-1) and may be useful a s pharmacodynamic indicators of clinical activity of idasanutlin. Additional biomarkers related to the mechanism of action of idasanutlin ( p53 and MDM2 activity ) and disease biology may be evaluated as appropriate. Exploratory research on safety biomarkers may be conducted to support future drug development. Research may include further characterization of a safety biomarker or identification of safety biomarkers that are associated with susceptibility to developing"
42,page_42,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 42/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1adverse events or can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation . Adverse event reports will not be derived from safety biomarker data by the Sponsor, and safety biomarker data will not be included in the formal safety analyses for this s tudy. In addition, safety biomarker data will not inform decisions on patient management. 3.3.4.1 AML -Associated Mutations , MDM2Protein Expression, MIC-1 Secretion and Gene Expression The mutation status of TP53as well as mutations of other genes with clinical relevance or prognostic value including FLT-3, IDH1 andIDH2 will be assessed by a sequencing panel. MDM2 expression inAML cells in pretreatment blood specimens in patient s with AML will be assessed by multi -color flow cytometry. Mic-1secretion will be analy zed by ELISA. Various gene expression signatures have been explored for their predictive value for MDM2 inhibitors. In this study, gene expression profiling is planned to clinically validate and explore additional signatures. 3.3.4.2 MRD Assessment MRD responses are associated with improved outcomes , whereas patients who have MRD after induction and consolidation have a poor prognostic outcome (Jongen- Lavrencic et al. 2018). MRD will be assessed as a secondary endpoint. Patients achieving remission will undergo additional serial MRD assessments at subsequent scheduled hematologic malignancy assessments (Appendix 1). These MRD assessments will serve as an exploratory monitoring tool to investigate the depth of response and afford early detection of impending relapse (before cytomorphologic relapse occurs) after idasanutlin therapy. In patients achieving remission , MRD monitoring from bone mar row aspirates will be prioritized over analysis of other exploratory markers . MRD assessments can be made with the use of several technologies (e.g., by flow cytometry for abnormal cell phenotypes or leukemia -associated immune phenotype, by next-generation sequencing ( NGS) of leukemia -associated mutations ,orby polymerase chain reaction [PCR] technologies to detect AML- speci fic translocations or mutations) . Recent reports suggest MRD in AML can also be assessed in cell -free DNA in plasma (Assi et al. 2018) and blood will be collected for this purpose. MRD in this study will be primarily analy zed by flow cytometry. Other methods may be employed for orthogonal validation and exploration of the correlation of MRD detected in cell-free DNA with that in bone marrow aspirates. 3.3.5 Rationale for Patient -Reported Outcomes Symptom presentation in AML is variable with patients frequently presenting with fatigue and loss of appetite at the time of diagnosis. Fatigue is the most common and severe"
43,page_43,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1symptom reported by patients ,as well as the most persistent over time (M øller et al. 2012), and is associated with decrements in health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and functioning (Schumacher et al. 2002; Messerer et al. 2008 ). In addition to disease- related symptoms , cancer treatments, particularly combination therapies, can produce significant treatment -related symptoms and impacts . Patients with AML in particular experience substantial HRQoL burden during treatment, experiencing the greatest decrements shortly after starting induction and rebounding thereafter (Redaelli et al. 2004; Korol et al. 2017 ).Research has shown that clinicians may underreport the incidence and severity of symptoms patients experience during treatment (Fromme e t al. 2004; Trotti et al. 2007; Pakhomov et al. 2008; Basch et al. 2009; Basch 2010; Quinten et al. 2011; Atkinson et al. 2012). Collecting information about these symptoms directly from patients can provide a better understanding of treatment characteristics and their effects. In order to measure bas eline symptoms and characterize symptomatic treatment toxicities from the patient perspective, patients will be asked to report on their experience of relevant treatment -related symptoms selected from the validated PRO -CTCAE item bank. On the basis of preliminary safety data, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea symptoms were identified as being salient to patients ' experience of treatment with idasanutlin. In this study, important disease -and treatment -related s ymptoms, as well as functioning will be assessed with the FACIT -Fatigue, EORTC QLQ -C30, and EORTC Item Library (selected symptoms ), and PRO -CTCAE. TheEQ-5D-5Lwill be administered for the purpose of producing health utility scores for economic modeling. 4.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 52/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1MDM2 antagonists were shown in vitro to affect all types of hematopoietic progenitors, including megakaryocytic differentiation. They inhibit both early and late stages of megakaryopoiesis, including ploidization and proplatelet formation (Mahfoudhi et al. 2016). As a consequence, the effect on early progenitors might induce long -lasting thrombocytopenia in vivo. Therefore, because of the potential severity and duration of thrombocytopenia induced by study treatment, patients in clinical need ofchronic treatment with oral or parenteral anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents (e.g., warfarin, chronic da ily treatment with aspirin [325mg/day], clopidogrel, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and systemic low-molecular weight heparin ), or subcutaneous anticoagulant prophylaxis) are excluded from this study. For patients considered eligible for the study because they are able to tolerate interruption of anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment, these agents must be discontinued 7 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter) prior to initiating study treatment (except used as flushes for indwelling catheters ). After the study treatment completion or discontinuation visit, treatment with anticoagulant/antiplatelet agents may be re -initiated for patients with transfusion -independent adequate platelet levels as clinically indicated.

Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment . The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or reco rd reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Those patients who fail screening because of long waiting times for results or study technical reasons (such as , ""cohort on hold "") can be rescreened once at a later date if deemed eligible before the screen failure. The decision to rescreen individual patients will be made jointly by the Medical Monitor and the investigator and any other person the investigator or Medical Monitor considers necessary to assist with this decision. Any such decision and the r easons for it will be clearly documented. Any out -of-window assessments need to be repeated and undergo a complete review by the Medical Monitor. Patients deemed ineligible based on screening results for the following exclusion criterion will be allowed to be re- screened once: Infection considered by the investigator to be clinically uncontrolled or of unacceptable risk to the patient upon the induction of neutropenia, that is, patients who are or should be on antimicrobial agents for the treatment of act ive infection Screening and pretreatment assessments will be performed within 14 days prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 unless otherwise specified. However, results of screening tests or examinations performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consen t and within the protocol -defined window (prior to randomization/ Cycle 1 , Day 1) may be used rather than repeating required tests. If a bone marrow aspirate cannot be obtained or is not evaluable, a bone marrow biopsy must be performed for AML diagnostic purposes. If biopsy is performed at screening, a bone marrow sample should be provided for biomarker analysis."

At a minimum cytogenetic information allowing stratification into the two risk categories (favorable/intermediate versus adverse ) needs to be available. Additional information on molecular markers is desirable and should be entered into the eCRF. 4.5.2 Medical History , Concomitant Medication, and Demographic Data Medical history, inc luding clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, will be recorded at baseline. In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 28days prior to initiation of study treatment will be recorded. At the time of each follow -up physical examinat ion, an interval medical history should be obtained and any changes in medications and allergies should be recorded. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity. For patients enrolled in the post -consolidation cohort, all details with regards to their previous AML history and treatment will be collected including but not limited to dates, medications, regimens, and responses 4.5.3 Physical Examinations A complete physical examination should be performed at screening and should in clude an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic , musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurologic systems. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), targeted (limited, symptom -directed) physical examinations should be performed. Targeted physical examinations should be limited to systems of primary relevance (e.g. , cardiovascular and respiratory systems), systems associated with symptoms (newly emergent or monitored from baseline. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. In cases that physical examinations reveal visible manifestations of l eukemia or of toxicities (skin involvement , rashes, etc .),additional assessments and measures (such as pictures andmeasurements) could be undertaken upon additional patient consent ."

W eight will be recorded at screening and as indicated in Appendix 1. Height will be recorded only at screening. 4.5.6 Tumor and Response Evaluations Hematologic malignancy response will be assessed according to ELN and additio nal response criteria for AML (see Appendix 19 ). Hematologic malignancy response assessments ( HMRAs)require sampling of blood and bone marrow on the same day as indicated (a window of 4days is acceptable between the blood and bone marrow sampling ). Bone marrow aspirates are required, but if bone marrow biopsies are performed, the biopsy results should be provided along with the aspirate . Depending on the timepoint in the schedule of activities, the HMRA is established on the basis of blood counts only, or includes the assessment of bone marrow. Patients will be considered to be in their best response state until definitive evidence of relapse is available from blood counts, bone marrow aspirate, or bone marrow biopsy. In the event that a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy is equivocal (i.e., a recovering marrow), the bone marrow assessment and complete blood count should be repeated 7 days later. In case disease progression/relapse is determined solely by symptomatic deteriora tion or by a hematology assessment, a bone marrow aspirate should be performed at that time to complete HMRA. If a patient progresses or relapses outside of the scheduled visit, an unscheduled HMRA must be provided. If a bone marrow aspirate is performed at any unscheduled timepoint during the study, an unscheduled HMRA must be provided. Please note that at the time of bone marrow sampling for HMRA ,the bone marrow sample collected (aspirate) should also allow for further analyses ( e.g., MRD by flow cytom etry, MRD by NGS ) and the amount taken should be taken into consideration. During the treatment period, HMRAs are to be performed and reviewed before the start of a new treatment cycle. In the event that a patient has a dosing delay 7 days in consolid ation or induction , weekly blood counts must be performed for HMRA to"

Treatment failure and relapse will lead to discontinuation of the study medication and patients will enter follow -up(see Appendix 1). During the follow -up of patients who remain in remission after treatment, blood will be required every month and a bone marrow aspirate will be required every 6months to allow for HMRA until relapse. Refer to Appendix 1for further details. 4.5.7 Laboratory Assessments Normal ranges for the study laboratory parameters must be sub mitted to the Sponsor beforethe study starts. Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site’s laboratory for analysis. Hematology : WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, plat elet count, differential count ( neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, blasts, promyelocy tes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes) A manual differential (including W BC) may be needed if an automated differential does not provide blasts. Each differential should add up to 100% (or as close as possible). Biochemistry : procalcitonin, glucose, urea or BUN, serum cr eatinine, creatinine clearance ( at screening only determ ined by Cockcroft -Gault Formula) , AST, ALT, LDH, ALP, total bilirubin (and direct bilirubin where total bilirubin ULN ), total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, and uric acid) Urinalysis using standard dipstick assessment (pH, protein, glucose, blood, ketones, and leukocytes) This must be supplemented with laboratory quantification of any potentially relevant abnormalities as deemed necessary by the investigator. C.difficile infection at screening Viral serology Hepatitis B testing includes hepatitis B surface antigen and total hepatitis B core antibody.

Unscheduled PK samples matched to ECG recordings may be required in case any prolongation of the QTc interval or other adverse cardiac findings is identified (see Section 4.5.9 for details). For PK analysis, it is of utmost importance to record dosing and blood sampling times accurately. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment ins tructions see the laboratory manual(s). 4.5.8.1 MRD Assessments for Patients in the Post -Consolidation Phase Patients in the post-consolidation phase with an MRD -positive remission afterinduction will be enrolled after local MRD assessment with a validated quantitative AML specific method .In order to monitor MRD during maintenance, assessment s will be performed at 3monthly intervals (see Appendix 1). 4.5.8.2 Pharmacokinetic Analyses PK blood samples will be collected in all patients according to the sample schedule outlined in Appendix 2. All PK samples will be collected from the arm (limb) thatis not being used during the administration of IV drugs (i.e., from the alternate arm). If IV drugs areadministered via a central line, PK samples may be collected via the same access after completely flushing the line. In case a patient experiences an adverse event without plausible clinical explanation, the investigator may perform an additional blood draw for unscheduled PK analys is. Care should be taken to accurately record timing of blood sampling on the unscheduled PK sampling page of the eCRF. All PK blood samples may be destroyed when the analysis is complete and the Bioanalytical Report finalized. Residual PK samples may b e used for additional validation experiments as appropriate."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 58/Protocol GO40800 , Version 14.5.8.3 Pharmacody namic and Exploratory Biomarkers Bone marrow and blood samples will be collected from patients for pharmacodynamic and exploratory biomarkers. These samples will be tested for protein, nucleic acid, or other tumor cell derived biomarkers relating to the proposed mechanism of action of idasanutlin , disease -associated markers ,or improvement of diagnostic assays . Analysis to include, but are not limited to: Sequencing of cancer -related g enes including TP53 Measurement of transcript gene expression Protein expression intumor cells by flow cytometry MRD in bone marrow MRD will be monitored along clinical response assessments during induction, consolidation and maintena nce. MRD will be assessed primarily byflow cytometry . Subsequent confirmation may use NGS panel following AML-specific mutations . This r esearch involves extraction of DNA, or RNA, analysis of mutations and genomic profiling through use of NGS fora comprehensive panel of genes. Research will not be aimed at distinguishing germline mutations from somatic mutations. The specimens will also be used for research purposes to identify biomarkers useful for predicting and monitoring response to idasanutlin treatment , identifying biomarkers useful for predicting and monitoring safety, assessing pharmacodynamic effects of idasanutlin treatment, evaluating potential combination partners ,and investigating mechanism of therapy resistance. Additional markers may be measu red in case a strong scientific rationale for these analyses develops. On the basis continuous analysis of biomarker data any analysis, timepoint, or sample type not considered to be critical for safety may be stopped at any time if the data donot suppor t a strong scientific justification to continue. Some samples that are collected may not be analyzed. Furthermore, some analysis may depend on patient’s molecular status or response to treatment. Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for optional exploratory research ( Research Biosample Repository ; see Section 4.5.11), biologic samples will be destroyed when the final Clinical Study Report has been completed, with the following excepti ons: Samples collected for biomarker research will be destroyed no late r than 5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed For enrolled patients, remaining archival tissue blocks will be returned to the site upon request or no later than the time offinal closure of the study database, whichever occurs fir st.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 59/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples. However, if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data. Data arising from sample analysis, including data on germline mutations, will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4. Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless requi red by law. The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication. 4.5.8.4 Clinical Genoty ping DNA will be analyzed from whole blood for polymorphisms which may predict potential DDI and altered metabolism (such as CYP genes) of idasanutlin. If the sample is missed on Day 1, it can be collected at any other scheduled visit. This specimen will be de stroyed after analysis. Data arising from clinical genotyping samples will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4. 4.5.8.5 Bone Marrow Bone marrow (i.e., aspirate and, if sampled, bone marrow biopsy for the analysis of biomarkers) will be collected at screening. Bone marrow aspirate will be collected each time that bone marrow is required for HMRAs (see Appendix 1). If an unscheduled bone marrow aspirate is being collected to assess disease state, then additional bone marrow aspirate should be collected for flow and biomarker analyses . Procedures are described in detail in the laboratory manual(s). Bone marrow for MRD flow cytometry (heparin) : Analysis will include determination of abnormal cell phenotypes by flow cytometry. After screening, the bone marrow for MRD flow cytometry is the priority sample . Bone marrow sample for DNA (in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [ EDTA]) : This is the priority bone marrow sample at screening . Mutation profiling ,including TP53 and gene mutations, rearrangements, and fusions are commonly seen in patients with AML . The EDTA bone marrow will potentially be used for MRD monitoring by sequencing Bone marrow (PAXgene): Analysis willinclude, but will not be limited to, gene expression analysis .

However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC )-approved Inf ormed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements) . 4.5.9 Electrocardiograms Resting 12- lead ECG recordings will be obtained in triplicate at specified timepoints, as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1)and may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints as clinically indicated. ECGs for each patient should be obtained using the same machine wherever possible. All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high -quality, high- fidelity digital electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements. Lead placement should be as consistent as possible. ECG recordings must be performed after the patient has be en resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and under no conditions while the patient is receiving premedication or an IV infusion of study drug. Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation), should be avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording. For safety mon itoring purposes, the investigator or designee must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of a patient’s permanent study file at the site. The following should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF: ECG abnormality (including waveform); heart rate; PQ, PR, RR, and QRS intervals; and QT interval and corrected QTcF interval based on the machine readings of the individual ECG tracings. Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities must be doc umented on the eCRF. If at a particular post -dose timepoint the mean QTcF is 500 ms and/or 60 ms longer than the baseline value, another ECG must be recorded, ideally within the next 5minutes, and ECG monitoring should continue until QTcF has stabilized on twosuccessive ECGs. The investigator should also evaluate the patient for potential concurrent risk factors (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, co -medications known to prolong the QT in terval, and severe bradycardia ) and provide this information on the eCRF. In the event a patient presents with an episode of Grade 2 supraventricular arrhythmia (e.g., atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia), an unscheduled ECG should be reported. Standard -of-care tr eatment may be instituted at the discretion of the investigator. If a PK sample is not scheduled for that timepoint, an unscheduled idasanutlin PK sample should be obtained."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 61/Protocol GO40800 , Version 14.5.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes Patient -reported outcome ( PRO )data will be collected to document the treatment benefit and more fully characterize the safety profile of idasanutlin . PRO data will be obtained through the use of the following instruments: FACIT -Fatigue , EORTC QLQ -C30 (selected scales) , EORTC Item library (selected items) , PRO -CTCAE (selected symptoms), and EQ -5D-5L. The questionnaires, translated into the local language as appropriate, should be completed in their entirety at specified time points during the study. To ensure instrument validity and that data standards m eet health authority requirements, questionnaires need to be self -administered before the patient receives any information on disease status and prior to the administration of study treatment . Completion of PRO questionnaires should occur prior to the per formance of non- PRO assessments whenever possible .Laboratory blood collections are permitted prior to completing the PRO assessment s. Study site staff will ensure that PRO questionnaires are provided to the patients for completion per the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1), and before drug administration, site staff will confirm completion or alternatively document any reasons questionnaires were not complete d. Paper versions of the questionnaires will be administered to patients and entered into the study database by site personnel. 4.5.10.1 FACIT-Fatigue The FACIT -Fatigue (Version 4) is a validated, reliable ,self-report measure for use in a variety of conditions (Yellen et al. 1997 ; Cella et al. 2005; Lai et al. 2011 ).It consists of 13 items that assess fatigue using a 7-day recall period. Items are scored on a 0 ( ""not at all"") to 4 ( ""verymuch so "") response scale (see Appendix 12). Relevant items are reverse scored, and all items are summed to create total scores where higher scores are indicative of better functioning (i.e., less fatigue). 4.5.10.2 EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 (Version 3) is a validated, reliable ,self-report measure (Aaronson et al. 1993; Fitzsimmons et al. 1999) . It consists of 30 questions that assess five aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social) , three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), global health status /quality of life, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week (see Appendix 13). Scale scores can be obtained for the multi -item scales. The first 28 items are scored on a 4-point scale that ranges from ""not at all ""to ""very much, ""and the last two items are score don a 7 -point scale that ranges from ""very poor ""to ""excellent. "" Higher scores indicate higher response levels (i.e., higher HRQoL, higher symptom severity). For this study only the physical function (5 items), role function (2 items), and global health status/quality of life (2 items) will be administered to patients."

Three items from the library will be used to assess disease -related symptoms relevant to patients with AML . Selected symptoms include headaches, dizziness ,and bruising. All items are scored on a 4-point scale that ranges from ""not at all ""to ""very much ,""with higher scores indicative of higher symptom severity. 4.5.10.4 PRO -CTCA E The PRO -CTCAE is a validated item bank that is used to characterize presence, frequency, severity, and interference with daily function of 78 patient -reportable symptomatic treatment toxicities (Basch et al .2014; Dueck et al .2015). The PRO -CTCAE contains 124 questions that are rated on either a 5 -point Like rt-type scale (frequency, severity ,and interference) or dichotomously (presence/absence). Included treatment toxicity terms can be subjective, with or without observable components (e.g., vomiting and nausea, respectively )or primarily observable with su bjective components (e.g.,rash). The standard PRO -CTCAE recall period is ""the past 7 days."" A subset of three symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) deemed most applicable to treatment with idasanutlin was selected for this study based on known adverse event s. The fiveitems assessing these symptoms will be used to characterize the patient experience of symptomatic adverse events (see Appendix 15). 4.5.10.5 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a validated, self-report ,health status questionnaire that is used to calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses (EuroQol Group 1990; Brooks 1996; Herdman et al. 2011; Janssen et al. 2013). There ar e two components to the EQ -5D-5L: a five- item health state profile that assesses mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, as well as a VAS that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation o f a single composite score of the patient's health status. It will be used in this study for informing pharmacoeconomic evaluations (see Appendix 16). 4.5.11 Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository 4.5.11.1 Overview of the Research Biosample Repository The RBR is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides). The collection, storage, and analysis of RBR samples will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the deve lopment of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future."

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY PLA N The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with study treatment components in completed and ongoing studies. The anticipate d important safety risks of IMP sin this study (i.e., idasanutlin, cytarabine, and daunorubicin) are outlined below. Please refer t o the I dasanutlin Investigator’s Brochure and the local labels for cytarabine and daunorubicin for a complete summary of safety information. Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial. Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk of toxicities (see Section 4.1.2 ). In addition, patients will undergo adequate safety monitoring during the study, as described in this section. Guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment delays or discontinuation, are provided in Secti on 5.1.3 . 5.1.1 Safety Risks of Idasanutlin ,Cytarabine , and Daunorubicin in Leukemia Patient well -being and safety will be protected by applying stringent exclusion criteria specified in Section 4.1.2 ,byapplying the toxicity management guidelines detailed in Appendix 5, and through pharmacovigilance/safety monitoring of all adverse events and laboratory assessments and will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v5 .0criteria. Alltreatment -emergent adverse events ,whether treatment related or not ,will be monitored to resolution or stabilization as feasible. All serious adverse events and any adverse event of special i nterest will be reported in an expedited fashion (see Sections 5.2.2 and Section 5.2.3 ). The safety reviews will include summary tables of patient disposition, all adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, adverse events leading to study discontinuations, adverse events of special interest, and treatment exposure ."
68,page_68,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 68/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Information related to the risks associated with idasanutlin treatment is based on the Idasanutlin I nvestigator’s Brochure. Many of the toxicities experienced by patients were manageable with appropriate prophylaxis and supportive therapy and/or were reversible with discontinuation of the drug . Refer to the current I dasanutlin Investigator’s Brochure for details on the safety data from previous studies and for additional information on idasanutlin warnings and precautions. 5.1.1.1 Gastrointestinal Toxicity The adverse GIevents in the Phase I idasanutlin studies include primarily diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, and anorexia. Diarrhea was the most common adverse event observed in 90% of patients in the AML study NP28679 (mostly Grade s1 and 2 in severity). Nausea and vomiting were also reported in this study but to a lesser extent and all events were generally Grades 1 and 2. Supportive therapies, including prophylaxis for diarrhea and nausea, are encouraged in this study . In addition to institutional guidelines, specific instructions for the management of GI si de effects are provided in Section 5.1.3.1 and Appendix 5. 5.1.1.2 Cytopenias Cytopenias including myelosuppression are an anticipated consequence of the leukemia treatment proposed. Bone marrow toxicity may manifest as cytopenias (i.e., pancytopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). The NP27872 stu dy evaluating idasanutlin in patients with solid tumors has shown possible exposure -dependent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Most of them were reversible and clinically manageable . Inpatients with leukemia, who are neutropenic and thrombocytopenic as part of their disease process at baseline, elimination of leukemic blasts is essential for normal marrow recovery. Idasanutlin was associated with myelosuppression in the AML study NP28679, but normal marrow recovery was observed in responding patients . Inpatients with leukemia , drug -induced myelosuppression is expect ed during idasanutlin treatment . Inthis study, blood counts will be monitored closely throughout study treatment (see Appendix 1). 5.1.1.3 Tumor Ly sis Sy ndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially life -threatening metabolic disorder that occurs when tumor cells release their contents into the bloodstream, either spontaneously or in response to therapy, leading to characteristic findings of hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperp hosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. This complication is common in patients with acute leukemia but had been very rare with idasanutlin . Please refer to the Idasanutlin Investigator ’s B rochure. 5.1.1.4 Infections Infections of various etiologies have been reported in patients with AML in Study NP28679, and patients with AML generally have a higher susceptibility to infection.

Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the fol lowing: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product"
77,page_77,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 77/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Any new disease or exacerbatio n of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Section s 5.3.5.8 and 5.3.5.9 for more information) Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of stud y treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actu ally causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue ,might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient 'sability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenit al anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe ""and ""serious ""are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event ( e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event record ed on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions)."
78,page_78,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 78/Protocol GO40800 , Version 15.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows : Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law (see Section 5.3.5.6 ) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug , as defined below Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contam ination of the study drug is suspected. TLS (clinical TLS per Howard criteria, see Appendix 4) Bleeding if associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia Grade 3febrile neutropenia Grade 2 diarrhea Grade 2 C. difficile infection Note that patients with hematologic adverse events of special interest should be monitored with weekly blood counts until resolution. The final outcome must be reported in the eCRF. Hematologic adverse events of special interest (bleeding and febrile neutropenia) are not reportable for patients in whom myelosuppression arises as a result of confirmed relapsed disease. 5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 )."
79,page_79,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 79/Protocol GO40800 , Version 15.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the final dose of study treatment . Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.1.1 Adverse Event s Associated with Allo-HSCT Because of the multiple safety issues associated with the procedure, adverse event s clearly related to allo-HSCT and associated procedures (e.g .,conditioning, DILs, etc .) should not be reported. Reporting in the maintenance following consolidation will resume following t he first dose of study drug as per standard reporting rules. 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation time points. Exampl es of non-directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v 5.0) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Table 13will be used for assessing severity for adverse events that are not speci fically listed in the NCI CTCAE."

The following guidance should be taken into consideration : Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable) Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy."
81,page_81,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 81/Protocol GO40800 , Version 15.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adve rse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterize d as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be null ified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That A reSecondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated i n time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe GIhemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as t o whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded o nce on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes"
82,page_82,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 82/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Deta ils regarding any increases or decreases in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non-serious "" to ""serious, ""providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment Note: For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator 'sresponsibility to review all laborato ry findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself s hould be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium, ""as opposed to ""abnormal potassium ""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyper kalemia. """
83,page_83,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 83/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria : Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator 'sjudgment It is the investigator 'sresponsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital s ign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events) . 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy’s Law). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be est ablished) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 )."
84,page_84,"Idasanutlin —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 84/Protocol GO40800 , Version 15.3.5.7 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol - specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of acute myeloid leukemia should be recorded on the dedicated eCRF page . All other deaths that occur during the adverse event rep orting period, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.2.2 ) Deat h should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac death""). Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.8 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequen cy, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more f requent headaches ""). 5.3.5.9 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as eff icacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on criteria using 2017 ELN recommendations (see Section 4.5.6 ). In r are cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 5.3.5.10 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Hospitalization data will be collected.

Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a fin al outcome can be reported. Patients with ongoing hematologic adverse events should be monitored with weekly blood counts until resolution. The final outcome must be reported in the eCRF. Hematologic adverse events are not reportable for patients for whom myelosuppression arises as a result of confirmed relapsed disease. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient 'smedical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome. 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THA T OCCUR AFTER THE A DVERSE EVENT REPORTING PERI OD After the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 28days after the final dose of study drug), all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported through use of the Long -Term Survival Follow -Up eCRF.

STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE Dose finding will be conducted during the dose -escalation phase of this study. The estimated sample size follows from the dose -escalation rules for a mCRM algorithm, as outlined in Section 3.1. It is ant icipated that enrollment of up to five cohorts of 36patients each, for a total of 9 15evaluable patients, will be required to establish the RP2D during the dose -escalation phase ( see Appendix 18for modeling details and simulation results ). Assuming 5 not -evaluable patients (see Section 3.1.2 for the definition of evaluable patients), the expected maximum sample size will be approximately 20 patients. Approximately 40 patients (20 favorable / intermediate risk patients and 20 high-risk patients in two separate cohorts) will be enrolled during the expansion phase. A sample size of 20 patients in the high-risk cohort is deemed sufficient to provide adequate precision for the point estimate and for the lower end of the 90 % CItorule o ut a clinically uninteresting probability of response of 50% with an observed CR proportion of 70%. Depending on the proportions of patients with adverse risk or secondary AML enrolled , a CR proportion up to 50%55% is expected for high-risk patients under current 7 3 standard of care (see Table 14). This assumption is based on the literature related to adverse- riskpatients (per ELN 2017 recommendations ; Fernand ez et al. 2009; Löwenberg et al. 2009; Burnett et al. 2015; Luskin et al. 2016) and secondary AML efficacy data as well as real world data obtained from the clinic (Østgårdt et al. 2014) ."

Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification d ocument that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RTFORMS eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive t raining and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in acco rdance with instructions from the Sponsor . All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will rece ive patient data for his or her site in a readable format that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the data is required. 7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to co nfirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded anddocumented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- techn ical departments involved in a clinical trial."

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 129/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1Appendix 5 Toxicity Management Guidelines DIARRHE A MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES A ND RECOM MENDA TIONS Diarrhea has been the most frequently reported adverse event in patients with acute myelo idleukemia (AML) administered with idasanutlin (Study NP28679). Prior to first study medication administration Patients should be carefully screened for active GI conditions (e.g., graft-versus - host disease, G 2) and un controlled irritable bowel disease (i.e., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis -associated colitis, and Behçet disease) prior to enrollment. Patients with active GI conditions as noted in the exclusion criteria are not permitted to start tre atment . Establish the individual patient’s normal bowel function. Discuss how function could change in the future with treatment. Discuss dietary management/rehydration. Prophylactic antidiarrheal therapy is to be instituted for all patients administered study medication sin induction and consolidation as follows (unless medically contra -indicated) : Loading dose of loperamide 4 mg orally 30 minutes before first administration of idasanutlin Instruct patients on warning signs (e.g., bloody stools, associated fever, and dizziness). Event management Should diarrhea occur: administer loperamide 2 mg orally every 4 hours or after every unformed stool t o a maximum dose of 16 mg/24 hr. Rule out other or concomitant causes, including medications (e.g., stool softeners, laxatives, and antacids), C.difficile infection (CDI), malabsorption/lactose intolerance, fecal impaction, and dietary supplements high in fiber Dietary measures: Disconti nue all lactose -containing products, alcohol and high-osmolar supplements; instruct patients to eat frequent small meals (e.g., bananas, rice, apples, and toast). Loperamide treatment should be continued until patient is diarrhea -free for 24hours or unt il Day 10 of the specific cycle, whichever occurs first. Record the number of stools and report complications (e.g., fever or dizziness upon standing). Encourage adequate hydration. Monitor electrolytes daily (i.e., potassium, magnesiu m, calcium, and sodium) . Administer IVfluids as clinically indicated and aim at all times for electrolyte correction."

Grade 3 d) Consider second -line agents (i.e., diphenoxylate, atropine, octreotide, budesonide, or tincture of opium) if the patient is receiving loperamide at the maximum recommended daily dose (16 mg/24hr). e) If no improvement is observed within 24 hours, test for CDI. f) If, despite adequate supportive care, Grade 3 diarrhea pe rsists 48hours without responding to loperamide at the maximum recommended daily dose (16 mg/24 h r), the idasanutlin dose should be reduced as per Table 11. g) If clinical characteristics have NOT improved to Grade 1 or baseline by 28 days despite the pa tient receiving maximal supportive care, idasanutlin must be permanently discontinued. h) If the diarrhea recurs at Grade 3 despite supportive care and idasanutlin dose reduction, idasanutlin must be permanently discontinued. Grade 4 i) If, despite prophylaxis and adequate supportive care, Grade 4 diarrhea is diagnosed, idasanutlin must be permanently discontinued. j) Consider second -line agents (i.e., diphenoxylate, atropine, octreotide, budesonide, or tincture of opium) if the patient is currently receiving loperamide at the maximum recom mended daily dose (16 mg/24 hr ). k) If no improvement is observed within 24 hours, test for CDI. CDIClostridium difficile infection; CTCAE Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION Due to the high incidence of diarrhea, CDI may occur undetected. Once diagnosed, monitoring CDI is also challenging, as treatment -induced diarrhea may be persistent. The risk factors for CDI are common in this patient population (treatment with systemic"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 131/Protocol GO40800 , Version 1antibiotics, decreased leukocyte count, decreased albumin, and increased temperature, and increased ATLAS score). Prior to first administration of study medication Patients should be carefully screened for active/uncontrolled infections prior to enrollment. Patients receiving antimicrobial agents with therapeutic intent to eradicate C. difficile are not permitted to begin study medication, as noted in the exclusion criteria Testing the stool from asymptomatic patients, at screening, or during an ongoing episode of diarrhea to verify cure is not clinically useful. Diarrhea management If loperamide at the maximum recommended daily dose (16 mg/24 hours) does not improve the severity of diarrhea within 24 hours, test for C. difficile toxin and toxin -producing C. difficile in stool. Consider clinically appropriate empirical therapy before microbiological evidence is found such as the following: Metronidazole: if the initial episode is mild CDI, administer 500 mg orally, three times daily for 10 –14 days. Vanc omycin: if recurrent disease is suspected or moderate to severe CDI is present, administer 125 mg orally four times daily for 10 –14 days. Once CDI is confirmed (colonoscopic or histopathological findings demonstrating pseudomembranous colitis may NOT suffi ce to confirm CDI), perform the following: Discontinue unnecessary antimicrobial therapy. Maintain adequate replacement of fluid and electrolytes. Avoid any anti -motility medications/dietary supplements. Use of proton pump inhibitors should be reviewed, as it has been shown to increase CDI susceptibility ( Garey et al. 2008 ; Janarthanan et al. 2012 ). Loperamide should not be used as a primary therapy. Vancomycin is preferred antibiotic of choice (125 mg orally four times daily for 10–14 days or 500 mg four t imes daily for 10 days). Fidaxomicin (200 mg twice daily for 10 days) can be administered as an alternative if CDI is severe or in case of recurrence. Simple measures such as thorough hand washing with soap and water (alcohol -based hand cleanser is not eff ective against spores) and avoidance of rectal thermometers is recommended for patients and healthcare providers. EMESIS GUIDELINES Nausea and vomiting have been reported in 30% of AML patients who are administered idasanutlin in combination with cytarabine."

Please refer to existing guidelines for optimal management of febrile neutropenia (Montesinos et al. 2008 ; de Naurois et al. 2010 ;Flowers etal. 2013 ). TUMOR LYSIS SYNDROME MANAGEMENT GUIDELIN ES Five cases with laboratory evidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) have been reported in AML patients who were treated in Study NP28679 as a treatment -related adverse event. Of these, a single case with clinical features was reported. The patient was treated for TLS and recovered. Per the exclusion criterion, WBC counts should be 50,000/mm3. Hydroxyurea (HU) or leukapheresis is allowed to meet this criterion. HU must be discontinued at least 24hours prior to initiating study medication. Prior to first administration of study medication Assess the risk for TLS based on a clinical assessment and comorbidities (e.g., presence of renal dysfunction or cardiac failure) prior to initiating study medication. Risk factors for TLS risk are not unique to idasanutlin and are multifactorial (i.e., WBC count 25,000/mm3, serum uric acid 7.5 mg/dL, and LDH 4ULN)."

All analyses were performed using the R statistical software R version 3.4.4 (2018 -03-15) (Team 2017 ) (see Section 3.1.2.3 for additional information). Rational efor Model -Based Design The modified continuous reassessment method (mCRM) design uses a statistical model that actively seeks a dose level close to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) by using toxicity data from all enrolled evaluable patients to compute a p recise dose -toxicity curve. It locates the MTD efficiently and minimizes the number of patients treated at possibly pharmacological inactive dose levels. Such model -based designs have been successful ly applied in many Phase I dose -escalation studies (S. P et al. 2004 ; C, JJ, and LL 2009 ; B, M, and T 2008 ). The simulations in this appendix investigate the operating characteristics of the design as implemented for this study. In this design the MTD is defined as the dose maximizing the posterior probability that the DLT rate,  (    ) ∈ [0.2, 0. 35]while keeping the probability of overdose  { (     ) > 0. 35} < 0. 35. Statistical M odel A two- parameter logistic model will be used to fit the dose -toxicity relationship. The probability of DLT at dose   ,  (   )is defined as (1)        =       +       1 +        +       (1) where   =       ∗  and  ∗is the reference dose (in this case  ∗=300mg)."

Model Prior A minimally informative bivariate normal prior for the parameters of the DLT -dose response curve ( ,  ) is constructed in order to have a weak impact to the final MTD determination (B, M, and T 2008 ). The parameters of the minimally informative prior are listed below (3):   = ( ,  ) = (−0. 797 , 0.995 )   =                  =  1.699 0.280 0.280 1.076  (3) where  and  are the parameters of the bivariate normal distribution. The prior distribution used to determine the dose -escalation decision for this study is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 Minimally Informative Prior Maximum Dose Increments The maximum dose Increments relative to the previous dose level is 150 mg.

Dose Grid The dose grid that has been used inthis design starts from 200 mg and ends at 800mg, with an increment of 50 mg. Model Performance Evaluation To illustrate how the design will perform, different escalation scenarios are explored and results are tabulated in Table 1. Each row represents four different situations: which dose would the model recommend, after seeing no DLT s in previous cohorts and when 0, 1, 2, or 3 DLTs are observed in the current cohort. The evaluation is based on cohort size=3, “ 200” indicates that the model would stop escalating and the trial would be halted."

Then, with 2 or 3 DLTs the model always recommends to d e-escalate or STOP. Therefore, the results show that the design will adequately adapt the dose in the presence of observed DLTs. Simulation Study A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the operating characteristics for the chosen design parameters (pr iors, reference dose, stopping rule) under various dose -toxicity scenarios. The different scenarios have been selected in order to cover a wide range of dose- toxicity possibilities and to be able to quantify the risk and benefit, should these scenarios act ually occur. Dose Toxicity Scenarios The different scenarios have been selected in order to cover a wide range of dose - toxicity possibilities and to be able to quantify the risk and benefit, should these scenarios actually occur. As shown in Figure 2 , we explore 6 scenarios. The first 5 represent decreasing levels of toxicity, while the last one considers the toxicity depicted in the prior as true toxicity. Scenario 3 has a steeper dose -toxicity curve meaning that the acceptable do se interval is very narrow. Some scenarios are relatively extreme, but still they will be informative on"

For dose -toxicity curves corresponding too most toxic scenarios (e.g. scenarios 1, 2) the median selected dose is 0, indicating that no MTD within the tested dose range can be found most of the time. In these cases, the required number of treated patients is far less than 15 evaluable patients, meaning that the design tends to recommend stopping dose escalation, avoiding therefore unnecessary exposure to toxic doses In addition, we see that the number of patients treated over the dose toxicity interval is quite limited, with the exception of the first two scenarios where all do ses were too toxic (all patients being treated at or above the target toxicity). The good performances of the algorithm are also confirmed by the median proportion of DLTs observed in the simulations, which is always 1/3 (except for toxic scenarios 1 and 2). Finally, in terms of sample sizes, the median number of patients required to give a MTD recommendation is usually 15 patients across all scenarios. In case of too high toxicity, the required number is, as outlined above, lower."
