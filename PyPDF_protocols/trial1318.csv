Amendment 5 (24April 2018) This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. The overall reason for the amendment: To add results of the male and female rat fertility studies. To exclude further enrollment of women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). In addition, other minor changes and clarifications related to study procedures w ere m ade. Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: To update nonclinical data . Section 1.1.1 .Nonclinical Studies (Toxicology); Section 16.1. Study -Specific Design ConsiderationUpdated nonclinical text to include findings from a 6-month toxicity study in rats and 9 -month toxicology stud y in dogs . Added results from the male and female rat fertility studies and relevant information from the literature . References (68 -74) New literature references added. Rationale: The female rat fertility study suggested that JNJ -42847922 reduced female fertility rates at all doses studied. Since it is not known what the relevance of these findings are to a w oman’s ability to become pregnant after taking JNJ -42847922, no new WOCBP w ill be included in this study until more is learned about the effect of JNJ-42847922 on female reproduction. WOCBP who are currently enrolled in the study may continue study participation following discussion between the subject and the investigator of the ne wrat fertility study results ,if they have a negative pregnancy test ,and are using reliable contraception (as specified further in the protocol). Synopsis (Subject Population); Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria; Section 16.1. Study -Specific Design ConsiderationsInclusion Criterion #1: Revised text to indicate that the study population will include men and w omen “of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)” . Added a definition of WONCBP. Clarified in other relevant se ctions that the study population will include men and w omen “of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)”. Section 1. 3. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment; Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 16.1. Study -Specific Design ConsiderationsAdded additional text to explain that WOCBP w ill be excluded based on the results of the female rat fertility study ,and that “WOCBP wh o are currently enrolled in this study may continue study participation following discussion between the subject and the investigator of the new rat fertility study results, if they have a negative pregnancy test, and are using reliable contraception ” Deleted following sentence: “It is expected that this population will be representative for the targeted subject population for future clinical trials.” Updated the following sentence (addition shown in “italics” ): “The “age of the” study population in this protocol is intentionally broad. ”"

Exclusion Criteria Exclusion Criterion #30: Made the following revisions: Is pregnant ,or breastfeeding , or planning to become pregnant while enrolled in this study or within 3 “1” monthsafter the last dose of study drug. Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria #1 0 and #11 have been deleted (these criteria are no longer required now that the female population is restricted to WONCBP. The relevant information on WONCBP from Inclusion Criterion #11 w as moved to Inclusion Criterion #1; the relevant information on contraceptive requirements for WOCBP from Inclusion Criterion #11 w as moved to Section 4.3 [Criterion #2]). Section 4.3 Prohibitions and RestrictionsCriterion #2: Added information regarding contraceptive requirements for WOCBP who continue in the study. Synopsis (Safety Evaluations); Time and Events Schedule; Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale (Safety Evaluations); Section 9.1.1. Overview; Secti on 9.1.2. Screening; Section 9.6 . Safety Evaluations (Clinical Labora tory Tests)The s cheduled serum and uri ne pregnancy tests were removed fr om the Tim e and Events schedule and footnote ‘t ’ was updated as follows: t. Wom en of childbearing potential only. Additional s Serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed “in WONCBP” , as determined necessary by the in vestigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject’s participation in the study. “ A FSH test may also be performed at investigator judgment to assist in determining if a woman is of non - childbearing potential. For WOCBP enrolled in the study before Amendment 5 and who continue in the trial, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests must be performed at Da y 1, Day 22, Day 42 (End-of Treatment/Ear ly Withdrawal] , and at the Foll ow-up Visit .” Wording on pregnancy testing throughout the protocol w as updated to clarify that pregnancy tests can be performed in WONCBP if determined necessary by the investig ator, a nd to clarify that pregnancy tests are still required for WOCBP who continue in the study. Rationale: The maximum age of the study population was increased from 64 years to 70 years to increase the patient population to help with recruitment and to learn about JNJ-42847922 in the elderly with MDD Synopsis (Sub ject Population); Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria (Criterion # 1)Changed the maximum age of the study population from 64 years to 70years, inclusive. Rationale: To make the evening dosing window less restrictive because no significant food effect has been observed up to now and to add further instructions on dosing. Synopsis (Overview of Study Design; Dosage and Administration; Description of Interventions); Timeand Events Schedule (footnote sb & k); Section 3.1. Overview of Study Design; Section 6. Dosage and Administration; Table 3 ; Section 9.1.3. Double -blind Treatmen t PhaseChanged the dosing time from “at least” 3 hours after the last meal to “approximately ” 3hours after the last meal. Added the following text in Section 6: “ Subjects will administer the assigned study drug once daily at bedtime, approximately 3 hours after the last meal, from Day 1 to Day 41. Subjects are required to record the administration of study drug or any missed doses in subject diaries, which will be checked at each scheduled visit. ”"

Overview of Study Design; Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria; Section 9.1.2. ScreeningInclusion Criterion #2: Changed the required length of the current depressive episode from “ ≤1 year” to “≤18 months”. The corresponding change was made in Section 9.1.2., Screening. Inclusion Criterion #3: The text was updated as shown below: “Have had a n inadequate response to at least 1 but no more than 2 “3” antidepressants (see the inclusion criterion below ), adm inistered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression, as assessed by the MGH -ATRQ. An inadequate response is defin ed as <50% reduction in depressive symptom severity, as assessed by the MGH -ATRQ. An adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 4 weeks at at least “or above” the minimum therapeutic dose, as specified in the MGH -ATRQ, for any pa rticular antidepressant. The inadequate response must include the subject’s current antidepressant treatment.” The corresponding change was also made in other relevant sections. Inclusion Criterion #4: Clarified that current antidepressant treatment should be at “a stable dose (at or above the minimum therapeutic dose level)” for at least 4 weeks, and for no greater than 6“12” months, at screening. Inclusion Criterion #12: Changed restriction on egg donation from 3months to “1 month” after receiving the last dose of study drug. Inclusion Criterion #13 : The text was updated as shown below : “During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 3 months) after receiving the last dose of study drug, in addition to the highly effective method of contraception , a m an” Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion Criterion #1: Added “(including narcolepsy)” after neurologic. Changed the HbA1c threshold for w ell-controlled diabetes mellitus from a HbA1c of “ ≤7%” to HbA1c of “ ≤7.5% ”at screening. Exclusion Criterion #5 : Added the following text to define the criteria for lack of response: “as indicated by no or minimal ( ≤25% improvement in symptoms) when treated with an antidepressant of adequate dose (per MGH -ATRQ) and duration (at least 4 weeks).” Rationale: To clarify that concomitant therapies do not need to be recorded for subjects who fail screening un less there is an adverse event, and that modification of an effective preexisting therapy should not be made for the explicit purpose of entering a subject into the study. To add additional medications to the list of prohibited medications and timing of th eir discontinuation to add additional clarity for investigators. Section 8. Prestudy and Concomitant TherapyAdded the following text: “For subjects who fail screening, concomitant therapies do not need to be recorded unless there is an adverse event.” Added: “Prior to study entry , modification of an effective pr eexisting therapy should not be made for the explicit purpose of entering a subject into the stud y.” Added “tricyclic antidepressants” and “bupropion” to the list of prohibited medications. Added: “When discontinuing a prohibited medication, the investigators should consider the time needed to sufficiently eliminate a drug from body system, eg, 5 half -lives of the drug.”"

Added the following text: “In the places where oral or t ympanic temperature are not standard practice, axillary temperature can be used. The same temperature measure should be used through out the study.” Section 9.6. Safety Evaluations (Clinical Laboratory Tests)Made a correction to the following sentence: The follow ing tests will be performed by the central laboratory “during the study” Rationale: To clarify that only those subjects with acute suicidal ideation and with a clear plan should be discontinued from study treatment. Section 10.2. Withdraw al from the StudyThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below (new text indicated in “italics” ): The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation “with a clear plan” at any time during the study; the subject should be referred to appropriate medical/psychiatric care. Rationale: Wording regarding the reporting process for adverse events of special interest was updated. Section 9. 6. Safety Evaluations (Adverse events of Special Interest)The follow ing sentence was updated as shown below: When reported, the investigator will be required to complete a detailed summary of the event and its clinical course utilizing the CRF page “AE of special interest narrative form” as soon as information on the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) is available. “In addition, the AE should be marked as an AE of special interest in the CRF.” Rationale: Wording regarding the transmission of serious adverse events to the sponsor was updated to remove reference to the Safety Report Form, as it is not relevant for this study. Section 12.3.2. Serious Adverse EventsThe follow ing sentence was updated as shown below: Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form and Safety Report Form , which must be completed and reviewed “signed” by a physician from the study site, and transmitted to the sponsor wi thin 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a serious adverse event should be “made” transmitted electronically or by facsimile (fax). Rationale: To add the generic name for JNJ -42847922 (ie, seltorexant) Title page; Running header; Synopsis; Section 1. IntroductionAdded the generic name for JNJ -42847922, ie seltorexant, in several locations in addition to the previous descriptor of selective orexin -2 receptor antagonist."

The overall reason for the amendment: The key reasons for this amendment are to simplify the dose-finding strategy and reduce the sample size by: 1) removing Stage 2 from the original study design; 2) removing the active comparator (quetiapine) arm from the study; 3)reducing the number of JNJ-42847922 treatment arms . Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: The study was previously designed as a tw o-stage study with an active comparator arm (quetiapine) in Stage 2. To simplify the dose-finding strateg y, Stage 2 and the active comparator arm have been removed. Study Title The study title has been updated to reflect changes in study design; ie, references to ‘T wo-Stage’ and ‘Active -Controlled’ have been removed. Synopsis; Time and Events Schedule; Sections 1.2 ( now deleted ), Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5, 6, 9.1.1, 9.1.3, 9.3.1, 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.8, 12.1.1, 14.1, 15, 16.1References to ‘tw o-stage’, ‘Stage 1’, or ‘Stage 2’ have been removed. References to the active comparator (quetiapine) have been removed. Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria The follow ing exclusion criteria w ere removed as they are specific to quetiapine use: Criterion #19: Has a history of previous nonresponse to an adequate trial of quetiapine as an adjunctive treatment for MDD (defined as ≥ 150 mg for 6weeks or more). Criterion #21: Has a hist ory of epilepsy, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or Tardive Dyskinesia. In addition, Criterion #23 w as modified to remove mention of quetiapine. Rationale: The JNJ-42847922 dose levels to be evaluated in this study have been re vised (previous doses w ere10, 20, or 40 mg in Stage 1 w ith the option to add a 2.5 mg dose in Stage 2; the revised doses are starting doses of 20 or 40 mg with the option to add a 10 mg dose after the interim analysis). Further review of clinical data from Phase 1 studies sugge ststhat the 20 mg dose is well tolerated and will likely be an effective dose. It is considered unlikely that doses lower than 10 mg will be effective and as such, the 2.5 mg dose has been removed. Synop sis; Sections 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 5, 6, 9.1.3, 11.2, 14.1JNJ-42847922 dose levels were updated and reference sto the 2.5 mg dose level were removed. Rationale: Updates w ere made to the sample size calculation and interim analysis based on changes in study design. A larger effect size was assumed (based on Phase 1b study results), resulting in a smaller number of subjects required. Synopsis; Section 3.1. Overvie w of Study Design; Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; Section 11. 2. Sample Size Determination; Section 11.8 Interim AnalysisThe sample size calc ulation was updated, resulting in a decrease in the planned number of subjects (from 565 to 256). The interim analysis will now be performed 6 weeks after 160 subjects have been randomized (previously after 175 subjects completed 6 w eeks of treatment). The formal statistical criterion for declaring futility has been removed. The statement regarding sample size re -estimation (SSR) has been removed, as SSR will no longer be performed at the interim analysis."
11,page_11,"JNJ-42847922 (Seltorexant/Selective Orexin -2 Receptor Antagonist) Clinical Protocol 42847922MDD2001 Amendment 5 12 Status: Approved , Date: 24 April 2018Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: A new section was added to the protocol (Section 1.3. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment ), in line with a ne w sponsor initiative to incorporate a discussion of benefit -risk within each protocol. Section 1.3. Overall Risk and Benefit AssessmentNew section added. Rationale: Additional text was added regarding the rationale for the s tratification of subjects by baseline insomnia severity index (ISI) and to ensure randomization of an approximately equal proportion of subjects w ith an ISI score <15 (su bclinical or no clinically significant insomnia) and ≥15 (moderate to severe insomnia) . Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale; ReferencesAn additional statement and 2 supporting references (Kenter [2016] and Mason [2014]) w ere added to provide further rationale regarding stratification of subjects by baseline ISI score. Section 5. Treatment Allocation and BlindingThe follow ing sentence was added: “In order to randomize approximately equal proportions of subjects with and without significant insomnia symptoms at baseline, the number randomized in either stratum will be capped at 60% of the planned total sample size .” Rationale: The Antidepressant Side Effect Checklist (ASEC) was removed from the study assessments , asat the time of enrollment subject s will have been on the same antidepressant for at least 4weeks and will continue to take the same antidepressant at same dose during the entire stud y. Since adverse events will be monitored during the study and the safety profiles of SSRI/SNRI shave been well established , it is not considered necessary to measure adverse events speci fically associated w ith underl yingantidepressants. Synopsis; Time and Events Schedule; Section s 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 9.1.2, 9.6, 11.7, and 17.4; ReferencesReferences to ASEC were removed . Rationale: The protocol previously defined an adequate trial of prior antidepressant treatment to be “ an antidepressant treatment for at least 6 w eeks at the minimum dose” . How ever, in clinical practice an adequate trial of an SSRI/SNRI can be assessed as early as 4 weeks after start of treatment. Therefore, an adequate trial of prior antidepressant treatment was revised to 4 w eeks to align with standard of care clinic al practice. Additional changes were made to clarify that the minimum dose should be at leas tthe minimum therapeutic dose. Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Criterion #3 was updated as described in the rationale above. Criterion #4 w as updated to indicate that subjects should be receiving monotherapy treatment with one of the stated antidepressants for at least 4weeks (previously stated as 6 w eeks). Section 9.1.2 .Screening Phase Changes made to reflect revisions to the Inclusion Criteria described above. Rationale: Updates w ere made to Exclusion Criterion #1 based on a request from the United States Food and Drug Administration to clarify the definition of “significant” renal or liver insufficiency. Additional updates were made to this criterion to further define ex clusion criteria for subjects with other comorbidities. Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria Criterion #1: Further text added to define renal and liver insufficiency based on creatinine clearance and Child -Pugh classification, respectively. Further text added to exclude subjects with significant or unstable immunologic disorders. Further text added to clarify that subjects with uncontrolled hypo -or hyperthyroidism or diabetes, or insulin -dependent diabetes mellitus will be excluded. Furthe r text added to define inclusion of subjects with “well -controlled” non-insulin dep endent diabetes mellitus."

The protocol w as therefore updated to allow subjects on fluvoxamine to participate in the study. Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Fluvoxamine was added to the list of SSRIs/SNRIs that may be used during the study . Time and Events Schedule; Section 9.1.2. Screening PhaseFluvoxamine was added to the list of SSRIs/SNRIs that will be assayed by the central laboratory. Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria; Section 8. Prestudy and Concomitant MedicationsRestrictions related to use of fluvoxamine were removed. Attachment 1 (previously Attachment 2)Fluvoxamine was removed from the list of concomitant drugs to be avoided. Rationale: Subjects are scheduled to stay overnight at the study site on Day 1 for collection of pharmacokinetic (PK) and cortisol samples. However, in some circumstances, subjects may not be able to stay overnight at the study site on Day 1 for sample collection. Si nce the collection of PK and cortisol samples does not relate to the primary assessments of safety and efficacy, the protocol w ording was revised to allow for exceptions to the overnight stay and the collection of samples (PK and cortisol). Such exceptions may only be made after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor. The reason for the exception must be documented in the subject’s source documents. Synopsis; Time and Events Schedule; Section 3.1. Overvie w of Study Design; Sectio n 6. Dosage and Administration; Section 7. Treatment Compliance; Section 9.1.3. Double -Blind Treatment Phase; Section 9.4. Biomarkers EvaluationsAdditional text added per rationale described above. Additional text added to clarify that subjects who do not stay overnight will take their Day 1 dose at home . Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Criterion #9 w as modified to remove reference to “peripheral biomarkers research (ie, blood, saliva)”, since salivary cortisol collection is no longer a required procedure for the study. Rationale: Exclusion of immunodeficient subjects or subjects with hepatitis B or hepatitis C is considered to be adequately covered by Exclusion Criterion #1. Therefore, the exclusion criterion specific to subjects with HIV, hepatitis C and hepatitis B (C riterion #15) w as deleted, and the serology sample that was previously planned for screening of these patients was removed. Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria The follow ing criterion (Criterion #15) w as deleted: “Is known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C, or has positive results at screening.” Synopsis; Time and Events Schedule; Section 9.1.2. Screening Phase; Section 9.6. Safety EvaluationsRemoved the serology assessment at screening. Rationale: In order to allow a broader group of the general MDD population to enroll, a small increase was implemented for the upper limit of body mass index (BMI) within Inclusion Criterion #6. Section 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Criterion #6 w as updated to encompass a BMI range of between 18 and 35kg/m2inclusive (previously was 18 to 34 kg/m2inclusive)."

Inclusion Criteria Criterion #5 w as modified to indicate that subjects must not demonstrate a clinically signifi cant “improvement” (previously stated as “change”) from the screening to baseline visit. In addition, the following text w as deleted for clarity: “ie, subjects must have a MADRS total score of at least 20 at the baseline visit”. Criter ion #8 w as modified to delete the following text: “If there are abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population.” Criterion #11 w as modified to indicate that subjects must agree to remain on a highly effective method of birth control throughout the study and for at least 1 month after the last dose of study drug (previously 3 months after the last dose of study drug). Section 4.2. Exclusion Criteria Criterion #5 previously excluded subjects w ith a “history of treatment resistance to antidepressant medication ( ≥3 lifetime treatment failures)”. The wording has been revised to exclude those subjects w ith a “history of lack of response to 3 or more adequate antidepressant treatments.” Criterion #9 w as modified to add “ autism spectrum disorder ”as one of the diagnoses that will be exclusionary. Criterion #11 updated to indicate that only those subjects w ith hypersomnia “that is not related to insomnia disorder” w ill be excluded. Criterion #17 updated for further clarity regarding exclusion of subjects with ECG abnormalities. Criterion #20 w as modified to indicate that subjects with prior transcranial magnetic stimulation should be excluded. Rationale: The requirement for subjects to refrain from strenuous exercise during the study was revised, as this criterion w ould be difficult to define and standardize, and there is currently no evidence to suggest that strenuous exercise would impact study assessments listed in the protocol . Section 4. 3. Prohibitions and RestrictionsCriterion #5 w as revi sed to indicate that “Subjects are advised not to change the frequency or level of exercise during the study.” Rationale: The protocol previously stated that subjects w ere allow ed to have a low -fat meal prior to blood biomarker sampling; how ever, since biomarker samples are taken on the same day as clinical laboratory samples (which should be taken under fasted conditions) it was decided that subjects should be fasted on Day 1, 8, 22 and 42visits. Therefore, details regarding the low -fat diet/meals in relation to biomarker assessments were removed. Time and Events Schedule; Section 9.1.3 .Double -Blind Treatment Phase; Section 9.4. Biomarkers Evaluations; Attachment 1 (now deleted)Text regarding low -fat diet/meal w as rem oved Text added to indicate that subjects should attend visits under fasted conditions. The attachment that provided examples of low -fat meals (previous ly Attachment 1) was removed and subsequent attachment numbers were updated. Rationale: Revisions were made to Section 8, Prestudy and Concomitant Therapy , based on further clinical revie w and to improve readability and consistency. Section 8. Prestudy and Concomitant TherapyMedications were summarized according to pharmaceutical class . Restrictions regarding use of certa in medications (eg, benzodiazep ines, hypnotics, sedating antidepressants , melatonin ) were revised. The restriction regarding consumption of quinine, grapefruit, Seville oranges, and poppy seed w as rem oved."

Rationale: For consistency with other sections of the protocol, the text in Section 9.5 w as updated to clarify that samples for pharmacogenomic research will be collected where local regulations permit, and that subject participation in pharmacogenomic research is o ptional. Section 9.5. Pharmacogenomic and Epigenetic (DNA) EvaluationsThe follow ing text added to the start of the first paragraph: “A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected to allow for pharmacogenomic research where local regulations permit.” The follow ing text was a dded to the start of the second paragraph: “Subject participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional.” Rationale: Further guidance was added regarding the methodology for collection of body w eight and waist circumference measurements, in order to standardize these assessments. Section 9.6. Safety Evaluations Physical Examination subsection w as updated with additional information regarding collection of body weight and waist circumference. Rationale: The protocol previously stated that subjects should take their baseline SSRI/SNRIs in the morning throughout the study. As not all subjects with MDD take their antidepressant medication in the morning, this was revised. Synopsis ; Section 3.1. Overvie w of Study Design; Section 6. Dosage and AdministrationThe text w as changed to indicate that baseline SSRIs/SNRIs should be taken “at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study” . Rationale: Pharmacokinetic sections were revised to reflect updates related to the interim analysis and to indicate that some of the PK analyses stated in the protocol w ill only be performed if considered necessary . Full details of the PK analyses will be described in a separate analysis plan. Synopsis; Section 3.2. Study Design Rationale ; Section 9.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters; Section 11.4. Pharm acokinetic Analyses ; Section 11.8. Interim AnalysisRemoved the word “pooled” when referring to PK population analysis. Text a dded to indicate that a snapshot date for PK samples may be defined prior to the interim analysis. Revised text in Section 11.8, Interim Analysis, to indicate that exposure analyses will be performed based on data available at the time of t he interim analysis (not, as previously stated ,“on an ongoing basis prior to the interim analysis ”). Rationale: The list of anticipated events in Attachment 2 (previously Attachment 3) was updated to remove events not considered specifically relevant to MDD. Attachment 2 . Anticipated EventsThe follow ing events were removed from the list of Anticipated Events: Activation or hypomania/mania Excessive happiness. Rationale: There is no plan to include TruCulture col lection in this study, so related text was deleted. Section 9.4. Biomarker s EvaluationsText regarding collection of samples for TruCulture was removed . Rationale: Detailed information regarding blood sample volumes was removed ,as this level of detail w as not considered necessary for the protocol . Full details onblood volumes will be provided inthe Laboratory M anual . Section 9.1. Study Procedures The table detail ing blood volumes was rem oved and replaced w ith a simple statement that: “The total blood volume to be collected from each subject will be approximately 190 mL. ”"

Rationale: To evaluate the relationship betw een improvement in depressive symptoms and baseline insomnia severity and to capture the subject’s assessment of JNJ -42847922 compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant in improving insomnia severity. Synopsis, 2.1. Objectives and Endpoints Added the following endpoints: Correlation betw een baseline ISI score as a continuous variable and change from baseline to the end of Week 6 in the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS )total score. Shift in ISI score category from baseline to the end of Week 6. Time and Events Schedule Added ISI at end -of-study/early withdraw al visit. 11.3. Efficacy Analysis Updated the text for analysis of correlation betw een baseline ISI score and MADRS. Rationale: To explore the response to JNJ -42847922 in the subgroup of subjects with MDD w ith anxious distress. Synopsis, 2.1. Objectives and Endpoints Added an objective and endpoint to assess the efficacy of JNJ-42847922 in improving depressive symptoms in the subpopulation of subjects with MDD w ith anxious distress. 11.3. Efficacy Analysis Added text for subgroup analysis (MDD with anxious distress or MDD without anxious distress). Rationale: Certain SSRIs/SNRIs (eg, fluvoxamine) can affect CYP3A4 and CYP2C9; hence, all permitted SSRIs/SNRIs are specified. In addition to the strong inhibitors/inducers or dual inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, the list of concomitant medications to be avoided was updated to include moderate inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C 9. 4.1. Inclusion Criteria, 12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and ClassificationsAdded desvenlafaxine, vilazodone, vortioxetine , milnacipran, or levomilnacipran as permitted SSRIs/SNRIs. 4.2. Exclusion Criteria, 8. Prestudy and Concomitant MedicationsUpdated the text of Exclusion Criterion # 7 and the second -to-last bullet in Section 8 to clarify that the use of moderate inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 is exclusionary.

Attachment 2 Modified the table to include examples of moderate inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Added ""fluvoxamine"" under Dual Inhibitors /Inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Rationale : To limit the study enrollment to non -geriatric population. Synopsis, 3.2. Study Design Rationale, 4.1. Inclusion CriteriaIn Inclusion Criterion # 1, the upper age limit was clarified to be less than 65 years (ie, “18 to 64 years” instead of “18 to 65 years”). Rationale : The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I Disorders –Clinical Trials Version (SCID -CT) will be implem ented at screening as this scale, unlike Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 7.0), covers the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5thEdition (DSM -5) specifiers for MDD (ie, anxious distress, mixed features, melancholic features, atypical features, mood-congruent psychotic features, mood incongruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset, seasonal pattern). The SCID Screening Questionnaire (SSQ)interview offers advantages over the SAFER (the acronym SAFER stands for interview’s attention to the following criteria: State versus trait; Assessability; Face validity; Ecological validity; and Rule of three Ps [pervasive, persistent, and pathological]) interview; it can be tailored to the protocol, flag potential exclusionary diagnoses and flag other clinical concerns that may interfere with study participation. Synopsis, Time and Events Schedule, 3.1. Overvie w of Study Design, 3.2. Study Design Rationale, 4.1. Inclusion Criteria, 9.1.2. Screening PhaseInclusion Criterion # 2 w as modified to replace MINI (Version# 7.0) and the SAFER with SCID -CT and SSQ, respe ctively. Rationale: To clarify that the Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ) scale will be administered by investigators. 4.1. Inclusion Criteria Updated the text of Inclusion Criterion # 4 to clarify the inclusion of subjects receiving monotherapy treatment with SSRI/SNRI antidepressants for depressive symptoms. Modified the note in Inclusion Criterion # 4 to “Dose and duration of treatment should be verified by the investigator using the medical or pharmacy records. The investigator w ill use this information to complete the MGH -ATRQ, which will then be corrob orated by the independent rater ”. Rationale : Updated the inclusion criterion for the scre ening and baseline MADRS total scores to be consistent with those reported in the adjunctive treatment MDD trials with currently approved treatments. Synopsis, 3.1. Overview of Study Design, 4.1. Inclusion Criteria, 9.1.2 Screening PhaseInclusion Criterion # 5 was modified to revise the required MADRS total score at screening and baseline visits (ie, ≥25 at screening and ≥20 at baseline) . Rationale : To clarify eligibility of subjects w ith hypothyroidism. 4.2. Exclusion Criteria Exclusion Criterion # 2 was modified to clarify that subjects with known hypothyroidism who have been on stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening are required to have thyroid-stimulating horm one [TSH] and free thyroxine (FT4) obtained. Any subject with an elevated TSH should also have FT4measured. In any case where the TSH value is out of range, but FT4is norm al, the findings should be discussed directly with the medical monitor before the subject is enrolled. If the FT 4value is out of r ange, the subject is not eligible. Synopsis, Time and Events Schedule, Table 4, 9.1.2 Screening Phase, 9.6.

In addition, data support the importance of attenuating sleep disturbance sto attain and sustain remission in MDD , and further suggest that the sleep enhancing effects of OX 2R antagonists may be of benefit to patients with MDD. Clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are limited. In depressed human subjects, average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or exin levels have not been demonstrated to be different from controls, nor to correlate with the severity of depressive illness; however, the diurnal variation of CSF orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in subjects with depression . Data from a single dose study (42847922EDI1002) of JNJ-42847922 in a small number of subjects with MDD showed a trend toward s normalization of morning cortisol levels and a reduction in depressive symptoms. The exploratory efficacy results from a multiple dose study (42847922MDD1001) of JNJ-42847922 in a small number of subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early asDay 11 of exposure) and a clinically relevant antidepressant effect. The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largely related to an effect on the core symptoms of depression and overall unrelated to its effect on sleep -related items. The antidepressant effect was sustained at least 14 days after treatment discontinuation. The present study is being conducted to investigate the antidepressant effects of arange of doses of JNJ-42847922 (versus placebo) , as adjunctive treatment to standard of care,and to further assess the safety and tolerability of JNJ-42847922. The study will utilize the change in theMontgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; the structured interview guide for the MADRS [SIGMA] will be used) total score from baseline to the end of Week 6 for assessment of efficacy. The results of this study will be used to select doses and endp oints in subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 and long-term safety studies. OBJECTIVES , ENDPOINTS, AND HYPOTHESIS Objectives Endpoints Prim ary  To assess the dose-response relationship of up to 3 doses of JNJ-42847922 (20 and 40 mg, with 10 mg potentially added at the interim analysis ) compared to placebo as adjunctive therapy to an antidepressant drug in improving depressive symptoms in subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Change from baseline to the end of Week 6 in the MADRS total score."

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 6-week adaptiv e dose-finding study to assess the efficacy and safety of JNJ-42847922 as adjunctive therapy in adult subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI/SNRI. A pproximately 280 subjects will be randomized . The doses of JNJ-42847922 that will be studied at the start of the study are 20and 40 mg. The doses of JNJ-42847922 to be studied in subjects randomized after the interim analysis will be adaptively chosen based on the dose -response curve observed at the time of the interim analysis . During the interim analysis review period, subjects will continue to be random ized to placebo, JNJ-42847922 20 mg, or JNJ-42847922 40 mgaccording to the initial randomization scheme. Regardless of whether subjects are randomized before or after the interim analysis , the schedule of events and study procedures will remain the same. The final analysis will include all subjects . The data cutoff for the unblinded interim analysis will be 6 weeks afte r randomization of 160 subjects . An Interim Analysis Committee (IAC) will be established to review the interim data to examine the dose- response relationship and determine the doses of JNJ -42847922 and the allocation ratio of the doses to be used after the interim analysis . At the start of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive 1of 3treatments: placebo: JNJ-42847922 20 mg: JNJ-42847922 40 mg. After the interim analysis , subjects will be randomly assigned to receive placebo orone of the JNJ-42847922 doses (potential doses include 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40mg). For all subjects, the study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 4 weeks), a double -blind treatment phase (6 weeks), and a posttreatment follow -up phase (2 weeks). The total study duration for each subject will be up to approxim ately 12 weeks (84 days).Subjects will continue to tak e their baseline SSRI/SNRI antidepressant (at the same dose, without change, and at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study) throughout the screening, double -blind, and follow -up periods (the entire 12weeks of the study duration). In order to collect PK and salivary cortisol samples after the Day 1 dose, subjects will stay at the study site from at least 1hour before the bedtime dosing on Day 1 until the morning of Day 2.The PK and cortisol samples will be collected from most subject s; however, in some circumstances, subjects may not be able to stay overnight on Day 1 for the sample collection. Since the collection of PK and cortisol samples does not relate to the primary assessments of safety and efficacy, an exception to the overnig ht stay and collection of samples (PK and cortisol) may be m ade after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor. The reason for the exception must be documented in the source documents. Subjects who do not stay overnight will take their Day 1 dose at h ome (at bedtime, approximately 3 hours after the last meal). SUBJECT POPULATION The study population will include adult men and women of non-childbearing potential (WO NCBP) (aged 18 to70years ,inclusive) who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5thEdition (DSM -5)diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I Disorders –Clinical Trials Version [SCID -CT]), and who have had an inadequate response to at least 1 butno m ore than 3 antid epressants (administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode , as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH -ATRQ ]).The current depressive episode must be deemed valid by the SCID Screening Questionnaire (SSQ) ,and each potential subject must have MADRS total score ≥25 at screening and must"

These data will be used for population PK analysis of JNJ-42847922, and if necessary, analysis of metabolites M12 and M16. Post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters will be obtained for JNJ-42847922 from population PK modeling (and, if ne eded, for M12 and M16) and may be used in exploratory exposure -response analysis. BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS Saliva samples for the measurement of cortisol concentrations will be collected by using an oral swab method just before bedtime (before dosing) on the night before each visit and upon awakening on the day of the visits during the double -blind treatment phase. In addition, salivary cortisol samples will be collected at the study site at baseline (before study drug administration on Day 1) and prior to each blood sample for PK on Days1, 2, and 8 (note: samples on Days 1 and 2 will only be collected from those subjects participating in the Day 1 overnight stay).If a subject does not participate in the overnight stay on Day 1, then the cortisol samples o n Days 1 and 2 will not be collected."

Biomarkers may be added or deleted based on scientific information or technical innovations under the condition that the total volume of blood collected will not be increased. PHARMACOGENOMIC AND EPIGENETIC (DNA) EVALUATIONS Blood sample sfor genetic research will becollected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study (where local regulations permit) to allow for the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy, safety, or tolerability of JNJ-4284792 2 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD. Subject participation in genetic research is optional. DNA samples collected from Japanese subjects will not be used for research related to MDD. SAFETY EVALUATIONS Safety evaluations will include collection of adverse events and concomitant medications, as well as assessment with physical examination, body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, urine drug screening, alcohol breath test, and clinical l aboratory tests (hematology, chemistry panel, lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c ], thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] [screening only], free thyroxine [FT4, for subjects with known hypothyroidism who have been on stable treatment for at least 3 months prior to screening or for subjects with an elevated TSH] ,and urinalysis) .Pregnancy testing (serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnancy test thereafter) should be performed as needed per the investigator’s judgment. For women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) who enrolled in the study before Amendment 5 and who continue in the trial, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests must be performed at Day 1, Day 22, Day 42 (End -of Treatment/Early Withdrawal), and at the Follow -up Visit to establish absence of pregnancy. In addition, emergence of suicidal ideati on will be assessed using the C-SSRS ;potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by the clinician using the PWC ;and the effect on sexual functioning will be measured by the ASEX. STATISTICAL METHODS Sample Size Determination The calculation of the sample size is based on the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to the end of Week 6 for the MADRS total score). The assumptions for the effect size were based on published literature and the clinically meaningful differe nce between groups to be detected. The total sample size is calculated on the basis of the generalized Multiple Comparison Procedure - Modeling (MCP -Mod) test applied to the placebo and the JNJ -42847922 dose groups at the final analysis. Approximately 280 randomized subjects will provide an averag e weighted power of approximately 85% depending on the underlyi ng true dose-response shape , assuming a 1-sided significance level of 0.05, a treatment difference from placebo of 4.5points in change in MADRS total score, a standard deviation of 10, and a 25% overall dropout rate . The data cutoff for the unblinded interim analysis will be 6 weeks after randomization of 160 subjects, which corresponds to approximately 57% of the sampl e size ofthe study. This number of subjects provides approximately 93% power to detect a dose-response relationship, depending on the underlying true dose-response shape, assuming a treatment difference of 4.5, and a standard deviation of 10 when tested b y means of the MCP -Mod approach at the 30% significance level (1 -sided). Efficacy Analysis The efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects who were randomly assigne d to study drug and received at least 1 d ose of study drug."

For all other analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and for all other efficacy endpoints, no multiplicity adjustment will be done and nominal 1 -sided p -values will be presented. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in MADRS total score from baseline to the end of Week 6. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of the observed data from the placebo and JNJ-42847922 groups will be used as the method of addressing missing data. The final analysis will use the generalized MCP -Mod approach ,which will beapplied towards estimates obtained from the MMRM analysis to establish a dose-response signal and to determine dose(s) to be used in the Phase 3 studies. In conjunction, the comparison between JNJ-42847922 and placebo will also be performed using the appropriate contrasts directly from the MMRM analysis using estimates at the end of Week 6. Any secondary efficacy endpoint which is defined as a change from baseline will be analyzed using the same MMRM as for the primary efficacy endpoint , with the corresponding baseline as a covariate .The secondary endpoint analyses will not be controlled for Type I error and nominal p-values will be presented. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Concentration -time data will be graphically displayed by dose, visit date and time (relative to dose) for JNJ-42847922, M12, and M16 and summarized using descriptive s tatistics. A population PK analysis using PK data from a selection of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be performed at the completion of the study andat the interim analysis . Using actual sampling and dosing times, concentration -time data will be analyzed using population PK modeling. Post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters (ie, area under the concentration -time curve [AUC] and, if allowed by the data, maximum drug concentration [Cmax]) will be obtained for JNJ-42847922 from population PK modeling, and if necessary ,for M12 and M16. As part of the population PK modeling, the effect of intrinsic (eg, age, gender, body weight) and extrinsic factors (eg, concomitant medications ) affecting the PK of JNJ -42847922 may be evaluated i f needed . Individual predicted plasma concentration -time profiles and/or post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters for JNJ-42847922 and, if necessary, for M12 and M16 may be used for exploratory exposure -response modeling for safety and efficacy endpoin ts. Biomarker Analysis Cortisol levels will be tabulated for each time point and summary statistics will be calculated. Posttreatment changes in cortisol levels will be assessed by treatment group. Analysis of variance (ANOVA )and t-test will be used to assess differences across groups and time points. Correlations between cortisol levels and clinical endpoints will be evaluated. The additional exploratory biomarkers will be tabulated by treatment and summary statistics will be calculated. Posttreatment changes in exploratory biomarkers will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between baseline biomarker levels and clinical endpoints may be explored. Pharmacogenomic Analysis Individual predicted post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters will be used in exploratory exposure -genetic variant modeling, as appropriate . Safety Analyses Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set which consists of all subjects who were randomly assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of stud y drug.

Subjects with abnormal findings in physical examination and ECG will be listed. Changes in body weight and waist circumference will be summarized descriptively. Results from the C-SSRS, PWC, and ASEX will be tabulated by treatment . Interim Analysis The primary purpose of the interim analysis will be to examine the dose-response relationship, to determine the doses of JNJ-42847922 and the allocation ratio to be used after the interim analysis . The IAC will review the outputs from statistical analysis, exposure, exposure -response analysis, and safety for this determination. The interim analysis will use the generalized MCP -Mod approach to establish a dose-response signal with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint. A 1-sided 0.30significance level will be used to test for dose-response using the MCP -Mod approach on the change in MADRS total score to the e nd of Week 6 . Unblinded exposure -response analyses will be performed by an independent internal pharmacometrician using data available at the interim analysis, with adequate firewalls so the study team will remain blinded.

INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common ,serious, recurrent disorder, with worldwide lifetime prevalence estimates ranging from 1% in the Czech Republic to 17% in the United States (US) . Its negative impact on role functioning in various settings (eg,school performance, marriage, parenting, and the workplace), quality of life, physical health, and life expectancy has been well-documented. Loss of work production and absenteeism due to major depressive episodes or MDD hasbeen estimated to account for approximately 30 to 50billion dollars in annual human capital .26In fact, as of October 2015, and with an estimated 350million sufferers, depression has been ranked by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of disability worldwide ,and the prevalence is rising .63MDD is associated with significant comorbid medical conditions which include diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease ,and there is an increased risk of earl y mortality in patients with MDD .26 Insomnia or hypersomnia is 1 of 9 diagnostic symptoms of MDD , according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5thEdition (DSM -5)criteria, with sleep disorders being one of the most common presenting symptoms of depression. Furthermore, noting an approximate 40-fold increase in the risk of MDD among patients with chronic insomnia ,16 Johnson and colleagues sought to evaluate the direction of that risk association, and determined that chronic insomnia may be prodromal to MDD .25Recently , insomnia has also been determined to play a role in the increasing prevalence of obesit y and diabetes , which are common comorbid conditions in patients with MDD .27Ongoing sleep problems may contribute to the persistence of depressive episodes or may be a residual symptom of a current depressive episode, despite depressive sy mptoms having responded to treatment .29,43,60Additionally , chronic insomnia is known to increase the risk of depression relapse . Insomnia also has a strong association with anxiety , and anxiety is a prominent comorbid condition in patients with MDD .41 In patients with depression with or without anxious distress, ruminative responses are common ,37 and a common feature in these conditions is a state of hy perarousal .18 Preliminary data on JNJ-42847922 (seltorexant) suggest that there may be unique additional benefits over conventional antidepressants alone with respect to attenuating sleep disturbances, of MDD .JNJ-42847922 is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin -2 receptor (OX2R , negative log of inhibition constant [pKi]=8 ) that is being developed for the treatment of insomnia and MDD . Orexins promote arousal (wakefulness) and are hypothesized to play a role in excessive arousal (eg, excessive rumination) which occurs in subsets of patients with mood disorders. OX2R antagonists may normalize excessive arousal. This is hypothesized to have clinical utility in the treatment of such subsets of patients with MDD . In addition to its potential role in modulating autonomic arousal and hypothalamic -pituitary - adrenal (HPA )axis hyperactivit y, the sleep enhancing effects of a selective OX2R antagonist such as JNJ -42847922 are expected to confer benefit in MDD. Support for a role of orexin receptors, particularly the OX2R, in modulating depressive -like behaviors has been derived from preclinical studies. Chronic unpredictable stress increases CCI CCI"

Also, intra-cerebroventricular injection of a selective OX2R antagonist was shown to attenuate an orexin -induced increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone levels in rats.50Finally, studies using selective orexin antagonists and genetic knockout mice showed that administration of selective OX2R antagonists, but not selective orexin -1 receptor (OX1R)antagonists ,reduced stress -induced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH )release in rodents (Janssen R & D, unpublished data). Interestingly , sub-chronic corticosterone administration elicits a depressive behavioral phenoty pe and increases orexin immunoreac tivity in the lateral hypothalamic area in mice.23Nevertheless, a small increase in depression -like behaviors was measured in mice that did not express the OX2R.52In summary , alterations in the HPA axis, a common finding associated with clinical depression, may be linked to the orexin sy stem. Berridge and colleagues proposed that orexin “may participate in behavioral responding under high-arousal aversive conditions”.3Such a behavioral response consists of both central and peripheral components. While this proposition does not shed further light on the receptor subty pe(s) involved in these responses, various studies suggest that OX2Rs are involved not only in wake regu lation but, additionally , in autonomic arousal.7For example, chronic stress increases heart rate and blood pressure in rats. Both OX2R and OX1R antagonists significantl y attenuate stress -induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure.64Similarly , novelty -induced blood pressure increases (but not heart rate increases )were attenuated by an OX2R antagonist.2 Therefore, an OX2R antagonist such as JNJ-42847922 is hypothesized to modulate the physiological components of hyperarousal associated with heightened stress -responsiveness, a characteristic of patients with depression . Clinical data in support of a role for orexin in depression are limited. In depressed human subjects, average cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) orexin levels have not been demonstrated to be different from controls, nor to correlate with theseverit y of depressive illness,49,51however, the diurnal variation of CSF orexin levels has been shown to be blunted in subjects with depression .49Data from a single dose study (42847922EDI1002) of JNJ-42847922 in a small number of subjects with MDD showed a trend towar dsnormalization of morning cortisol levels and a reduction in depressive symptoms. The exploratory efficacy results from a multiple dose study (42847922MDD1001) of JNJ-42847922 in a small number of subjects with MDD showed an early onset (as early as Day 11 of exposure) and a clinically relevant antidepressant effect. The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largely related to an effect on the core symptoms of depression and overall unrelated to its effect on sleep related items.

Background 1.1.1. Nonclinical Studie s Nonclinical Pharmacology Single and multiple dose studies in rats at various doses demonstrated that JNJ-42847922 reduced latency to non -rapid ey e movement (NREM) sleep, increased NREM sleep duration, and did not impact rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The reduced sleep onset and increased sleep duration were maintained upon 7 -day repeated dosing . Unlike DORAs, the physiologic NREM/REM sleep ratio is preserved with JNJ-42847922 . A single oral dose of JNJ-42847922 (30 mg/kg) hadno effect on motor coordination (Rotarod performance test) at sleep inducing doses, in contrast with zolpidem (gold standard for treating insomnia). In addition, the same dose of JNJ -42847922 co- administered with alcohol did not modify the ataxic effects of alcohol.

S ignificantly higher Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) scores (reflecting greater sleepiness) were observed for activel y treated subjects relative to placebo for all daytime cohorts at the first postdose time point of 2 hours. No significant treatment effects were observed at later time points. In studi es 42847922EDI1002 (subjects with MDD) and 42847922EDI1003 (healthy subjects), no differences were found between JNJ-42847922 and placebo in task performance and subject measures of alertness, suggesting that the risk for next- day residual effects is minimal. All subjects reported normal responses for suicidal ideation/behavior at baseline and at all post-baseline assessments as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS) in study 42847922EDI1003. One subject reported a suicidal ideation adverse event after administration of 20- mg JNJ-49847922 in Study 42847922EDI1002; this event was deemed mild in intensity and not related to treatment. Suicidal ideation was also reported predose and considered as a part of the underl ying condition (MDD ). JNJ-42847922 showed a significant reduction in latency to persistent sleep (L PS) versus placebo , as measured by PSG in subjects with MDD (42847922EDI1002) . The total sleep time (TST) was significantl y longer in all of the JNJ-42847922 dose groups than inthe placebo group. Sleep efficiency was also significantly improved in subjects with MDD who were treated with JNJ-42847922 compared with placebo.

In the multiple dose study in subjects with MDD ( 42847922MDD1001 ),a larger improvement in clinician -rated depression symptoms (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , 17 items [HAM-D17 ] total and adjusted total scores and 6-item subscale from the HAM-D17 [HAM -D6])was observed in subjects randomized to treatment with JNJ-42847922 compared with placebo and diphenhydramine (HAM-D17 adjusted scores were calculated by summing the item scores excluding the 3 insomnia questions ie, 4-Insomnia Early, 5-Insomnia Middle and6-Insomnia Late. The 6 items in the HAM -D6were : depressed mood, guilt feelings, work and interests, psychomotor retardation, psychic anxiety , and general somatics [ tiredness and pains]) . The assessment for symptoms of depression showed that self-rated symptoms (QIDS-SR16) of depression followed the same overall trend as clinician -rated symptoms. However, a larger placebo effect was measure d, especially in women of childbearing potential (WOCBP). In this study , the effect of JNJ-42847922 was largel y relate d to an effect on the core symptoms of depression and overall unrelated to its effect on sleep related items.

In thesingle dose drug-interaction study with rabeprazole (42847922EDI1006 ),the most frequentl y reported TEAE (≥2subjects) by preferred term was fatigue (7subjects [43.8%]) with all other TEAEs being reported as single incidents. In healthy Japanese male subjects (428479 22ISM1002 ), a single dose of JNJ -42847922 ( 5, 20, or 40mg) was observed to be safe and well tolerated with no new safety findings of clinical concern. In subjects with MDD receiving single doses of JNJ-42847922 (42847922EDI1002), the most common TEAEs during the double -blind phase were headache, dizziness, somnolence, disturbance in attention, hy poesthesia, nausea, feeling hot, and nasophary ngitis. In subjects with MDD receiving multiple doses of JNJ-42847922 (20 mg) or placebo (42847922MDD1001), the most common TEAEs in WOCBP dosed over 10 days were influenza, nasophary ngitis, fatigue, insomnia, nightmare, and headache ; in the JNJ-42847922 treatment arm (n=10) ,no TEAE was reported by more than 1 subject. For men and women of non-childbearing potential who were dosed over 28 days, the most common TEAEs were headache, dizziness, somnolence, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, nasophary ngitis ,and fatigue ; the most common TEAE in the JNJ-42847922 treatment group was somnolence (3[25%] of 12 subjects in the JNJ-42847922 group, 0 of 6 subjects in the placebo group, and 0of 7 subjects in the diphenhy dramine group). In subjects with insomnia disorder without psychiatric comorbidity (42847922I SM2002), the most common TEAEs during the double -blind phase were headache and somnolence. There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported in subjects dosed with JNJ-42847922. There were no clinically significant, consistent, treatment -related effects in clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemist ry, coagulation profile and urinalysis); neurologic and physical examinations; vital signs; or electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements.

Thus, somnolence is an expected ADR. Among these events of somnolence were events of “next day”somnolence that occurred 6 to 12 hours after the evening dose in 7subjects from Studies 42847922ISM2002 (3 subjects) and 42847922MDD1001 (4subjects). Refer to the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure for additional details on the adverse events seen in studies with JNJ -42847922 conducted thus far. 1.2. Overall Rationale for the Study MDD is characterized by low mood, anhedonia, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, low energy , and other emotional and physical symptoms. In severe cases, MDD can result in suicide. Effective treatment of patients with MDD not responding adequatel y to first-line antidepressant treatment (ADT) remains an important unmet need. Partial response to pharmacologic treatment is common. In the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) -sponsored Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, only 28% of subjects achieved remission (defined as a score of ≤7 on the HAM -D17) during first-line treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) .46For inadequate response to an optimized trial of first-line ADT, current guidelines recommend switching the ADT, adding a second ADT or adding adjunctive therap y with a non-ADT.8,42,57Adjunctive second generation antipsy chotic therapies such as olanzapine, quetiapine ,and aripiprazole are associated with significant improvements in treatment response and remission; however , their side effect profile may limit use in clinical practice.57Thus, there is ongoing interest in identify ing adjunctive strategies that offer better efficacy and tolerability . Preclinical evidence supports a role for the orexin system in modulating the HPA -axis and stress -responsiveness , critical component sof the pathoph ysiology of depression. In addition, data support the importance of attenuat ingsleep disturbance sto attain and sustain remission in MDD ,and further suggest that the sleep enhancing effects of OX2R antagonists may be of benefit to patients with MDD. At present, about two-thirds of patients with depression take sleep medications in addition to their antidepressant regimen. The drugs prescribed for this purpose include benzodiazepines, atypical antipsy chotics, trazodone, antihistamines, non-benzodiazepine sleep agents such as zolpidem, as well as non -prescri ption sleep aids. Some of the most common side effects of these medications include cognitive impairment, risk of dependence and abuse, risk of respiratory depression, dependence in association with alcohol use and/or sleep apnea, next day sedation, and weight gain. Whereas some of the drugs used to treat insomnia in MDD have intrinsic antidepressant effects (eg, trazodone, tricyclic antidepressants) , the doses used to relieve insomnia s ymptoms are usually lower than ty pical antidepressant doses and their u se does not alway s help to improve depressive symptoms. Hypnotics have also shown inconsistent effects on depressive symptoms when used adjunctively with antidepressants in patients with MDD. For example, whereas no improvement in depressive symptoms was measured after 8weeks of treatment with zolpidem in combination with escitalopram,13a small but significant effect was observed after treatment with eszopiclone in combination with fluoxetine.14In these studies, depressed subjects with sleep problems were included, but subjects were not selec ted for a history of failure to respond to antidepressant drug therapy ."
50,page_50,"JNJ-42847922 (Seltorexant/Selective Orexin -2 Receptor Antagonist) Clinical Protocol 42847922MDD2001 Amendment 5 51 Status: Approved , Date: 24 April 2018 The present study is being conducted to investigate the antidepressant effects of arange of doses of JNJ-42847922 (versus placebo) , as adjunctive treatment to standard of care, and to further assess the safet y and tolerability of JNJ-42847922. The study will utilize the change in the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; the structured interview guide for the MADRS [SIGMA] will be used) total score from baseline to the end of Week 6 for assessment of efficacy . The results of this study will be used to select doses and endpoints in subsequent confirmatory Phase 3 and long -term safet y studies. 1.3. Overall Risk and Benefit A ssessment As further described in Section 1and the rationale for this study (Section 1.2), MDD is a common, serious, recurrent mental disorder. MDD is the leading cause of disability , and its prevalence is rising.63 Current therapies commonly used as first-line ADT in patients with MDD (eg, SSRI s and SNRI s) are sub-optimally effective in some patients who require adjunctive treatment, or who are otherwise poorly compliant because of their associated adverse events, such as weight gain and sexual side effects. Currently approved adjunctive treatments are limited to the atypical antipsychotic drug class, which also present considerable tolerability concerns (eg, metabolic syndrome , akathisia, and extrapy ramidal symptoms [EPS]). The orexin -receptor antagonist class offers a novel mechanism of action that may prove to be a valuable alternative in the adjunctive treatment of MDD, but without the side effects observed with other medications commonly used in this setting such as weig ht gain, sexual side effects, akathisia, or EPS. The preliminary data regarding effects on cortisol and stress -response suggest that JNJ-42847922 may have clear advantages over the standard of care in patients with certain co-morbid medical conditions typically associated with dy sregulation of the HPA axis. The currently available data (see Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studie s, and the JNJ-42847922 Investigator’s Brochure22) support this clinical study thatinvestigates the efficacy and safet y of JNJ-42847922 in adult subjects with MDD who have responded inadequately to commonly used ADT s. The antidepressant effect of JNJ -42847922 was clinically relevant as earl y as Day 11 of exposure and was sustained at least 14days after treatment discontinuation. The effect of JNJ-42847922 was largel y related to an effect on the core symptoms of depression, and overall unrelated to its effect on sleep related events. Additionally , the safet y and tolerability data so far accumulated for JNJ-42847922 in both healthy subjects and subjects with MDD and/orinsomnia were generally acceptable based ona thorough review of the safet y information from completed clinical studies. No death or SAEs were reported after subjects received JNJ-42847922. The most commonly reported TEAEs were somnolence, headache, and dizziness with most TEAEs being mild or moderate in intensity . Adverse drug reactions attributed to JNJ-42847922 were sleep paral ysis, somnolence, and abno rmal dreams. Few subjects reported these events at doses planned for this study and all were CCI"

Based on the short half-life of JNJ-42847922 ,no accumula tion of study drug is expected. (Refer to Section 1.1.2 , Clinical Studies , and the JNJ-42847922 I nvestigator’s Brochure22for additional details) . To ensure safe use of the study drug, besides routine safety monitoring and subject management, this protocol also includes specific risk mitigation strategies , including: exclusion of WOCBP , since a female rat fertility study suggested that JNJ -42847922 reduced female fertility rates at all doses studied (however , WOCBP subjects who are currentl y enrolled in this study may continue study participation following discu ssion between the subject and the investigator of the new rat fertility study results ,if they have a negative pregnancy test,and are using reliable contraception). Other risk mitigation strategies include: restrictions on driving, operating machinery , orengaging in hazardous activity when subjects have had less than 6 hours sleep the night before (Section 4.3,Prohibition and Restrictions); overnight in-house observation of subje cts at study sites after the first dose administration of study drug (see Time and Events Schedule ); pay ing special attention to clinicall y significant adverse events that are known to have been reported in drugs of the same pharmacological class (Section 9.6, Safet y Evaluation s/Adverse Events of Special Interest); and reducing suicidality risk inherent in the underly ing depression by excluding high risk subjects (Section 4.2, Exclusion Criteria) and performing C -SSRS at every site visit (Section 9.6, Safety Evaluations /C-SSRS). The information obtained to date regarding JNJ-42847922 suggests that the potential benefits to patients with MDD in fulfilling an unmet medical need outweigh the identified (ie, ADRs) and potential risks (see Adverse Events of Special Interest in Section 9.6, Safety Evaluations ) at the doses selected for further investigation. 2.

Hypothesis The hypothesis for this study is that adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 is superior to placebo in treating depressive symptoms, as measured by change in MADRS total score from baseline to the end of 6weeks, and exhibits a dose-response relationship, in adult subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to treatment with an SSRI /SNRI . 3. STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE 3.1. Overview of Study Design This is a multicenter, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo -controlled, 6-week adaptive dose-finding study to assess the efficacy and safet y of JNJ-42847922 as adjunctive therap y in adult subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI /SNRI.Approximately 280 subjects will be randomized . The doses of JNJ-42847922 that will be studied prior to the interim analy sisare known (ie, 20and 40 mg), whereas the doses of JNJ-42847922 to be studied after the interim analy sis will be adaptivel y chosen based on the dose-response curve observed at the interim analy sis.During the interim analy sisreview period, subjects will continue to be randomized , according to the initial randomization scheme. Regardless of whether subjects are randomized before or after the interim analy sis, the schedule of events and study procedures will remain the same. The final analysis will include all subjects. Initiall y, the study will assess the efficacy , dose-and exposure -response relationship, safet y, and tolerability of JNJ-42847922 20and 40 mg doses compared to placebo, when administered as adjunctive therapy to an SSRI /SNRI antidepressant. At the start of the study , subjects will be randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio toreceive 1 of 3treatments: placebo: JNJ-4284 7922 20 mg: JNJ-42847922 40 mg. The data cutoff for the unblinded interim analysis will be 6 weeks after randomization of 160subjects . An Interim Anal ysis Committee (IAC) will be established to review the interim data to examine the dose -response relation ship and determine the doses of JNJ -42847922 and the allocation ratio of the doses to be used after the interim analysis. See Section 11.8 for additional details on interim analy sis. After the interim analysis, subjects will be randomly assigned to study drug(placebo or one of the JNJ-42847922 doses [potential doses include 10mg, 20 mg, 40mg]) , with the allocation ratio adapted according to the dose -response curve seen at the interim analy sis."

Figure 1: Schematic Overview of the Study Design Abbreviations: IA=interim analysis, MDD=m ajor depressive disorder, PK=pharmacokinetics, QD=once daily, SSRI= selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SNRI= serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. For all subjects, the study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 4 weeks), a double - blind treatment phase (6 weeks), and a posttreatment follow -up phase (2 weeks). Subjects will continue to take their baseline SSRI /SNRI antidepressant (at the same dose, without change, and at approximately the same time as prior to entering the study ) throughout the screening, double -blind, and follow -up periods (the entire 12 weeks of the stud y dur ation). In order to collect PK and salivary cortisol samples after the Day 1 dose, subjects will stay at the study site from at least 1hour before the bedtime dosing on Day 1 untilthe morning of Day 2. The PK and cortisol samples will be collected from most subjects; however, in some circumstances, subjects may not be able to stay overnight on Day 1 for the sample collection. Since the collection of PK and cortisol samples does not relate to the primary assessments of safet y and efficacy , an exception tothe overnight stay and collection of samples (PK and cortisol) may be made after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor. The reason for the exception must be documented in the source documents. Subjects who do not stay overnight will take their Day 1 dose at home (at bedtime, approximately 3 hours after the last meal)."

In order to be eligible for the study , subjects must meet the following criteria: DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 Axis I Disorders – Clinical Trials Version (SCI D-CT). The current depressive episode must be deemed valid by the SCID Screening Questionnaire (SSQ) . MADRS total score ≥25 at screening and must not demonstrate a clinically signi ficant improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their MADRS total score) from the screening to baseline visit . Inadequate response to at least 1 but no more than 3 antidepressant s, administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression ,as assessed by the Massachusetts General Hospital -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH -ATRQ). See Section 9.1.2 , Screen ing Phase, for additional details on screening procedures. Double -Blind Treatment Phase As mentioned above, at the start ofthe study , subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1:1ratio to receive 1 of 3treatments: placebo: JNJ-42847922 20 mg: JNJ-428479 22 40mg.

All other study procedures during the double -blind treatment phase will remain the same for subjects randomized either before or after the interim analy sis, and will occur as per the Time and Events Schedule. On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, the assigned study drug (blinded placebo or JNJ-42847922) will be administered at the study site(at bedtime , approximately 3 hours after the last meal ),and PK and salivary cortisol samples will be collected atthe study sitein subjects participating in the overnight stay.For the remainder of the study (from Day 2 to Day 41), the assigned study drug will be self-administered by the subject at home at bedtime , approximately 3hours after the last meal . For subjects who don’t participate in the overnight stay on Day 1, the study drug will be self-administered at home throughout the double -blind treatment phase (from Day 1 to Day 41 [once daily at bedtime, approximately 3hours after the last meal ]).

During this call, the PWC will be administered and information on adverse events and concomitant medications will be collected. In addition, all subjects will complete a follow -up visit within 7 to 14 days after completion of the double -blind phase . If a subject discontinues study treatment before the end of Week 6, end-of-treatment and follow -up assessments should be ob tained. The total study duration for each subject will be up to approximately 12 weeks (84 days). The study will be considered completed after the final study visit for the last subject participating in the study . See Section 9.1.4 , Posttreatment Phase (Follow -up)for additional details . Study Evaluations The efficacy of study drug will be evaluated using the MADRS (SIGMA version) , HAM -A (SIGH-A version) , CGI-S,SDS, PHQ -9,SHAPS, PROMI S-SD(Short Form) , PROMI S-Fatigue (Short Form) , PGI-S, EQ-5D-5L, and WLQ(Short Form) . These evaluations will be performed at the time points specified in the Time and Events Schedule. The Ruminative Respon se Scale (RRS) will be collected at baseline only, and will be evaluated as a potential predictor of treatment outcome. The safet y and tolerability of the study drug will be evaluated throughout the study . In addition to standard/routine assessment s, the safety assessment in this study will include theASEX, C-SSRS, and PWC. Blood samples for PK and biomarker evaluation will be collected on the study visits specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Evening and morning salivary cortisol samples will be collected asspecified in the Time and Events Schedule. Blood sample sfor genetic research will be collected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study (where local regulations permit) to allow for the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safety , or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD .Subject participation in geneti c research is optional. DNA samples collected from Japanese subjects will only be used forresearch related to JNJ-42847922 and will not be used for research related to MDD. 3.2. Study Design Rationale Study Population In the context of mood disorders, sleep di sturbances (both insomnia and hypersomnia) have been associated with a suboptimal response to antidepressant drug therapy , an increased risk for relapse (in antidepressant -responsive patients), and prodromal depression.4,5,24,25,59While the"

It is proposed that in many patients a cycle exists that involves rumination/dy sphoric arousal leading to sleep problems, thereb y perpetuating/exacerbating a depressive episode.37Therefore, OX2 R antagonis ts, such as JNJ-42847922 may have clinical efficacy in the treatment of MDD, particularl y in patients with such symptoms, and especially as an adjunctive therapy to conventional antidepressant drug therap y. The study population will include adult men and WONCBP (aged18 to 70years,inclusive )who meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for MDD (confirmed by the SCID-CT),15and who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI /SNRI (administered at an adequate dose and duration in the current episode) .The diagnosis of MDD will bevalidated by the SSQ. The SSQ criteria identify subjects who, despite meeting DSM criteria, would be poor candidates for drug trials and whose exclusion from the study may increase the likelihood of separation between novel antidepressant treatments and placebo. Unlike many other mental disorders, the age of onset of depression has a wide range, with a median onset of early to mid-20s, although significant proportions of patients may experience onset between late adolescence to late adulthood. Hence, the age of the study population in this protocol is intention ally broad. Women have a two-fold increased risk of depression over men, and separation and divorce are additional risk factors across the sexes .26 Definitive GLP studies in pregnant rats and rabbits to evaluate the effects of JNJ-42847922 on embry o-fetal development have been completed .JNJ-42847922 did not induce any developmental alterations (external, visceral ,and skeletal) in the fetuses. Howev er, a female rat fertility study suggested a reduction in female fertility . Since it is not known what the relevance of these findings are to a woman’s ability to become pregnant after taking JNJ-42847922 , no new WOCBP will be included in this study until more is learned about the effect of JNJ-42847922 on female reproduction. WOCBP subjects, who are currently enrolled in this study , may continue study participation following discussion between the subject and the investigator of the new rat fertility study results ,if they have a negative pregnancy test,and are using reliable contraception . Blinding, Control, and Treatment Groups A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic andbaseline characteristics) are evenl y balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinica l endpoints."

Adaptive Design and Interim Analysis An adaptive design will beused in order to better characterize the shape of the dose-response curve. At the start of study enrollment, subjects will be randoml y assigned in a 2:1:1ratio to receive 1 of 3treatments : placebo: JNJ-42847922 20 mg: JNJ-42847922 40mg. The doses of JNJ-42847922 to be studied and allocation ratio after the interim analy sis will be adaptivel y chosen based on the dose-response relationship established at the time of the interim analysis (potential doses of JNJ -42847922 include 10 mg, 20 mg,40mg). The primary purpose of the interim analy sis will be to determine the doses of JNJ-42847922 to be used after the interim analysisand the allocation ratio of these doses to be used insubjects randomized after the interim analysis. The interim analy sis will use the generalized Multiple Comparison Procedure -Modeling (MCP -Mod )approach to establish a dose-response signal with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint. Dose and Dose Administration Interval The JNJ-42847922 doses selected at the start of the study are 20and 40 mg, and the JNJ-42847922 doses selected after the interim analy sis are one or more of the following potential doses :10mg, 20, and/or 40mg. The doses chosen are within the range shown to be well-tolerated in the Phase 1 studies . Additionally , in study 42847922MDD1001 , a clinically relevant antidepressant effect was shown after daily administrations of the 20 mg dose in the evening (for 10days in WOCBP and 28 days in women of non-childbearing potential and men) . There was also a suggestion of efficacy and a reduction in morning cortisol levels in the 42847922 EDI1002 study ,in which single doses of 10 to 40mg were studied . The present study will begin with the JNJ-42847922 20and 40 mg doses in order to obtain preliminary information regarding the dose-response curve. An interim analysiswill then be performed to optimize allocation up to a total of 3possible active dose levels inthe study after interim analy sis,in order to fully characterize the shape of the dose -response curve. The proposed dose range for this study (10mg up to 40 mg)was selected based on anticipated efficacious dose levels, plasma exposures in relation to the NOAEL in GLP toxicology studies, the clinica l safet y and tolerability profile, and anticipated plasma exposures across the selected dose levels."

Treatment with JNJ-42847922 showed a trend towards a decrease in depressive symptoms compared to placebo, asmeasured by the QIDS-SR14. The largest mean change from Day 1 t o Day 2 i n the QIDS-SR14total score was observed in the 40-mg JNJ-42847922 treatment group (-2.1 points). Mean changes in the 10-and 20-mg JNJ-42847922 treatment groups were similar in magnitude (-1.4 and -1.3 points, respectively ). The smallest mean change was observed in the placebo group (-0.7 points). In study 42847922MDD1001, subjects with moderate to severe MDD who were either antidepressant naive or being treated with a maximum of 2 concurrent antidepressants were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (JNJ-42847922 20 mg, diphenhy dramine 25 mg, or placebo) in a ratio of 2:1:1. All doses were administered at nighttime. The double -blind treatment period was a maxim um 10 days for WOCBP and 28days for all other subjects. Overall, a larger improvement in clinician -rated depressi on symptoms was observed from subjects randomized to treatment with JNJ-42847922 compared with placebo and diphenhy dramine. The observed change in the HAM-D17 scores in the JNJ-42847922 treatment group was not related to a preferential effect of JNJ-428479 22 on sleep items, but to an improvement in the core symptoms of depression. In both studies, the doses of JNJ -42847922 were well tolerated in the target population. While there were no reports of severe somnolence reported in subjects exposed to JNJ-42847 922, 1 subject receiving 60 mg morning dose in Study 42847922EDI1003 was reported to have insomnia and somnolence on Day 3 and Day 4 and was discontinued from the study due to the events on Day 5. Based on the apparent dose-limiting tolerability , 40mg was selected as the upper dose limit in this study to evaluate the efficacy of JNJ-42847922 in the adjunctive treatment of MDD. The doses of JNJ-42847922 to be studied after the interim analysis will be adaptivel y chosen based on the dose-response relationshi p established at the time of the interim analy sis. The lowest potential dose of JNJ -42847922 in this study is 10 mg. It is considered unlikely that doses lower than 10 mg will be clinically effective. Therefore, a dose range of 10 to 40 mg was selected forthis study in order to preserve a good safet y ratio relative to GLP toxicology exposures and to maximize the chance of observing an efficacy effect. DNA and Biomarker Collection It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to interindividual differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes and may help to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to a drug. The goal of the pharmacogenomic component is to collect DNA to allow the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic f actors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safety , or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with CCI"

Specifically , genetic and epigenetic changes in genes known to be in pathway s relevant to depressio n (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, circadian rh ythm) will be evaluated. Increasingl y, it is recognized that psychiatric disorders may be associated with altered immune/metabolic activation patterns. Blood and saliva samples will be collected to explore biomarkers related to immune system activity , HPA axis activation, and neurotropic factors (including but not limited to growth factors, inflammation, or endocrine markers). Many of these factors may be influenced by stage of menstrual cycle in women; therefore menstrual cycle will be tracked in premenopausal women during the study , by the subject’s verbal report. Biomarker samples may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes or identify population subgroups that respond differently to JNJ -42847922. DNA and biomarker samples may be used to help address emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimately individualized therapies. Efficacy Measures Primary Efficacy Measure MADRS: The 10-item clinician -administered MADRS was designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure the overall severit y of depressive symptoms.35The MAD RS scale has been selected as a primary endpoint for this study because it is validated, reliable, and acceptable to regulatory health authorities as a primary scale to determine efficacy in major depression. The structure intervi ew guide version (SIGMA) will be used in this study . The SIGMA has been shown to achieve high reliability of MADRS scores in evaluating patients with depression.61 Secondary Efficacy Measures HAM -A:The original 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the severit y of different anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonly used, validated scale in clinical trials assessing anxiety .20,21However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration and clear anchor points for the assignment of severity ratings . For this reason, the structured interview guide (SIGH -A)version will be used in this study . The SIGH-A has been shown to have high inter -rater and test -retest reliability and produced similar but consistently higher (+4.2) scores compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measure of overall anxiety has also been shown to be high.62 SDS: The SDS has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated d isability .30,54 PROMIS -SDand PROMIS -Fatigue : Thesemeasure swere developed using state of the art psychometric techniques such as Item Response Theory Models and havebeen shown to adequatel y represent sleep disturbance and fatigue domains.

Its content validity has been established through condition -specific focus groups and its measurement properties are documented as strong.31,32,33 A short form version consisting of 8 items will be used in this study . RRS: TheRRS will be collected at baseline only, and will be evaluated as a potential predictor of treatment outcome.37 For additional details on efficacy measures, see Section 9.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessments A population PK analysis using PK data from a selection of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be performed at the completion of the study andat the interim analysis. The purpose of the planned population PK analy sis will be to assess the PK of JNJ-42847922 (and, if needed, of metabolites M12 and M16) in the target patient population, and the poten tial impact ofcovariates . PK collection will also enable the evaluation ofthe relationship between parent drug concentration and metabolites M12 and M16 , and the exploration of the correlation of exposure to efficacy or safet ymeasures . These analy ses wi ll be helpful in identify ing optim aldoses and dosing regimens to evaluate in subsequent studies. Safety Evaluations Standard safet y evaluations including collection of adverse event s and concomitant medications, physical examination, body weight, waist circumference, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, urine drug screening, alcohol breath test, and clinical laboratory tests will be performed to monitor subject safet y throughout the study .Pregnancy testing (serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnan cy test thereafter) should be performed as needed per the investigator’s judgment. For WOCBP ,who enrolled in the study before Amendment 5 and who continue in the trial, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests must be performed at Day 1, Day 22, Day 42 (End -of Treatment/Early Withdrawal), and at the Follow -up Visit to establish absence of pregnancy ."

The ASEX has shown satisfactory reliability and validity .34 In addition, potential withdrawal effects will be assessed by the clinician using the PWC. The PWC is a reliable and sens itive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation sy mptoms .47 Adverse Events of Special Interest Prior studies with DORAs (eg, suvorexant) sugg est that such agents may precipitate cataplex y (sudden, transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by conscious awareness) and sleep paral ysis (the experience of not being able to move, react, or speak when falling asleep/awakening). Animal studies suggest that cataplex y may be a liability for DORAs, but not for OX2R -selective antagonists .9To date, 3 cases of sleep paral ysis have been observed with JNJ-42847922: 1 each from studies 42847922EDI1001 (80 mg dose) ,42847922EDI1006 (20 mg dose), and 42847922I SM2002 (40 mg dose) .

TREA TMENT ALLOCA TION AND BLINDING Treat ment Allocation Procedures for Ran domization and Stratification Central randomization will be implemented in this study . Subjects will be randomly assigned based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the sponsor. At the start of study enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1:1ratio to receive 1of 3treatments: placebo: JNJ-42847922 20 mg: JNJ-42847922 40mg. After the interim analysis, subjects will be randomly assigned to study drug, with the allocation ratio adapted according to the dose-response curve observed at the time of the interim analysis. Subjects will be assigned to receive placebo orone of the JNJ-42847922 doses (potential doses include 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg). The randomization will be balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and will be stratified by region (US, EU, and Japan) and by insomnia status (significant insomnia symptoms [ISI score ≥15]1at baseline versus no significant insomnia symptoms [ISI score <15]at baseline ).In order torandomize approximately equal proportions of subjects with and without significant insomnia symptoms at baseline, the number randomized in either stratum will be capped at 60% of the planned total sample size . The interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study drug kit for the subject. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS, and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely identify the subject. Blinding To maintain the study blind, the study drug container will have a label containing the study name, study drug number, and reference number. The label will not identify the study drug in the container. However, if it is necessary for a subject's safet y, the study blind may be broken and the identity of the study drug ascertained. The study drugnumber will be entered in the case report form (CRF) when the study drug is dispensed. The study drugs will be identical in appearance and will be packaged in identical containers. The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment (ie, study drug concentrations ,study drug preparation/accountability data, treatment allocation, and biomarker or other specific laboratory data)will be handled with special care to ensure that the integrit y of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions,"

In particular, data regarding cortisol and other biomarkers will not be made available to the investigational team and the sponsor study team until after the database lock. Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing the treatment status of the subject. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the treatment by contacting the IWRS.It is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24hours per day, 7days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF, and in the source document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner. Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded are required to return for end-of-treatment /follow -up visits . In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed and the clinical database is closed. However, for the interim analysis, the randomization codes and, if required, the translation of randomization codes into treatment and control groups will be disclosed to those authorized and only for those subjects included in the interim analysis. SeeSection 11.8 Interim Analy sis for details. 6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTR ATION JNJ-42847922 supplied for this study is formulated asover-encapsulated tablets of 10 and 20mg.

Where multiple procedures are scheduled for the same visit, procedures are recommended to be performed in the following order: salivary cortisol samples , ECGs, vital signs, blood samples , PRO assessments and then other procedures . All scheduled morning salivary cortisol samples should be collected upon awakening and evening salivary cortisol samples should be collected at bedtime. Thesalivary cortisol samples scheduled at the time of PK samples ( ie, Day 1 night, Da y 2 morning, and Day 8 morning) should be collected before any blood samples are drawn . Blood collections for PK, biomarker ,and pharmacogenomic and epigenetic (DNA) assessments should be kept as close to the specified time as possible. Actual dates and times of assessments will be recorded in the source documentation. Serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined necessary by the investigator to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject's participat ion in the study .For WOCBP ,who enrolled in the study before Amendment 5 and who continue in the trial, a serum pregnancy test must be performed at screening, and urine pregnancy tests must be performed at Day 1, Day 22, Day 42 (End -of Treatment/Early Withdrawal), and at the Follow -up Visit to establish absence of pregnancy . The total blood volume to be collected from each subject will be approximately 190mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. The maximum amount of blood drawn (including retesting) from each subject in this study will not exceed 300mL. 9.1.2. Screening Phase After providing written informed consent and within 4 weeks prior to randomization, outpatient subjects experiencing a major depressive episode will be screened to evaluate their eligibility for study participation. Subjects must meet DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the SCID-CT. In addition, the current depressive episode must be deemed valid by the SSQ interview , which will be administered by independent, remote (ie, not at clinical site) raters. (Note: The SSQ will be administered along with the MADRS ). The duration of the current depressive e pisode must be ≤18months . Eligible subjects must have a MADRS total score ≥25 at screening and must not demonstrate a clinically significant improvement (ie, an improvement of >20% on their MADRS total score) from the screening to baseline visit. Rating of the MADRS will be performed by independent, remote raters. Subjects must have had an inadequate response to at least 1 butno more than 3antidepressant s, administered atanadequate dose and duration in the current episode of depression, documen ted by medication history based upon the MGH -ATRQ. An inadequate response is defined as <50% reduction in depressive symptom severity , as assessed by the MGH -ATRQ. An adequate trial is defined as an antidepressant treatment for at least 4weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose specified in the MGH -ATRQ. The inadequate response must include the subject’s current antidepressant treatment."

All other SSRI /SNRI background antidepressants qualify ing the subject for enrollment will be assay ed (urine or blood sample) locall y at the study site, if possible. Investigators should be aware that subjects with seizures are not excluded, but subjects are excluded if they take anticonvulsant medications (see Section 8,Prestudy and Concomitant Therap y). In deciding to include a subject with seizures orhistory of seizures, investigators should be aware that convulsions were observed in a small number of dogs at high exposure levels in nonclinical studies (see Section 1.1.1, Nonclinical Studies). In each case, the animals with convulsions had substantial ly higher exposures than those without, and exposures in these animals were 20-to 40-fold higher than the mean Cmax levels in humans at a dose of 40mg/day (the highest dose to be studied in this study ). The group mean Cmax levels at the dose where convul sions were seen in the 9-month dog study were >6.5-fold higher (or >68-fold when adjusted for plasma protein binding) than the mean Cmax levels in humans at a dose of 40 mg/day . No convulsions were seen in the 1-or 3-month dog studies at similar doses or in other species in the preclinical program. To date ,no convulsions or seizures have been seen in humans"

The investigators should carefull y weigh the risks and benefits of including subjects with a known history of seizures or seizure disorder, particularl y considering exclusion criterion 1 of this study that exclude subjects with significant and/or unstable neurological conditions. Exceptional and limited retesting of abnormal screening values that lead to exclusion may be allowed after discussion and approval by the sponsor during the screening period (to reassess eligibility ).This should only be considere d if there is no anticipated impact on subject safet y. Subjects must discontinue all prohibited psychotropic medications as described in Section 8, Prestudy and Concomitant therapy , before Day 1 of the study . 9.1.3. Double -Blind Treatment Phase Subjects will be randomized after completion of all screening procedures and after assessment of qualification for study participation based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The doses of JNJ-42847922 that will be studied at the beginning of the study are known (ie,20and 40 mg), whereas the doses of JNJ-42847922 to be studied after the interim analysis will be adaptively chosen based on the dose -response curve seen at the time of the interim analy sis. At the start of the study on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, subjects will be randoml y assigned in a 2:1:1ratio to receive 1 of 3treatments: placebo: JNJ-42847922 20mg: JNJ-42847922 40mg. After the interim analysis, subjects will be randomly assigned to study drug(placebo or one of the JNJ-42847922 doses [potential doses include 10 mg, 20 mg, 40mg]) , with the allocation ratio adapted according to the dose -response curve observed at the time of the interim analysis. Regardless of whether subjects are randomized before or after the interim analysis, the schedule of events and study procedures will remain the same. Study procedures during the double -blind treatment phase to assess safety , tolerability , efficacy , compliance, and other evaluations (eg, PK and biomarker s) will occur as per the Time and Events Schedule. Subjects will report to the study sitein the morn ing on Day s 1 (Week 1), 8 (Week 2), 22 (Week 4), and 42 (end of Week 6) in a fasted state . On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, the assigned study drug (blinded placebo or JNJ-42847922 )will be administered at the study site(at bedtime , approximately 3 hours after the last meal ),and PKand salivary cortisol samples will be collected at the site . For the remainder of the study (from Day 2 to Day 41), the assigned study drug dose will be self-administered by the subject at home at bedtime ,approximately 3 hours after the last meal . Note: On Day 1, subjects should report to the study sitein the morning for the assessments .After the assessments ,subjects may remain at the study site ormay go home for the afternoon and return later for an overnight stay at the study site. Subjects who prefer to go home willreturn to the study site 1hour before the evening dosing and will remain overnight at the study site."

Note: In some circumstances, subjects may not be able to stay overnight on Day 1 for the sample collection. Since the collection of PK and cortisol samples does not relate to the primar y assessments of safet y and efficacy , an exception to the overnight stay and collection of samples (PK and cortisol) may be made after discussion with the sponsor’s medical monitor. The reason for the exception must be documented in the source documents. Subjects who do not stay overnight will take their Day 1 dose at home (at bedtime, approximately 3 hours after the last meal) . 9.1.4. Posttreatment Phase (Follow -Up) Telephone Contact One day after completion of the double -blind phase, on Day 43 (Week 7), a telephone contact will be made for follow -up safet y assessments. During this call, the PWC will be administ ered, and information on adverse events and concomitant medication s will be collected. Follow -up Visit All subjects will complete a follow -up visit within 7 to 14 days after completion of the double -blind phase . Evaluations to be performed at the follow -up visit are described in the Time and Events Schedule. If a subject discontinues study treatment before the end of Week 6, end-of-treatment and follow - up assessments should be obtained. The duration of participation in the study for an individual subject (including screening and follow -up visit) will beup to approximately 12 weeks ( 84 day s). Subjects will be instructed that study drug will not be made available to them after they have completed/discontinued study drug and that they should return to their primary physician to determine standard of care. 9.2. Efficacy Evaluations The following efficacy assessments will be performed at the time points indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. The MADRS (SIGMA) and CGI-S will be administered by independent , centralize dremote raters over the telephone ; the HAM -A(SIGH -A) will be administered by the investigators or designee; and the EQ-5D-5L, PGI-S, PHQ -9,PROMIS -SD(Sho rt Form) , PROMI S-Fatigue (Sho rt Form) , SDS, SHAPS, RRS, and WLQ(Sho rt Form) will be completed by the subjects . 9.2.1. Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) The MADRS will be performed by independent , centralize dremote raters during the study . The MADRS is a clinician -administered scale designed to measure depression severit y and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment .35The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored"

Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadness, inner tension, reduced sleep, reduced appetite, concentration difficulties , lassitude, inability to feel, pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter -rater reliability . The t ypical recall period for the MADRS is 7 day s. 9.2.2. Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS) The SDS is a 5 item questionnaire which has been widely used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability .30,54The first 3 items assess disruption of (1)work/school, (2) social life, and (3) family life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. The scoresfor the first 3 items are summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment. It also has 1 item on days lost from school or work and 1item on days when underproductive. Its completion time is estimated to be around 1 to 2minutes. The recall period for this study is 7 days . 9.2.3. Hamilton A nxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) The original 14-item clinician -administered HAM -A scale assesses the severity of different anxiety -related symptoms. It is a commonl y used, validated scale in clinical trials assessing anxiety .20,21However, the original HAM -A lacks instructions for administration and clear anchor points for the assignment of severity ratings . For this reason , the structured interview guide version (SIGH -A) will be used in this study .62The SIGH-A has been shown to have high inter- rater and test-retest reliability and produced similar but consistently higher (+4.2) scores compared to the original HAM -A. Correlation with a self-report measure of overall anxiety has also been shown to be h igh.62 9.2.4. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sy stem -Sleep Disturbance ( PROMIS -SD)and Fatigue (PROM IS-Fatigue) Short Form Developed under a National Institute sof Health (NIH)initiative, the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System captures self-reported, qualitative health aspects in the domains of phy sical, mental, and social health.65 The PROMI S-SDShort Form subscale consists of a static 8-item questionnaire. Using a recall period of the past 7 days, it assesses the concepts of sleep initiation (2 items), qualit y of sleep (3items), early morning feelings (2items) and worry ing about sleep (1 item). Five-point Likert scales are provided to capture the subject’s impressions ranging from “very poor” to “very good” and “not at all” to “very much” . Its completion time is estimated to be less than 5 minutes. The PROMI S-Fatigue Short Form subscale consists of a static 8-item questionnaire. Using a recall period of the past 7 days, it assesses a range of symptoms from mild subjective feelings of tiredne ss to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one’s abilit y to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Ratings are done on a 5 item Likert scale ranging from “not at all” to “very much” and “never ” to “alway s”. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency , duration, and intensity )"

The fatigue short form is generic rather than disease -specific. Its completion time is estimated to be less than 5minutes. 9.2.5. Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) The CGI-S will be completed by independent, centralized remote raters during the study . The CGI-S provides an overall clinician -determined summary measure of the severity of the subject’s illness that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the subject’s history , psychosocial circumstances, s ymptoms, behavior, and the impact of the sy mptoms on the subject’s ability to function.19The CGI-S evaluates the severity of psy chopathology on a scale of 1 to 7. Considering total clinical experience with the depression population, a subject is assessed on severit y of illness at the time of rating according to: 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedl y ill; 6=severel y ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. The CGI-S permit s a global evaluation of the subject 's condition at a given time. For an experienced rater, the time required to complete the CGI -S is less than 1 minute. 9.2.6. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) The PGI-S is a self-report scale to measure severity ofillness (1=none, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe ). Considering all aspects of depression , subjects will rate their severit y on the PGI-S. Its completion time is less than 1 minute. 9.2.7. Patient Health Questionnaire, 9 -Item (PHQ -9) The PHQ -9 is a 9-item, PRO measure to assess depressive symptoms.55The scale scores each of the 9 symptom domains of the DSM -5 MDD criteria and it has been used both as a screening tool and a measure of response to treatment for depression. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0=not at all, 1=several days, 2=more than half the days, and 3=nearl y every day). The subject’s item responses are summed to provide a total score (range of 0 to 27), with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms. The recall period is 2 weeks and its completion time is less than 5 minutes . 9.2.8. Snaith -Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHA PS) The SHAPS is a reliable, valid, and unidimensional instrument to assess hedonic capacit y in adults with MDD . It is a 14-item, self-report tool with a completion time below 5 minutes. Each of the items has a set of 4 response categori es-Definitely Agree /Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, and Strongl y Disagree, with either of the Disagree responses receiving a score of 1 and either of the Agree responses receiving a score of 0. A higher total SHAPS score indicates higher levels of current anhedonia.36 9.2.9. European Quality of Life (EuroQol) Group, 5 -Dimension, 5 -Level (EQ-5D-5L)Questionnaire The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome, primarily designed for self -completion by respondents. It consists of the EQ -5D-5L descriptive sy stem and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and"

Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1 indicating no problem, Level 2 indicating slight problems, Level 3 indicating moderate problems, Level 4 indicating severe problems, and L evel 5 indicating extreme problems).11,12 The subject selects an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health “today .” The descriptive system can be represented as a health state. The EQ-VAS self-rating records the respondent’s own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 to 100. The time taken to complete the questionnaire varies with age, health status, and setting but is likely to be around 1 minute. 9.2.10. Work Limitations Question naire (WLQ) Short Form The objective of the WLQis to assess the on-the-job impact of chronic health problems and/or treatment (“work limitations ”) in adults. It is a PRO tool, consist ingof 8items in the short form version . Likert scales are provided to capture the subject’s impressions . The recall period is 2weeks and its completion time has been reported to be less than 5 minutes . Its content validity has been established through condition -specific focus groups and its measurement properties are docume nted as strong.31,32,33 9.2.11. Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) The RRS assesses rumination as the process of “compulsively focused attention on the sy mptoms of one’s distress, and on its possible causes and consequences, as opposed to its solutions ”as established by Nolen-Hoeksema in 1998. The measure consists of 22items and provides 4 point Likert scales ranging from “almost never” to “almost alway s”. Its completion time is about 5minu tes. The tool is understood as very straightforward, as all items are summed to provide the final score.37 9.3. Pharmacokinetics 9.3.1. Evaluations Blood samples of approximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of JNJ-42847922 andthe metabolites M12 and M16 as described below: Day 1 Night and Day 2 Morning PKsampling: Three blood samples will be collected on the followin g time points : oSample 1: between 15 minutes to 1.5 h ourafter dosing oSample 2: between 2 to 4 h ours after dosing oSample 3: between 6 to8hours after dosing . Day 8 PK sampling A single sample will be collected in the early morning on Day 8between 6 and 12 hours after dosing at night on Day 7."

As this is a blinded study , blood samples for PK will be collected from placebo -dosed subjects, but not analyzed for PK. These samples will be stored and may be analyzed if needed (eg,suspicion of an incorrect dose). Genetic analyses will not be performed on these plasma samples. Note that there are no dietary restrictions or fasting requirements prior to blood collection for PK assessments. Additiona l information about the collection, handling, and shipment of biological samples can be found in the Laboratory Manual. The exact time of PK blood sampl e collection must be recorded, along with all concomitant medications (dose, drug, start and stop date).The exact date and time of the last administration of study drug before the PK sample will be recorded . 9.3.2. Analytical Procedures Pharmacokinetics Plasma samples will be analy zed to measure concentrations ofJNJ-42847922 and the metabolite M12 using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chromatograph y/mass spectrometry /mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. The metabolite M16 will be analy zed using a scientificall yvalidated method. 9.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters Concentration -time data will be graphicall y display ed by dose, visit date and time (relative to dose) for JNJ -42847922, M12 ,and M16 and summarized using descriptive statistics. A population PK analysis using PK data from a selection of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be performed at the completion of the study and at the interim analy sis. Using actual sampling and dosing times, concentration -time data will be analy zed using population PK modeling. Post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters ( ie, AUC and, if allowed by the data, C max) will be obtained for JNJ -42847922 from population PK modeling and if needed, for M12 and M16 . As part of the population PK modeling, the effect of intrinsic (eg,age, gender, body weight) and extrinsic factors (eg,concomitant medications ) affecting the PK of JNJ-42847922 may be evaluated if needed . Individual predicted plasma concentration -time profiles and/or post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters for JNJ-42847922 and,if necessary , for M12 and M16 may be used for exploratory exposure -response modeling for safety and efficacy endpoints . 9.4. Biomarkers Evaluations Venous blood samples will be collected for the assessment of biomarkers asindicated in the Time and Events Schedule . To avoid interference cause d by lipid content in blood specimens collected for biomarker evaluation, biomarker samples will be collected under fasting conditions (for a minimum of 8 hours, water permitted)."

In addition, salivary cortisol samples will be collected at the study site at baseline (before study drug administration on Day 1) and prior to each blood sample for PK on Days1, 2, and 8 (Note:samples on Days 1 and 2 will only be collected from those subjects participating in the Day 1 overnight stay). (Note: order of samples: salivary cortisol followed by biomarker blood samples and then PK samples; exact time of all samples should be recorded) .Cortisol concentration has a strong diurnal pattern, with peak concentrations present upon awakening and low concentrations in the evening hours. Collection of saliva cortisol samples (which correlate well with serum concentrations) allows for collection at home with a low subject burden. Subjects should not consume alcoholic beverages for at least 12 hours prior to saliva sampl ing. Food, drinks (except water), and oral care (brushing, flossing, mouthwash) are not permitted 1hour prior to the saliva collection. Biomarker analy ses will include (but are not limited to) markers related to the immune system activity , growth factors, metabolic, and HPA axis activation, to allow for exploratory assessment of drug-clinical response relationship, to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes, and to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to treatment. Bioma rkers may be added or deleted based on scientific information or technical innovations under the condition that the total volume of blood collected will not be increased. All biomarker data obtained during this study may be included in ongoing cross -study analy ses to investigate the relationship between depression severit y and phenot ypes and biomarkers. Fasting status at the time of biomarker blood collection will be noted on the laboratory requisition form and/or the CRF, along with any incidence of illnes s or allergy during the previous 2 weeks. Information about alcohol consum ption within 12 hours prior to saliva sampling (including amount/ty pe of alcohol consumed) will be recorded on the CRF. In addition, for premenopausal women , the average length of menstrual cycle (days) and first day of last period will be recorded on the CRF. 9.5. Pharmacogenomic and Epigenetic (DNA ) Evaluations A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected to allow for pharmacogenomic research where local regulations permit. DNA sampl es will be analy zed forthe identification of genetic and/or epigenetic factors that may influence the PK, efficacy , safety , or tolerability of JNJ-42847922 and to identify genetic and/or epigenetic factors associated with MDD .Epigenetic changes in genes known to be relevant to depression (HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, circadian rhythm) may be evaluated. Additional analy ses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may help resolve issues with the clinical data. Subject participation in the pharmacogenomic research is optional.

Safety Evaluations The collection of adverse events and concomitant medications will start after the informed consent has been signed and will continue until the follow -up visit. All safety assessments listed below will be performed as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study must be recorded on the Adve rse Event section of the CRF. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the study/earl y withdrawal will be followed b y the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. The study will include the following evaluations of safet y and tolerability according to the time points provided in the Time and Events Schedule: Adverse Events Adverse events will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject's legall yacceptable representative) for the duration of the study . Adverse events will be followed by the investigator as specified in Section 12, Adverse Ev ent Reporting. As with any CNS -active medication, investigators should monitor carefully and document any CNS -related adverse event including tremor, ataxia, abnormal sensation, confusion, or possibility of seizure. Adverse Event s of Special Interest The following adverse events are considered to be of special interest in this study : Cataplex y (sudden, transient episode of muscle weakness accompanied by conscious awareness) Sleep paraly sis (the experience of not being able to move, react, or speak when falling asleep/awakening) Complex, sleep -related behaviors/parasomnias such as confusional arousals, somnambulism (sleep walking), sleep terrors, bruxism (teeth grinding), sleep sex, sleep -related eating disorder, sleep behavior disorder, and catathrenia (REM -associated end-inspiratory apnea/breath holding). Investiga tors are instructed to inquire about the occurrence of such events during the collection of adverse events at each visit. When reported, the investigator will be required to complete a detaile d summary of the event and its clinical course utilizing the AE of special interest narrative form as soon as information on the outcome (recovered, resolving, or ongoing) is available.

Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Supine blood pressure and pulse/ heart rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5minutes of rest in aquiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones ), and standing measurements should follow . Standing measurements are to be taken after at least a full minute of standing. In addition, oral or ty mpanic temperature will be measured. In the places where oral or t ympanic temperature are not standard practice, axillary temperature can be used. The same temp erature measure should be used throughout the stud y. Physical Examination The study investigator, or other authorized and appropriatel y qualified designee, will perform the physical examinations. Height will be measured at screening only. Body weight and waist circumference will be measured at screening, Day 1, and end-of-treatm ent/early withdrawal visit. Body weight will be measured using a calibrated scale at each visit. Subjects will be weighed at approximately the same time of day on the same scale, wearing underwear and a gown and without shoes; they will be instructed to empty their bladders before being weighed. (Note: if disrobing for weighing is logistically impossible, the subject should be dressed as lightl y as possible, with consistency from visit to visit). When measuring waist circumference, the study -site personnel must ensure that the subject stands and the examiner places a measuring tape in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at the level of the umbilicus. The measuring tape should be snug, but does not compress the skin, is parallel to the floor, and is not twisted. The measurement should be taken at the end of a normal respiratory expiration. The measurement should be recorded in centimeters to the first decimal point. Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC) Potential withdrawal effects will be assessed b y the PWC .47 The Physician Withdrawal Checklist (20 items; PWC -20) is a simple and accurate method used to assess potential withdrawal s ymptoms following cessation of treatment .The PWC -20 is a reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation sy mptoms. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) Emergence of suicidal ideation will be assessed using the C-SSRS.

The ASEX is a five-item rating scale that quantifies sex drive, arousal, vaginal lubrication/penile erection, ability to reach orgasm, and satisfaction from orgasm. Possible total scores range from 5 to 30, with the higher scores indicating more sexual dysfunction. The scale has shown satisfactory reliabilit y and validity .34 9.7. Sample Collection and Handling The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the CRF or laboratory requisition form. If blood samples are collected via an indwelling cannula, an appropriate amount (1 mL) of serosanguineous fluid slightly greater than the dead space volume of the lock will be removed from the cannula and discarded before each blood sample is taken. After blood sample collection, the cannula will be flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) (or equivalent) or sodium heparin of 10 U/mL and charged with a volume equal to the dead space volume of the lock. If a mandarin (obturator) is used, blood loss due to discard is not expected. Refer to the T ime and Events Schedule for the timing and frequency of all sample collections. Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples are found in the Laboratory Manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated in the Laboratory Manual . 10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/ DISCONTINUA TION OF S TUDY TREATMENT/ WITHDRA WALFROM THE STUDY 10.1. Completion A subject will be considered to have completed the double-blind phase if he or she has completed assessments at the end of Week 6(ie, Day 42)of the double -blind phase (end- of-treatment visit) . A subject will be considered to have completed the follow -up phase if he or she has completed assessments at the fo llow-up visit (ie, the visit Days 49 -56). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for any reason before completion of the double -blind phase will not be considered to have completed the study . 10.2. Withdrawal From the Study A subject will be automa tically withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: Lost to follow -up Withdrawal of consent Death"

A subject's study treatment will be automatically discontinued if : The investigator believes that for safet y reasons or tolerability reasons (eg,adverse event) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study treatment The subject becomes pregnant The subject shows signals of acute suicidal ideation with a clear plan at any time during the study ; the subject should be referred to appropriate medical/ps ychiatric care AST and/or ALT exceeds 5 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (confirmed by repeat testing) AST and/or ALT exceeds 3 x ULN and total bilirubin exceeds 1.5 x ULN (confirmed by repea t testing). If a subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind phase (ie, Day 42), end-of-treatment and follow -up assessments should be obtained. If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study -site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal. The measures taken to follow -up must be documented. When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be documented in the CRF and in the source document. Study drug assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw will notbe replaced. 10.3. Withdrawal From the Use of Research Samples A subject who withdraws from the study will have the following options regarding the optional research samples: The collected samples will be retained and used in accordance with the subject's original separate informed consent for optional research samples. The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples, in which case the samples will be destroy ed and no further testing will take place. To initiate the sample destruction process, the investigator must notify the sponsor study site contact of withdrawal of consent for the optional research samples and to request sample destruction. The sponsor study site contact will, in turn, contact the biomarker representative to execute sample destruction. If requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the sponsor that the samples hav e been destroy ed."

In such a case, the optional research samples will be destroy ed. The sample destruction process will proceed as described above. Withdrawal From the Use of Sample s in Future Research The subject may withdraw consent for use of sample sfor future research ( refer to Section 16.2.5 , Long -Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . However, if the subject withdraws consent after the study is over, it is possible that the investigator may have alread y discarded the subject’s medical records that link the subject’s name to his or her study number. In this case, the subject’s samples would no longer be linked tothe subject, and it would not be possible to find the subject’s samples for destruction. Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main I CFand in the separate ICF for optional research samples. 11. STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be performed by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to analy ze the efficacy and safety data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Sta tistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) . 11.1. Subject Information The efficacy analyses will be based on the full analy sis set (FAS) which consists of all subjects who were randoml y assigned to stud y drug andreceived at least 1 dose of study drug. Safety analyses will be based on the safet y analysis set,which consists of all subjects who were randomly assigned to study drug and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The safet y analysis set is the same as the FAS. Data for all subjects who have received JNJ-42847922 and have at least 1 evaluable PK sample will be included in the population PK analy sis. For all subjects who are randoml y assigned to study drug, descriptive statistics (eg, study completion/withdrawal information, demographic and baseline data) will be pr ovided. 11.2. Sample Size Determination The calculation of the sample size is based on the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to the end of Week 6 for the MADRS total score). The assumptions for the effect size were based on published literature and the clinically meaningful difference between groups to be detected. The total sample size is calculated on the basis of the generalized Multiple Comparison Procedure -Modeling (MCP -Mod) test45applied to the placebo and the JNJ-42847922 dose groups at the final analy sis. Approximately 280 randomized subjects will provide an average weighted power of approximately 85%depending on the underling true dose-response shape ,"
93,page_93,"JNJ-42847922 (Seltorexant/Selective Orexin -2 Receptor Antagonist) Clinical Protocol 42847922MDD2001 Amendment 5 94 Status: Approved , Date: 24 April 2018assuming a 1-sided significance level of 0.05, a treatment difference from placebo of 4.5points in change in MADRS total score, a standard deviation of 10 , and a 25% overall dropout rate . The data cutoff for the unblinded interim analysis will be 6 weeks after randomization of 160subjects, which corresponds to approximately 57% of the sample size ofthe study . This number of subjects provides approximately 93% power to detect a dose-response relationship, depending on the underlying true dose-response shape, assuming a treatment difference of 4.5, and a standard deviation of 10 when tested by means of the MCP -Mod approach at the 30%significance level (1 -sided). 11.3. Efficacy Analyses Primary estimand The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study , is defined b y the following 3 components: Population: subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therap y with an SSRI /SNRI . Endpoint: change in MADRS total score fro m baseline to the end of Week 6 . Measure of Intervention: the effect of the initially randomized treatment together with the oral SSRI /SNRI antidepressant that would have been observed had all subjects remained on their treatment t hroughout the double -blind phase. The primary analysis will be based on the FAS and the MADRS total scores collected during the double -blind phase. The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated at a 1-sided significance level of 0.05 using the MCP -Mod approach to test for dose-response. For all other analy ses of the primary efficacy endpoint and for all other efficacy endpoints, no multiplicity adjustment will be done and nominal 1 -sided p -values will be presented. Primary efficacy endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in MADRS total score from baseline to the end of Week 6. A mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) analy sis of the observed data from the placebo and JNJ-42847922 groups will be used as the method of addressing missing data. The MMRM will include region, time, treatment (placebo and JNJ-42847922 dose groups), baseline insomnia status (present/absent), and treatment -by-time interaction as factors and baseline MADRS total score as a covariate. An unstructured variance -covarianc e matrix will be used. Subjects in the FAS who do not have complete data will still contribute to the estimates at the end of Week 6, but will have less weight in the analy sis than those subjects with complete data. The final analy sis will use the generali zed MCP -Mod approach45(a hybrid methodology that combines multiple comparison procedures with modeling techniques) ,which will be applied towards estimates obtained from the MMRM analy sis to establish a dose-respo nse signal and to"

MCP -Mod has been qualified by the European Medicines Agency .10 In conjunctio n, the comparison between JNJ -42847922 and placebo will also be performed using the appropriate contrasts directl y from the MMRM analy sis using estimates at the end of Week 6. Secondary efficacy endpoints Any secondary efficacy endpoint which isdefined as a change from baseline will be analy zed using the same MMRM as for the primary efficacy endpoint, with the corresponding baseline as a covariate. Frequency distributions will be provided for CGI-S, PGI-S,and for the number of responders and re mitters. The correlation between baseline ISI score as a continuous variable and change from baseline to the end of Week 6 in the MADRS total score will be evaluated by means of a scatter plot and if appropriate, regression analysis. In addition , subjects will be dichotomized based on their baseline ISI score (≥15 versus <15) to evaluate whether there are differences in these subgroups (ie, evaluating change from baseline to the end of Week 6 in the MADRS total score in subjects with ISI score ≥15 versus subjects with ISI score <15). The shift in ISI score category (score 0-7=no clinically significant insomnia; score 8-14=sub -threshold insomnia; score 15-21=moderate insomnia, and score 22-28=clinically severe insomnia) from baseline to the end of Week 6 wil l be presented. Subjects will also be dichotomized based on whether they have MDD with anxious distress or MDD without anxious distress to evaluate whether there are differences in these subgroups (ie, evaluating change from baseline to the end of Week 6 i n the MADRS total score in subjects with and without anxious distress). The secondary endpoint analyses will not be controlled for Type I error and nominal p-values will be presented. The analyses for the other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP. 11.4. Pharmacokinetic A nalyses Plasma concentrations for JNJ-42847922, M12, and M16 (if applicable) will be analy zedand summarized by dose, day and time point, using descriptive statistics. A population based PK analysis using PK data from a selection of Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies will be performed at the completion of the study and at the interim analy sis. Post-hoc Bayesian estimates of PK parameters for JNJ-42847922 (and, if necessary , for metabolites M12 and M16) from the population PK analy sis may be used for e xploratory exposure -response analy ses. Population PK analy sis of plasma concentration -time data of JNJ-42847922 will be performed using nonlinear mixed -effects modeling.

Post-hoc Bayesian individual estimates of PK parameters will be generated from the population PK analy sis for potential use in exposure -response analysis. An interim population PK and exposure -response analysis will be conducted . A snapshot date for PKsamples to be analyzed will be defined, if required. Sampl es collected before this date will be analy zed for JNJ-42847922, M12, and M16 (if applicable) and included in the population PKanalysis. Samples collected after the snapshot date will be analy zed at a later date, and may be included in a population PKre-analy sis when they become available after database lock. Details for the population PKand exposure -response analy sis will be described in a standalone analysis plan and the results of the population PK and exposure -response analysis will be presented in a separate report. Data will be listed for all subjects with available plasma concentrations per treatment group. Subjects will be excluded from the PK analy sis if their data do not allow for accurate assessment of the PK (eg, incomplete administration of the study drug; missing information of dosing and sampling times; concentration data not sufficient for PK parameter calculation). All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration database. All subjects and samples excluded from the analysis will be clearl y documented in the study report. For each treatment group , descriptive statistics will be calculated for all individual derived PK parameters includi ng exposure information ofJNJ-42847922 and, if needed, M12, and M16. 11.5. Biomarker A nalysis Cortisol levels will be tabulated for each time point and summary statistics will be calculated. Posttreatment changes in cortisol levels will be assessed by treatment group. Analy sis of variance (ANOVA )and t-test will be used to assess differences across groups and time points. Correlations between cortisol levels and clinical endpoints will be evaluated. The additional exploratory biomarkers will be tabulated by treatment and summary statistics will be calculated. Posttreatment changes in exploratory biomarkers will be summarized by treatment group. Associations between baseline biomarker levels and clinical endpoints may be explored. Additional exploratory analyses may also be performed .Results of all exploratory analysis will be presented in a separate report. All biomarker data obtained from this study may also be included in an ongoing cross -study analysis to investigate the relationship between depression severi ty, phenoty pes,and biomarkers . 11.6.

Interim A nalysis An internal IAC will be established to review the interim data and formulate recommended decisions/actions in accordance with the objectives of the interim analysis. The IAC consists of 2clinician s (or a clinician and a scientist) , a clinical pharmacologist, and a statistician, one of whom will chair the committee ,and other members as required. The IAC will not include sponsor study team members; however, it will include other sponsor employ ees, who are not affiliated with the stud y team, as deemed appropriate for the membership. The primary purpose of the interim anal ysis will be to examine the dose -response relationship, to determi ne the doses of JNJ-42847922 and the allocation ratio of these doses to be used in subjects randomized after the interim analysis. The IAC will review the outputs from statistical analysis, exposure, exposure -response anal ysis, and safet y for this determin ation. The interim analy sis will use the generalized MCP -Mod approach to establish a dose-response signal with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint. A 1-sided 0.30significance level will be used to test for dose-response using the MCP -Mod approach on the change in MADRS total score to the end of Week 6 . Unblinded exposure -response analyses will be performed by an independent internal pharmacometrician using data available at the interim analysis, with adequate firewalls so the study team will remain b linded. At the time of interim anal ysis, the IAC will review the exposure and exposure -response analy ses to assist in selection of doses and the allocation ratio to be used after the interim anal ysis. To ensure timely availability of data for modeling, dosing information, drug concentration data, efficacy data for MADRS, safety data for next-day somnolence and sleep paraly sis, and demographic information will also be accessed by the unblinded pharmacometrician prior to the time of the interim analysis, while keeping the study team blinded . As this Phase 2b study is not a confirmatory trial, no adjustment to the significance level will be performed for the interim anal ysis. Further details regarding the interim analy sis will be specified in a separate charte r and interim SAP."

ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conduc ted in accordance with those procedures. 12.1. Definitions 12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigationa l) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) . This includes any occurrence that i s new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note : The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events, for time of last adverse event recording). Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspect ed transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important*"

These should usually be considered serious. Ifa serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug and the event (eg, death from anaph ylaxis), the event must be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study endpoint (eg, all -cause mortalit y). Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product reference safet y information. For JNJ-42847922 , the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined b y whether or not it is listed in the I nvestigator's Brochure. For baseline antidepressant therapies (eg, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxam ine, fluoxetine, milnacipran, levomilnacipran, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine , desvenlafaxine, vilazodone, or vortioxetine ) with marketing authorization ,the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in thelocally approved Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)/Package Insert ( PI). Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likel y by th e definitions listed in Section 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions . 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug. Doubtful An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . Possible An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s)."

The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed b y dechallenge and rechallenge). 12.1.3. Severity Criteria An assessment of severity grade will be made using the following general categorical descriptors: Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate : Sufficient discomfort i s present to cause interference with normal activity . Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y ofevents not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory abnormalities). 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drugthat may require expedited reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study drug Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study drug Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study drug Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the sponsor study drug , eg, name confusion) Exposure to a sponsor study drug during pregnancy or breastfeeding Special reporting situations should be recorded in the CRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the seri ous adverse event page of the CRF. 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure ,which may include contact for follow -up of safety . Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 30days after the last dose of study drug, must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will"

All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. Anticipated events will be recorded and reported as described in Attachment 2. All adverse events, regardless of seriousness, severity , or presumed relationship to study drug, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection ”). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy .All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) . For anticipated events reported as individual serious adverse events the sponsor will make a determination of relatedness in addition to and independent of the investigator ’s assessment. The sponsor will periodicall y evaluate the accumulating data and, when there is sufficient evidence and the sponsor has determined there is a reasonable possi bility that the drug caused a serious anticipated event, they will submit a safety report in narrative format to the investigators (and the head of the investigational institute where required). The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSA Rs to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB .A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investig ators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary , unless otherwise specified. For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, the subject must be provided with a “wallet (study )card”and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number Local sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staf f onl y) Site number Subject number Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind"

Serious A dverse Events All serious adverse events occurring during thestudymust be reported to the appropriate sponsor contact person b ystudy -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event. Information regarding serious adverse events will be transmitted to th e sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed andsigned by a physician from the study site, and transmitted to the sponsor within 24 hours. The initial and follow -up reports of a serious adverse event should be madeby facsimile (fax). All serious adverse events that have not resolved by the end of the study , or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study , must be followed until any of the following occurs: The event resolves The event s tabilizes The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study conduct It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due diligence with follow -up ef forts) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product will be reported as a serious adverse event. Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospitalizations for the following: Hospitaliz ations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility ). Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF ). Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the underly ing condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened ,will not be considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originall y pla nned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event. The cause of death of a subject in a study within 30 daysof the last dose of study drug, whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse event. 12.3.3. Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notificat ion form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomal ies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered serious"

Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue further stud y treatment. Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the study will be reported as noted abov e. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required . 12.4. Contacting Sponsor Regarding Safety The names (and corresponding telephone numbers) of the individuals who should be contacted regard ing safet y issues or questions regarding the study are listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided to the investigators as a separate document. 13. PRODUCT QUA LITY COMP LAINT HA NDLING A product qualit y complaint (PQC) is defined as any suspicion of a product defect related to manufacturing, labeling, or packaging, ie, any dissatisfaction relative to the identity , quality , durability , or reliabilit y of a product, including its labeling or package integrity . A PQC may have an impact on the sa fety and ef ficacy of the product. T imely , accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor , and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The spons or has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of PQC information; all studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. 13.1. Procedures All initial PQCs must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours after being made aware of the event . If the defect is combined with a serious adverse event, the study -site personnel must report the PQC to the sponsor according to the serious adverse event reporting timelines (refer to Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events). A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further investigation if requested by the sponsor . 13.2. Contacting Sponsor Regarding Product Quality The names (and corresponding telephone numbers) of the individuals who should be contacted regarding product quality issues are listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document."

Study drug will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study . Returned study drug must not be dispensed again, even to the same subject. Whenever a subject brings his or her study drug to the study site for pill count, this is not seen as a return of supplies. Study drug may not be relabel ed or reassigned for use by other subjects. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study drug from, nor store it at, any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the sponsor. 15. STUDY -SPECIFIC MATERIA LS The investigator will be provided with the following supplies: Investigator's Brochure for JNJ -42847922 Pharmacy manual/study site investigational product manual Laboratory manual and materials A binder containing all patient -and investigator -administered questionnaires and scales, along with completion guidelines Electronic data capture (eDC) Manual Sample I CF IWRS Manual Subject recruitment materials Pre-printed labels for blood samples Subject diaries . 16. ETHICA L ASPECTS 16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, during the study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential adverse events of the study , and provid e their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. The primary ethical concern is that some subjects who could potentially benefit from adjunctive treatment with JNJ-42847922 will be randomized to placebo or to a dose of study drug that is either not efficaciou s or where the risks exceed the benefits for that subject . This will be partially mitigated by continue dbackground antidepressant therap ythroughout the study .Moreover, the duration of study is considered to be relatively short. Since thefemale rat fertility study suggested a reduction in female fertility ,and it is not know n what the relevance of these findings are to a woman’s ability to become pregnant after taking JNJ-42847922 , WOCBP will not be included in this study until more is learned about the effect of JNJ-42847922 on female"

However, WOCBP subjects, who are currently enrolled in this study , may continue study participation following discussion between the subject and the investigator of the new rat fertility study results, if they have a negative pregnancy test, and are using reliable contraception. JNJ-42847922 has been administered to humans before in single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy subjects and subjects suffering from depression and/or insomn ia. The highest dose tested in the multiple dose study was 60 mg over 10 days (Study 42847922EDI1003). All doses tested to date have proven to be well-tolerated in healthy subjects and in subjects suffering from depression with comorbid insomnia and in subjects with insomnia without comorbid psychiatric diseases. This is consistent with the reported involvement of the orexinergic system in the hypothalamo -pituitary -adrenal axis through control of the gonadotrophic hormones.70,71,72A study to assess reversibility has not been conducted with JNJ-42847922 but similar effects induced by several approved drugs were shown to be reversible.73,74 In this study adult men and WONCBP with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therapy with an SSRI /SNRI will be selected. The age of the study population in this protocol is intentionally broad, asunlike many other mental disorders, the age of onset of depression has a wide range, with a median onset of early to mid-20s, although significant proportions of patients may experience onset between late adolescence to late adulthood. In addition, women have a two-fold increased risk of depression over men, and separat ion and divorce are additional risk factor sacross the sexes. Subjects with MDD who have had an inadequate response to current antidepressant therap y with an SSRI /SNRI will be selected, as it is expected that this population will be representative for the targeted subject population for future clinical trials. Also, subjects might benefit from the clinical evaluations and the information collected as part of this study . The results of the investigation of JNJ-42847922 may help future patients with MDD .

Subjects will be monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study , in accordance with the Time and Events S chedule. In addition, t o ensure subject safet y, subjects should be cautioned not to drive or operate machinery or engage in any potentially hazardous activities if they have had less than a full night’s sleep (6-8 hours) following administration of the study drug or at any time during the study ifthe subject feels that his or her baseline capacityis impaired. At any point during the study , if subjects manifest significant next day sleepiness ,they areadvised to inform the investigator. Such subjects may be discontinued or advised not to drive or operate machinery . The maximum amount of blood drawn (including retesting) from each subject in this study will not exceed 300 mL, that is considered to be safe and acceptable in comparison to a Red Cross blood donation. 16.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance 16.2.1. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol , current ICH guidelines on GCP, and applicable regulatory and country -specific requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific qualit y standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety , and well -being of study subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki ,and that the stud y data are credible. 16.2.2. Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board Before the start of the study , the investigator (or sponsor where required) will provide the IEC/IRB with current and complete copies of the following documents (as required by local regulations) : Final protocol and, if applicable, amendments Sponsor -approved ICF(and any other written materials to be provided to the subjects) Investigator's Brochure (or equivalent information) and amendments/addenda Sponsor -approved subject recruiting materials Information on compensation for study -related injuries or payment to subjects for participation in the study , if applicable Investigator's curriculum vitae or equivalent information (unless not required, as documented b y the IEC/IRB)"

At the end of the study , the investigator (or sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/I RB about the study completion (if applicable, the notification will be submitted through the head of investigational institution) . 16.2.3. Informed Consent Each subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the study has been fully explained. The ICF(s) must be signed before performance of any study -related activity . The ICF(s) that is/areused must be approved by both the sponsor and by the reviewing IEC/I RB and be in a language that the subject can read and understand. The informed consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy . Before enrollment in the study , the investigator or an authorized member of the study -site personnel must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study ,and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his or her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatmen ts are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally , they will be told that the investigator will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term follow -up if needed and that their records may be accessed by health authorities and authorized sponsor personnel without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. By signing the ICFthe subject is authorizing such access . It also denotes that the subject agrees to allow his or her study physician to recontact the subject for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safet y evaluations , and subsequent disease -related treatments , if needed. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study , consent should be appropriatel y recorded by means of the subject's personall y dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a cop y of the ICFmust be given to the subject. Subjects will be asked for separate consent to provide optional samples for genetic research (where local regulations permit). After informed consent for the study is appropriatel y obtained, the subject (or his or her legally acceptable representative) will be asked to sign and personall y date a separate ICF indicating agreement to partic ipate in the optional genetic research component. Refusal to participate in the optional research will not result in ineligibility for the study . A copy of this signed I CF will be given to the subject."

Privacy of Personal Data The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the study . These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentialit y and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to keep the identit y of subjects confidential. The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator /institution to allow direct access to his or her original medical records (source data/documents) for study -related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries. The subject has the right to request through the investigator access to his or her personal data and the right to request rectification of any data that are not correct or complete. Reasonable steps will be taken to r espond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of the study , and the applicable laws and regulations. Exploratory DNA, biomarker , and PK research is not conducted under standards appropriate for the return of data to subjects. In addition, the sponsor cannot make decisions as to the significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research data will not be returned to subjects or investigators, unless required by lawor local regulations . Privacy and confidentiality of data generated in the future on stored samples will be protected by the same standards applicable to all other clinical data. 16.2.5. Long -Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research Samples collected in this study may be stored for up to 15 years (or according to local regulations) for additional research. Samples will only be used to understand JNJ-42847922 , to understand MDD , to understand differential drug responders, and to develop tests/assay s related to JNJ-42847922 and MDD (Note: DNA samples collected from Japanese subjects will not be used for research related to MDD). The research may begin at any time during the study or the post-study storage period. Stored samples will be coded throughou t the sample storage and analysis process and will not be labeled with personal identifiers. Subjects may withdraw their consent for their samples to be stored for research (refer toSection 10.3, Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Research )."

Inclusion and exclusion criteria not requiring documented medical history must be verified at a minimum by subject interview or other protocol required assessment (eg, physical examination, laboratory assessment) and documented in the source documents. An electronic source system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or clinic record to document medical care (eg, electronic source documents) as well as the clinical study -specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronicall y extracted for use by the sponsor. If electronic source is utilized, references made to the CRF in the protocol include the electronic source system but information collected through electronic source may not be limited to that found in the CRF. Data in this system may be considered source documentation. 17.5. Case Report Form Completion Case report forms are prepared and provided by the sponsor for each subject in electronic format. All data relating to the study must be recorded in CRF. All CRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study -site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRF are accurate and correct. The study data will be transcribed by study-sitepersonnel from the source documents onto an electronic CRF, if applicable. Study -specific data will betransmitted in asecure manner to the sponsor. Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the CRF. Any such worksheets will become part of the subject's source document s. Data must be entered into CRF in English. The CRF must be comple ted as soon as possible after a subject visit and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. All subjective measurements (eg, clinician -completed questionnaires) will be completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to a CRF are needed after the initial entry into the CRF , this can be done in either of the following ways: Investigator and study-site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool) . Sponsor or sponsor delegate can generate a query for resolution by the investigator and study -site personnel. 17.6.

Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samp les. Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before the start of the study .The sponsor will review CRF for accuracy and completeness during on -site monitoring visits and after transmission to the sponsor; anydiscrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. 17.7. Record Retention In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibi lity of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor . If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such reports. 17.8. Monitoring The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post- initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compar e the data entered into the CRF with the source documents (eg,hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records) ; a sample may be reviewed . The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the sponsor and study -site personnel and are"

If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel . Direct access to source document s(medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that the recorded data are consis tent with the original source data. Findings from this review will be discussed with the study -site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source document swill be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. 17.9. Study Completion/Termination 17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study The study is considered completed with the final study visitfor the last subject participating in the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 17.9.2. Study Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the earlyclosure of astudy site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator Discontinuation of further study drug development 17.10.

For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events: Suicidal thinking, ideation/ behavior, Sleep changes/difficulty sleeping, reduced sleep, abnormal sleep, tiredness, fatigue, reduced energy, Difficulty in sexual des ire, performance or satisfaction, Reduced appetite, weight changes (loss or increase), Irritability, anger, impulsive behavior, Agitation, feeling anxious/anxiety, tension, panic attacks, phobia . Reporting of Anticipated Events All adverse events will be recorded in the CRF regardless of whether considered to be anticipated events and will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events. Any anticipated event that meets serious adverse event criteria will be reported to the sponsor as described in Section 12.3.2 , Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health Authorities , except for Japan (no events will be designated as anticipated events in Japan) . However ,if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner. Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC ) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safety committee within the sponsor’s organization that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendat ion to the sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to the study drug. Statistical Analysis Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and thresh old to trigger an aggregate analysis of anticipated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP)."
