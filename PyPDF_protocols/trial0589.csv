Pre- dose FEV1 is the average of the 2FEV1 assessments taken at 45 minutes and 15 minutes prior to the dosing of study drug at the clinic visit. The baseline FEV1 is defined as meanof the last two FEV1 assessments prior to the first dose of study drug. If any one of these assessments is missing (or is not confirmed to be pre-dose), then the remaining non -missing observation will be considered as baseline. If both asse ssments are missing (or are not confirmed to be pre-dose) then the last available FEV1 measurement prior to Day 1 on study drug will be used for baseline. If the FEV1 measurements are missing both on Day 1 and at the placebo run-in or screening visit s, the respective baseline values will be set to missing. Missing data after discontinuation of double -blind study treatment will be imputed using the jump-to-reference approach . The secondary variables are daytime asthma sy mptoms , total daily SABA use,and AQLQ +12. Analysis of primary variable: The primary efficac y variable will be analy zed on the full analysis set (FAS)using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors for treatment group, age group (<18 vs. ≥18 years), use or non-useof a second asthma controller medication ,and region, as well as the baseline daytime asthma symptom score, baseline total daily SABA use and baseline pre -dose FEV1 as continuous linear covariates."

The superiority of QAW039 150 mg once daily to placebo as add on to existing asthma therapy is established ,if the two-sided p-value is less than 0.05 and the 95% confidence intervals lie entirely to the right of 0 L. Analysis of secondary variables: The secondary variables of this study are change from baseline in daytime asthma symptoms, change from baseline in total daily SABA use, and change from baseline in AQLQ+12 over the 12-week active treatment period. The mean of change from baseline in the daytime asthm a symptom scores over the 12 week s of treatment will be analyzed using an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model in a similar fashion as for the primary efficacy variable. The mean of change from baseline in the total daily use of SABA over the 12 weeks of treatment will be analy zed using an ANCOVA model in a similar fas hion as for the primary efficacy variable. The change from baseline in AQLQ+12 at week 12 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model in a similar fashion as for the primary efficacy variable. Six hundred fifty (650) patients (325 per arm) are needed for 90% power to observe a statistically significant difference between QAW039 and placebo at the two-sided 5% significance level in the primary analysis ,assuming a treatment difference of 112 mL for the primary endpoint, a standard deviation of 380 mL and a treatm ent discontinuation rate of 15% with half of the patients discontinuing from study treatment having week 12 assessment of the primary variable.

14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Asthma presents a major global health burden. Despite existing therapies, there is still significant unmet medical need in asthma, with an estimated 300 million people affected worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 15 million disability – adjusted life years are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of the total global burden. Annual worldwide deaths have been estimated at 250 000 ( Masoli et al 2004 ). Uncontrolled asthma has a prevalence of greater than 6 million patients worldwide. According to asthma guidelines, the goal of treatment is to “achieve and maintain control of the clinical manifestations of the disease for prolonged periods” (GINA pocket guide 2016 ). Current asthma guidelines recognize that the assessment of asthma severity reflects the underly ing disease state as well as the perceived response to treatment and, based on assessment, asthma severity may change over time. Therefore, current asthma treatment guidelines classify patients based on 2 factors: control of asthma and future risk (e.g., risk of exacerbations). For patients older than 5 years with asthma, guidelines recommend assignment of patients to 1 of the 5 “treatment steps” based on current asthma controller treatment or, if a de novo presentation, assignment based on severity to either Step 2 or Step 3. Asthma control is then periodicall y assessed (~every 3 m onths) based on a patient’s asthma symptoms, severity , response to current medications, and future risk. Patients are assessed as “controlled,” “partly controlled,” or “uncontrolled” according to an algorithm and treatment is adjusted to achieve or maintain control at the lowe st treatment step (GI NA pocket guide 2016 ). The treatment guidelines recommend initiation of short -acting ß -agonists (SABAs) for patients older than 5 years with occasional symptoms, followed by addition of contro ller medications (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) , inhaled corticosteroid/long -acting ß-agonists (LABA) combinations, leukotriene modifiers etc.) according to the stepwise treatment paradigm to achieve and maintain control as described above (GINA pocket guide 2016 ). Following current guidelines, most patients are able to achieve asthma control with currentl y available therapies. Approximately 5% of patients have a refractory form of asthma which is associated with increased risk of hospitalization and death, and about 50% of medical costs associated with asthma care ( ATS 200 5 ). While only an estimated 5% of patients with asthma fulfill criteria for a diagnosis of refractory asthma, as many as 40% of patients do not achieve control with currentl y available asthma treatment (Fuhlbrigge et al 2009 ). Failure to respond to therapy may be due to multiple factors, including poor adh erence, inadequate inhaler technique (inhaled therapies) or corticosteroid resistance. Thus, there is a need for new, effective anti-inflammatory therapies for asthma. Prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2)also known as the chemoattractant receptor -homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTh2) receptor is a receptor for prostaglandin D2 (P GD2 ) which is one of the major prostanoid inflammatory mediators identified in asthma. Fevipiprant (QAW039 )is a DP2 antagonist expected to provide benefit in asthma bybinding to prostaglandin D2 receptor 2 (DP2) on eosinophils, basophils, and T lymphocy tes in the"

Since these are the major effector cells and soluble factors driving airway inflammation in asthma, treatment with QAW039 (fevipiprant) should result in a decrease in these param eters of airway inflammation as well as a clinical improvement in asthma. In support of this premise are the results of Phase 2 studies of QAW039 (CQAW039 A2201, CQAW039 A2206, and CQAW039 A2208) in which QAW039 demonstrated an improvement in lung function ( i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]) in patients across a range of asthma severities, an improvement in asthma control in patients with more severe asthma, and a fall in sputum eosinophils of 71% (geometric mean) in patients with severe asthm a and sputum eosinophilia over 12 weeks of treatment . 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safet y of QAW039 (150 mgonce daily ), compared with placebo, when added to standard -of-care (SoC) asthma therap yin adult and adoles cent (≥12 years) patients with uncontrolled asthma with respect to change from baseline in FEV1 at the end of 12 weeks of treatment. 2 Study objectives and endpoints 2.1 Objectives and related endpoints Table 2 -1 O bjectives and related endpoints Objective(s) Endpoint(s) Primary Objective To demonstrate the efficacy of QAW039 150 mg once daily as measured by change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 [in liters], compared with placebo, at the end of the 12-week active - treatment period.Endpo int for primary objective Change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 (L) at Week 12.

Asthma patients who are alread y receiving ICS or ICS with one asthma controller medication (see inclusion criteri on 4 for allowed ICS doses and combinations) are the target population for this study. Patients will continue to receive the SoC asthma medication they were receiving at Visit 1 throughout the remainder of the study . No change in SoC asthma medication and no dosage adjustments will be permitted throughout the study. Within 14 days prior to or at Visit 1, an informed consent will be obtained from patients before any study related assessments or procedures are performed. All patients signing informed consent must be registered in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Asthma and other medications and eligibility criteria will be reviewed. Patients will be instructed regarding medications to be withheld prior to spirometry for Visit 1 (See Section 5.5.7 ). The study will include: aScreening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility . Patients will also practice completing the e lectronic peak expiratory flow(ePEF) /eDiary device during this period. a Placebo R un-in period of 1week to collect b aseline data for efficacy variables and compliance with the ePEF /eDiary device . Eligibility for randomization will be determined during the placebo run-in period . a Treatment period of 12 weeks; and a Follow -up period of 4 weeks, stud y drug -free, following the last dose of study drug. Note :the follow- up period applies to all patients except those patients who enter the safet y stud y (CQAW039A2315) directl y after Visit 299. Figure 3-1 Study design"

Patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during screening may be re-screened 4 weeks after complete recovery from the exacerbation. All patients must demonstrate FEV1 reversib ility as determined by the central reader from the spirometry vendor for study eligibility . If reversibility is not demonstrated at Visit 1, reversibility will be attempted atVisit 101. If not achieved atVisit 101, then one additional attempt to demonstr ate reversibility is permitted within 4 days following Visit 101 in an ad -hoc visit tomeet this eligibility criterion. Clinic visits will be scheduled approximately 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after randomization during the active -treatment period . Since the primary endpoint is pre-dose FEV1, patients will receive witnessed doses of study drug at clinic visits after spirometry is performed for the FEV1 assessment. This will allow for appropriate assessment of pre -dose FEV1. A follow -up visit will occur approxim ately 4 w eeks (i.e., approximately 30 days) following the last dose of study drug to complete safety assessments and pregnancy testing (if applicable). Please refer to the assessment schedule (Section 6) for a list of procedures to be conducted at each visit. A Safet y Study of QAW039 is planned. At sites participating in the Safet y Study CQAW039A2315, patients who successfully complete 12 weeks of treatment in this study (CQAWA0392317 [hereafter referre d to as Study A231 7]) may be offered participation in the Safety Study; patient participation in the Safety Study will be optional. The study design and procedures for the Safet y Study will be described in a separate protocol. Periodic unblinded safety reviews will be conducted by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for the duration of the trial. 3.2 Rationale for study design The patient population will be described in more detail in Section 4 below. This randomized, double -blind, parallel- group, placebo -controlled, design supports the assessment of efficacy as well as safety of QAW039 as add-on treatment for patients with asthma inadequatel y controlled on I CSor ICS with a second controller medication .Accord ing toGlobal Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the goals of asthma therap y are to attain asthma control and reduce future risk of asthma worsening while maintaining minimal side effects of therapy . By maintaining good asthma control in patients with appropriate use of therapies, potential future risk to patients may be reduced. The endpoints included in this study measure objective and symptomatic parameters of asthma control (objective: lung function [FEV1, ]; symptomatic parameters: daytime asthma symptoms, SABA use, quality of life(QOL) , ) in patients over 12 weeks of therap y. Patient population The overall purpose for the study is to determine whether QAW039 150 mg improves lung function as measured by change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 in patients aged ≥12 years. These patients represent a subset of moderate asthma patients treated according to GINA"
19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 20 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 2016 ( treatment steps 3 and 4). This study will confirm results from a prior study of QAW039 (Study CQAW039A2206). A prior Phase 2 study of QAW039 (Study CQAW039A2206) in patients with moderate -to- severe asthma showed a statistically significant improvement in pre-dose FEV1 (L), after 12 weeks of treatment with QAW039 on top of low-dose ICS,compared with placebo on top of low-dose ICS (p=0.0035), with a clinicall y relevant maximum model -averaged difference to placebo of 112 ml. In this study ,a total daily dose of 150 mgprovided maximum efficacy as determined b y pre -dose FEV1. Screening period The sc reening period allows for assessment of patient entry criteria and for patients to become familiar with spirometry measurement and daily eDiary entry prior to the collection of baseline values. Patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the screening period must be designated as a screening failure . Patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during screening may be re -screened 4 weeks after complete recovery from the exacerbation. Re-screening of patients is permitted once during the screening period. Placebo run-in The placebo run-in period allows for the determination of level of asthma control based on , FEV1 reversibility as determined by the central reader at the spirom etry vendor, SABA use, and daytime asthma symptom scores for eligibility for randomization into the 12- week active treatment period. This period also allows for the collection of baseline data for all efficacy variables. During this period , patients will become familiar with administration of investigational treatment and patient’s compliance with an Electronic Peak Flow/ eDiary device will be assessed . Patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation during the placebo run-in period must be designated as arun-in failure. Treatment period During this period , oral QAW039 150 mg or matching placebo (1:1) will be administered once daily for 12 weeks added to SoC asthma therap y (as defined in inclusion criterion 4), with the last dose given at Week 12 and fin al assessment for the treatment period at Week 12. The 12-week treatment duration is considered sufficient to demonstrate an effect of QAW039 on the primary endpoint, pre-dose FEV1, in this Phase 3 study since QAW039 has previously demonstrated significan t effects on pre- dose FEV1 in 12 -week Phase 2 studies. Follow -up period The 4-week wash out period will monitor the safety and tolerability profile after the last dose of study drug."

QAW039 or placebo will be administered as add -on therapy . Placebo was chosen as the comparator as it will permit the assessment of improvement in terms of pre -dose FEV1 for patients with uncontrolled disease who are treated with QAW039 plus SoC asthma therap y, in comparison to those solely on SoC asthma therapy . Additionall y, the use of placebo will permit a controlled evaluation of the safet y of QAW039 plus SoC asthma therap y, compared with SoC asthma therapy in these patients. Further, patients will be allowed the use of SABAs as rescue medication when required. 3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations Not applicable. 3.6 Risks and benefits QAW039 is a potent and highly selective oral DP2 antagonist being develop ed as a potential therap y for patients with severe asthma. DP2 is a receptor for PGD 2which mediates the activation and migration of T helper 2 (Th-2)cells and eosinophils, some of the key inflammatory cell types in asthma. Recruitment of these cells into the lung is partly responsible for the intermittent airway obstruction which leads to wheezing and shortness of breath characteristic of asthma. The overall clinical experience with QAW039 includes 15 studies: 11 (six in health y volunteers and five in patients) have completed and four (three in patients and one in healthy volunteers) are ongoing. The completed phase 2 studies consist of three in patien ts with asthma, one in patients with allergic rhinitis and one in patients with atopic dermatitis (Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for information on the studies of QAW039). As of 31 -Jan- 2016, >1400 patients have been exposed to QAW039. Three Phase 2 studies in patients with asthma evaluated the effect of QAW039 across the range of asthma severities (mild to severe). In these studies, QAW039 demonstrated an effect on lung function (FEV1) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma, and an improveme nt in quality oflife scores and asthma control questionnaire scores in severe patients uncontrolled"
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 at baseline. In one study, QAW039 also demonstrated a reduction in sputum eosinophils in patients with severe asthma. The potential benefits of QAW039 therapy need to be balanced against its potential risks. Potential side effects of QAW039 include: increased heart rate, non- serious arrhythmia such as palpitations, headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, nasophary ngitis, somnolescence and dizziness. In humans, one major metabolite of QAW039 has been identified which is formed by glucuronidation (acyl glucuronide) and partially binds to plasma proteins. In the literature, in vivo binding of acyl glucuronides to proteins has been reported to be associated with rare idiosy ncratic drug reactions (IDRs), although a causal connection of protein adduction to IDRs remains uncertain (Regan et al 2010 ). There have been no IDRs observed with QAW039 treatment in completed clinical trials as of 31-Jan-2016. Taking QAW039 at the doses used in this study with the cholesterol -lowering drug simvastatin has been shown to cause a small increase in the peak blood level of simvastatin . The risk to patients in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures and close clinical monitoring. Patients on doses of simvastatin > 20 mg, doses of atorvastatin >40mg, doses of pravastatin >40 mg, or doses of pitavastatin >2 mg per day (Elsby et al 2012 , Deng et al 2008 , Noe et al 2007 , andKalliokoski and Niemi 2009 ), as well as patients on anystatins with high creatine kinase (CK)levels (>2 X ULN (upper limit of normal) ) at screening will be excluded from the study . Patients on statin medication who are included in the study will have regular monitoring for relevant symptoms and be subject todiscontinuation based on persistent myalgia and/or blood CK levels (Jacobson 2008 ). Cardiovascular risks will be monitored based on changes in vital signs, ECGs and biochemical parameters. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFT) and renal function will be conducted as described in Appendix 2and Appendix 3, respectively, of this protocol. Surveillance of adverse events for identification of idiosy ncratic drugs will be conducted. Refer to the QAW039 Investigator’s Brochure for further information about risks and benefits. 4 Population The study population will include: Males and females aged ≥12 y ears. Asth ma patients who are alread y receiving ICS or ICS with one asthma controller medication (see inclusion criterion 4 for allowed ICS doses and combinations) are the target population for this study . Approximately 1857 patients will be screened to randomize ap proximately 650 patients in a 1:1 ratio into the study worldwide. An estimated 15% of patients will discontinue their study drug during the treatment period ; these patients will not be replaced. 4.1 Inclusion criteria Patients eligible for inclusion in this s tudy must fulfill all of the following criteria:"

Further instructions on when patients have to take the study drug are found in Section 5.5.4 . 5.3 Treatment assignment and randomization At Visit 201, all eligible patients will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to 1 of the 2treatment arms (QAW039 150 mg once daily or matching placebo once daily ) in a 1:1fashion. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from pati ents and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the differen t treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Drug Suppl y Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numb ers to packs containing the investigational drug(s)."
28,page_28,"Novartis Confidential Page 29 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 Randomization will be stratified by patient age at Visit 1 (<18 years or ≥18 years) anduse or non-use of a second asthma controller medication at Visit 1. Treatment randomization will be stratified at the regional level. The randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group. 5.4 Treatment blinding This study consists of a single -blind run-in period (i.e., only patients will be blinded to the identity of the treatment) followed by a double -blind randomized treatment period . Patients, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments, and data analy sts will remain blind to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock, using the following methods: (1) Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone involved in the study with the following exceptions: the external DMC, independent of the QAW039 study team, will have access to unblinded data. Please refer to Section 8.4for details. (2) For QAW039, the identity of the treatment will be concealed by the use of placebo identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste, and odor to QAW039. Unblinding should only occur in the case of patient emergencies (see Section 5.6)and at the conclusion of the study . In addition, the independent DMC will be unblinded for the purpose of safet y reviews. 5.5 Treating the patient Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. 5.5.1 Patient numbering Each patient is uniquely identified by a Subject Number which is composed by the site number assigned by Novartis and a sequential number assig ned by the investigator. Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned the next sequential number by the investigator. The investigator or his/her staff will contact the IRT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to register them into the IRT. The site must select thecase report form (CRF ) book with a matching Subject Number from theelectronic data capture (EDC )system to enter data. If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the Screening period Study Disposition CRF. Each patient is uniquely identified in the st udy by a c ombination of his/her center number and patient number. The center number is assigned by Novartis to the investigative site. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned a patient number by the investigator. At each site, the first patient is assigned patient number 1, and subsequent patients are assigned consecutive numbers (e.g. the second patient is assigned patient number 2,the third"
29,page_29,"Novartis Confidential Page 30 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 patient is assigned patient number 3). The investigator or his/her staff will contact the I RT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to register them into the IRT. Only the assigned patient number must be entered in the field labeled “Patient ID” on the EDC data entry screen (e.g. enter ‘1’, ‘2’, etc.). Once assigned to a patient, the patient number will not be reused. If the patient fails to be randomized for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 days that the patient was not randomized. The reason for not being randomized will be entered on the Screening Log, and the Demograph y electronic case report form ( eCRF )should also be completed. 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each stud y site will be supplied with study drug in packaging of identical appearance. The study drug packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the 2treatment arms and a specific dose. Investigator staff will identify the study drug package(s) to dispense to the patient by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediatel y before dispensing the package to the patient, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patient’s unique subject number. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis Country Pharma Organization (CPO) Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number . The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment The following non -study treatment (rescue medication) hasto be monitored:"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 SABA (such as salbutamol 100 mcg or albuterol 90 mcg) The non-study treatment must be handled and stored according to label, kept in a secured location and dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of dispensing of the above -mentioned treatment in adrug accountability log / inventory log / source documents. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits and at the completion of the study . Patients will be asked to return all unused SABA treatments and packaging atthe end of the study or at the time of discontinuation from the study . 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment Study drug will be single -blind during the placebo run-in and double -blind, placebo - controlled after randomization. At clinic visits, patients will receive a witnessed dose of study drug and, therefore, will be instructed to withhold study drug and SoC asthma therap y prior to each clinic visit. These in-clinic witnessed doses should be given after completion of all pre-dose assessments and at approximately the same time at each clinic visit. Between clinic visits, patients will take study drug once daily in the morning. Patients will be instructed to take their stud y drug at approximately the same time each morning, with or wit hout food. At Visit 101, all eligible patients will be given oral placebo to QAW039 during the placebo run-in period for approximately 1week and will be instructed on the intake of study drug. In order to maintain the blind from the patient’s point of view, investigators must not divulge information regarding the fact that all individuals will be assigned to placebo during the placebo run- in period . At Visit 201, patients will be randomized and stratified according to patient age (<18 or ≥18 years)and use or non-use of a second asthma controller medication at Visit 1. Treatment randomization will be stratified at the regional level. Each randomized patient will then enter a 12-week treatment period where they will receive one of the following 2 treatmen ts: (1) QAW039 150 mg once daily given orally or (2) matching placebo to QAW039 150 mg once daily given orally . The study drug will be dispensed in kits at each site visit during the treatment period to cover the treatment period between patient visits and to allow for late visits and other unforeseen events. All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient during the study must be recorded on the dosage administration record (DAR) CRF. All kits of study drug assigned by IRTwill be recorded/databased in the IRT s ystem. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study drug exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s safety and the validity of the study. The patient must also beinstructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for an y reason to take the stud y drug as prescribed. 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment QAW039 and background asthma therap y dose adjustments are not permitted. QAW039 treatment interruption is only permitted in the following situations: A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study drug until serum β-hCG is performed and found to be negative."
31,page_31,"Novartis Confidential Page 32 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 An investigator considers an interruption is nec essary for the treatment of an adverse event. Interruption to study drug must be recorded on the dosage administration record eCRF. 5.5.6 Rescue medication At Visit 1 all patients will be provided with a SABA (such as salbutamol [100 mcg] or albuterol [90 mcg] ) which they will be instructed to use throughout the study as rescue medication on an ‘as needed basis.’ Patients will be advised that between visits they can take their rescue medication for symptoms of asthma. Rescue medication (i.e.,SABAs )will either be supplied to the study sites locally by Novartis or provided by the study site to the patient and reimbursed b y Novartis. Nebulized salbutamol/albuterol is not allowed as rescue medication and will not be supplied. No other rescue treatment is permitte d and use of a spacer for rescue medication is not allowed at an y time throughout the stud y. To standardize measurements, patients will be instructed not to use their rescue medication upon rising in the morning on days requiring spirometric assessments indicated inTable 6-1, unless absolutely necessary . If rescue medication is taken within 6 hours prior to spirometry , this information will be recorded by the study site staff using the equipment provide d by the central spirometry vendor. Additionally , if rescue medication is taken within 6 hours prior to spirometry at any of the scheduled visits, the visit must be rescheduled to the next possible day. Daily use of rescue medication (the number of puffs taken in the previous 12 hours) will be recorded (once in the morning and once in the evening) b y the patient using ePEF/ eDiary . Unless clinically indicated, the type of rescue medication (i.e.,SABA) a patient uses, the device used to deliver the medica tion (e.g.,dry powder orhydrofluoroalkane (HFA )) and the way it is administered (e.g.,with a spacer device) must not be adjusted. Any changes relating to the above must be recorded on the Concomitant medications eCRF after the start of study drug. 5.5.7 Conco mitant medication The medications in Table 5-1are only permitted under the circumstances given. This table is not considered all-inclusive. Medications should be assessed for adherence to the indication and other inclusion/exclusion criteria.

All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recorded in the concomitant medications / significant non-drug therapies eCRF. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication. If in doubt the investigator should contact the Novartis medical monitor before randomizing a patient or allowing a new medication to be started. 5.5.8 Prohibited medication Use of the treatments display ed in Table 5-3 is NOT allowed after Visit 101. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria and the tables below to see if it is allowed. If in doubt, the investigator must contact the Novartis medical monitor or designee before randomizing a patient or allowing a new medication to be started. This table is not considered all- inclusive. Medications must be assessed for adherence to the indication and other inclusion/exclusion crtieria.

Most often, study treatment discontinuation (TD) and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the Study Team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number study drug name (if available) patient number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un - blinding can be performed at an y time. Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. Study drug must also be discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been inadvertently broken or for any other non -emergency reason. Of note, the patient may continue in the study after discontinuing study drug. 5.6 Stud y completion and d iscontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study treatment Study completion for a patient will occur after he/she has completed 12 weeks of treatment (through to Visit 299) or has prematurel y withdrawn. Completion of the study will be when"
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 all randomized patients have completed 12 weeks of treatment and the post -treatment Follow - up visit. Patients who have been screened when enrolment target has been met will be allowed to proceed onto stud y participation. A Safety Study of QAW039 is planned. Atsites participating in the Safet y Study , patients who successfully complete 12 weeks of trea tment in this study (Study A2317 ) may be offered participation in the Safety Study; patient participation in the Safety Study will be optional. Patients not enteri ng the Safety study will complete the follow -up period and will not be given further access to study drug because the risk/benefit ratio will not yet have been substantiated and there are alread y other marketed therapeutic alternatives available to treat these patients. At the time of study completion or early termination, all patients will be placed on the appropriate asthma treatment as prescribed b y the investigator. The investigator must provide appropriate advice on the continued use of effective contraception for at least one week (at least 5 half-lives of QAW039) after the study completion visit (Visit 299) or premature study drug discontinuation and must follow up with the subject as appropriate at least to the end of this period. The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. 5.6.2 Discontin uation of study t reatment Discontinuation of study drug for a patient occurs when study drug is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the patient or the investigator. Patients may voluntarily discontinue study drug (discontinue double -blind study drug but continue with study participation) at any time. Patients who wish to discontinue double - blind study drug will be asked to remain in the study and complete all study visits. Patients withdrawn from study drug will receive SoC asthma therapy according to investigator judgment. The investigator must discontinue study drug for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation of study drug would negativel y impact the risk/benefit of trial participation. Study drug must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Patient wish; Pregnancy (see Section 6.5.6 and Section 7.6 ); Any situation in which study participatio n might result in a safet y risk to the patient; Female patients non-compliant with the chosen effective method of contraception during the study . The investigator must provide appropriate advice on the continued use of effective contraception for at least one week (at least 5 half -lives of QAW039) after stud y drug discontinuation and follow up with the subject as appropriate at least to the end of this period; Liver laboratory test abnormality / event (see Appendix 2 ): Abnormal liver laboratory results requiring discontinuation –refer to Table 14-2;"
36,page_36,"Novartis Confidential Page 37 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 If the investigator considers it appropriate after the confirmation of a liver safet y monitoring signal: ALT or AST ≥5xUL N, or ALT or AST ≥2.5xUL N andtotal bilirubin ≥1.5xULN ( Appendix 2 ); Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator, taking into consideration the subject’s overall status, prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study; Premature unblinding of study drug for a patient for an y reason; Total white blood cell count <1000 cells/µL ; If patients on statin therapy complain of persistent muscle pain without any obvious cause for greater than 3 day s accompanied b y increase in CK levels >10 x UL N or persistent intolerable muscle pain regardless of the accompany ing CK level ; If a patient develops a medical condition that requires consistent use of prohib ited treatment as per Section 5.5. 8or if patient exhibits a behavior of non -compliance regarding prohibited medication . If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the patient should NOT be considered w ithdrawn from the study . The patient should return to the clinic as soon as possible, after discontinuation of study drug, for a study treatment discontinuation visit. Treatment discontinuation visit assessments detailed in the “treatment discontinuation visit” (TD) in Table 6-1should be completed and recorded in the eCRF. The investigator must determine the primary reason for the patient’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this inf ormation on the dosage administration record eCRF. The investigator and study staff must discuss with the patient his/her continued participation in the study and request he/she continues attending study visits according to the study visit schedule with all assessments completed up to Visit 299. If thepatient cannot or is unwilling to attend any further visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular phone contact with the patient, or with a person pre-designated by the patient. This phone contact should preferabl y be done according to the study visit schedule. After study drug discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should to be collected at clinic visits or via telephone visits: new / concomitant treatments adverse eve nts/Serious Adverse Events (SAE) The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient’s discontinuation from study drug. If study drug discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 5.5.9 . 5.6.2.1 Asthma w orsening alerts The data captured in the patient eDiary will be used in conjunction with the patient’s asthma characteristics to monitor the patient ’s asthma . Patients will be instructed to call the study site if they experience symptoms of worsening asthma. Additionally , the eDiary will be"
37,page_37,"Novartis Confidential Page 38 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 programed to generate some alerts of signs of possible worsening asthma based on data collected . These alerts will be sent to the patient and /orto the investigator. The patient’s personal best PEF in the clinic at Visit 101will be set as the patient’s baseline for the placebo run-in period, and the personal best PEF in the clinic at Visit 199 will be set as the patient’s baseline for the treatment period. 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Patients may voluntaril y withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent from the study is defined as when a patient: Does not want to participate in the study anymore and Does not want any further visits or assessments and Does not want an y further study related contacts and Does not allow anal ysis of alr eady obtained biologic material In this situation, the investigator must make every effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to determine the primary reason for the patient’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the patient’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed inthe assessment table below. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For patients whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time point of his/her scheduled end of study visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time fo r any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons, or for regulatory or medical reasons (including slow enrolment). Should this be necessary , the patient must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a premat urely discontinued patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure"
38,page_38,"Novartis Confidential Page 39 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RBs/IECs) of the earl y termination of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments Visits must be scheduled to allow randomized study drug to be taken in the morning. Table 6-1lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “X”or “S” when the visits are performed. Assessments marked with “S”are documented in source documentation only and will not be entered into the eCRF . Patients must be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients who discontinue study drug before completing the study and accept to remain in the study will return for study visits as described inSection 5.6.2 . If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort should be made to contact them as specified inSection 5.6.2 . At the very least, patients should be asked if they can be contacted by phone by study personnel at the date they would have been scheduled to end the follow up period (4 weeks after premature study drug discontinuation) to ask about concomitant medication use, surgery and procedures, SAEs, AEs and asthma exacerbations. Patients will be required to attend the clinic in the morning at approximately the same time, so that pre-dose FEV1 assessments can be performed between 6AM and 10AM ±1hour . Efficacy and safet y assessments will be completed prior to QAW039 or placebo administration in the clinic. When the following assessments are scheduled to be performed at the same time -point, the order of prio rity will be as follows: 1.Question on medication withholding for spirometry If the patient has not withheld medications as specified in the protocol before a particular visit, the visit must be rescheduled; 2.Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments to be completed in the following order: , AQLQ+12, at certain clinic visits; 3.Vital signs; 4.ECG s; 5.Samples for urinalysis/hematology/blood chemistry (At Visit 1 ,there is no specified order for collect ion of samples. At all other applicable visits, collect samples prior to the 1stpre-dose spirometry [which is the -45 min utepre-dose spirometry ] or between the 1st and 2ndpre-dose spirometry measurements); 6.Samples for radioallergosorbent test ( RAST )/ImmunoCAP test, at ce rtain clinic visit(s) (At Visit 1, there is no specified order for collection of samples. At all other applicable visits , collect samples prior to the 1stpre- dose spirometry [which is the -45 min utepre-dose spirometry ] or between the 1stand 2nd pre-dose spirometry measurements); 7.Spirometry. Spirometry assessments must be timed so that the Visit 1 spirometry assessment and all pre-dose spirometry assessments can be performed between 6 AMand"

Start and end dates of doses of study drug administered since the last dispensing visit will be recorded in the eCRFs (study drug dosage administration record (DAR) -summary page) at visits specified in the table of assessments ( Table 6 -1). All doses of study drug taken at the clinic visits must be from the newl y assigned medication bottles, except at Visit 299 when the medication returned by the patient should be used. 6.4 Efficacy 6.4.1 Spirometry (Pre -dose FEV1 ) All clinic visits must occur in the morning. Please refer to Section 6 andTable 6-1for full details of the scheduling of spirometry measurements. Equipment for spirometry assessments will be provided to all study sites by a C entral Spirometry vendor, and overread of spirometry assessments will be performed by trained spirometry technicians at the central vendor. Please refer to the Spirometry Guidance, in Appendix 5(Spirometry Guidance), for full details on sched uling and performing spirometry. Reversibility testing must be conducted in the morning. 6.4.2 eDiary for daily asthma sy mptoms, and rescue medication use The study will use the asthma diary reported bySantane llo et al (1997) . This asthma diary was validated in studies of patients aged 18 to 65 years (Santanello et al. 1997). The diary was subsequently included as a measure in placebo -controlled studies of montelukast in patients aged 15 years and older (Reiss et al. 1998 ,Malmstrom et al. 1999 ) and shown to be responsive to both montelukast and inhaled beclomethasone therapy in this age range. All patients will complete the asthma diary regardless of age. All patients will be provided with a patient electronic diary (referred to as eDiary or eDiary /ePEF) to record daily asthma symptoms, , and SABA (salbutamol/albuterol) use. Patients will be instructed to routinely complete the patient diary twice daily –at the same time each morning and each evening, approximately 12 hours apart. The eDiary/ePEF recordings are to be reviewed at each clinic visit as detailed in Table 6-1until study completion. Sites and patients will receive appropriate training and guidance on the use of the eDiary /ePEF device. The information detailed below will be collected in the eDiary /ePEF. Daytime asthma symptoms will be rated on a 0 to 6 scale and nocturnal asthma symptoms will be rated on a 0 to 3 scale. 6.4.2.1 Daily symptom scores The asthma diary contains daytime and nocturnal asthma symptom questions as delineated below.

The data captured in the eDiary /ePEF will be used to alert the patient and/or investigator to possible signs of worsening asthma. These alerts include: An increase in SABA use on at least 2 of any 3 consecutive day s exceeding the equivalent of 8 puffs/day (diary alert) . Night time awakenings requiring SABA use on at least 2 out of an y 3 consecutive nights (diary alert) . <60% of PEF compared to baseline (diary alert) . The patient’s personal best PEF in the clinic at Visit 101will be set as the patient’s baseline for the placebo run-in period, and the personal best PEF in the clinic at Visit 199 before dosing will be set as the patient’s baseline for the treatment period. If patients develop any of the above criteria, the patient should notify the investigator and be evaluated b ythe investigator and treated as clinically appropriate. If any of these criteria are met while a patient is in the screening , placebo run-in,or treatment periods of the study , they may be withdrawn if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is appropriat e to do so. Worsening of asthma symptoms may require unscheduled evaluation between visits. Study site personnel must be available to monitor and document the patient’s progress until the asthma worsening has resolved. 6.4.3 Asthma exacerbations The following definitions of exacerbations are used in this study : A severe asthma exacerbation is defined as treatment with ‘rescue’ systemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 day s and hospitalization; or treatment with ‘rescue’ systemic corticosteroids f or greater than or equal to 3 day s and emergency department visit (greater than 24 hours*); or death due to asthma. A moderate asthma exacerbation is defined as treatment with ‘rescue’ systemic corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 3 day s either as an outpatient or in emergency department visits (Emergency department visit less than or equal to 24 hours). *An emergency room visit greater than 24 hours is considered to be a hospitalization ‘Rescue’ systemic corticosteroids are tablets, suspension, or injection, or an increase of a patient’s maintenance systemic corticosteroids of greater than 2 fold (i.e., greater than doubling the maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroids). A single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroid will be considered the eq uivalent to a 3 -day course of sy stemic steroids ( Reddel et al 2009 ).Endotracheal intubations will be captured on the CRF."

If indicated based on medical history and/or sy mptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, a nd pelvic exams will be performed. Abbreviated physical examinations will be performed at visits as indicated inTable 6-1. These will include the examination of the lungs and heart. Information for all physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to informed consent being granted must be included in the Relevant Medical History /Current Medical Conditions screen on the patient’s eCRF. Significant findings made after informed consent is given which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event screen of the patient’s eCRF. 6.5.2 Vital signs Vital signs will be performed at visits specified in the table of assessments (Table 6-1). Measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. 6.5.3 Height and weight Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured at the visits specified in the table of assessments (See Table 6 - 1). Body weight (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram [kg] in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be measured at the visits specified in the table of assessments (See Table 6-1 ). Body Mass Index (BM I) will be calculated as the weight in kg divided by the height in meters squared. 6.5.4 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for analysis of all specimens detailed in this section. Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1 . 6.5.4.1 Hematology Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet count will be measured according to the assessment schedule inTable 6-1.

If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range, the total bilirubin will differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bi lirubin. All patients with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormalities must be followed until the values return to within the normal ranges or until a clinical explanation is identified, even after study drug has discontinued. 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis Urine for urinal ysis and urine chemistry will be collected according to the collection schedule inTable 6-1. All samples for urinalysis and urine chemistry will be sent to the central laboratory foranalysis. The urinaly sis evaluation by the central laboratory will include a urine dipstick for specific gravit y, protein, glucose, leukocy tes and blood and, if required, a microscopic examination. Urine chemistry and microscopic examination of the urine will be performed by the central laboratory as delineated in Table 15-1 “Specific Renal Alert Criteria and Actions” in Section 7.4“Renal Safety Monitoring” of this protocol”. Other reflex testing will be performed as out lined in the laboratory manual. 6.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECGs will be measured according to the assessment schedule inTable 6-1. At Visit 1, an ECG will be measured to test for eligibility for trial inclusion. ECGs must be recorded according to the ECG investigator manual in the supine position to ensure a stable baseline. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection dur ing stud y visits is PRO collection first, followed by ECG, and then other study procedures (see Section 6). The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) must be used for clinical decisions. Single 12 lead ECGs are to be collected with ECG machines supplied by the core laboratory . Full details of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting will be contained in an investigator manual to be provided to each investigator site. The original trace will be sent electronicall y for central review directly from the ECG machine. Two ‘identical’ duplicate print -outs will be generated and kept at the investigator site as source documentation and as back -up for submission to the central laboratory in case of problems with the electronic transmission. Each page of the ECG tracing must be labeled with study number (CQAW039A2317), subject initials (where this is allowed according to local regulations), subject number, date and time, and filed in the study site source documents."

Clinically significant ECG findings prior to dosing with study drug must be discussed with the Novartis responsible person or designee. Clinically significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the medical history /Current medical conditions/AE CRF / e(CRF) page as appropriate. In the even t that the central cardiologist reports that an ECG is abnormal, then the investigator must comment as to whether the ECG abnormality is either clinically significant or clinically insignificant. If necessary a cardiologist may be consulted. 6.5.6 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility All women and adolescent girls of child bearing potential will have serum pregnancy test according to the assessment schedule inTable 6-1. Pregnancy testing will begin at the visit a patient is first identified as being of child bearing potential. A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study drug until serum β- hCG is performed and found to be negative. If positive, the patient must be discontinued fr om study drug and the patient is followed to understand the outcome of the pregnancy . 6.5.7 Appropriateness of safety measurements The safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population. 6.6 Other assessments In addition to patient repor ted outcomes at the visits indicated inTable 6-1, 6.6.1 Clinical Outcome A ssessments (COA s) 6.6.1.1 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) The impact of QAW039 on various aspects of patient’s health status will be assessed by the following measures: Asthma Control Questionnaire -5 (ACQ -5) to assess improvement in asthma sy mptom control ; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire+12 (AQLQ+12) to measure health -related quality of life (HRQOL) ; and All questionnaires will be completed in the language most familiar to the respondent, at the scheduled study visit prior to the patient seeing the investigator for any clinical assessment or evaluation. The patient must be given sufficient instruction, space, time and privacy to complete the questionnaire. The study coordinator must check the responses to the questionnaire for completeness and encourage the patient to co mplete an y missing responses. Available training materials related to the administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites."
54,page_54,"Novartis Confidential Page 55 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 All patients will complete the PRO questions via a handheld electronic device or an electronic tablet. Patients must be given sufficient space and time to complete all study PROs. If patients experience an y difficulties with submission after they complete the PROs, the study staff must assist them with submitting their PRO responses. Attempts must be made to collect responses to all PROs for all patients, including from those who prematurel y discontinue prior to the study evaluation completion visit, however, if patients refuse to complete PROs, this must be documented in study source records. Patient’s refusal to complete study PROs are not protocol deviations. Completed questionnaires will be reviewed and examined by the investigator, before the clinical examination, for responses that may indicate potential adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). The investigator must review not only the responses to the questions in the questionnaires but also for any unsolicited comments written by the patient. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed, then the physician must record the events as per instructions given in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 of the protocol. The PROs ACQ -5,AQLQ+12 , questionnaires should alway s be completed before any other assessments and in the following order when done at the same visits (see Section 6): ACQ - 5 AQLQ+12 Asthma Control Questionnaire (A CQ-5) Inthis study , the ACQ -5 will be used to assess improvements in asthma s ymptom control . The original ACQ consists of 7 items: 5 items on symptom assessment, 1 item on rescue bronchodilator use, and 1 item on airway caliber (% FEV 1predicted). The rescue bronchodilator useand % FEV 1predicted items are not included in the ACQ -5. The ACQ was originall y validated in patients with asthma over aged 17 years (Juniper et al 1999, Juniper et al 2006 ), and is one of several asthma control measures recommended by the GINA Guidelines. The ACQ has been fully validated, including patients aged from 6 to 16 years (Juniper et al 2010) and including a minimal important difference (MID) or smallest change that can be considered clinically important (0.5). The ACQ - 5will be self-administered at the clinic and only takes a few minutes to complete. Patients will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respon d to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ - 5 score is the mean of the 5 questions: therefore, between 0 (totall y controlled) and 6 (severel y uncontrolled) ( Juniper et al 1999 ;Juniper et al 2005; Juniper et al 2006). The ACQ will be collected in an electronic format. The ACQ will be completed by patients at the visits specified in the table of assessments (See Table 6-1). The questionnaire must be completed before the AQLQ+12 and before any other assessments (see Section 6). The appropriate language version(s) of the questionnaire will be used in each participating country . The same language version of the questionnaire must be used by a particular patient throughout the stud y."
55,page_55,"Novartis Confidential Page 56 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 The study coordinator must be familiar with the instrument and the associated user guides and training materials provided. Patients must complete the questionnaire in a quiet area and are allowed to ask questions; however the site staff must take care not to influe nce the patient’s response. In response to a question, patients must be instructed to provide the truest or best response for them. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for 12 y ears and older (AQLQ+12) In this study , the disease -specific AQLQ+12 will be used to measure health -related qualit y of life in patients. The measure was originally validated for use in patients with asthma aged “12 to 80 y ears ( Juniper et al 2005 )”. The AQLQ+12 comprises a total of 32 individual questions that span a total of four domains: symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Test-retest reliability , construct validity (cross -sectional and longitudinal), and responsiveness have been demonstrated ( seeAppendix 8). The AQLQ+12 will be self-administered at the clinic. It takes about 4 to 5 minutes to complete. Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7-point scale (7 = not at all impaired to 1 = severely impaired). The AQLQ+12 yields individual domain scores, which is the mean of all items in each domain, and an overall score, which is the mean of all 32 individual responses. Higher scores indicate less impa irment in HRQOL . The AQLQ+12 will be collected in an electronic format. The questionnaire will be completed by patients at the visits specified in the table of assessments (See Table 6 -1). The appropriate language version(s) of the questionnaire will be used in each participating country . The same language version of the questionnaire must be used by a particular patient throughout the stud y. The study coordinator must be familiar with the instrument and the associated user guides and training materials provided. The patient must complete the questionnaire in a quiet area and be allowed to ask questions; however site staff must take care not toinfluence the patient’s responses.

Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. The occurrence of adver se events must be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, they are considered clinically significant, they require therap y. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse events. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 ."

Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the investigator brochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification (IN) or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient. The investigator must also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the"

All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the react ion; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ( please refer to Annex I V, ICH -E2D Guideline). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse ( please refer to Annex I V, ICH-E2D Guidel ine). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction."
59,page_59,"Novartis Confidential Page 60 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the last study visitmust be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visitshould only be reported to Novartis safet y if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements f or signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re- occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safet y and Epidemiology (DS&E) Department associate may urgentl y require further informa tion from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with European Union (EU)Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. Note: SAEs must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of the investigator learning of its occurrence/r eceiving follow -up information. 7.3 Liver safet y monitoring To ensure patient safet y and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver events has to be followed. The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as (S)AE):"
60,page_60,"Novartis Confidential Page 61 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events , which will require close observation, follow -up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver CRF pages Please refer to Table 14-1in Appendix 2for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 14-1 of Appendix 2should be followed up by the investigator or designated personal at the trial site as summar ized below. Detailed information is outlined in Table 14 -2in Appendix 2 . For the liver laboratory trigger: Repeating the liver function test (LFT) within the next week to confirm elevation. These LFT repeats must be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If this is not possible, then the repeats can be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safet y of the patient. Repeats laboratory must then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local LFTs previousl y conducted that are associated with this event must be reported on the Liver CRF pages. Repeat laboratory tests must be entered on the appropriate unscheduled local laborator y CRF page. If the elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate. For the liver events: Repeating the LFT to confirm elevation as appropriate Discontinuat ion of the investigational drug if appropriate Hospitalization of the patient if appropriate A causalit y assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, co-medications) An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy , based on investigator’s discretion. All follow -up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded on appropriate CRF pages, including the liver event overview CRF pages. 7.4 Renal safety monitoring The following two categories of abnormal renal laboratory values have to be considered during the course of the study : Serum event: Confirmed (after ≥24 hours) increase in serum creatinine (sCr) of ≥25% compared to baseline during normal hy dration status . Urine event Albumin -creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥1g/g or ≥100 mg/mmol ."
61,page_61,"Novartis Confidential Page 62 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 Protein- creatinine ratio (PCR ) ≥1g/g or ≥100 mg/mmol. Every renal laboratory trigger or renal event as defined in Table 15-1 should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site as summarized in Appendix 3. 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (Europe an Medicine Agency (EMA) definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or psy chological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in the DAR (dosageadministration record) eCRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safety database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE.

The pregnancy should be followed upto the birth of the newborn to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form."
62,page_62,"Novartis Confidential Page 63 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 7.7 Idiosy ncratic drug reactions monitoring IDRs are adverse drug reactions that do not occur in most patients (i.e., they are rare, occurring 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 patients) and do not result from known pharmacological effects of a drug. Their onset is unpredi ctable and they may involve one or more organ systems, most notably the immune sy stem, liver and blood cells. The investigator should pay special attention to any adverse events which may be a potential IDR reported by a patient. If such an event occurs, the investigator should report the event as per standard adverse event reporting procedures (i.e., serious adv erse events for those meeting serious criteria and non-serious adverse events for those meeting non-serious adverse event criteria as defined in the protocol). The investigator may be also be contacted by Novartis regarding AEs that may resemble an IDR. A list of terms considered IDRs are provided in Appendix 4 . Events with potential to be IDRs will be identified thorough a pre-specified search algorithm based on the standardized medical dictionary forregulatory activities (MedDRA ) Queries as described in the study analysis plan. These events will be reviewed by the DMC on a regular basis. 8 Data revie w and database management 8.1 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eSource or eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and good clinic al practice (GCP )compliance and the quality /integrit y of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monit oring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analytics organization may analyze data and identify risks and trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the patient (a signe d copy is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the"
63,page_63,"Novartis Confidential Page 64 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Oracle Clinical/Remote Data Capture (OC/RDC )system. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the s ystem until they have been trained. Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and after data entry and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected online by the designated investigator site staff. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database management and quality control Novartis staff ( or contract research organization ( CRO ) working on behalf of Novartis) review the data entered into the CRFs by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or additions. Queries are sent to the investigational site using an electronic data query . Designated investigator site staff is require d to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) classification system. Concomitant procedures, non-drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the m edical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis (or a designated CR O). Spirometry and ECG readings will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Diary data will be entered into an electronic diary by the patient andpatients will fill in their PRO data in a site-based tablet. The system will be supplied by a vendor(s), who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronicall y to Novartis personnel (or designated CRO). Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a v endor, who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis."
64,page_64,"Novartis Confidential Page 65 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data Monitoring Committee An independent, external data monitoring committee (DMC) will be set up to review safet y data (including specific safet y summaries for adolescent participants) from this trial and other Phase 3 trials in the QAW039 asthma development program. The DMC will consist of a group of experts independent of the sponsor ;analy ses for the DMC will be prepared by individuals independent of the sponsor and sponsor personnel will remain fully blinded to results until the final clinical database lock as described inSection 5.4. Based on the safety implications of the data, the DMC may recommend modification or termination of the study . Nostatistical adjustment will be made to the final analy sis.Full details on procedures, the DMC and futility criteria will be specified in a DMC charter. 8.5 Adjudication Committee Not required. 9 Data analy sis The analysis will be conducted on all subject data at the time the trial ends. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. The primary efficacy analysis of this pivotal trial will be based on the data of this trial alone. In addition, efficacy data will also be pooled with the other identical Phase 3 trial and the pooled data will be used to fully characterize efficacy in the asthma patient population studied in these trials. 9.1 Analysis sets The screened set (SCR) will in clude all patients who provided informed consent. The full anal ysis set (FAS) will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. It was considered reasonable to limit the FAS to patients who took trial medication, because th e decision on whether or not study drug is started will not be influenced by the treatment group assignment due to the effective treatment blinding procedures described inSection 5.4 . Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization. The per-protocol set (PPS) will include all patients in the FAS without any major protocol deviations such as violation of major entry criteria or low compliance. Patients may also be considered censored for the PPS analy sis at the time of major post-basel ine protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations will be defined in the study specification document"

Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they received. The safet y set (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one dose of double -blind study drug. Patients will be anal yzed according to the treatment they received. The analy sis of the primary objective will be performed on the FAS. The PPS will be used for the supportive analysis of the primary and the secondary variables. The FAS will be used for the analysis of all other efficacy variables. The SAF will be used in the analy sis of all safet y variables. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Patient demograp hics and baseline characteristics measured before randomization including age (calculated from date of birth to date of Visit 1), sex, race, ethnicit y, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), relevant medical history , including smoking history , asthma duration, use of long-acting beta -agonists, ICS dose ranges (medium , high) pre-and post-bronchodilator FEV1, percent predicted FEV1, , AQLQ+12 score, , number of exacerbations in the previous year, and daytime asthma symptom scores will be summarized by treatment group for the FAS. Categorizations of age will include at least the categories of <18, 18 to <65, 65-74, 75- 84 and ≥85 years of age. 9.3 Treatments The duration of exposure, the number of patients randomized who comple ted the foreseen course of study drug and the number of patients who discontinued from the study drug will be summarized. Medications started and stopped prior to study drug, taken concomitantly , and started following last study drug dose (if applicable) will be summarized by treatment group in separate tables in the SAF. Concomitant therapies will be recorded, listed and summarized separately for asthma related medications / non-drug therapies and other medications. Concomitant asthma related medications will be summarized by pre-defined category . Concomitant medications not related to asthma will be summarized by anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) class and preferred term. More than one ATC class per medication is possible and the medication will be reported under all applicable classes. SABA usage (number of puffs) during the placebo run-inperiod will be summarized. Usage of asthma medication (e.g. ,LABA, ICS) at baseline will be summarized (if applicable). Patients taking prohibited concomitant medications will be noted in the summary of protocol deviations. Compliance with study drug over the entire study will be summarized as the percentage of days with study drug intake during the period from first intake to last intake. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s) The primary analysis for this study will be conducted according the intention to treat (ITT) principle."
66,page_66,"Novartis Confidential Page 67 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 9.4.1 Primary Variable(s) The primary variable for this study is the change from baseline in pre -dose FEV1 at the end of 12 weeks of treatment . Pre-dose FEV1 is the average of the two FEV1 assessments taken at 45 minutes and 15 minutes prior to the dosing of study drug at the clinic visit. The baseline FEV1 is defined as mean of the two FEV1 assessments prior to the first dose of study drugat the randomization visit. If any one of these assessments is missing (or is not confirmed to be pre-dose), then the remaining non-missing observation will be considered as baseline. If both assessments are missing (or are not confirmed to be pre-dose) then the last available FEV1 measurement prior to Day 1 on study drug will be used for baseline. If the FEV1 measurements are missing both on Day 1 and at the placebo run-in or screening visits, the respective baseline values will be set to missing. The secondary variables are daytime asthma sy mptoms , total daily SABA use and AQLQ+12. Their definition and analysis is described in Section 9.5. Efficacy measurements (i.e.,daily asthma symptom scores, FEV1) taken within 7 days of systemic corticosteroid use and/or within 6 hours of rescue medication (SABA) use will be censored (set to missing). Additionally , if the pre-dose FEV1 is taken within 12 hours of LABA (including fixed dose combinations of LABA and ICS) use or 24 hours of tiotropium, then the individual FEV1 value will be set to missing. 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis The primary objective of the study is to evaluate superiority of QAW039 150 mg once daily over placebo (with SoC asthm a therap yas the background therapy ) by testing the following null hy pothesis (H 0) versus the alternative h ypothesis (H a): H0: There is no difference in the change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 at week 12 post- baseline for the patients treated with QAW039 150 mg once daily compared with placebo. Ha: There is a difference in the change from baseline in pre-dose FEV1 at week 12 post- baseline for the patients treated with QAW039 150 mg once dail ycompared with placebo. Familywise type I error rate control The famil ywise type I error rate will be controlled at the two-sided 5% level across the primary and secondary null hypotheses using the closed testing procedure shown in Figure 9- 1using the graphical m ethod of Bretz et al 2009 . In this closed testing procedure ,the primary null hy pothesis about pre -dose FEV1 acts as a gatekeeper for the secondary null hy potheses."

Abbreviations: FEV1 (forced expirator y volume in 1 second); AQLQ+12 (a sthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older). Initiall y, the alpha is assigned to the primary null hypothes is. Once the primary null hypothesis has been rejected, then 98% of the alpha will be distributed equally amongst the secondary null hypotheses of daytime asthma symptoms and total daily SABA use, respectivel y, and 2% of the alpha will be assigned to the null hy pothesis forAQLQ+12. If one of the secondary null hypotheses is rejected, its local significance level will be propagated to the other secondary null hy pothes e sas illustrated in Figure 9 -1. Statistical model for primary variable The primary efficacy variable will be analyzed on FAS using an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with factors for treatment group, age group (<18 vs. ≥18 years), use or non-use of a second asthma controller medication at study entry, and region, as well as the baseline daytime asthma sy mptom score, baseli ne total daily SABA use and baseline pre- dose FEV1 as continuous linear covariates. The least squares mean (“adjusted mean”) change from baseline for each treatment group, the difference in the least squares mean changes between the two treatment groups (QAW039 150mg –placebo), and the two -sided adjusted 95% confidence interval along with the p -value for the difference will be obtained and combined from the primary analy sis model through the multiple imputation approach described in Section 9.4.3 .

Missing data after discontinuation of double -blind study treatment will be imputed using the jump to reference approach (Carpenter et al 2013) . Intermittent missing data prior to discontinuation of double - blind study treatment will be imputed under a missing at random assumption. A large number of imputed datasets will be created, with their number chosen based on computational feasibility, but at least 1,000. Each dataset will be analyzed using the model described in Section 9.4.2 and the results will be combined using Rubin’s rule (Barnard and Rubin 1999 )for final inference . Theaverage of the two FEV1 assessments will only be formed after multiple imputations so that if one of the two FEV1 assessments at a visit is missing, the average will be between the one available assessment and a second imputed assessment. In the situation when both FEV1 values at the randomization visit are missing, the values from preceding visits will be used as described in Section 9.4.1 . Retrieved data after the discontinuation of study drug(retrieved drop-out) will remain in the anal ysis without further imputation for all treatment groups . 9.4.4 Supportive analy ses The primary and the secondary anal yses will be repeated for the PPS. The analysis results and the imputed data for different methods for imputing missing data will be compared. In a sensitivity analysis, data will be analyzed in the same manner as for the primary analysis, but with missing data imputed using pattern mixture approach combining the jump to reference and the randomized -arm missing at random approaches (Carpenter, et al 2013) by distinguishing the following two cases: 1.A continued treatment effect for QAW039 150 mg patients being lost to follow -up for reasons likel y to be unrelated to study drug ( e.g. lost to follow -up, withdrew consent) will be assumed (randomized -arm missing at random). 2.Same treatment effect as placebo will be imputed for QAW039 150 mg patients that discontinue study drug and are lost to follow- up due to (or following a study drug discontinuation due to) lack of efficacy , adverse events or death (jump to reference). If feasible ,retrieved drop-out will be used to impute missing post-study drug discontinuation data as a sensitivity analysis. While retrieved drop-outs may be a particularly suitable basis for imputing data for non-retrieved drop-outs as it is most close to the ITT principal, this analysis may not be feasible or may require simplification of the imputation model, because observed post -study drug discontinuation data ma y be sparse. The primary efficacy variable will also be analyzed using a repeated measurement analysis model in which treatment, age group (<18 vs. ≥18 years), use or non-use of a second asthma controller medication at study entry, region, visit (where FEV 1measurement is taken per"
69,page_69,"Novartis Confidential Page 70 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 assessment schedule Table 6-1)andtreatment -by-visit interaction will be included as fixed - effect factors ,and baseline pre-dose FEV1 value as well as the baseline daytime asthma symptom score , baseline total daily SABA useand visit-by-baseline FEV1 as covariates. A common unstructured covariance matrix among visits for each treatment group will be used. The analysis will be performed based on all available on-treatment data up to week 12 and based on a likelihood method with an assumption of missing at random (MAR )for missing data assuming a hy pothetical situation of continued treatment. On -treatment data is defined as all available data collected while patients took the study drugup totheWeek 12visit. The estimated treatment differences for all treatment comparisons will be tabulated along with the associated 95% confidence intervals and two -sided p -values. In a tipping point analysis it will be explored by how much the imputed contin uous missing data for the investigational and the placebo arm would have had to change compared to the imputations in the primary analysis in order to alter the trial conclusions. This will include an exploration of the possibility that patients with missing data from the investigational arm has worse outcomes than patients with missing data from the placebo arm. In a further rank-based sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint, patients will be ranked from smallest to largest in the following sequence with high ranks denoting greater efficacy . 1.patients that died 2. patients that withdrew from the trial 3.patients that completed the trial Within categor y 3, patients with higher FEV1 change from baseline will be ranked greater than patients with lower chang e from baseline . Within categor ies1and 2, patients that withdraw from the trial later will get higher ranks than patients that withdraw early. In case patients withdraw at same study day, patients with higher FEV1 change from baseline at the last assessm ent are assigned a higher rank. In case of ties in the FEV1 value s or no available post-baseline assessments of the primary variable , we use midranks. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test stratified by age group (<18 vs. ≥18 years), use or non-use of a second asthma controller medication, and region will be used to analy ze the ranked data. Subgroups The primary and secondary analyses will also be conducted by subgroup including for key demographic (e.g. ,age, sex, race, BM I, geographic region) and disease related subgr oups (e.g. number of exacerbations in the previous year, use or non -use of a second asthma controller medication , baseline FEV1 tertiles, ACQ tertiles, ). 9.5 Analysis of secondary variables 9.5.1 Efficacy variables The secondary variables of this study are change from baseline in daytime asthma symptoms , change from baseline in total daily SABA use, and change from baseline in AQL Q+12 over the 12 weeks of treatment. The local significance level for each secondary null hy pothesis will be determined based on the closed testing procedure specified byFigure 9-1. A range of"
70,page_70,"Novartis Confidential Page 71 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 sensitivity analyses will be conducted on secondary endpoint s under different missing data handling approaches in a similar fashion as those described in Section 9.4.4. 9.5.1.1 Daytime asthma sy mptoms in patients Daytime asthma symptoms areevaluated through four questions and each of them will be rated on a scale of 0 to 6. Higher scores indicate more severe asthma - related symptoms. A mean score will be calculated for the responses to 4 questions. The main analysis of the secondary endpoint of day time sy mptoms will be performed for all patients over the entire age range (12 years and older). The baseline of daytime asthma symptoms will be defined as the average of the mean daytime asthma symptom score during the placebo run-in period. The mean of change from baseline in the daytime symptom scores over the 12 weeks of treatment will be analy zed using an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model in a similar fashion as the primary efficacy variable. T he null hypothesis is that the treatment diffe rence compared to placebo over the 12weeks of treatment = 0, while the alternative hypothesis is that the treatment difference to placebo over the 12 weeks of treatment ≠ 0.Thismodel will be fitted to each of multiple imputations generated using a jump -to-reference approach as for the primary anal ysis. The asthma diary included in this study to measure daytime asthma symptoms was validated in studies of patients aged 18 to 65 years (Santanello et al 1997). It was subsequently included as a measure in placebo -controlled studies of montelukast in patients aged 15 years and older (Reiss et al. 1998 andMalmstrom et al. 1999) and sho wn to be responsive to both montelukast and inhaled beclomethasone therapy in this age range. Given the performance characteristics, particularly the responsiveness to asthma therapies, of the asthma diary are known for patients aged 15 y ears and older, a supportive anal ysis of the secondary endpoint of daytime s ymptoms will be included and be limited to patients aged 15 y ears and older. 9.5.1.2 Total daily use of SABA Total daily use of SABA (the number of puffs taken in the previous 24 hours) by the patient will be analyzed using ePEF/ eDiary data. The baseline of SABA usewill be defined as the average of total daily SABA useduring the placebo run-in period .The mean of change from baseline in the total daily use of SABA over the 12 weeks of treatment will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model in a similar fashion as the primary efficacy variable. T he null hypothesis is that the treatment difference compared to placebo over the 12weeks of treatment = 0, while the alternative hypothesis is that the treatment difference to placebo over the 12 weeks of treatment ≠ 0.Thismodel will be fitted to each of multiple imputations generated using a jump -to-reference approach as for the primary analy sis. 9.5.1.3 AQLQ+12 The change from baseline in AQL Q+12 at week 12 will be analy zed using an ANCOVA model in a similar fashion as the primary efficacy variable. The baseline of AQLQ+12 is defined as the last assessment prior to the first dose of study drug.Missing data of AQLQ+12 overall score will be imputed a jump -to-reference approach as for the primary anal ysis."

Adifference of 112mL in pre- dose FEV 1during treatment was assumed ,which is similar to the model -averaged effect seen in study QAW039A2206 . The standard deviation (SD)of 380 mL and between -visit correlation for pre-dose FEV 1wasbased on study QAW039A2206 in a similar population.

Simulations were used todetermine the sample size due to the complex jump -to- reference missing data imputation approach for the primary anal ysis. Under the outlined assumptions, a sample size of 650 patients (325 per arm) will be needed to have 90% power to observe a statistical ly significant difference between QAW039 and placebo at the two-sided 5% significance level in the primary analysis as shown in Table 9-1. The table also shows the sensitivity of the power to deviations from the assumptions.

The local significance level for each secondary null hypothesis will be determined based on the closed testing procedure shown in Figure 9 -1. As differences in FEV1 to placebo for QAW039 150 mgonce daily and montelukast 10 mg once daily appeared to be of similar magnitudes in study QAW039 A2206, the power calculations for the two secondary objectives (change from baseline in daytime asthma symptoms and change from baseline in total daily SABA use) are based on the assumptions from the results of two studies comparing montelukast 10 mg once daily with placebo (Reiss et al 1998 ,Malmstrom et al 1999). These studies suggest an averaged difference of 0.26 for change from baseline in daytime asthma symptoms between montelukast and placebo after 12 weeks of treatmen t and a SDof 0.94. The two studies also su ggest an averaged difference of - 1.34 point difference in the change from baseline in the number of daily SABA puffs between montelukast and placebo with a standard deviation of 3.82. We assume a clinically import ant true improvement of at least 0.5in AQLQ+12 after 12 weeks treatment for patients that remain on treatment anda standard deviation (SD) of 1.

Abbreviation: AQLQ+12 (asthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older). 10 Ethical considerations 10.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, United Stat es Code of Federal Regulations ( US CFR) 21, and Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. 10.2 Informed consent procedures Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent, or, if applicable after such consent has been provided by a legall y acceptable representative(s) of the patient. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedures (e.g.all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the patient source documents. For trials using an Electronic Informed Consent system where a date/timestamp is automatically generated, the sy stem -generated date/timestamp is sufficient; additional input of the date at the time of consent is not required b y the patient. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study . Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/IEC approval."

If there is any question that the patie nt will not reliably compl y, they must not be entered in the study . 10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board/Indepen dent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to patients. Prior to study start, the inves tigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to Novarti s monitors, auditors, Novartis Quality Assurance representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/I ECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority , the investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. 10.4 Publication of study protocol and results The key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study complet ion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 10.5 Qualit y Control and Quality Assurance Novartis maintains a robust Qualit y Management (QM) system that includes all activities involved in quality assurance and qualit y control, including the assignment of roles and responsibilities, the reporting of results, and the documentation of actions and escalation of issues identified during the review of qualit y metrics, incidents, audits and inspections. Audits of investigator sites, vendors, and Novartis sy stems are performed by Novartis Pharma Auditing and Compliance Quality Assurance, a group independent from those involved in cond ucting, monitoring or performing quality control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowledge/risk based approach. Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal standard operating procedures (SOPs), and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 11 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safet y of patients should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances including incidental collection is an investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any"
76,page_76,"Novartis Confidential Page 77 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol , other than the purpose of the study . If despite this interdiction, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and not use it for any purpose other than the study , except for the appropriate monitoring on study participants. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IRB/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 11.1 Protocol a mendments Any change or addition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safet y of any patient included in this study , even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 7 Safety Monitoring must be followed. 12 References Refer ences are available upon request.

Spirometers must have the capacity to print forced vital capacity (FVC) tracings. All spirometry values should be reported at body temperature and pressure saturated (BTPS ) by the method established by the manu facturer. Calibration The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for the study are performed. Calibration reports should be printed and stored as source data at the site. Preparing the test subject On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following: Coffee, tea, chocolate, cola and other caffeine -containing beverages and foods and ice- cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry Exposure to environmental smoke, dust or areas with strong odors Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study . A seated position with nose clips is recommended to reduce risks related to dizziness or sy ncope. When possible, spirometry should be conducted by the same technician using the same spirometer. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry visits should start at approximatel y the same time of day at each visit. Performing Spirometry The subject’s age, height and gender will be entered into the spirometer. It is important that the height is measured accuratel y at the study site. Spirometry , an effort-dependent test, require s careful instruction and cooperation of the subject. The technician should ensure a good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the subject’s posture is correct. The subject should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, followed by maximum forced expiration until no more air can be exhaled or for at least 6 seconds. Expiration must be rapid with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability . Acceptability criteria should be applied before repeatability is determined."
85,page_85,"Novartis Confidential Page 86 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Protocol No. CQAW 039A231 7 Number of trials A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a subject is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be discontinued. Acceptability An acceptable maneuver has the following characteristics: No hesitation or false start; A rapid start; No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures No earl y termination of exhalation (minimum exhalation time of 6 seconds is recommended andno volume change for at least 1 second) or the subject cannot continue to exhale further . Overall acceptability will be determined by expert over -read b y spirometry vendor . Repeatability The 2 largest forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary by more than 0.150 L. If patient does not meet the repeatability or acceptability criteria during the screening period , patient may be rescreened once or allow one spirometry retest. Recording of data The greatest FEV1 from any of the acceptable curves are recorded. (The greatest FEV1 may not necessarily result from the same acceptable curve). Predicted normal For all patients, this study will utilize the global lung function 2012 equations (GLI2012) published by Quanjer et al 20122or Japanese Respiratory Societ y3. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS Task force: Standardization of Lung Function Testing1. A pre-bronchodilator spirometry * assessment should be performed after withholding of specified medications as specified in Table 5-2 “Medications to be withheld prior to spirometry ”. Administer 400µg of salbutamol/albuterol (or equivalent) following the completion of the pre - bronchodilator assessment*. Spacers will be allowed for the administration of salbutamol/albuterol (or equivalent) for reversibility testing. Post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment is then performed approximately 10 to 15 minutes after administ ration of the salbumatol/albuterol. Reversibility is calculated as:"
