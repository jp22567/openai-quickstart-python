The study consists of approximately 90 subjects who will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to active treatment (approximately 60 subjects ) or placebo (approximately 30 subjects ). Subjects will receive one infusion per day of active or placebo treatment for 5 consecutive days during week 1 and week 13. The study duration for the subjects will be approximately 7 months. Each infusion will have a duration of approximately with a maximum of . The infusion of active and placebo agents wil l be identical to maintain blinding. The following measures will be taken to ensure adequate allocation concealment during infusions: blinding of subjects, trial partners, study coordinators, physicians, and cognitive /motor test administrators to treatmen t allocation ; use of blinded Outcomes Assessors and unblinded Infusion Nurses; and measures to block view of the infusion setup to avoid unblinding. All subjects will undergo a screening visit , including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan , baseline visit, two treatment periods, follow-up visits, and an end-of-study/early-termination visit. During each 5-day treatment period, administration of GRF6021/placebo can occur in an inpatient/hospital setting or in outpatient infusion centers or equivalent facilities with appropri ate medical personnel . All infusions must be performed by adequately trained personnel under the supervision of the investigator. Safety and tolerability assessments will occur at every visit. Neurocognitive and motor assessments will be performed at baseline and at periodic visits following dosing. Subjects who provide explicit consent to undergo a second , optional MRI scan will have an additional MRI scan at Visit 16 to assess for changes from screening . Objectives: The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of an infusion dosing regimen of GRF6021 in subjects with PD and cognitive impairment. As a secondary objective, the study will assess the potential effects of GRF60 21 on cognition and motor function as well as changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters, vital signs, body weight, and the Sheehan-Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS). The exploratory objectives include serial compositional analysis of plasma to identify"

Nonclinical studies conducted by Alkahest have demonstrated that both Young Plasma and GRF6021 confer beneficial outcomes in cognitive decline , motor function , neuro inflammation, synaptic density, and neurogenesis in mouse models (ALK-2015- R002, VIV -2016-R003, VIV-2016-R009, VIV -2016-R014, VIV -2016-R020, VIV-2016-R021, VIV -2016-R024, VIV-2017-R025, VIV -2017-R036, VIV -2017-R038, VIV-2018-R069, 2018- CET01 , 2018- CRL03, 2018- QPS01 ). Initial Alkahest nonclinical studies were performed to test whether the positive effects observed with young mouse plasma could be rep licated using Young Plasma. Treatment of aged NODscid (non- obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency) mice with Young Plasma (100-150 µl per injection, two injections per week for 3-5 weeks) resulted in improved cognitive and motor performance in st andard behavioral tests ( ALK-2015-R002). These cognitive changes were further supported by electrophysiological and histological correlates of enhanced memory. Together, these results provided support for the hypothesis that young human plasma infusions may have functional clinical benefits, potentially ameliorating or halting the progression of age -related cognitive decline. Subsequent nonclinical studies at Alkahest were performed to test the effects of GRF6021 using various dosing paradigms in NODscid, NSG (NODscid Gamma) , C57BL/6J , and Line 61 α -Synuclein (α -Syn) transgenic mice. Initially, mice were dosed with 150 µL of Young Plasma, GRF6021, or saline (control) via IV infusions 2 times per week for 5 weeks ( VIV-2016-R003). A subsequent study examined the same dosing regimen for a period of 23 weeks, to assess the effects of treatment on age- dependent changes in behavioral and cognitive funct ion over a period of approximately 6 months ( VIV-2016-R014) . Following these studies, a novel dosing regimen for GRF6021 that consisted of one 150 µL dose every day for 7 consecutive days (referred to as “pulsed dosing”) was assess ed, both alone and compared to other intermittent weekly dosing regimens ( VIV-2016-R009, VIV -2016- R021, VIV -2016- R024, VIV-2017-R025, 2018- CET -01, 2018- CRL03 , 2018- QPS01 ). Add i tional stud ies examined dosing of 150 µL for 5 consecutive days ( VIV-2017-R038) as w ell as subsequent booster dosing for 5 consecutive days ( VIV-2017-R036) which is the pulsed- dosing regimen chosen for ALK60 21-201. These studies demons trated that pulse d dosing with GRF6021 led to significant improvements in cognitive performance, motor function, and histological correlates. Furthermore, t he beneficial effects lasted up to 3 months after the end of dosing, suggesting that continuous repeat dosing may not be required ( VIV-2017- R036 , VIV-2017-R038). After pulsed dosing with GRF6021 in old mice , there is a well -defined timecourse of effects on the brain. Within hours of the end of dosing, C- fos expression increases, demonstrating that GRF6021 administered intravenously results in neuronal activation ( 2018- CET01 ). Over the course of a few days to a few weeks, there is a reduction in age- related neuroinflammation , and an improvement in age- related deficits in cognition and locomotion ( 2018- CET -01, 2018- CRL03 , 2018- QPS01 ). Lastly, there is an increase in synaptic density and hippocampal neurogenesis; the latter lasts for up to 11 weeks after the end of dosing ( VIV-2017- R038). Together, these studies indicate that 5 consecutive days of dosing (“pulsed dosing”) of GRF6021 and cognitive and other testing for a period of 11 weeks thereafter, followed by a second “booster” dosing period is a reasonable study design in human subjects (VIV-2017-R036)."

Studies were performed using relevant viruses or models of human viruses that represent a wide range of physicochemic al properties. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 was used as a relevant bloodborne pathogen, bovine viral diarrhea virus was used to model hepatitis C virus (HCV) , and pseudorabies virus was used as a surrogate for large, enveloped deoxyribonuclei c acid ( DNA) viruses to model hepatitis B virus (HBV) for which there is not practicable assay system. Reovirus type 3 was used to model non- enveloped viruses, hepatitis A virus was used as a relevant non -enveloped virus, and porcine parvovirus was used as a surrogate for human parvovirus B19. The clearanc e capacities for all individual processing steps that achieved at least 1 log10 were combined to determine the overall clearance capacities, which demonstrate that the manufacturing process for GRF6021 has the capacity to remove and/or inactivate a diverse variety of enveloped and non- enveloped virus challenges and thereby provides assurance that the process yields a margin of safety from the risk of transmission of infectious viruses. GRF6021 is contraindicated in patients with severe anemia, congestive h eart failure, or increased blood volume ( PI) and these are exclusion criteria in this study. GRF6021 is depleted of the majority of immunogenic proteins during the manufacturing process, and thus is not expect ed to alter the blood typing characteristics of the recipient and should not sensitize humans to its subsequent administration . ABO antigen typing is not required prior to administration. GRF6 021 is not expected to significantly alter the urinalyses of recipients, their bleeding times, coagulation times, prothrombin times, prothrombin consumption, platelet counts, or fibrinogen levels when given in quantities of up to 1000 mL Based on the cumulative review (PSUR ), the production steps taken to increase the safety margin and avoid virus trans missions, and the multiple safety minimization steps implemented in this study, the benefit -risk balance for GRF6021 as an investigative product in PD-MCI and PDD is favorable. 2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS There is no known reported benefit of administering GRF60 21 to patients with PD-MCI or PDD . 3 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GRF60 21, a human fraction administered by IV infusion, in subjects with PD and cognitive impairment. Secondarily, this study aims to assess the effects of GRF60 21 on subjects’ cognitive and motor function. E xploratory objectives include blood and plasma collection to identify specific biomarkers associated with cognitive and motor changes and/or indicators of PD -MCI and PDD progression. In addition, MRI of the brain will be conducted after the second treatment period in consenting subjects to identify potential therapeutic effect s of GRF6021. 4 STUDY DESIGN AND ENDPOINTS 4.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY DESIGN This will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study conducted at up to 40 sites in the U S and ex -"

During the screening p eriod (Day -35 through Day -8) , subjects will undergo all screening assessments, including a screening MRI and an echocardiogram, and complete two training sessions on the Continuity and Power of Attention, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory on the CDR- CCB. During the Baseline Vi sit (Day -7 through Day -1) , subjects will complete cognitive and motor testing . Subjects will then be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio to GRF6021 (Group 1) or placebo (Group 2). There will be two ( 2) dosing periods. Each dosing period (Treatment 1 , starting at Week 1 ; and Treatment 2, starting at Week 13) consists of 5 consecutive days (“pulsed dosing”) of IV infusions of of either GRF60 21 or placebo. During each 5-day treatment period, the administration of GRF6021/placebo will occur in a setting with appro priate medical monitoring by adequately trained personnel. The infusions can occur in the inpatient/hospital setting or in an outpatient infusion center or equivalent medical facility . Following a 4-hour post- infusion monitoring period, the subject may return home if medically stable based on the investigator’s clinical judgement . Should further monitoring be required, subjects may need to remain at and/or be transferred to an appropriate facility for extended outpatient monitoring and/or inpatient observation. Safety and tolerability assessments will occur at every visit. C ognitive and motor testing will be performed at Baseline and at periodic interim visits following dosing. Cognitive and motor t esting may take up to approximately 2.5 hours . It is pre ferred that the sequence of tests administered should be consistent for all subjects. S ubjects (and /or their trial partners , if applicable) may take breaks between assessments as needed. In the event of early termination of a subject who has received at least one infusion , the end of study procedures will be performed unless the subject has withdrawn consent. A comprehensive efficacy and safety assessment of all data in toto will be conducted at the end of the study. Subjects will also be invited to participate in an additional MRI obtained at Visit 16 to detect potential changes in brain atrophy, cortical thinning, functional connectivity , and cerebral blood flow after treatment. The MRI procedure, as well as the poten tial risks and benefits, will be explained to all study participants. Participation in the Visit 16 MRI scan is optional and not required for inclusion in the study. The overall duration of the study /recruitment period is approximately 24 months from study initiation (i.e., following consent of f irst subject ) to study completion (i.e., last subject, last visit). The subject participation period is approximately 7 months from Screening through End of Study, unless prematurely discontinued. 4.2 STUDY ENDPOINTS 4.2.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT Primary Endpoint: • Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs identified by MedDRA PT and grouped by MedDRA S OC. 4.2.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS This study is not powered to detect statistically significant differences in cognitive or motor domains between"

A copy of the site ’s drug disposal policy should be maintained or referenced in the investigator’s study file. 7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND SCHEDULE 7.1 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 7.1.1 STUDY SPECIFIC PROCEDURES 7.1.1.1 Screening Procedures During screening, the following will be performed: • S-STS • Assessment of PD , including Hoehn and Yahr • MHIS • MoCA • Medical history • Demographics • Review of medications • Vital signs (including seated, supine, and standing BP )"
28,page_28,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 29 of 111 • Physical examination • 12-Lead ECG • Screening Safety Lab Panel and pregnancy test for WOCB P • Echocardiogram* • Screening MRI * *Note : it is recommended , but not required , that the echocardiogram and screening MRI be performed after all other screening procedures have been completed, and the subject meets all criteria for inclusion into the study. The echocardiogram and screening MRI may be completed in any order. Detailed descript ions of each of these procedures are provided in the sections immediately following. Information pertaining to all study activities performed during screening, and the sequence of events, is provided in Section 7.3.1 Screening . 7.1.1.1.1 Sheehan -Suicidality Tracking Scale The S- STS was developed to provide a brief but efficient instrument for use in assessing change in suicidal ideation and behavior while providing a comprehensive description of suicidal ideation and behavior. The primary goals in the design of the S- STS were for th e scale to be: 1) short and inexpensive ; 2) simple, clear, and easy to administer or self -rate; 3) highly sensitive (i.e., able to detect a high proportion of patients who are suicidal); 4) s pecific (i.e., able to screen out those who are not suicidal); 5) sensitive to change in suicidal ideation and behavior; 6) c ompatible with the regulatory categories of assessment for suicidal ideation and behavior; 7) useful in clinical as well as research settings; 8) useful in detecting an efficacy signal for anti-suicidal medications; and 9) capable of use in pediatric and geriatric settings ( Sheehan 2014 ). The standard version of the S- STS ( Appendix 7 ) is a 16 -item scale that assesses the seriousness of suicidality phenomena on a Likert- type scale (0 -4) ranging from “not at all” (0) to “extremely” (4). It also assesses the frequency of key phenomena and the overall time spent in suicidality. 7.1.1.1.2 Assessment of Parkinson’s Disease and Cognitive Impairment The diagnosis of PD will be verified using MDS -PD criteria (Postuma 2015)( Appendix 8). The prerequisite to apply the MDS -PD criteria is the presence of parkinsonism, defined as bradykinesia, in combination with either rest tremor, rigidity, or both. These features must be clearly demonstrable and not attributable to confounding factors ( Postuma 2015). The stage of the disease will be classified using the Hoehn and Yahr scale. Subjects will also be evaluated for PD -MCI (Level I) and PDD based on MDS crit eria ( Litvan 2012, Emre 2007) . PD -MCI is a syndrome defined by clinical, cognitive, and functional deficits ( Litvan 2012)( Appendix 9). The MDS criteria for MCI were developed to address issues relatively specific to PD. The criteria were also designed to be consistent with the MDS proposed PDD criteria ( Emre 2007)(Appendix 10) and thereby allow differentiation between MCI and dementia in patients with PD . Global cognition (a requisite for the diagnosis of PD- MCI Level I) will be assessed using the MoCA (Nasreddine 2005)( Appendix 1)( see Section 7.1.1.3.1 ). The score range for PD -MCI is 19 -25.2, and for PDD it is 11.4 -21. While the score ranges overlap, differentiation between the conditions is dependent upon associated functional impairment (Doerflinger 2012) . Per the inclusion criteria for this study, subjects must have a MoCA score of 13-25, inclusive ( see S ection 5.1 Inclusion Criteria )."

The scale is completed by the phy sician based on clinical information obtained from diagnostic testing and physical examination. The scale takes about 10 to 15 minutes to complete, depending on the availability of the data needed. Scores for the 8 items are added together for a total sc ore. Subjects who score 5 or greater are more likely to have a dementia of vascular etiology and thus are excluded from participating in th is trial. 7.1.1.1.4 Medical History The investigator or designee will obtain a detailed medical history through in terview with the subject and the subject’s trial partner during screening. The medical history should focus on recent history, with an emphasis on the history of cognitive and motor symptoms related to PD . Additionally, the medical history should include: • Current/past illnesses and conditions • Current symptoms of any active medical condition • Surgeries and procedures • Allergies • Family history in biological parents, siblings, and offspring of PD, AD, or other dementias or neurological disorders • Social history (e.g. exercise, smoking, alcohol, illegal substances) and current living situation • Cause of parental death (if not living) • Prior imaging, CSF assessments, or other relevant diagnostic test results, including genetics 7.1.1.1.5 Demographics Demographic i nformation such as the subject’s education level , ethnicity, and race will be collected by interview with the subject and the subject’s trial partner at screening. 7.1.1.1.6 Review of Medic ations The investigator or designee should obtain a complete list of the subject’s current medications, including over- the-counter drugs, herbal supplements, and/or vitamins, as well as those taken by the subject in the past 12 months and any dose changes in the last 3 months . Assessment of eligibility should include a review of permitted and prohibited medications. Any additions, discontinuation, or dosage changes in medication during the course of the study will be recorded. 7.1.1.1.7 Vital Signs Vital signs will include seated systolic and diastolic BP (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute [bpm]), respiration rate (breaths per minute), and body temperature. Vital signs will be measured after the subject has been seated for 5 minutes. In addition, at screening and at every visit during both treatment periods (including follow-up Visits 8 and 16), orthostatic ( supine and standing ) BP will also be measured. Orthostatics are collected as follows: • After a 10 -minute rest in a supine position, s upine BP should be measured w hile the subject is lying down."
30,page_30,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 31 of 111 • The subject should then stand for 3 minutes, if physically able or can be held in standing position with assistance , and the BP is taken again. At Visits 3 -7 and Visits 11-15, seated, supine, and standing BP should be measured prior to infusion start and at the end of each infusion (~ post infusion start ). Refer to the Infusion Administration Manual for further guidance ( Appendix 11). 7.1.1.1.8 Physical Examination A full physical examination will be performed to assess the following organ systems: skin, ENT (ears, nose, and throat), head, eyes, lungs/chest, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, extremities, neurologic and lymphatic systems. The neurological exam will include cranial n erves (visual fields, fundoscopic exam, pupillary light reflex , extraocular muscles, facial sensation and symmetry, palate and tongue, and head turning and shoulder shrug) ; motor function including m uscle strength, tone , bulk, and abnormal movements ; reflexes (biceps, triceps, knees, ankles, and plantar) ; coordination ( finger -to-nose, heel -knee- shin) ; sensory f unction (light touch and pinprick); and gait . Height will be measured at screening and weight will be monitored during the trial. 7.1.1.1.9 12 -Lead EC G A 12 -lead ECG will be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out technical factors contributing to ECG artifacts or abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time for consistency. The overall conclusion with the interpretation of the ECGs will be recorded on the appropriate CRF. The interpretation of the ECGs will be recorded as normal, abnormal but not clinically significant, or abnormal and clinically significant. Corrected QTc intervals will be calculated using Fridericia’s correction formula. 7.1.1.1.10 Echocardiogram During screening, an echocardiogram will be performed to evaluate the sub ject’s left ventricular (LV) systolic function to ensure the subject’s ejection fraction percentage is ≥ 55% (Gebhard 2012). 7.1.1.1.11 Screening Safety Lab Panel Biological samples will be analyzed at screening. Samples that remain after study screening is complete may be stored at the central lab in the event additional testing (e.g., further evaluation of an AE or assessment of effect) is required . Blood will be drawn by a qualified medical provider, and urine specimens will also be collected. The timing and frequency for specimen collection and laboratory evaluations to be performed are further described in Section 15 Schedule of Events . The labs that will be tested at screening include: • Serum pregnancy test in WOCBP only • Hematology : complete blood count ( CBC), neutrophils , total lymph ocytes , monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, iron, v itamin B12 (c obalamin ) • Chemistry : sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) , creatinine, eGFR, protein ( total), albumin, IgA, bilirubin [total, indirect, direct], aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ), gamma- glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT ), alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), amylase, lipase, lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH) , creatinine kinase ( CK), glucose, HbA1C, phosphate,"

All testing will be performed by qualified evaluators who have undergone standardized rater training and certification , as appropriate. The same evaluator should be used for the duration of each subject’s participation unless a change in rater is unavoidable. When possible, a ll cognitive and motor testing should be performed when the subject is in the “ON” state and at approximately the same time after the last dose of each subject’s PD medication (s). The preferred order of behavioral and cognitive testing during visits with multiple assessments is as follows : 1. MoCA 2. CDR -CCB 3. D-KEFS 4. dCDT 5. MDS -UPDRS 1/2/3 6. SE-ADL 7. CISI -PD 8. PDQ-39 9. GDS -15 Descriptions of each neuropsychological and motor function assessment are provided below. 7.1.1.3.1 Montreal Cognitive Assessment The MoCA ( Nasreddine 2005)(Appendix 1) is a commonly used screening test easily administered by nonspecialist staff. It assesses the domains of attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The total possible score is 30 points with a score of 26 or more considered normal. 7.1.1.3.2 Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognition Battery The CDR -CCB is the most widely used automated cognitive function assessment system i n clinical research worldwide ( Wesnes 1977, Wesnes 2000 , Wesnes 2013) . It was developed to assess both enhancement and impairment of human cognitive function. There are several core tests available. The core tests have remained constant over the last three decades while being steadily supplemented with others as required. In this study, the following will be measured us ing the CDR -CCB system: Continuity and Power of Attention, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory . Subjects will have two CDR -CCB training sessions during the screening period to ensure adequate performance at the B aseline Visit (Visit 2). 7.1.1.3.3 D elis-Kaplan Executive Function Verbal Fluency The D- KEFS V erbal Fluency test is used for assessment o f executive function, which is one of the main cognitive domains impaired in PD ( Delis 2001 , Delis 2004, Emre 2004) (an example of the full assessment for this study can be downloaded using the following link: Delis -Kaplan Executive Function Verb al Fluency ). The D -KEFS Verbal Fluency Test has three conditions: Letter Fluency, Category Fluency, and Category Switching. In the Letter Fluency condition, subject s are asked to say as many words that start with a particular letter (e.g., F, A, S) as possible over three trials of 60 seconds. The Category Fluency condition requires subject s to say as many words belonging to a particular semantic category (e.g., animals, tools) as they can in two trials of 60 seconds. In the final condition, subjec ts are asked to switch between words belonging to two different semantic categories in one trial of 60 seconds (e.g., fruits and furniture). The test requires subjects to exercise mental flexibility , avoid perseverative responses, and engage in an effective and"

Importantly, this test provides auxiliary information regarding verbal fluency to the CDR -CCB, which does not include assessments in this critical cognitive domain . 7.1.1.3.4 Digital Clock Drawing Test The conventional clock drawing t est is a rapid and inexpensive screening tool for detection of moderate and severe dementia. Modern digitizing devices offer the opportunity to measure subtle changes of visuo- constructive demands and executive functions that may be used as a fast and easy -to-perform screening instrument for the early detection of cognitive impairment (Müller 2017 ). The pen -like dCDT device gathers the x- y coordinates that describe the movement of the stylus as it chan ges its position during the assessment . It also assesses when the stylus or writing device is not exerting pressure on the writing surface (i.e., in -air movements performed by the hand while transitioning from one stroke to the next), making it a more sen sitive tool than the conventional clock test with increased diagnostic accuracy ( Müller 2017). 7.1.1.3.5 Movement Disorder Society’s Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale The MDS -UPDRS ( Fahn 1987, Movement Disorder Society Task Force 2003)( Appendix 2) was developed in an effort to incorporate elements from existing scales to provide a comprehensive but efficient and flexible means to monitor PD-related disability and impairment. The MDS- UPDRS has four components (Part 1, Mentation, Behavior, and Mood; Part 2, Activities of Daily Living; Part 3, Motor; Part 4, Complications). Parts 2 and 3 are the most widely used for both clinical and research purposes. One of the core advantages of the UPDRS is that it was developed as a compound scale to capture multiple aspects of PD. It assesses both motor disability (Part 2) and motor impairment (Part 3). In addition, Part 1 addresses mental dysfunction and mood. The rating for each item is from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The total score for each Part is obta ined from the sum of the corresponding item scores. For this study, Parts 1-3 will be completed, and t he estimated time for completion is 20-30 minutes. 7.1.1.3.6 Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale The SE-ADL evaluates patients’ perceptions of global functional capacity and dependence ( Schwab 1968)( Appendix 3 ). Scoring is expressed in terms of percentage, in 10 steps from 100 to 0 (100%, normal status; 0%, bedri dden with vegetative dysfunction), so that the lower the score, the worse the functional status. The rating is made by a trained clinician. 7.1.1.3.7 Clinical Impression of Severity Index – Parkinson’s Disease The CISI -PD is a severity index formed by four items (motor signs, disability, motor complications, and cognitive status), rated 0 (not at all) to 6 (very severe or completely disabled) ( Martinez -Martin 2006)( Appendix 4 ). A total score is calculated by summing the item scores. The scale is completed by a clinician. It only takes a few minutes to complete once the state of the subject is known. 7.1.1.3.8 Parkinson’s Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 The PDQ- 39 is a self -administered questionnaire of 39 questions relating to 8 key areas of health and daily activities, including both motor and non- motor symptoms ( Peto 1998 )(Appe ndix 5 ). The eight dimensions include: mobility, activities of daily living, emotional well-being, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. It is scored on a scale of 0 -100 with lower scores indicating better health and high scores indicating more severe symptoms."

The GDS -15 is a shortened form of a 30-item questionnaire in which participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no in reference to how they felt over the past week ( Yesavage 1983)( Appendix 6). Questions from the long form GDS which had the highest correlation with depressive symptoms in validation studies were selected for the short version which is more easily used by mildly to moderately demented patients who have short attention spans and/or feel easily fatigued. Of the 15 items, 10 indicate the presence of depression when answered po sitively, while the rest (question numbers 1, 5, 7, 11, 13) indicate depression when answered negatively. It takes about 5 to 7 minutes to complete. 7.2 LABORATORY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 7.2.1 CLINICAL LABORATORY EVALUATIONS Biological samples (e.g. whole blood, serum, urine) will be collected for laboratory evaluations in accordance with Section 7.1.1.1.11 Screening Safety Lab Panel , Section 7.1.1.2.8 Blood and Urine Collection for Lab Evaluations , and the Schedule of Events . . Clinical sample processing and laboratory evaluations will be conducted by a central lab’s registered and certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) facilities. Pre -infusion laboratory evaluations will be conducted at the clinical site. Refer to the study’s laboratory manual for complete information regarding all laboratory evaluations to be performed, sample collection procedures, and related requirements. The investigator is responsible for determining and documenting whether out of ra nge laboratory values are clinically significant. All clinically significant values will be recorded as AEs in the CRF and followed until determined to be stable or resolved , unless the subject is lost to follow up. Once resolved, the appropriate CRF pag e(s) will be updated. 7.2.2 OTHER TESTS OR PROCEDURES 7.2.2.1 Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) Genotype Testing ApoE genotype is a known risk factor for neurodegeneration and dementia pathogenesis, with presence of the ApoE ε4 allele carrying increased risk. This risk is further influenced by age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Thus, determining ApoE genotype at baseline will allow for the assessment of possible differential effects of Apo E genotype on safety, treatment efficacy, neuroimaging, and other exploratory measures. DNA for ApoE analysis will be obtained from a blood serum sample collected during Visit 3 prior to the subject’s first infusion. 7.2.2.2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI will be used to evaluate subjects’ eligibility for inclusion in the study at screening. Structural i mages will be interpreted by a central reader at screening and any exclusionary findings will be reported. Where available, functional imaging will also be acquired to assess for functional connectivity as measured by tf- fMRI and cerebral blood flow as measured by ASL MRI. In consenting subjects, an additional MRI at Visit 16 will assess for changes in brain atrophy as measured by MRI , functional connectivity as measured by tf- fMRI , and cerebral blood flow as measured ASL MRI. During the MRI, the subject will be asked to lie on a narrow bed in a large tunnel while images are captured by the MRI machine. Participation in the scree ning"

For more information regarding the timing and procedures for sample collection and related requirements, refer to the study’s laboratory manual and Section 15 Schedule of Events . Plasma will be analyzed by proteomics using mass spectrometry and targeted approaches to assess the specific signature of proteins in subjects at baseline and to assess the changes in the proteome with repeated GRF6021 infusions. These methodologies will provide a broad overview of the proteins that are present in the plasma sample by assessing 1000 -5000 analytes and allow generation of a proteomic signature. From this signature, it is hoped that key proteins that are drivers of cognitive function and/or indicators of disease progression can be identified . Blood samples will be collected for analysis of emergent genetic markers of disease. By understanding the composition and function of plasma samples from the trial, the goal is to identify the biomarkers relevant to further optimizing treatment in PD, PD -MCI, and PDD. For information regarding future use of stored samples, see Section 12.5 Future Use of Stored Specimens . 7.2.3 SPECIMEN PREPARATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, AND SHIPPING Refer to the study’s laboratory manual for specimen preparation, handling, storage, and shipping procedures. 7.3 STUDY SCHEDULE To ensure follow -up visits occur at approximately the same intervals following both treatment periods, visit windows should be calculated as follows: • Visit windows fo r Visits 1 -10 should be calculated relative to Day 1. • Visit windows for Visits 11 -19 should be calculated relative to Day 85 ±7 (i.e., first day of dosing for Treatment Period 2).

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding that is deemed clinically significant), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (i nvestigational) product . An AE does include any: • Exacerbation of a pre-existing illness. • Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the subject and/or observed by the investigator or study staff. • Increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condition. • Condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study (unless it can be demonstrated by medical record review that the onset of the event preceded the date/time of Informed Consent). • Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at baseline that worsen following the start of the study. • Symptoms associated with disease not previously reported by the subject. • Untoward medical occurrences considered by the investigator to be related to study -mandated procedures. • Abnormal assessments (e.g., change on physical examination, ECG findings), if they represent a clinically significant finding, that were not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study. • Laboratory test abnormalities, if they represent a clinically significant finding, symptomatic or not, which were not present at Baseline or worsened during the course of the study . An AE DOES NOT include a/an: • Elective medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusio n). • Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. • Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not oc curred (e.g., hospitalization for cosmetic elective surgery, social and/or convenience admissions) . • The disease or disorder being studied , or sign or symptom associated with the disease or disorder , unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condit ion. • Overdose of either study drug or concurrent medication without any signs or symptoms. • Symptoms associated with PD, PD -MCI, and PDD that are consistent with the subject’s usual clinical course unless the symptom(s) meet(s) the criteria for “serious.” • Pregnancy."

Note : the terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity (or intensity) refers to the grade of an AE. “Serious” is a regulatory definition. A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is an untoward medical occurrence that , at any dose, fulfills one or more of the following criteria: a. Results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death). b. Is life -threatening . • An AE is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death; it does not include AEs which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. c. Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. • Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen during the study is not con sidered an AE ; hospitalization for participating in this study is not considered an AE. • Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs; if a complication prolongs hospitalization, the event is an SAE. • “Inpatient” hospitalization means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for medical reasons that may or may not be overnight; it does not include presentation at a casualty or emergency room unless the event meets the definition of an Important Medical Event (in the opinion of the Investigator or Sponsor). d. Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. • The term ‘disability’ means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions; this definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, accidental trauma (i.e., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life func tions but do not constitute a substantial disruption . e. Results in a congenital anomaly in the offspring of a subject who received drug. f. Results in an Important Medical Event. Important Medical Events are events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgica l intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition; examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpa tient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. • Medical and scientific judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt reporting is appropriate in this situation ."

For example, although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some patients exposed to drugs in the a ngiotensin -converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the Investigator ’s Brochure as a class effect, the first case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be considered unexpected for reporting purposes ( FDA 2012). This definition of “unexpected” relies entirely on the Reference Safety Informatio n in the Investigator ’s Brochure as the basis for determining if newly acquired information generated from clinical trials or reported from other sources is unexpected . The suspected adverse reactions listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure (i.e., “expected”) are those observed with the investigational drug and for which a causal relationship between the event and the drug is suspected or confirmed. Sponsor assessment of expectedness and relationship to study drug/causality will determine the need for expedited reporting of AEs. 8.3 TIME PERIOD/FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT/FOLLOW -UP At every clinic visit, subjects will be assessed for AEs and SAEs. After the subject has had an opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, the investigator should inquire about AEs by asking a non-leading question such as the following: 1. “How are you feeling?” 2. “Have you had any changes since your last assessm ent/visit?” 3. “Have you taken any new medicines since your last assessment/visit?” 8.3.1 POST -STUDY AE AND SAE The investigator is not obligated to actively seek SAE information in former study subject s, but the investigator is encouraged to notify Alkahest, Inc. or their designee of any AE or SAE occurring within 30 days after a subject completes the study (or has their last visit) that the investigator judges may be reasonably related to study treatment or study participation. 8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES 8.4.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING All subjects who have given informed consent will be evaluated for AEs. All AEs that occur after the time of treatment with the study agent will be considered Treatment E mergent AEs. Subjects with T reatment - Emergent AEs must be followed until the AE is resolved or is stable, unless the subject is lost to follow up. Each AE or suspected adverse reaction must be described as follows: the date of onset, date of resolution, severity (mild, moderate, severe), frequency of the event (single episode, intermittent, continuous), action taken with study treatment (no action taken, treatment held, treatment discontinued), outcome, causality* (unrelated, possibly related, definitely related), and seriousness criteria. Each AE or suspected adverse reaction must be recorded separately."
47,page_47,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 48 of 111 *Note : Causality assessment will be made only when the AE occurs after the subject has initiated at least one infusion of the study agent. An AE occurring before the subject’s exposure to study agent will always be labeled as “unrelated”. Any AE occurring during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical records and as an AE in the CRF. Any SAE occurring during the study must be documented in the subject’s medical records and as an SAE in the CRF. A separate set of SAE pages should be used for each SAE. However, if at the time of initial reporting, multiple SAEs are present that are temporally and/or clinically related, they may be reported on the same SAE page. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event (that meets the definition of an AE or SAE) bas ed on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs or symptoms. The diagnosis will become the basis for the verbatim term as reported by the invest igator. If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not present, the abnormal finding should be recorded. In addition to the i nvestigator’s own description of the AE , each AE will be encoded according to the MedDRA . The investigator will take all appropriate and necessary therapeutic measures required for resolution of the AE. Any medication necessary for the treatment of an AE must be recorded on the concomitant medication CRF . The SAE pages of the CRF should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by the investigator or his/her designee before transmittal to the study Contract Research Organization (CRO). It is very important that the investigator provide his/her assessment of causality to study drug as well as an applicable diagnosis at the time of the initial SAE report. 8.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 8.4.2.1 Timeframes for Reporting SAEs The Sponsor will notify the FDA a s well as the competent authority of each participating country, including the Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Sant é (ANSM) , Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) , and all participating investigators in a safety report of potentially serious risks from clinical trials ( i.e., Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions [SUSAR s]), as soon as possible after the Sponsor receives the safety information and determines t hat the information qualifies for reporting: • No later than 7 calendar days for events that are life threatening (in the opinion of the investigator or the Sponsor) or that involve death as an outcome. • No later than 15 calendar days for all other SUSARs. As such, prompt notification of the Sponsor, and/or the Sponsor’s representatives, and promptly providing requested follow-up information regarding SAEs is essential so that ethical and regulatory responsibilities and legal obligations can be satisfied . Investigators are responsible for reporting SAEs according to the following"
48,page_48,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 49 of 111 timeframes: • All SAEs occurring during the study should be reported immediately. • The SAE Report Form and relevant source documents, if applicable, must be completed and emailed to Safety.Alkahest@apcerls.com within 24 hours of observation or learning of the event. • Follow- up information must be sent to the CRO within 24 hours of receipt of information by the investigational site. SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained or is judged by the investigator to be no longer clinically significant, or unt il the subject is lost to follow up. 8.4.2.2 SAE Information to Report All information available regarding an SAE must be submitted in the timeframes indicated . At a minimum, SAE reports must cont ain the subject ID, the SAE verbatim term, onset date, re lationship to study drug/causality, and a brief narrative of the event. Please note that relationship to study drug/causality as well as the reported verbatim term are very important and should be included in the initial report as it may impact expedited regulatory reporting requirements for the event. The date of SAE discovery by the site staff should be documented in the source documents. The investigator must record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in the applicable sections of the CRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records in lieu of completion of the appropriate AE/SAE pages. However, there may be i nstances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the CRO and/or the Sponsor. If medical records are submitted to the CRO then all subject personal identifiers must be completely and thoroughly redacted prior to submission. A bla nk SAE Report Form and instructions for SAE reporting will be provided to the site and will be maintained in the investigator’s study file. The SAE Report Form must be completed and emailed to Safety.Alkahest@apcerls.com according to the timeframes specified in Section 8.4.2.1. The SAE Report Form should include copies of relevant source documents, if applicable. R econciliation of any discrepancy noted during monitoring and amending the eCRF is required. If new information about an SAE is received or corrections to data are needed , the investigator should complete a new SAE Report Form and check the “follow-up” box on the form. This follow-up SAE Report Form should be submitted within 24 hours of learning of the information, especially if the new information concerns seriousness, relatedness, or the event term of an AE. Sites acting under their local IRB/IEC should submit all applicable events, unanticipated problems, and safety reports to the site’s local IRB/IEC , if applicable. All safety reporting deviations should also be submitted to their local IRB/IEC , if applicable. 8.4.3 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST Please note that for an event to be classified as an AE of special interest (AESI ), the event should meet the definition of an Adverse Event per Section 8.1.1. Thus, if the investigator considers the event to be an AE, and it meets one or more of the criteria listed below , then the event should be classified as an AESI and"
49,page_49,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 50 of 111 reported according to the timeframe specified. The following will be considered AE s of special interest (AESI) if they qualify as AEs per the preceding paragraph : • Clinically significant peripheral edema or pulmonary edema . • Clinically significant systolic BP >160 but <170 mmHg over consecutive timepoints spanning 30 or more minutes. • Clinically significant systolic BP <90 or >170 mmHg at a single timepoint. • Clinically significant diastolic BP >100 but <110 mmHg over consecutive timepoints spanning 30 or more minu tes. • Clinically significant diastolic BP <60 or >110 at a single timepoint. • A change of >25% from baseline in systolic and/ or diastolic BP . • Reduced kidney function (eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2). • Suspected transmission of blood- borne infectious agents. AESI occurring during the study should be reported within 48 hours of observation or learning of the event, unless the event is serious, in which case the event must be reported according to the timeframes specified in Section 8.4.2.1. Note : Blood pressu res meeting the parameters above that are not considered adverse events need not be reported within the 48-hour window. Rather, these will be considered “blood pressures of special interest” and analyzed separately. 8.4.4 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY While pregnancy itself is not considered an AE, pregnancy occurring in a clinical study must be followed to collect information regarding the experiences of gestation and pregnancy with study agent exposure. The investigator must report any pregnancy that occurs in a female study subject or female partner of a male subject subsequent to first exposure to the study agent until End of Study, or 3 months following a subject’s last dose in the event of early termination. All pregnancies will be reported to the IRB/IEC , Sponsor, and CRO. In the event of a pregnancy, treatment will be discontinued, and the subject will undergo continued safety follow -up through pregnancy outcome. Any pregnancy must be followed by the investigator until delivery or to the end of pregnancy. Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect (s) observed in the child must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the investigator or study personnel’s first know ledge. 8.5 STUDY HALTING RULES If any of the following safety events occur, a Safety Evaluation Meeting (defined below) will be triggered: • Three or more SAEs in the same SOC that are assessed as possibly or definitely related to the study agent by the investigator and confirmed as such by the Sponsor (see Section 8.2.2 Relationship to Study Agent ). • Within or between any of the dosing groups: an overall pattern of sym ptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events associated with the study agent that the Sponsor’s Program Physician or designee consider a serious potential safety concern (e.g., suspicious overall pattern) ."

The CMP describes in detail who will conduct monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. • Independent audits may be conducted by the Sponsor in accordance with a q uality oversight p lan or equivalent to ensure monitoring practices are performed consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the CMP. 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN MODEL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) with analytical details and assumptions will be developed and finalized before database lock and unblinding of the study data. 10.2 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES Because the primary objective of the study is safety and tolerabi lity, the study is not designed to detect statistically significant differences between active and placebo on efficacy endpoints. T he statistical approach toward secondary efficacy endpoints will be primarily descriptive; within -subject changes from basel ine for each dosing group and among-group differences will be evaluated. 10.3 ANALYSIS DATASE TS Four analysis datasets are possible ; however, analyses may not necessarily be conducted with all four: • Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Dataset: all randomized subjects. • Safety Dataset : all subjects who received a ny amount of the study agent. • Evaluable Dataset: all subjects who receive at least 5 of the 10 planned doses, have a diagnosis of PD and cognitive impairment per the inclusion criteria, and complete through Visit 8. – Per Protocol Dataset: a subset of the Evaluable Dataset . A detailed description of the reasons for exclusion from the P er Protocol population will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . The presentation of baseline characteristics will be conducted on the ITT dataset. All safety analyses will be performed for the Safety Dataset. Analyses of the secondary endpoints will focus on the Evaluable and/or Per Protocol Datasets."

Overall baseline and demographic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics; between -groups testing will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the randomization in producing homogeneous pre- treatment groups. For analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints, the following will be considered: • For endpoints that are continuous in nature: – Number of observations, mean, median, minimum and maximum, and standard deviation (SD) values will be presented as descriptive summary – For inferential statistics:  If the Normality assumption is met, Paired t -test, or Analysis of Covariance ( ANCOVA) using the baseline value as a covariate will be used  If the Normality assumption is not met, a rank –ANCOVA analysis i.e., an ANCOVA analysis on rank-transformed data or other non -parametric methods will be used • For endpoints that are categorical in nature: – Frequency counts and percentages will be presented as descriptive summary – Chi-square test or Logit model will be used for inferential statistics Subject disposition (e.g., the number of subjects randomized, completed, and discontinued) will be summarized , and medical history data will be listed. Prior and concomitant medications taken from screening and during the study will be categorized by World Health Organization classification for therapeutic class and drug name, listed and summarized by number and percentage of subjects. Final analyses are not limited to the summaries described herein. As noted above, analytical details and assumptions will be fully presented in the SAP. 10.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EN DPOINT Safety and tolerability will be e valuated by examining the occurrence of AEs, including Treatment- Emergent AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation from the study. Summary tabulations of the reported adverse events will be presented by group after the verbatim terms have been coded to PTs and SOCs using the MedDRA Version 21.0 coding dictionary. The summaries will include severity and attribution to the study agent. Multiple reports of the same AE by the same subject will be counted only once at the highest severity and strongest attribution to the study agent. The AE analyses will focus on those that are T reatment -Emergent, however any AEs that are reported after consent has been signed and prior to initial dosing will be tabulated as Intercurrent Events. Additional details are presented in Section 10.4.4."

Of particular interest will be the within - subject changes from baseline and their distribut ion around a null value of zero and a comparison between groups to evaluate any trends in difference s between subjects randomized to active and placebo agents . Appropriate paired sample tests (paired t -test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests) may be conducted to evaluate within -subject changes from baseline, using a two- tailed α -level of 0.05. Between -group differences may be assessed by One- way ANCOVA or its nonparametric equivalent test. 10.4.4 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY SAFETY ENDPOINTS Actual values and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measurements, vital signs , body weight, and S- STS scores will also be assessed and summarized. Abnormal lab or vital sign values will be determined and flagged in the listings. Laboratory shift tables or graphics displaying the change (number of subjects) relative to the reference range from baseline to each study visit may also be presented for each test. The investigator should exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding and document ing whether an abnormal laboratory finding, or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. For secondary safety endpoints that are continuous in nature (e.g. clinical laboratory parameters, systolic and diastolic BP , heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature, body weight, S -STS score) the mean, median, minimum, maximum , and standard deviation will be plotted over time. For secondary safety endpoints that are categorical in nature (e.g. physical exam or ECG abnormalities), the frequency count s and percentages will be presented as a descriptive summary. Per-subject extent of exposure will be listed. 10.4.5 ADHERENCE AND RETENTION ANALYSES Subject adherence with the study visit schedule, visit procedures, infusions and subject retention will be assessed. Subject adherence may vary across the different groups offering another feasibility measurement as would a comparison of the number of subjects who complete two series of 5 pulsed doses to subjects who complete only the first series. Reasons for study discontinuation will be compared across groups and across other subgroups of subjects, as appropriate. 10.4.6 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS See Section 10.4.1. 10.4.7 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES An unblinded interim analysis of the safety endpoints , including the primary endpoint and secondary safety endpoints, was conducted when approximately 20 subjects completed Visit 8 (end of first dosing period). The requirement that subjects remain on an inpatient unit during each treatment period was included in the"
54,page_54,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 55 of 111 protocol to enable safety monitoring during dosing. The Sponsor reviewed the safety data from this interim analysis to assess whether the need for inpatient stay s during dosing should remain a requirement . The unblinded safety analysis was performed following a data- cut o n 09JUN2019 and included 32 subjects . Based on the results of the interim safety analysis and feedback from FDA, the inpatient requirement is no longer required as reflected in this version of the Protocol. An unblinded interim analys is of the MoCA, CDR -CCB, and MDS -UPDRS 3 secondary efficacy endpoints is planned when approximately 40 subjects have completed Visit 8 (end of first dosing period). As the study is not powered for efficacy and no decisions will be made regarding stopping the trial, statistical testing will be performed at the 0.05 level using two-tailed tests on both the Evaluable and Per Protocol datasets. To minimize potential bias of the remaining efficacy and safety data, only aggregated summary tables will be provided. Safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis. If a Safety Evaluation Meeting is triggered (see Section 8.5), an ad hoc interim safety analysis will be performed. If such an ad hoc safety interim analysis is conducted, the treatment assignme nt will remain masked , unless unblinding is deemed necessary by the Sponsor for safety evaluation. 10.4.8 ADDITIONAL SUBGROUP ANALYSES Not applicable. 10.4.9 MULTIPLE COMPARISON/MULTIPLICITY No adjustments for multiplicity will be employed. 10.4.10 TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE DATA This will be further defined in the SAP. 10.4.11 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES Not applicable. 10.5 SAMPLE SIZE A total of approximately 90 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to active treatment (approximately 60 subjects) or placebo (approximately 30 subjects ), with the intent of obtaining ~68 evaluable subjects who have received at least 5 doses and completed the study through Visit 8. Subjects who discontinue prior to completing Visit 8 may be replaced. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn during screening will be replaced. The study is not statistically powered to detect differences in measures of clinical efficacy or biomarker endpoints. To evaluate potential safety signals , the statistical approximation described by Hanley (aka the “Rule of Threes” i n which the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the frequency of an unreported AE is at most 3/n % where n represents the number of subjects who received active GRF6021 in the study) will be used. In a sample of 60 subjects, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the frequency of an unobserved"

In addition, the proposed sample size may be sufficient to identify trends in efficacy endpoints that will be used to determine the appropriate sample size for subseque nt studies . 10.6 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS 10.6.1 ENROLLMENT/RANDOMIZATION/MASKING PROCEDURES To minimize the potential bias at the time of randomization, the study will be double -blinded and randomized in a 2:1 ratio (active: placebo), with a mixed block size. In addition to mixed block size, to reduce the potential impact of sex on study outcomes, the randomization will be stratified by sex; this is to assure a balanced distribution of evaluable male and female subjects in both treatment grou ps. The randomization will be web -based and centralized. The randomization codes will be generated by a statistician that has no involvement in the study other than generation and maintenance of the randomization codes. All study outcome measures will be assessed by blinded Outcomes Assessors or other blinded raters. However, vials containing of the study agent or vials containing placebo will be provided by an unblinded pharmacist, or other qualified staff responsible for drug accountability, to an unblinded Infusion Nurse who will administer the study agent or placebo. To ensure that Outcomes Assessors, raters , and other study personnel, a s well as subjects and trial partners are unaware of the allocation , appropriat e measures will be taken to mask the study agent /placebo containers and IV setup such that they will only be visible as necessary to the unblinded Infusion Nurse. These measures include, but are not limited to, covering the vial and drip chamber with an opaque black bag or equivalent; using a curtain, drape, or equivalent to shield the infusion administration setup as applicable; concealing vials/containers of study agent/placebo during transport; and returning used containers of the study agent /placebo to the unblinded pharmacist, or other qualified site personnel responsible for drug accountability, promptly at the end of the Infusion Period. Communication between the blinded Outcomes Assessor and the unblinded Infusion Nurse will be restricted to only that required to ensure the immediate safety of subjects. The Outcomes Assessor will observe the subject during the infusion and collect and/or manage/report AEs and SAEs. Finally, to avoid potential unblinding based on subject levels, lab results (aside from those tested at screening) will remain blinded until the conclusion of the study. Unblinding of lab results would only occur for emergent safety reasons. Aside from de signated personnel whose sole responsibility necessitates access to unblinding information (e.g., the unblinded CRA whose sole responsibility is to ensure study agent/placebo accountability, the unblinded clinical supply manager, etc.) , the Sponsor and the ir representatives will be blinded with respect to subjects’ treatment allocation through database lock unless breaking the blind is required for safety reasons (see 10.6.3 Breaking the Study Blind/Subject Code ). The unblinded interim analys es will be performed by unblinded statisticians who are not members of the protocol study team. The data will be provided in aggregate fashion so the difference between study agent and placebo is compared b ut individual treatment allocation remains blinded."

All intentional and unintentional unblinding will be documented and reported. 10.6.3 BREAKING THE STUDY BLIND/SUBJECT CODE The study blind can be broken for safety reasons if the information is required for the management of SAEs or severe AEs. Only the Investigator can obtain the treatment allocation for their subject through the IRT. Before breaking the blind, every attempt should be made to discuss the need with the Sponsor ’s Program Physician, or designee . When some degree of unblinding must occur, this should be limited to the fewest number of people on a need- to-know basis. Any noted intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind should be documented and reported to the Sponsor’s Study Team Lead. If unintentional unblinding occurs during t he study, root cause analysis will be evaluated, and corrective actions implemented. 11 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this trial, in compliance with ICH E6 R2 and regulatory and institutional requirements for the protection of confidentiality of subjects. Each site will permit authorized representatives of regulatory agencies, the IRB/IEC , the Sponsor, or the Sponsor’s representatives to examine (and when permitted by applicable law, to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress, and data validity. Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Examples of these original documents and data records include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory not es, memo randa , subject’s memory aids or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded audio tapes of counseling sessions, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, and subject files and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial. It is not acceptable for the CRF to be the only record of a subject’s participation in the study. This is to ensure that anyone who would access the subject’s medical record has adequate knowledge that the subject is participating in a clinical trial. Source document templates will be developed for this study. 12 ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 12.1 ETHICAL STAN DARD The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, ICH E6 R2, 21 CFR,"

Approval from the IRB/IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. All changes to the consent form will be IRB/IEC approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented subjects need to be re- consented. Any modifications or amendments to the protocol must also be submitted to the IRB/IEC for approval prior to implementation. 12.3 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS 12.3.1 CONSENT FORMS Consent forms describing in detail the study agent, study procedures, and risks are given to the subject or healthcare power of attorney or equivalent legal representative, and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to any study- relate d procedures. 12.3.2 CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATIO N It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee to obtain written informed consent from each subject participating in this study or their legally authorized representative after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and prior to undertaking any study- related procedures. Subjects should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family members or other advisors and the time to consider participation in the trial carefully. The subject s may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. The rights and welfare of the subject s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. The investigator or designee must utilize an IRB/IEC -approved consent form that contains the elements required by ICH GCP and applicabl e regulatory requirements for documenting written informed consent. Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the subject and/or their legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent. A copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the subject and/or their legally authorized representative. By signing the informed consent form, all parties agree they will complete the evaluations required by the study, unless they withdraw voluntarily or are terminated from the study for any reason. Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study candidates that includes"

All subjects who provide consent will be assigned a unique study number. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to the study subject. Once a number is assigned to a subject, that number will remain with th at study subject and will not be reused. If an individual’s medical chart or results of diagnostic tests performed as part of an individual’s regular medical care are going to be used for screening, written informed consent must be obtained prior to review of that information in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . 12.4 PARTICIPANT AND DATA CONFIDENTIALITY Subject confidentiality is held in strict trust by the participating i nvestigators, their staff, the Sponsor, and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples and genetic tests in addition to the clinical information relating to subjects. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor. The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the Sponsor , representatives of the IRB/IEC , or government regulatory agencies may inspect documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the subject s in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records. The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by local IRB/IEC and Institutional regulations. Study subject s’ research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, that is transmitted to the Sponsor, CRO, and/or IRB/IEC will not include contact or identifying information. Rather, individual subjects and their research data will be identified by a unique study number. This unique study number should be recorded on non- local lab samples, requisitions, and any documents submitted to the CRO, Sponsor, and/or IRB/IEC . The s tudy data entry and study management systems used by clinical sites and by research staff will be secured and password protected. 12.5 FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS With the subject ’s (or the subject’s legally authorized representative’s) approval and as approved by local IRB/IEC s, biological samples may be stored at Alkahest , or designee, for future use . These samples could be used for research and to improve treatment. Alkahest will also be provided with a code- link that will allow linking the biolog ical specimens with the specific data from each subject , maintaining the masking of the identity of the study subject . Subjects may choose whether the Sponsor can store and use samples for further research . An individual subject can choose to withdraw consent to have biological specimens stored for future research. Samples from subject s who provide consent for future research purposes are collected , stored , and code-linked to the subject until the end of the study at which time t he samples are deidentified and may no longer be connected to the individual subject. Throughout the study, at any time , the subjec t and/or the subject’s LAR is able to withdraw consent , and the individual samples can be retrieved and destroyed . Howev er, after the samples have"

When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be managed by Alkahest. In the event Alkahest transfers ownership to another commercial Sponsor , ownership of the samples may be transferred as well. 13 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 13.1 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES Data collection is the responsibility o f the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site. Data entered in the eCRFs that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. Black or blue ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies. When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL. The investigator may need to request previous medical records or tran sfer records, depending on the trial; also , current medical records must be available. For each subject enrolled in the study, the eCRF must be completed in a timely manner. The investigator will review and approve the e CRF f or each study subject after all data have been entered, the e CRFs have been source document verified, and all queries have been resolved. This als o applies to records for those s ubjects who fai l to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the e CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. All data collection and recordkeeping procedures must be compliant with applicable ICH GCP. 13.1.1 INVESTIGATOR RESPONS IBILITIES The investigator will comply with the protocol (which has been approved/given favorable opinion by an IRB/IEC ), ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator is ultimatel y responsible for the conduct of all aspects of the study at the study site and verifies by signature the integrity of all data transmitted to the Sponsor. The term “investigator” as used in this protocol as well as in other study documents, refers to the investigator or authorized study personnel that the investigator has designated to perform certain duties. Sub -investigators or other authorized study personnel are eligible to sign for the investigator, except where the investigator’s signature is specifically required. 13.1.2 STUDY FILES The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into two separate categories (although not limited to) the following: (1) investigator’s study file, and (2) subject clinical source documents."
60,page_60,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 61 of 111 The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, e CRF, IRB/IEC approval with correspondence, informed consents , drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and study- specific manuals (e.g., lab m anual) . Subject clinical source documents would include (although are not limited to) the following: subject hospital/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, radiologic imaging, X- ray, pathology and specia l assessment reports, consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc. 13.2 STUDY RECORDS RET ENTION All clinical study documents must be retained by the investigator until two years after the study is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Before the investigator destroys any material related to the clinical study, he/she must obtain approval in writing from the Sponsor. The investigator should keep a file where the full name and address of the subject and all signed informed consents are included for at least 15 years after completion of the trial. Any original study- related information that permits verification of inclusion and exclusion criteria, including clinical history, a copy of all data collection logs, and documents on the use of the study agent, must be stored for as long a time period as permitted by the center. Should the investigator wish to move study records to another location, arrangements must be made to store these in sealed containers so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 13.3 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS A Protocol D eviatio n is any noncompliance with the clinical trial pr otocol or with GCP . The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff. When deviations occur , corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented promptly. These practices are consistent with ICH E6: • 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 • 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 • 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2. Protocol Deviations will be categorized as either M ajor or M inor and will be defined in the study- specific Protoc ol Deviation Plan. Major Protocol Deviation : a departure from the approved protocol relating to the conduct of the study which may significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect the rights, safety or wellbeing of study participant s. Examples of Major Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to:"
61,page_61,"Protocol ALK6021 -201 V5.0 23SEP2019 _________________________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL/PROPRIETARY Page 62 of 111 • Failure to obtain informed consent (i.e., no evidence of informed consent) • Enrolling subjects in violatio n of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a specific subject populatio n • A drug dispensing or dosing error that could have affected the safety of the subject • Failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as this may compromise the scientific value of the trial Major Protocol Deviations may result in data that are not deemed evaluable for the per protocol analysis and/or may require that subjects are discontinued from the study. Observations categorized as Major may include those situations where there is a patt ern of deviation, numerous Minor observations, or other significant deviation. Minor Protocol Deviation : a departure from the approved protocol relating to the conduct of a study that does not affect the rights, safety, and/or wellbeing of study participants or the study outcomes or data quality. Examples of Minor Protocol Deviations include, but are not limited to: • A protocol visit date outside of a visit window • An isolated case of a missed or incomplete study procedure (e.g., laboratory test) • An isolated incident of a missed or incomplete study evaluation (e.g., examination) Minor Protocol deviations would not gen erally preclude subject data from the per protoco l analysis population. Observations categorized as Minor may become Major if not corrected. All deviations will be logged and tracked by the site and CRO. Periodic review of Protocol Deviations will serve an indicator of site performance. It is the responsibility of the site to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations promptly to the study CRO and/or Sponsor. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents. Notification of Protocol D eviations must be sent to t he local IRB/IEC per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff are responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB/IEC requirements. 13.4 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY In compliance with The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE) clinical trials registration policy and Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, this study will be registered by the Sponsor in ClinicalTrials.gov, a public trials registry which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. Notwithstanding the Sponsor’s requirements for registration and data sharing in ClinicalTrials.gov, any formal presentation or publication of data collected as a direct or indirect result of this trial will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator(s) and the Sponsor. In the case of multicenter studies, it is mandatory that the first publication be made based on the totality of data obtained from all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol, and presented and interpreted as documented in the final Clinical Study Report. The resulting publication will name investigators according to the policy of the chosen journal. Where it is not permitted for all investigators to be included as authors, the publication will name all in vestigators within the publication. Individual investigators may publish data arising from their own subjects. The investigator will provide the Sponsor with copies of written publications (including abstracts and posters) at least 60 days in advance of submission. This review is to permit the Sponsor to review the communication for accuracy (thus avoiding potential discrepancies with submissions to regulatory authorities), to verify that confidential information is not"

Investigators participating in multicenter studies must agree not to engage in pres entations based on data gathered individually or by a subgroup of centers before publication of the first main publication unless this has been agreed otherwise by all other investigators and the Sponsor. However, in the event that no publication of the overall results has been submitted after approval of the Clinical Study Report, investigators may publish results of one or more center’s subjects to the same review as outlined above. The Sponsor will circulate proposed multicenter publications to all inv estigators for review. Data will be reviewed by all participating investigators prior to publication. The study Sponsor will have 90 days to review all definitive publications, such as manuscripts and book chapters, and a minimum of 30 days to review all abstracts. 14 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE AND CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY A separate financial disclosure agreement will be made between each P rincip al Investigator and Alkahest, Inc. or its authorized representative before the study agent is shipped. Each investigator will notify Alkahest, Inc. or its authorized representative of any relevant changes during the conduct of the study and for 1 year after the study has been completed. Alkahest and the study CRO will evaluate any disclosed conflicts of interest and will establish a mechanism for their management."

Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale The S- STS was developed to provide a brief but efficient instrument for use in assessing change in suicidal ideation and behavior while providing a comprehensive description of suicidal ideation and behavior ( Sheehan 2014). The primary goals in the design of the S- STS were for the scale to be: 1) short and inexpensive; 2) s imple, clear, and eas y to administer or self -rate; 3) highly sensitive (i.e., able to detect a high proportion of patients who are suicidal); 4) s pecific (i.e., able to screen out those who are not suicidal); 5) sensitive to change in suicidal ideation and behavior; 6) compati ble with the regulatory categories of assessment for suicidal ideation and behavior; 7) useful in clinical as well as research settings; 8) useful in detecting an efficacy signal for anti-suicidal medications; and 9) c apable of use in pediatric and geriatric settings . The standard version of the S -STS is a 16 - item scale that assesses the seriousness of suicidality phenomena on a Likert -type scale (0 -4) ranging from “ not at all” (0) to “extremely” (4). It also assesses the frequency of key phenomena and th e overall time spent in suicidality.

This person’s qualifications must enable them to identify AEs , monitor vital signs , and take the appropriate course of action when an AE or clinically- significant vital sign change occurs. • Sites must identify and follow procedures that ensure adequate blinding of blinded study personnel, subjects, and trial partners before, during, and after the Infusion Period. This may include the use of study drug container covers and /or the use of drapes to separate the unblinded Infusion Nurse and infusion apparatus from the blinded Outcomes Assessor, PI, subject, and trial partner. • The unblinde d pharmacist, or other qualified site personnel responsible for drug accountability, must retain all used vials /containers for drug accountability , unless otherwise agreed t o with the Sponsor . These should be kept in a secure location with limited access to minimize the risk of unblinding blinded study staff. Partially -used vials /containers may not be re -used. 4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE UNBLINDED INFUSION NURSE 4.1. Equipment and Supplies The following equipment and supplies will be needed for each infusion: Infusion Supplies (Provided by Sponsor) • GRF6021 or p lacebo • Hangers for IV vials (for blinding) • Black IV Cover Bags (for blinding) Infusion Supplies (Not provided) • Volumetric infusion pump • IV spike set (vented) • Pump -compatible IV tubing (without inline filter) • IV Start Kit or equivalent supplies • 18-20 gauge peripheral IV catheter • Piggyback setup if saline bags will be used to flush the IV line post infusion • 0.9% s aline for injection (50 mL bags or 10 mL syringes) for post IV line or peripheral IV flush • Gloves • Alcohol pads • IV pole • Injectable cap and luer -lock connector (if applicable) • Epinephrine Pen/Epi Kit • Heparin Lock and syringe (if used) • Sharps container • Privacy screen/blinding setup during infusion"

Study Drug Infusion Rates ) If the site is unable to source needed infusion supplies, the Sponsor will assist in provisioning the required materials. 4.2. Blinding Each site is required to ensure an appropriate blinding setup is prepared before each infusion and must document the setup employed. This may include any or all of the following: • A privacy screen (or similar) to shield subject, subject’s trial partner, and all blinded study personnel from the infusion setup • Opaque bag or similar, to mask the content of the glass vial /container • Other masking devices 4.3. Prior to Infusion The unblinded Infusion Nurse will take care to ensure the appropriate blinding of the study d rug at all times. Prior to infusion: a. Verify subject identity. b. Verify randomization assignment/ kit number. c. Visually inspect the study drug vial for particulate matter or cracks in the vial. Do not use the solution if the vial is cracked or if the solution contains discrete foreign particulate matter. Do not shake. Do not use if the vial has been frozen. Study drug should be stored and infused at room temperature. d. Obtain the study drug vial from the pharmacy and ensure that it is not visible when being transported to the infusion room or while setting up the IV apparatus. e. Follow site procedures for peripheral IV catheter insertion, IV setup, and locking (if applicable). f. The study drug vial should be spiked no more than 4 hours before infusion start. It is recommended to prime the line using the study drug (either GRF6021 or placebo), while being careful to limit the amount of study drug that is lost (no more than 2 -3 mL is ideal). The amount of study drug lost during priming should be noted in the infusion source record , without disclosing any information that could be potentially unblinding. 4.3.1. Considerations if Using a Heparin or Saline Lock If the peripheral IV site will be locked with saline or heparin, the following steps should be considered: • Locked peripheral IV sites should be assessed prior to and after each use to inspect for swelling, redness, pain, warmth, and phlebitis."

If accidental unblinding occurs, immediately contact your site’s unblinded CRA for further instruction. 4.5. Post-Infusion a. Depending on your infusion line’s loading volume, sufficient saline should be used to flush the IV line to ensure of study drug was infused into the subject. b. When the infusion is complete, flush the peripheral IV catheter as ordered if it will remain in place (see Section 4.3.1) or discontinue it as appropriate. c. The unblinded Infusion Nurse will document the following information on the subject’s infusion source record: • Subject ID • Date and time of infusion start and stop • Infusion vial label checked for accuracy; record unique vial ID number • Actual volume infused (if less than ) • What infusion method or pump that was used • Titration steps (e.g. changes in flow rate and time of change) • Vascular access device and status (including all flushes) d. Following the infusion, the infusion source record should be maintained with the subject’s records. e. The unblinded Infusion Nurse should return the used vial to the unblinded pharmacist, or other qualified personnel responsible for drug accountability. During transport, ensure the vial /container is concealed from view. 5. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE BLINDED OUTCOMES ASSESSOR AND INVESTIGATOR 5.1. Equipment and Supplies The Outcomes Assessor will need the following equipment and supplies for each infusion: • Source notes for the blinded Outcomes Assessor • Sphygmomanometer, or equivalent device for measuring BP and heart rate • Pulse oximeter (optional) • Thermometer • Body weight scale 5.2. Prior to Infusion The blinded Outcomes Assessor will check the following information prior to infusion start: a. Subject identification to ensure it is the correct subject. b. Verify eligibility criteria (e.g. subject’s history and diagnosis, including allergies and previous reactions to blood or blood products). c. Review AEs and concomitant medications. d. Baseline vital signs (temperature, seated BP, orthostatic BP , heart rate, respiratory rate, and weight) within 1 hour of the start of the infusion and record data on source document."

Now reads: Approximately 90 subjects (GRF6021: 60; placebo: 30) will be enrolled in the study with the intent of obtaining ~68 evaluable subjects . Additional detail not required in this section as it is detailed in Section 10 Statistical Considerations. 6.1.2, 10.6.1 Clarified that saline placebo is supplied in glass vials. Revised for clarity. 7.1.1.1.8 Provided additional detail regarding assessment of motor function as part of the neurological exam. Revised to clarify the motor function portion of the neurological exam. 7.1.1.2.8.2, 7.3.4 Modified to reflect Protocol Clarification Memorandum #2. Revised to provide additional clarity to sites using an i -STAT handheld device to assess pre-infusion safety labs. 7.2.1 Removed sentence indicating total blood volume collected during the study. This information is conveyed in the Informed Consent Form and may vary depending on whether unscheduled labs are collected. 7.3 Previously read: Visit windows (when noted) should be benchmarked relative to Visit 3 for a subject, such that subjects complete the entire study by Day 168 (± 7 days). Now reads: To ensure follow -up visits occur at approximately the same intervals following both treatm ent periods, visit windows should be calculated as follows: • Visit windows for Visits 1 -10 should be calculated relative to Day 1. • Visit windows for Visits 11 -19 should be calculated relative to Day 85 ±7 (i.e., first day of dosing for Treatment Period 2). Revised to ensure follow - up assessments are conducted at consistent intervals post -treatment."
