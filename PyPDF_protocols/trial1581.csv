Adalimumab, a widely used tumor necrosis factor inhibitor, was chosen as an active comparator because of its well -established efficacy and safety profile; treatment with adalimumab is a standard of care. Asadditional therapies become available, an important question is whether agents with different mechanisms of action have comparable clinical efficacy and safety. To date, no results of a direct comparator study in patients with PsA comparing 2 bDMARD s have been published . This type of study design is important forinforming evidence -based treatment decisions with regard stoa tumo r necrosis factor inhibitor. Objective(s)/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary To assess whether ixekizumab is superior to adali mumab at Week 24 in the treatment of patients with active PsA as measured by American College of Rheumatology 50 (ACR50) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 100 (PASI 100) ÔÇ∑Proportio n ofpatients simultaneously achieving ACR50 and PASI 100 at Week 24 Major Secondary Objectives: To assess whether ixekizumab is noninferior to adali mumab at Week 24 in the treatment of patients with active PsA as measured by ACR50 To assess whether ixekizumab is superior to adalimumab at Week 24 in the treatment of patients with active PsA as measured by PASI 100ÔÇ∑Proportio n of patients achieving ACR50 in each treatment group at Week 24 ÔÇ∑Proportio n of patients achieving PASI 100 in each treatment group at Week 24 Other Secondary Objectives: To assess the effect of treatment with ixekizumab compared with adalimumab as measured by efficacy and quality of life outcomesPsA Endpoints Time course of response to treatment over 52 weeks as measured by: ÔÇ∑Proportio n of patients achieving ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses ÔÇ∑Change f rom baseline in individual components of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR )Core Set -tender joint count, swol len joint count, patient ‚Äô s pain assessment, Patient ‚Äôs Global Assessment of Disease Activity , Physician ‚ÄôsGlobal Assessment of Disease Activity ,"

12,page_12,"I1F-MC-RHCF(a) Clinical Protocol Page 12 LY2439821The study will consist of 3 periods: ÔÇ∑Period 1: Screening Period (Visit 1) up to 28 days before randomization (Visit 2) ÔÇ∑Period 2: Open -Label Treatment Period (Visit 2 through Visit 11) f rom Week 0 to Week 52 ÔÇ∑Period 3: Post- Treatment Follow -Up Perio d occurring from last treatment visit during Period 2 or Early Termination Visit (ETV) up to a minimum of 12 weeks after that visit Number of Planned Patients : ÔÇ∑Enrolled/Randomized: 550 (275 ixekizumab; 275 adalimumab) Statistical Analysis: The total sample size for the study will be 550patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to ixekizumab or adalimumab (patients per treatment group) in Period 2. A significance level of 0.05 is assumed for testing ixekizumab v ersus adalimumab . Sample size was c alculated assuming the proportion of patients simultaneously achieving ACR50 and PASI 100as 13.6% and 31.3%in the adalimumab and ixekizumab treatment groups, respectively ,as observed in the conventional synthetic disease - modifying anti -rheumatic drug ( csDMARD )-experienced population from Study RHAP . According to the nQuery sof tware, a total sample size of 550 patients (with 275 patients per treatment group) using a 2 -sided Fisher's exact test at a0.05 leve l of significance would yield approximately 99% power for testing ixekizumab versus adalimumab. This sample size would yield 78% power for testing thenoninferio rity of ixekizumab to adalimumab at a one-sided 0.025 level of significance based o n a no ninferiority margin of ‚Äì12% and using ACR50 response rates of 43.8% and 44.1% as observed for the ixekizumab and adalimumab treatment groups , respectively ,in the csDMARD - experienced population from Study RHAP . For testing superiority of ixekizumab to adalimumab based on PASI 100 response rates of 46.9% and 23.7% as observed for ixekizumab and adalimumab in the csDMARD -experienced populatio n fromStudy RHAP, this sample size would yield 99% power using a 2 -sided Fisher's exact test at 0.05 level of significance ."

20,page_20,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 20 LY24398213.Introduction 3.1. Study Rationale During the l ast decade, the treatment of psoriatic arthrit is (PsA) has significant ly changed . Methotrexate (MTX) or other conventio nal synt hetic disease -modifying anti -rheumat ic drugs (csDMARD) such as sulfasalazine or leflun omide areusually init iated as a firstline o f treatm ent. In pati ents wi th active PsA and an inadequate response or intol erance to a csDMARD ,the use of a bio logic DMARD (bDMARD) is recommended according to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriat ic Arthri tis (GRAPPA) working group (Gossec et al. 2016; Coates etal. 2016) . Based on curr ent treatment recommendations, a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor is the usual first option for a bDMARD, mainly because of the long-term experi ence and the well-established efficacy and safet y profile o f these agents . Five TNF inhibitors have been approved and are available in major markets for the treatment of PsA to-date: etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab ,and certolizumab. In addit ion, biosimilars of infliximab , etanercept , and adalimumab (Amjevita package insert, 2016) have been rec ently approved for use in PsA. New bDMARDs targeting different mechanisms of act ion have also been approved for the treatm ent of PsA, wi th ustekinumab targeting the IL -12/IL -23 pathway , secukinumab and brodal umab targeting the IL -17 pathway , and apremilas t, an oral molecule, inhibit ing phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4). As addit ional therapi es beco me available, an important question is whether bDMARDs with different mechanisms o f acti on have com parable clinical efficacy and safet y. Ixekizumab has been studied in pat ients with active PsA in a study that included adalimumab as an act ive control reference arm (Mease et al. 2017). Yet to date, no results of a direct com parator study in pat ients with PsA co mparing 2 bDMARDs have been published. This type of study design is important for informing evidence -based treatment decisions with regard to a TNF inhibitor . In thi s study , adalimumab has been chosen as the active comparator, as it is recognized as a standard of care for a bDMARD in the treatment of active PsA. 3.2. Background PsA is an immune -mediated chronic inflammatory disorder commo nly associated wi th psoriasis (Ps) that occurs in 0.04% to 1% of the general populat ion but in 6% to 42% of patients with psori asis. It i s a progressive, destructive disease that re sults in deformit ies, impaired physical funct ion, loss o f QoL, and increased mortalit y (Kavanaugh et al 2016). PsA also has a considerable negat ive impact on mult iple physical and emot ional aspects of patients‚Äô lives (Gladman et al . 2005; Rosen et al . 201 2). Pati ents wi th PsA have reported poorer health -related QoL compared to the general populat ion and to Ps patients (Husted et al. 1997; Rosen et al. 2012) and suffer from a similar level o f functional impairment to patients with rheumatoid arthri tis (RA) (Husted et al . 2013). The current standard of care for PsA includes nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory drugs; intra-articular and/or systemic glucocorti coids; convent ional synt hetic disease -modifying"
21,page_21,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 21 LY2439821anti-rheumat ic drugs (csDMARDs) such as MTX, sulfasalazine (SSZ), lefluno mide, and cyclosporine A; and bio logic agents such as TNF inhibitors (Gossec et al. 2012; Smo len et al. 2014, Gossec et al. 2016). Although leflunomide has been shown to be effect ive in improving signs and symptoms of PsA as assessed by Psoriatic Arthrit ic Response Criteria (PsARC) and American Co llege of Rheumatology 20 score (ACR20), there is only weak evidence that other csDMARDs are effect ive, though limited controlled clinical trial d ata are available (Gossec et al. 2012; Mease and Armstrong 2014, Gossec et al. 2016). In a recent randomized controlled trial of patients wi th PsA treated wi th MTX, no si gnificant improvement was demonstrated in peripheral arthri tis (Kaltwasser et al. 200 4, Kingsley et al . 2012). Addi tionally, csDMARDs have not demonstrated efficacy in treating axial invo lvement, enthesit is, or dactylit is, though limited data are available ( Gossec etal. 2012; Mease and Armstrong 2014). SSZ was effect ive for axial manife stations in an open -label trial, but not for enthesit is or dactylit is (Clegget al. 1996; Dougados et al. 1995). Data on radiographic progression on MTX has not been conclusive and only analyzed in a small case -control study; for SSZ, radiographic progres sion was not prevented in a small case -control study of 20SSZ-treated pati ents and 20 m atched controls ( Ash et al. 2012). In pati ents wi th PsA, TNF inhibitors are effect ive in treating signs and symptoms, inhibit ing or slowing structural progressi on (main ly bone degradation), and improving skin lesio ns (Kavanaugh et al. 2006; Mease et al. 2005; Mease et al. 2000; Mease et al. 2004; Kavanaugh etal. 2009; Antoni et al. 2005a; Antoni et al. 2005b). However, between 30% and 40% of patients wi th PsA have a pa rtial response while others become resistant or intolerant to treatment and cont inue to accrue disabilit y (Rudwaleit et al. 2010; Nash and Clegg 2005). In addition, infect ions, m alignancies, blood dyscrasias, peripheral neuropathy , and central nervous sys tem and spinal cord demyelinat ion can present as majo r probl ems in some patients treated with these agents (Deepak et al. 2013; Ruderm an2012; Singh et al. 2011). Therefore, there is an unmet need for alternative effect ive medicat ions with a different mec hanism o f action and an improved safet y profile for patients with PsA. Ixekizumab (LY2439821) is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 monoclonal ant ibody that neutralizes the cy tokine IL -17A (al so known as IL -17). Ixekizumab was developed by humanizat ion and optimizat ion of a mouse anti -human IL -17 ant ibody . It has a high affinit y for and neutralizes the activit y of both human and monkey IL -17. It has high specificit y to IL -17A and has no cross -reactivit y to other IL -17 family members (IL -17B- F). Ixekizumab blocks IL - 17 binding to the IL -17 receptor (IL -17R). A total o f 7339 patients ( 5689 patients with psoriasis, 532 patients with RA, and 1118 patients with PsA) have been treated with at least 1 dose of ixekizumab . The efficacy o f ixekizumab in patients wi th moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis has bee n evaluated in 3 large, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 studies ( Studi es RHAZ, RHBA, and RHBC) invo lving a total of 2328 patients treated with ixekizumab and 791 patients treated with place bo. Ixekizumab was found to be superi or to pl acebo in all 3 studies during both the inducti on and maintenance phases. Inthe 2 studi es wi th etanercept as an act ive co mparator during the induction phase, ixekizumab"
22,page_22,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 22 LY2439821was found to be superior to etanercept. Based on these results, ixekizumab has been approved for the treatm ent of moderate -to-severe psoriasis worldwide. In pati ents wi th PsA, Study RHAP was designed to assess whether ixekizumab 80 mg every 2weeks (Q2W) or 80 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W )was superi or to pl acebo in the treatm ent of bDMARD -naive patients with act ive PsA. Significant ly more pati ents treated with ixekizumab achieved an ACR20 , ACR50, and ACR70 response compared wi th placebo -treated patients at Week 24 (all co mpar isons p‚â§.001 ; nonresponde r imputati on m ethod): ÔÇ∑ACR20 response -IXEQ2W (62.1%) ,IXEQ4W (57.9%) versus placebo (30.2%) ÔÇ∑ACR50 response -IXEQ2W (46.6%) , IXEQ4W (40.2%) versus placebo (15.1%).

The improvement from baseline in Short Form (36 Items) Healt h Survey Physical Component Score was also si gnificantly great er at Week 24 for patients receiving IXEQ4W (7.5) and IXEQ2W (8.2) compared with those receiving placebo (2.9) (p ‚â§.01). For patients with dactylit is and LDI-B >0 at baseline, signi ficantly greater improvements in mean LDI -B scores at Week 24 (post hoc ana lysis) were observed for the IXEQ4W and IXEQ2W groups compared with the placebo group (p ‚â§.01) and complete resolut ion of dactylit is symptoms (LDI -B=0) at Week 24 (post hoc analysis) occurred at a greater rate in the IXEQ4W (80%) and IXEQ2W (77%) groups than in the placebo group (25%) (p ‚â§.001). For patients with nail invo lvement at baseline, mean changes fro m baseline in the NAPSI score at Week 24 were sign ificantly greater for the IXEQ4W ( ‚àí14.0) and IXEQ2W ( ‚àí15.5) groups than for the placebo group ( ‚àí2.4) ( p‚â§.001). Progression of structural damage, measured by changes from baseline in mTSS at Week 24, was significant ly less in the IXEQ4W (0.17) andIXEQ2W (0.08 )groups than in the placebo group (0.49) (p ‚â§.01) . There was not a statist ically significant dif ference between either ixekizumab group, compared with the pl acebo group, for the major secondary endpoints of change from baseline to Week 12 in Leeds Enthesit is Index (LEI) (Mease et al. 2017). Significant therapeutic effects for the si gns and symptom s of PsA, physical funct ion, progression of structural damage, and skin manifestations of psoriasis were observed for many endpoints as early as 1 week after init iation of therapy . Effects were observed in the overall bDMARD -naive popul ation and the subpopulat ion with csDMARD experience. The findings were clinically"
23,page_23,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 23 LY2439821significant and indicated that ixekizumab offers a potential therapeutic option for patients with active PsA who are bDMARD naive. Although a dalimumab 40 m g Q2W was used as the active control for com parison wi th placebo , this study was not powered to compare ixekizumab wit h adalimumab . In addit ion, the Phase 3 clinical development program conducted in patients with active PsA includes 2 addit ional studi es: Study RHBE in pat ients who are bDMARD experienced, and Study RHBF, a wi thdrawal study conducted in csDMARD -inadequate responder (IR) and bDMARD -naive pat ients.

The primary objective of this study is to assess whether ixekizumab is superior to adalimumab as measured by the proportion of patients simultaneously achieving ACR50 and PASI 100at Week 24 . In addi tion, the effects of ixekizumab on extra -articular m anifestati ons of PsA such as skin, fingernails, enthesit is, dactylit is, and the impact on QoL will be evaluated.

Scientific Rationale for Study Design See Secti on 3.1for scientific rationale for study design. 5.5. Justification for Dose Protocol RHCF will include a starting dose of ixekizumab 160mg for all pat ients randomized to ixekizumab fo llowed by either i xekizumab 80 mg Q4W for patients not m eetingcriteria for moderate -to-severe plaque Ps or ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (untilWeek 12 ) and then Q4W for patients wi thmoderate -to-severe Ps. Given the similar benefit /risk profile of the 2 dosing regimens studied in the pivotal Phase 3 studies, the dose just ification for patients with PsA includes the following: Dose Justification for Patients with PsA without Coexistent Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis Rationale : Studies RHAP and RHBE examin edthe effect of 2 dose regimens (80 m g Q2W and 80mg Q4W ) of ixekizumab compared to placebo in patients with act ive PsA . Overall, there were no clinically meaningful d ifferences between the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens (Mease et al . 2017) . The less -frequent ixekizumab regimen (Q4W) provided therapeuti c benefit co mparable to the more frequent regimen (Q2W) across a range of efficacy"
31,page_31,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 31 LY2439821endpo ints up to Week 24(Studi es RHBE and RHAP) with efficacy sustained through Week 52 (Study RHAP) (Mease et al . 2016) . While there were some numeric differences, the overall safet y profiles were similar for the Q2W and Q4W dosing regimens. There were no unexpected finding s in safet y analyses, including within subgroups, across the 2 ixekizumab dosing regimens based on the previously recognized safet y profile from the psori asis clinical development program. The findings were confirmed wit h the exposure -response analyses of efficacy and safet y. Dose Justification for Patients with PsA with Coexistent Moderate -to-Severe Plaque Psoriasis Rationale : Evidence fro m the pivotal Phase 3 tri als for moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis (Studi es RHAZ, RHBA, and RHBC) demonstrated additional clinical benefit on skin measures for the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W dosing regimen versus the Q4W dosing regimen at Week 12 (Gordon et al. 2016) . In the pivotal Phase 3 studies for PsA, this addit ional clinical benefit was observed in patients with PsA who had higher levels of skin invo lvement ( ie, BSA ‚â•10%) and those defined as having coexistent moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis (Studi es RHBE and RHAP) . Given there were no meaningful differences in safet y between these dosing regimens in patients defined as having coexistent moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis, it is recommended that such patients use the dosing regimen approved for patients with moderate -to-severe plaque psori asis. Dose Justification for the 52 -Week Study Duration In addit ion, long-term efficacy and safet y were evaluated for up to 52 weeks in Study RHAP. For patients who rem ained on ixekizumab after 24 weeks of treatment, durabilit y of the therapeuti c effects was observed for up to 52 weeks of treatment across relevant clinical d omains of PsA, incl uding the signs and symptoms of disease activit y, as represented by ACR20/50/70 responses; physical function, as assessed by HAQ -DI;andskin manifestati ons of psori asis, as assessed by PASI 75/90/100 ,indicat ing clinically meaningful re sponses. The overall efficacy findings when placed in the context of the safet y resul ts from the Extensio n Peri od for the ixekizumab dosing regimens of this global, mult icenter study are consistent with a favorable benefit /risk profile for the long- term treatm ent wi th ixekizumab in pat ients with active PsA (Mease et al. 2016) . Lilly considers it appropriate to evaluate these 2 dose regimens in Study RHC F with regard to: ÔÇ∑The posi tive efficacy resul ts (eg, primary endpoint achieved in the bDMARD naive patients) and the currently known safet y profile from Study RHAP ÔÇ∑The overall consistency o f the safet y profile of ixeki zumab across the patient populat ions studi ed thus far, including Ps, RA , and PsA ÔÇ∑The recommended dose regimen for the treatment of PsA and mo derate -to-severe plaque psori asis, respectively. The evidence indicates a favorable benefit/risk profile that supports the conduct of the proposed PsA study , Study RHCF ."
32,page_32,I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 32 LY2439821Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous (SC)Q2W was selected as the comparator because it is an approved therapy for the treatm ent of PsA and reflects the bDMARD treatment considered to be a standard of care. Adalimumab will be dosedaccording to its approved labelling. The subset of patients wi th PsA associated with moderate -to-severe plaque psor iasis will receive the dosing regimen approved for the treatment of moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis.

Proteins may also cause redness, itching, swelling, or pain locally at the inject ion site. Therefore, all pat ients should be closely mo nitored for signs or symptoms that could result from such reactions, be educated on the signs or symptoms of these ty pes of react ions, and be instructed to contact the study site immediately if any of the symptoms are experienced after an injection. If a patient experiences an acute allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion after an inject ion of investigational product, he or she should be managed appropriately and given instruction to receive relevant supportive care. For pati ents who experience a potential allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion, consideration for any prem edicat ion for future inj ections will be agreed upon between the investigator and sponsor and/or its designee. Examples o f potenti al allergi c/hypersensit ivity react ions that might merit prem edicat ion include mild -to-moderate skin rashes, mild -to-moderate generalized pruritus and/or urti caria, and mild -to-moderate inject ion-site reacti ons (eg, injection -site ery thema, inject ion-site pruri tus). Pati ents who develop clinically significant sy stemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions after administratio n of invest igational product wh o do not respond to symptomat ic medicat ion or resul t in clinical sequelae should be discont inued fro m study treatm ent and not receive further doses of investigational product, with or without prem edicat ion (see Section 8). Medi cations considered appropriate for premedication include (but are not restricted to) acetaminophen/paracetamo l up to 1000 m g and ant ihistamines (eg, oral diphenhydramine, 50 mg ) given 30 to 60 minutes before investigational product inject ion. Patients m ay self-premedicate at hom e before administration of invest igational product, as directed by the invest igator. All such premedicat ions will be recorded as concomitant therapy.

ACR50 response is anefficacy me asure for which a patient must satisfy the following: 1)‚â•50% improvement from baseline in TJC and 2)‚â•50% improvement from baseline in SJCand 3)‚â•50% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of the fo llowing 5 ACR Core Set criteria: a.Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Pain Vi sual Analog Scale (VAS) b.PatGA VAS c.PGA VAS d.patient‚Äôs assessment of physical funct ion as measured by the HAQ -DI e.acute -phase reactant as measured by high sensit ivity (assay) CRP (hs -CRP) PASI 100 is described in Sect ion9.1.2.1 . Patients achieving PASI 100 are defined as having an improvement of 100% in the P ASIcompared to baseline . 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments 9.1.2.1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 75, PASI 90 , PASI 100) The PASI will be administered by a blinded assessor. The PASI is an accepted primary efficacy measurement for this phase of development of psoriasis treatments (EMA 2004). The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body -surface involvemen t in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severit y of desquamati on (scaling), ery thema, and pl aque induration/infiltration (thickness) in each regio n, yielding an overall score from 0 for no psoriasis up to 72 for the most severe dise ase (Fredri ksson and Pettersson 1978). The PASI has been the most frequent ly used endpo int and m easure of psoriasis severit y in clinical trials (EMA 2004;"
55,page_55,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY2439821Menter et al . 2008). A clinically meaningful response is a PASI 75, which represents at least a 75% decrease (improvement) from the baseline PASI score. As minimum treatment response, the European and German guidelines ment ion a PASI 50 response. Higher levels of clearance (PASI 90), as well as co mplete resol ution of psoriasis (PASI 100), have beco me additional endpo ints because of the increasing recognit ion of the associat ion of higher clearance wit h greater health -related QoL (Pui g 2015). Patients achieving PASI 75, 90, or 100 are defined as having an improvement of at least 75% , 90%, or 100%, respectively, in the P ASIcompared to baseline . Absolute PASI scores of ‚â§1, ‚â§2, or ‚â§3 may be consi dered as treatm ent targets for the management of plaque psoriasis. 9.1.2.2. Percentage of Body Surface Area The blinded assessor will evaluate the percentage invo lveme nt of psori asis on each pat ient‚Äôs BSA on a continuous scale from 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), in which 1% corresponds to the size of the patient‚Äôs hand (including the palm, fingers, and thumb) (National Psori asis Foundat ion [NPF] 2009). 9.1.2.3.

Any joints that requi re intra -articular inject ions during the study (according to Section 7.7) should be excluded fro m evaluation fro m the time o f the inject ion to the conclusio n of the study . Joints will be assessed for tenderness by pressure and jo int manipulati on on physical examinat ion. The patient will be asked for pain sensations on these manipulat ions and watched for spontaneous pain reactions. Any posit ive response on pressure, movement, or both will then be translated into a single tender -versus -nontender di chotomy .

For ACR measures, the number of swo llen jo ints will be determined by examinat ion of 66 jo ints (33 joints on each side of the patient‚Äôs body ). Any jo ints that require intra- articular inject ions during the study (according to Section 7.7) should be excluded fro m evaluat ion from the time of the inject ion to the conclusio n of the study . Joints will be classified as eit her swollen or not swollen. Swelling is defined as palpable fluctuating syno vitis of the jo int. Swelling secondary to osteoarthrit is will be assessed as not swollen, unless there is unmistakable fluctuation. Dactylit is should be counted as 1 swollen joint. Missing, replaced, ankylo sed, or arthrodesed jo ints will be identified by the invest igator at the Screening Visit and will be excluded fro m evaluat ion during the trial. c. Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Pain Visual Analog Scale The patient will be asked to assess his or her current level of joint pain by marking a vert ical tick on a 100 -mm horizontal VAS where the l eft end represents no joint pain and the right end represents worst possible jo int pain. The Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Pain VAS shoul d be administered prior to the TJC and SJC e xaminat ions. Results will be expressed in millimeters measured between the left end of the scale and the crossing point of the vert ical line o f the tick; this procedure is applicable for all VAS used in the trial. d. Patient‚Äôs Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale The patient‚Äôs overall assessment of his or her PsA activit ywill be recorded using the 100- mm horizontal VAS. Pati ents will be asked, ‚ÄúConsidering all the ways y our PsA has affected y ou, how do y ou feel your PsA is today?‚Äù whe re the l eft end represents ‚Äúvery well‚Äù and the right end represents ‚Äúvery poor.‚Äù e. Physician‚Äôs Global Assessment of Disease Activity Visual Analog Scale The invest igator, who must be a physician, will be asked to give an overall assessment of the severit yof the patient‚Äôs current PsA activit yusing a 100 -mm horizontal VAS, where 0 represents no disease act ivity and 100 represents extremely active disease. f. Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Physical Function as Assessed by the Health Assessment Questionnaire -Disa bility Index The HAQ -DI is a patient -reported standardized questionnaire that is commo nly used in PsA to measure disease -associ ated di sabili ty (assessment of physical funct ion). It consists of 24 questions referring to 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other daily act ivities (Fries et al . 1980; Fries et al. 1982)."
57,page_57,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 57 LY2439821The disabilit y secti on of the questi onnaire scores the pat ient‚Äôs self -percept ion on the degree of difficult y (0 = without any difficul ty, 1 = wi thsome difficult y, 2 = wi th much difficult y, and 3 =unable to do), covering the 8 domains. The reported use of special aids or devices and/or the need for assistance of another person to perform these activit ies is also assessed. The scores for each of t he functional do mains will be averaged to calculate the functional disabilit y index. An MCID i s a clinically relevant change in a pat ient‚Äôs status. The HAQ -DI MCID has been estimated to be about 0.35 for patients with PsA (Mease et al . 2011 ). Details of scoring and calculat ions are presented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). g. C- Reactive Protein CRP will be the ACR Core Set measure of acute -phase reactant. It will be measured with a high sensit ivity assay at the central laboratory to hel p assess the effect of ixekizumab on the patient‚Äôs PsA. 9.1.2.4. American College of Rheumatology 50 and 70 Responder Index ACR50 and ACR70 responses are secondary efficacy endpoints and are improvements of at least 50% and of at least 70%, respectively, in the mult iple disease assessment ACR criteria. The ACR50 and ACR70 are calculated similarly to ACR20, as described in Sect ion 9.1.2.3 . 9.1.2.5. Individual Components of the American College of Rheumatology Core Set The individual co mponents of the ACR Core Set will be measured including TJC (68 jo int count), SJC (66 jo int count), Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Pain VAS, PatGA VAS, PGA VAS, Patient‚Äôs Assessment of Physical Funct ion as measured by the HAQ -DI, and CRP (Secti on9.1.2.3.1 ). 9.1.2.6. Psoriatic Arthritic Response Criteria The PsARC is a composite criteria reported in terms of the percentage of pati ents achieving response according to the following criteria: PGA, PatGA, TJC, and SJC. Overall response is defined by improvement from the baseline assessment in 2 of the 4 criteria, 1 of which must be a joint count; there m ust not be worsening in any of the 4 criteria: 1.At least 30% reduction in TJC 2.At least 30% reduction in SJC 3.At least a 1 point reduction in physician‚Äôs assessment 4.At least a 1 point reduction in pat ient‚Äôs assessment The PsARC response was modified in this study by using the PGA and the PatGA on a 100 mm VAS described in Sect ion 9.1.2.3.1 instead of a 5- point Li kert scal e in the ori ginal criteria. The results from the 2 VAS m easures were assessed as a difference fro m baseline (in mm), but criteria 3 and 4, above, were changed to ‚Äúat least a 20 mm reduct ion‚Äù (Clegg1996). 9.1.2.7. Minimal Disease Activity The MDA score has been developed based on current expert op inion and uses a composite of 7key outcom e measures used in PsA to encompass all o f the dom ains o f the disease to m easure"
58,page_58,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 58 LY2439821the overall state of a patient‚Äôs disease (Coates et al. 2010a; Coates and Helliwell 2010b). The overall state of disease act ivity is deemed a useful target of treatment by both the patient and the physician, given current treatment possibilit ies and limitat ions. Preliminary validation work supports the use of the MDA criteria in both observat ional cohorts and in intervent ional tri al coho rts. The PsA MDA criteria have evidence supporting their use within the OMERACT filter of truth, di scriminat ion, and feasibilit y. ÔÇ∑MDA : Patients are classified as achieving MDA if they fulfill 5 o f 7 outcom e measures: TJC ‚â§1; SJC‚â§1; psori asis act ivity and severit y index (PASI total score) ‚â§1 or BSA ‚â§3; patient pain VAS score of ‚â§15; pat ient global disease activit y VAS score of ‚â§20; HAQ -DIscore ‚â§0.5; and tender entheseal po ints ‚â§1. 9.1.2.8. Modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index The Modified CPDAI is avalidated instrument intended to assess co mposite psoriat ic disease activit y and response to therapy (Mum taz et al. 20 11). Thi s instrum ent assesses individual domains invo lved as well as the global effect of disease in all dimensio ns by which each pati ent may be affected. Domains include peripheral arthrit is as assessed by the number of tender and swollen jo ints and the HAQ -DI, skin as assessed by the PASI and the DLQI, enthesit is as assessed by the number of si tes wi th enthes itisand the HAQ -DI, and dactylitis as assessed by the number of digits affected and the HAQ -DI. Scores range from 0 to 12, with a higher score indicat ing higher disease act ivity. 9.1.2.9. Leeds Enthesitis Index If the patient has enthesit is,the LEI will be administered by a blinded asses sor. The LEI has been developed specifically for use in PsA. It measures enthesit is at 6 sites (lateral epicondyle, left and right, medial femoral condyle, left and right, Achilles tendon insertion, left and right) (Healy and Helliwell 2008). Each site is assigned a score of 0 (absent) or 1 (present); the results from each sit e are then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 6). 9.1.2.10. Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada If the patient has enthesit is,the SPARCC will be administered by a blinded assessor. The SPARCC enthesit is index evaluat es tenderness in a total of 16 enthesit is sites: the greater trochanter (right/left [R/L]), quadriceps tendon insertion into the patella (R/L), patellar ligament inserti on into the patella and tibial tuberosi ty (R/L), Achilles tendon insert ion (R/L), plantar fascia insertion (R/L), medial and lateral epicondyles (R/L) ,and the supraspinatus insertion (R/L) (Mease 2011 ). Tenderness at each site isquant ified on a dichotomous basis : 0 =nontender and 1 = tende r. The results from each site are then added to produce a total score (range 0 to 16). 9.1.2.11. Leeds Dactylitis Index -Basic If the patient has dactylit is,the LDI-B will be administered by a blinded assessor. The LDI -B has been developed to measure the severit y of dactyli tis. Once the presence of dact ylitis is established in each digit, the ratio of the circumference of theaffected digit to the circumference of the di git on the opposi te hand or foot is measured (Helliwell et al. 2005 ). Each dactylit ic digit is defined by a minimum increas e of 10% in circumference over the contra -lateral digit. If the"
59,page_59,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 59 LY2439821same di gitson each hand or foot are thought to be invo lved, the clinician will refer to a table o f norm ative values (provided to study sites) for a value which will be used to provide the comparison. If the ratio is >1.1, then subtract 1 from the calculated ratio and mult iply it by 100 and the tenderness score of 0 (not tender) or 1 (tender). Otherwise, if the ratio of the circumference o f the digit is ‚â§1.1, then the LDI -B score i s set to 0. Tenderness is assessed in the area between the jo ints. The results of each digit are then added to produce a total score (Healy andHelliwell 2007). 9.1.2.12. Nail Psoriasis Severity Index Fingern ails If the patient has fingernail Ps , the NAPSI Fingernails will be administered by a blinded assessor. Site personnel should ensure that the patient makes their nails available for assessment during the study . The NAPSI Fingernails is a numeric, reprod ucible, object ive tool for evaluat ion of nail Ps. This scale is used to evaluate the severit y of nail bed Ps and nail matrix Ps by area of invo lvement in the nail unit. In this study , only fingernail involvement will be assessed. The fingernail is divid ed wi th imaginary horizontal and longitudinal lines into quadrants. Each fingernail is given a score for nail bed Ps (0 to 4) and nail matrix Ps (0 to 4) depending on the presence (1) or absence (0) of any o f the features of nail Ps in each quadrant. TheNAPSI Fingernails score of a nail is the sum of scores in nail bed and nail matrix from each quadrant (thus a maximum of 8). Each fingernail is evaluated, and the sum of all the nails is the total NAPSI Fingernails score. Thus, the sum of the scores fro m all fingernails is 0 to 80. 9.1.2.13. Disease Activity Score based on C -Reactive Protein TheDAS28 -CRP is a measure of disease act ivity in 28 j oints that consists of a composite numerical score utilizing the fo llowing variables: TJC, SJC, hs -CRP (m easured in mg/L ), and PatGA recorded by patients on a 0 to 100 mm VAS. For DAS28- CRP, the 28 jo ints to be examined and assessed as tender or not tender for TJC and as swo llen or not swollen for SJC ( Section 9.1.2.3.1 )are a subset of those assessed for the TJC and SJC, and include 14joints on each side of the patient‚Äôs body : the 2 shoul ders, the 2 elbows, the 2 wri sts, the 10 metacarpophalangeal jo ints, the 2 interphalangeal jo ints of the thumb, the 8proximal interphalangeal jo ints, and the 2 knees ( Smolen et al . 1995). The fol lowing equat ion will be used to calculate the DAS28 (Vander Cruyssen et al. 2005) : ÔÄ®ÔÄ©ÔÄ®ÔÄ©ÔÄ®ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ©ÔÄ®ÔÄ© 96. 0 014. 0 1 ln36. 0 28 28. 0 28 56. 0 28 ÔÄ´ ÔÄ´ ÔÄ´ ÔÄ´ ÔÄ´ ÔÄΩ ÔÄ≠ VAS CRP SJC TJC CRP DAS 9.1.2.14. Static Physician Global Assessment If the patient has plaque Ps, the static Physician Global Assessment of psoriasis (sPGA) will be administered by the blinded assessor. The sPGA is the assessor‚Äôs determin ation of the patient‚Äôs Pslesions overall at a given time point . The s PGA is recommended as an endpoint to use to assess efficacy in the treatm ent of Ps ( EMEA 2004). Overall lesio ns are categori zedby descript ions for induration, ery thema, and scaling . For the analysis of respon ses, the pati ent‚Äôs Ps is assessed at a given time po int on a 6 point scale in which 0 = cleared, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3= moderate; 4 = severe, 5 = very severe ."

Appropriateness of Assessments All o f the clinical and safet y assessments/measures included in the primary and maj or secondary objectives in this study are standard, widely used, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropri ate medical care of pat ients during the study. Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate health care option, AEs that are serious or otherwi se medically important, considered rel ated to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical s tudy is to establish treatment effect. After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, study site personnel will record vi a eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient‚Äôs preexist ing conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addi tion, si te personnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs. Invest igators should record their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, inves tigational product, via eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment, o r pathologies. A ‚Äúreasonable possibilit y‚Äù means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study device and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surger ies and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient‚Äôs investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must repo rt this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificati ons, or di scontinuati ons of treatm ent."
61,page_61,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 61 LY24398219.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outco mes: ÔÇ∑death ÔÇ∑initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion ÔÇ∑a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying) ÔÇ∑persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y ÔÇ∑congenital ano maly/birth defect ÔÇ∑considered significant by the invest igator for any ot her reason: important medical events that may not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment. Although all AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCR F, SAE reporting begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, it needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reason ably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately followed wi th official notificati on on stu dy-specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow -up SAE inform ation. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientsummary eCRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1.

Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C-SSRS (Posner et al. 2007; Columbia Universit yMedical Center [WWW]) is a scale that captures the occurrence, severit y, and frequency of sui cide-related i deati ons and behaviors during the assessment period. The C -SSRS m ust be administered by appropri ately trained site personnel. The tool was developed by the Nat ional Ins titute of Mental Heal th Treatm ent of Adolescent Sui cide Attem pters (TASA) trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment (C -CASA) categorizat ion of suicidal events . Pati ents will be assessed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). The Sel f -Harm Supplement Form, completed according to the Schedule of Act ivities, is a one - question formthat asks for the number of suicidal or non suicidal self -injuri ous behaviors the patienthasexperienced since the last assessment. For each uniq ue event i dentified, a questionnaire (Self -Harm Follow-Up Form ) which collects suppl emental informat ion on the self - injuri ous behavi or is to be completed. This informati on is then docum ented in the eCRF. 9.4.4. Other Tes ts 9.4.4.1. Physical Examination One co mplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic, rectal, and breast examinat ions) will be perform ed at Visit 1 ( screening ). This examinat ion will determine whether the patient meets the criteria requi red to parti cipate in the study and will al so serve as a monitor for preexist ing condi tions and as a baseline for treatment -emergent AE(TEAE) assessment. All physical examinat ions throughout the study are indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on 2) and shoul d include a symptom -directed physical evaluati on as well as an examinat ion of the heart, lungs, and abdo men and a visual examinat ion of the skin . 9.4.4.2. Chest X -Ray and Tuberculosis Testing X -ray: At Visit 1, a posteri or-anterior view chest x -raywill be obtained l ocally , unless the x -ray or results from a chest x -rayobtained wi thin 6 months before rando mizat ion (Vi sit 2) are available .

In countri es where the Quant iFERON -TB¬ÆGold test or T-SPOT.TB test is available and in the judgment of the investigator preferred as an alternative to the PPD skin test for the evaluat ion of TB infect ion, it may be used instead of the PPD test and willbe perform ed and read l ocally . If the Quant iFERON -TB¬ÆGold test or the T-SPOT.TB test is indeterminate, 1 retest using the same TB test method is allowed. If the retest is indeterminate, then the patient is excluded fro m the study . Patients wi tha posi tiveTB test performed at screening but withno other evidence o f activ e TB may be rescreened 1 time and may be enro lled without repeating the TB test based on the following requirements: ÔÇ∑after receiving at least 4 weeks of appropriate latent TB infection therapy ÔÇ∑with no evidence o f hepatotoxicit y (ALT/AST must remain ‚â§2xULN) upon retesting of serum ALT/AST pri or to randomization.

Documentati on of PPD test result smust include a record of the size of the indurat ion response ; otherwise a retest at screening (Visit 1) will be required to determine pat ient eligibilit y. Patients with positive TB test results on file : Patients with prior history of a posi tive TB test shoul d not perform a TB test at Visit 1. Documentation of this history and of at l east 4 weeks of appropriate latent TB treatment prior to randomization (Visit 2) is required for study eligibilit y. Patients who have a documented history of com pleting an appropriate TB treatment regimen with no history of re-exposure to TB since their treatment was completed and no evidence of active TB will be eligible to participate in the study .

European Quality of L ife‚Äî5 Dimensions 5 Level [EQ -5D-5L]) The EQ -5D- 5L is a standardized measure of health status used to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and econo mic appraisal. The EQ-5D- 5L consists of 2 components: a descri ptive system o f the respondent‚Äôs healt h and a rating of his/her current health state using a 0-to 100 -mm VAS. The descriptive system comprises the fo llowing 5 dimensi ons: m obilit y, self-care, usual act ivities,pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no probl ems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe probl ems, and extrem e probl ems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her healt h state by select ing in the box associated wi th the most appropri ate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no arithmetic properties and should not be used as a cardinal score. The VAS records the"

Sample Size Determination Approximately 550 pat ientswho meet all criteria for enrollment at Visits 1 and 2 will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio a t Week 0 (Visit 2)in Period 2 to ixekizumab or adalimumab ( 275patients per treatment group). Sample size was calculated assuming the proporti on of patients simultaneously achieving ACR50 and PASI 100 as 13. 6% and 31.3% in the adalimumab and ixekizumab treatm ent groups, respectively , as observed in the csDMARD -experienced popul ation fromStudy RHAP . According to the nQuery software, a total sample size of 550 (with 275 per treatm ent group ) using a 2 -sided Fisher's exact test at 0.05 level o f significance woul d yield 99% power for tes ting ixekizumab versus adalimumab. This sample size would yield 78% power for testing the noninferiorit y of ixekizumab to adalimumab at a one -sided 0.025 level of significance based on a noninferiorit y margin of ‚Äì12% and using ACR50 response rates of 43.8%and 44.1% as observed for the ixekizumab and adalimumab treatment groups, respectively, in the csDMARD -experi enced popul ation from Study RHAP . For testing superiorit y of ixekizumab to adalimumab based on PASI 100 response rates of 46.9% and 23. 7% as obse rved for ixekizumab and adalimumab in the csDMARD - experienced populat ion from Study RHAP, this sample size would yield 99% power using a 2-sided Fisher's exact test at 0.05 level of significance . 10.2. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following popul ations are defined: Population Description Entered All participants who sign informed consent Randomized Participants who met all entry criteria and were assigned a study treatment Intent -to-treat (ITT) The ITT population consists of all randomized patients. Even if the patients do not take the assigned treatment, do not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise do not follow the protocol, they will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned. Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and health outcomes analyses for Period 2 will be conducted on the ITT populatio n. Safety The safety population consists of all randomized patients who receive dat least 1 dose of study treatment in Period 2. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned. Safety analyses for Period 2 will be conducted on this analysis set . Post-treatment follow -up The post -treatment follow -up population consists of all r andomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment during Period 2 and have entered the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they were assigned in Period 2. Safety analyses for Period 3 (Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period) will be conducted on this analy sis set."

General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly. Any changes to the data analysis methods related to the primary and maj or secondary endpoints described in the protocol, and the just ificat ion for making the change, will be documented in the SAP and/or the clinical study report (CSR). Additional explorat ory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate. Com plete details of the planned analyses will be documented in the SAP. 10.3.1.1. General Considerations for Analyses during Period 2 (Open -Label Treatment Period) Baseline will be defined as the last available value before the first inject ion of the study drug f or both efficacy , heal th outcom es,and safet y analyses. In most cases, this will be the measurement recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). Categorical data for baseline variables will be summarized as frequency counts and percentages . Continuous data for baseline variables will be summarized using the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Com parisons of ixekizumab versus adalimumab will be performed for all outcome variables at all visits in Period 2; however, the primary timepoint of interest is Week 24 . Change from baseline at a particular visit will be calculated as the value at that visit minus the baseline value. For outcome measures that are not collected at each post -baseline visit, data may exist at visits where the outcome measure was not scheduled to be co llected, due to early discont inuat ion visits. In these situat ions, data f rom the early discontinuat ion visit that does not correspond to the planned collection schedule will be excluded from any mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) analysis. However, the data will still be used in other analyses, including shift a nalyses, change fro m baseline analyses using last observat ion carried forward (LOCF) imputati on m ethod, and other categorical analyses. 10.3.1.2. Missing Data Imputation The m ethods for imputati on of missing data to be used in this study are described below. 10.3.1.2.1. Nonresp onder Imputation Missing data for categorical efficacy and healt h outcom e measures will be imputed using the nonresponder imputation ( NRI) method. Patients will be considered nonresponders if they do not m eet the clinical response criteria or have missing clinical response data at the time po int of analysis. Rando mized pat ients without at l east one post -baseline observat ion will also be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis."

Last Observation Carried Forward Missing data for continuous efficacy and health outcom es variables will be impute dusing LOCF method . For patients discont inuing investigational product or having missing data at a visit, the last nonmissing post -baseline observation before discontinuat ion or before the visit with missing data will be carried forward to the corresponding time point. Randomized patients without at least one post -baseline observation will not be included in LOCF analyses. In addit ion to NRI and LOCF, other imputation methods may be used as deemed appropriate. 10.3.1.3.

If the unstructured covariance matrix results in a lack of convergence, the heterogeneou s Toeplitz covariance structure, fo llowed by the heterogeneous autoregressive covari ance structure will be used . The Kenward -Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the deno minator degrees of freedo m. Type III tests for the least squares means will be used for the statist ical comparison; the 95% CI will also be reported . Treatment group comparisons at all visits up to Wee k 52 will be made ."

Categorical Variables Secondary analys es for treatm ent com parisons on the categori cal efficacy variables will be conducted using a Fisher‚Äôs exact test. 10.3.3.2.2. Continuous Variables Secondary analyses for treatment comparisons on continuous outcome variables will be perform ed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model and LOCF imputati on m ethod . The details o f the analysis model will be presented in the SAP . 10.3.3.3. Methodology for Noninferiority Test For assessing noninferiorit y of ixekizumab to adalimumab, missing data will be imputed using the NRI m ethod. Noninferiorit y analysis will be performed on the ITT populat ionusing a prespecified fixed margin approach . There i s no universally accepted value for what is considered to be a clinically unimportant difference between 2 treatments for a particular efficacy measure. We will consider the points fro m EMEA Committee for Medicinal Products for Hum an Use ( CHMP )(CHMP 2005) and FDA guidance (201 6) which statethat an appropriate noninferiorit y margin should be based on both clinical and statist ical grounds . The null hypothesis will be rejected if the l ower bound of the 2- sided 95% CI for the difference in proporti ons of responders on ixekizumab minus adalimumab is greater than the prespecified margin, meaning ixekizumab will be deemed noninferior to adalimumab . If the lower bound of the CI exceeds 0 (the corresponding p -value will also be produced), then ixekizumab will be deem ed superi or to adalimumab . The 95% CIs for the difference in proportions will be calculated using the simple asymptotic method, without continuit y correcti on (that i s, norm al approximat ion to the bino mial distribut ion). Based on EMEA CHMP (CHMP 2005) ,FDA guidance (2016 ),and Weinblatt et al. (2013), a noninferiorit y margin o f ‚àí12.0% for ACR50 between ixekizumab and adalimumab (ie, response rate of ixekizumab ‚Äìresponse rate of adalimumab) is considered appropri ate. This noninferiorit y margin represents a napproximately 50% preservati on of the adalimumab treatm ent effect (based on the difference between adalimumab and placebo) observed in a historical Phase 3 stud yfor adalimuma b 40 m g twice weekly com pared wi th placebo (Mease et al 2005) and Study RHAP . If it is deemed appropriate to perform noninferiorit y tests on endpoints other than ACR50, the details about select ion of noninferiorit y margins for the other endpoints will be p resented in the SAP. 10.3.4. Safety Analyses Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing AEs, laboratory analy tes including neutrophil counts, vital signs, and conco mitant m edications. The durati on of exposure will also be summarized. The primary safety analyses will focus on comparisons of ixekizumab versus adalimumab in Period 2. Fisher's exact test will be used for all AEs and other categorical safet y data. Continuous vital sign and laboratory values will be analyzed using ANCOVA method wit h"
75,page_75,"I1F-MC-RHCF (a)Clinical Protocol Page 75 LY2439821treatm ent and baseline value in the model. Other continuous safet y variables will be analyzed by t-tests, unless otherwise stated. Summaries of safet y data collected during the Post- Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od 3) will be presented separately . Unless o therwise specified, the fo llow-up baseline is defined as the last nonmissing assessment on or prior to the Week 52 (Visit 11) or early discontinuati on visi t. The categorical safet y measures will be summarized with incidence rates . The m ean change of the continuous safet y measures will be summarized by visits. 10.3.4.1. Adverse Events AEsare cl assified based on the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or wor sened in severit y after the first dose of study treatm entand on or prior to the date of the last visit within the treatment period. Both the date/time of the event and th e date/time of the dose (ie , inject ion) are considered when determining TEAEs. For each TEAE, the severit y is recorded acc ording to the patient‚Äôs or physician‚Äôs perceived severit y of the event (mild, moderate, or severe). A follow-up em ergent adverse event (FE AE)is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after the date of Week 52 (Visit 11) or the ET V. For events that are sex-specific, the deno minator and computati on of the percentage will only include subjects from the given sex. An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for Period 2, including the number and percentage of subjects who experienced TEAE s, TEAEs by maximum severit y, death, SAEs , TEAEs related to study drug, di scont inuat ions from treatm ent due to an AE, and treatment -emergent adverse event sof special interest . TEAEs (all, by maximum severi ty, and TEAE s possibly related to study drug by the investi gator), SAE s including deaths, and AEs that lead to treatment discontinuat ion will be summarized and analyzed by MedDRA system organ cl ass(SOC) and preferred term. In addit ion to general safet y param eters, safet y inform ation on specific topics of adverse event s of special interest will also be presented. Potential adverse event sof special interest will be ident ified by a standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) or a Lilly -defined MedDRA preferred term listing. Follow-Up em ergent AEs, SAE s incl uding deaths, and AEs that lead to study discont inuat ion will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term for Period 3. 10.3.4.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory assessments will be analyzed as mean changes from baseline and as incidence of treatm ent-emergent abnormal, high, or low laboratory values (see bel ow). Shift tables will be presented for selected parameters.

Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Safety Evaluations Vital signs will beanalyzed as mean changes from base line and as incidence of abnormal values and will be summarized for both predose and postdose at Week 0 (Week 2) and Week 52 (Visit11), as applicable . Suicide-related thoughts and behaviors and self- injuri ous behavior wi th no sui cidal intent, based on the C -SSRS, will be listed by patient. 10.3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses Not applicable . 10.3.6. Other Analyses 10.3.6.1. Subgroup Analyses Subgroup analysis will be conducted using the ITT population. Subgroups to be evaluated will i nclude conco mitant csDMARD use at baseline (Yes vs No), concomitant MTX use at baseline (Yes vsNo), sex(male vs female), age group (<65 vs ‚â•65) . A detailed descript ion of the subgroup variables will be provided in the SAP. A logistic regressio n model with treatm ent, subgroup, and the interaction of subgroup by treatm ent included as factors will be used. The subgroup-by- treatm ent interacti on will be tested at the significance level of 0.10. Treatment group differences will be evaluated within each categ ory of the subgroup using Fisher‚Äôs exact test, regardless of whether the interaction is statist ically significant. Missing data will be imputed using NRI. If any group within the subgroup is less than 10% of the total populat ion, only summaries of the ef ficacy data will be provi ded ( ie,no inferent ial testing will be perf ormed). 10.3.7. Interim Analyses An interim database lock will occur, and the analysis will be performed at the time (that is, a cutoff date) when the last patient completes Visit 8 (Week 24), co mpletes ETV, or discont inues from Period 2. Thi s database l ock will include all data collected by the cutoff date including data after Week 24 fro m the Open- Label Treatment Peri od (Peri od 2) and follow -up data from patients who have begun Post -Treatment F ollow-Up Peri od (Peri od 3). This interim database lock at Week 24 will be considered the primary database l ock f or this study because all primary and major secondary study object ives will be assessed at this t ime.

Synopsis Objective(s)/Endpoints: Psoriasis/Nail Endpoints Time course of response to treatment over 52 weeks as measured by: ÔÇ∑Change f rom baseline in body surface area (BSA) ÔÇ∑Proportio n of patients who ac hieve the following PASI score s: PASI 75, PASI 90, or PASI 100 (defined as 75%, 90%, and 100% improvement from baseline in PASI criteria, respectively) ÔÇ∑Proportio n of patients achieving an absolute PASI score < ‚â§1 or < ‚â§2 or < ‚â§3 ÔÇ∑Change f rom baseline in the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) Fingernails score in the subgroup of patients with fingernail involvement at baseline (ie, baseline NAPSI Fingernails score >0) Statistical Analysis: A significance level of 0.05 is assumed for testing each dosing regimen of ixekizumab v ersus adalimumab . Sample size was calculated assuming the proportion of patients simultaneously achieving ACR50 and PASI 100as 13.2 13.6% and 28.8 31.3 %in the adalimumab and ixekizumab treatment groups, respectively ,as observed in the conventional synthetic disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug ( csDMARD )-experienced population from Study RHAP . According to the nQuery sof tware, a total sample size of 550 patients (with 275 patients per treatment group) using a 2 -sided Fisher's exact test at a0.05 leve l of significance would yield approximately 99% power for testing ixekizumab versus adalimumab. This sample size would yield 79 78% power for testing the noninferiority of ixekizumab to adalimumab at a one - sided 0.025 level of significance based on a noninferiority margin of ‚Äì12% and using ACR50 response rates of 42.5 43.8% and 44.1% as observed for inthe ixekizumab and adalimumab treatment groups , respectively, in the csDMARD -experienced population from Study RHAP ,respectively . For testing superiority of ixekizumab to adalimumab based on PASI 100 response rates of 42.5 46.9% and 23.5 23.7 % as observed for ixekizumab and adalimumab in the csDMARD -experienced population from Study RHAP, this sample size would yield 99% power using a 2 -sided Fisher's exact test at 0.05 level of significance. 2.

The LDI -B has been developed to measure the severit y of dactyli tis. Once the presence of dact ylitis is established in each digit, the ratio of the circumference of theaffected digit to the ci rcumference of the di git on the opposi te hand or foot is measured (Helliwell et al. 2005 ). Each dactylit ic digit is defined by a minimum increas e of 10% in circumference over the contra -lateral digit. If the same di gitson each hand or foot are thought t o be invo lved, the clinician will refer to a table o f norm ative values (provided to study sites) for a value which will be used to provide the comparison. The calculated ratio is then mult iplied by a tenderness score of 0 (not tender) or 1(tender). If the ratio is >1.1, then subtract 1 from the calculated ratio and mult iply it by 100 and the tenderness score of 0 (not tender) or 1 (tender). Otherwise, if the ratio of the circumference of the digit is ‚â§1.1, then the LDI -B score i s set to 0. Tenderness is assessed in the area between the jo ints. The results of each digit are then added to produce a total score (Healy andHelliwell 2007)."
