Protocol Synopsis Strategic MAnagement to Optimize Response To Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy SMART CRT Study Objective(s) The primary objective is to show the benefit of SmartDelay ™ in patients with a prolo nged RV- LV interval. Planned Indication(s) for Use All implanted devices will be used within the current labeled indications for use. Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators ( CRT -D) are intended to provide cardiac resynchronization therapy and provide anti - tachycardia pacing and defibrillation therapy . Device Description All commercially approved Boston Scientific X4 quadripolar CRT -D devices and future generations of BSC X4 CRT -Ds approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies will be included in the trial in combination with a Boston Scientific ACUITY™ X4 quadripolar LV lead. CRT -D devices must be capable of providing SmartDelay recommendations for both biventricular pacing (BiV) and left v entricular (LV) only pacing. A list of approved ACUITY X4 LV leads and CRT -D models is available upon request. Study Design SMART CRT is a prospective, double -blind, multicenter, international, randomized controlled trial. Planned Number of Subjects An estimated 726 subjects will be enrolled in the study in order to achieve a target of at least 370 subjects to complete the Six Month Follow -Up. The study progress will be monitored, and if necessary, the number of patients enrolled may be increased to ensure that an adequate numb er of patients complete the Six Month Follow -Up. Planned Number of Investigational Sites / Countries The study will be conducted at up to 100 sites globally. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is comparing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT ) response rates between AV Delay programming schemes define d by SmartDelay or a Fixed AV Delay of 120ms . CRT response is defined by a decrease in Lef t Ventricular End Systolic Volu me (LVESV) ≥ 15% at 6 months compared to pre -implant baseline ."

For those subjects identified with an RV-LV delay ≥70ms, 1:1 randomization will occur in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Subjects will be randomized to have an AV Delay determined by SmartDelay or by a Fixed AV Delay of 120ms. Those s ubjects identified with an RV -LV < 70ms will be exited from the study after 30 day contact to assess for any reportable safety events. Follow- up Schedule Study procedures or clinic visits will occur at the following time periods: • Enrollment V isit (<30 days prior to implant procedure) • Pre-Implant V isit (<30 days prior to implant procedure) • Post-Implant A ssessment (0 -14 days post -implant) and Randomization, if applicable • Six Month Follow- Up Visit (180 to 210 days after Randomization) Study Duration The trial duration is estimated to be approximately 2.5 years from first enrollment to the last patient follow -up."

Sample Size Parameters Approximately 726 subjects are required in order to achieve 370 subjects to complete the Six Month Follow -Up. Sample size was calculated using the followi ng assumptions: • Effect size = 14 .25% difference (based on ability to detect at least 75% of the 19% difference observed in SMART AV) • Randomization allocation = 1:1 • Subject s contributing to analysis = 370 ( 51%) of enrolled subjects o 436 ( 60%) with RV- LV ≥ 70 ms o 370 ( 85% of randomized subject s) with complete datasets at 6 months among subject s with RV- LV ≥ 70 ms Our sample size parameters for patient enrollment were estimated based on experience from prior studies. These parameters will be re- evaluated while the study is in progress, and if necessary, adjustments may be made."

Introduction Heart failure may be exacerbated by the presence of an interventricular conduction delay. This delay in conduction, evidenced by QRS prolongation on an ECG, often results in an inefficient asynchronous contraction pattern. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is the application of electrical stimuli to both ventricles with an implanted device. Cardiac r esynchronization therapy, when combined with defibrillation (CRT -D) was first demonstrated to be safe and effective in the CONTAK CD study 1. This study showed that defibrillator patients with NYHA Class III- IV heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and wide QRS who randomized to CRT -D On had significantly improved exercise performance, reduction in symptoms, increased quality of life, and improved cardiac structure and function when compared to patients randomized to CRT -D Off. The COMPANION study was a subsequent study of patients NYHA Class III -IV heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and wide QRS. Unlike the prior CONTAK CD study, patients in COMPANION were not indicated for a defibrillator. Patients in this study were randomized on a 2:2:1 basis to CRT -D, CRT -P (CRT without a defibrillator), or optimal pharmacological therapy. COMPANION not only confirmed the re sults from the CONTAK CD study, but demonstrated additional benefits of CRT that included significant reduction in all-cause mortality, both alone and in combination with hospitalization due to all -causes, cardiovascular causes, or heart failure2. The study of CRT -D was extended in the MADIT CRT trial to defibrillator patients with NYHA Class I -II, reduced ejection fraction, and wide QRS. Like the COMPANION study before it, M ADIT CRT showed that CRT -D was associated with significant reduction in all- cause mortality in combination with heart failure hospitalization when compared to patients receiving a defibrillator alone3. MADIT CRT also demons trated significant reduction in left ventricular volumes and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction. The benefits of CRT -D are not conferred on every patient implanted with a device, however. Patients who fail to show improvement are typically referred to as “non -responders”. There is no universally accepted metric for defining response. Commonly used outcome measures in clinical practice include symptomatic relief, quality of life, or exercise tolerance. Improvements in echocardiographic param eters (left ventricular dimensions/volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction) may also be used. Large scale clinical trials tend to use composite endpoints, of which the Clinical Composite Endpoint (CCE) is the most widely used 4. This endpoint combines four metrics: all -cause mortality, heart failure hospitalization, NYHA Class, and quality of life as measured with the patient global assessment instrument. When clinical metrics are used, the typical non -response rate cited is one -third of patients are non-responders. When echo- based measures are used, the non -response rate is somewhat higher. The potential reasons for non- response are varied and include 5: • Poor lead location"
13,page_13,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 14 of 67 • Lack of baseline electrical dyssynchrony • Improper programming • Irreversibly adva nced heart failure • Myocardial scar Device- based features have been introduced that modify how CRT is delivered. These include: • Interventricular timing (V -V timing) • AV Delay • Multi -site pacing • LV-only CRT To date, the randomized clinical studies conducted have shown equivalence with conventional CRT delivery without demonstrating superiority although subsequent subgroup analyses suggest that some patients may be helped. V-V Timing : The InSync III Marquis Study 6 using the CCE, D ECREASE HF Study7 using a composite of peak VO2 and L VESD, and RHYTHM ICD V- V Optimization Study8 using peak VO2 all demonstrated the safety of this feature and non- inferiority to conventional sequential biventricular pacing, but none showed superiority. LV Only CRT : The DECREASE HF Study7 using a composite of peak VO2 and LVESD and the B -LEFT HF Study9 using the CCE demonstrated safety of LV pacing but neither showed that LV Only CRT was superior to conventional biventricular CRT. The AdaptivCRT study, using the CCE, evaluated an algorithm that provided either LV or biventricular pacing depending on AV conduction while also periodically adjusting AV delay and V -V timing. This algorithm was found to be non -inferior to echocardiographic -guided optimization 10. AV Delay: Randomized studies to determine the effectiveness of optimizing AV delay have been based on algorithms that use measurements of intrinsic conduction to establish an AV delay. These studies include FREEDOM11 (which also included a V-V timing optimization algorithm) and used the CCE and SMART -AV12 which used LVESV, which showed these methods were non- inferior to empiric programming. The RESPOND -CRT study, which evaluated a CRT system that employed a hemodynamic sensor to optimize both AV and VV timing, used a modified version of the CCE. This study as well found that the sensor was non-inferior to echocardiographic optimization 13. Multi -site Pacing: To date, results from only one randomized clinical trial on multi- site pacing has been presented. The MPP Trial, using a modified version of the CCE, evaluated a CRT -D system that pace d the left ventricle from two distinct sites using a quadripolar lead14. The study had a 3 month run- in phase that identified non -responders who were then randomized to MPP or conventional CRT. MPP was found to be non- inferior to conventional CRT in converting non- responders to responders. Given that no major randomized trial has prospectively shown superiority to conventional methods of delivering CRT, emphasis has shifted to tailoring CRT to a given patient’s intrinsic electrophysiologic characteristics. Left ventricular electrical delay (LVED), which is a measure of the difference in time between an intrinsic ventricular depolarization being"

Longer LVEDs would be indicative of both underlying baseline dyssynchrony and good lead position and provide a better foundation for CRT optimization. The SMART AV 12 study was reexamined in this light by Gold et al15 and the results of the fixed AV delay and SMART AV-determined AV delay arms were divided into quartiles based on the LVED as measured at the time of implant using the Q- wave from the surface lead II ECG as one timing reference and appearance of unpaced ventricular depolarization on the left ventricular lead as the othe r. In this retrospective analysis that used reduction in LVESV as its primary endpoint, prolonged values of QLV were significantly associated with progressively greater degrees of reverse remodeling. The role of interventricular delay was examined again by Gold et al 16, but this time using data from the implanted CRT -D device instead of external hardware. For this analysis, interventricular delay was measured as the elasped time between unpaced ventricular depola rization detected on the right ventricular lead and the left ventricular lead (RV -LV). The same relationship was observed with RV- LV based subgroups that was previously observed with QLV, namely, that progressively larger values of RV- LV were significantly associated with greater reductions in left ventricular volumes and improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction and quality of life. This retrospective observation that SmartDelay was more effective with prolonged RV -LV is the basis for the SMART CR T study. The objective of the SMART CRT study is to confirm this finding prospectively. 5. Device Description 5.1.

The objective of the feature is to recommend AV Delays that provide optimally timed CRT, which maximizes contractile function. The SmartDelay optimization test evaluates right and left ventricular response to both atrial sensed and paced events to determine suggested settings for the following: Paced AV Delay (PAV), Sensed AV Delay (SAV), pacing chamber(s)."

Study Objectives The primary objective is to show the benefit of SmartDelay in patients with a prolonged RV- LV interval. 7. Study Endpoints The primary endpoint is comparing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response rates between AV Delay programming schemes defined by SmartDelay or a Fixed AV Delay of 120ms.CRT response is defined by a decrease in LVESV of ≥ 15% at 6 months compared to the pre-implant baseline. 8. Study Design SMART CRT is a prospective, double-blind, multicenter, international, randomized controlled trial. 8.1. Scale and Duration The study will be conducted at up to 100 sites globally. An estimated 726 subjects will be enrolled in the study in order to achieve a target of at least 370 subjects to complete the Six Month Follow- Up. The study progress will be monitored, and if necessary, the number of patients enrolled may be increased to ensure that an adequate number of patients complete the Six Month Follow-Up. The final sample size will be determined via an interim sample size re- assessment, as described in Section 12.1.2. Figure 8-1: SMART CRT Study Design 8.2. Treatment Assignment The RV- LV interval will be measured at the P ost-Implant A ssessment f or all subjects enrolled and implanted with a BSC X4 CRT -D system . For those subjects identified with an"

Subjects will be randomized to have either an AV Delay and pacing chamber determined by SmartDelay or a Fixed AV Delay of 120ms with BiV pacing . Randomization schemes can be obtained by logging onto the electronic data capture system (EDC) and registering the subject. Study participation ends prior to randomization assignment for subject s with a n RV- LV < 70ms (as shown in Figure 8-1: SMART CRT Study Design). Subjects with an RV -LV < 70ms will be exited from the study after 30 day contact to assess for any reportable safety events. Treatment Arms There will be two treatment arms of the trial: Table 8-1: Treatment Arms ARM 1= AV Delay and pacing chamber determined by SmartDelay ARM 2 = Fixed AV Delay at 120ms with BiV pacing 8.3. Justification for the Study Design NYHA Class I -II patients are now eligible for CRT following the MADIT CRT study3, and there are no prior data for these patients using the SmartDelay feature. Furthermore, in the intervening seven years since the SMART AV trial results were first published , there have been changes in technology. Q uadripolar leads are available and in use today rather than the unipolar/bip olar leads previously available. P otential changes in implant technique (optimizing lead position for position rather than electrical performance) as well as potential changes in the practice of medicine when treating heart failure patients. Accordingly, a randomized controlled trial was chosen. This study design helps assure that two comparable patient populations are obtained while mitigating bias such that any observe d changes are due to the use of SmartDelay alone. The parameters for the study design were taken from the predicate SMART AV study. The SMART AV study was designed to detect a decrease in LVESV of at least 15 mL. The SMART CRT study is designed to detect a decrease in LVESV of at least 15%. The modification in the response definition for SMART CRT was made to represent a more appropriate clinical definition of CRT response. Increasing values of RV -LV were associated with an increased effect size. The cutoff value of 70 ms was chosen because it maximized the potential yield of screened patients while still preserving a clinically important effect size. New studies based on previous retrospective analyses may not precisely duplicate the magnitude of effect orig inally reported. Accordingly, this study was designed to detect at least 75% of the effect size to conserve a clinically meaningful proportion of the effect observed in SMART AV."

Assess p hrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) in any LV pacing vector with an RV- LV delay ≥ 70ms at an output of 7.5V using VectorGuide. PNS will be assessed as per standard of care, based on subject complaint (such as hiccups or twitching) and confirmed by palpation by a qualified HCP. The PNS threshold is defined as the first voltage step without PNS. a. Presence or absence of PNS and PNS threshold must be documented in the LV Vector Guide Report. 4. Assess the pacing capture threshold in each LV pacing vector with an RV- LV delay ≥ 70ms using VectorGuide . The pacing capture threshold for each LV pacing vector with an RV- LV delay ≥ 70ms must be documented on the VectorGuide Report. a.

Device Programming Outside of the Investigational Plan Once a subject is programmed to a randomized treatment arm, every effort must be made to keep the subject’s device programmed per the required programming in this protocol. Any device reprogramming of AV Delay change , including the reason for change, must be recorded as a protocol deviation and the clinical circumstances must be documented. After reprogramming to device settings outside of the required programming per protocol, subjects will remain in the assigned treatment arm until the end of the study to follow the methodology of intention- to-treat (ITT). Deviated programming does n’t qualify as reason for study withdrawal, and subjects will continue to be followed per the investigational plan. 11.9. Study Completion Subject participation in the study is considered complete for the following reasons: • Study completion per protocol o A Six Month F ollow -Up visit has been recorded at least 180 days from the date of the randomization OR o Subject does not have an RV-LV delay ≥ 70ms on any electrode (E1, E2, E3, E4) with a qualifying pacing vector at the Post-Implant A ssessment • Death ( see 19.7 for reporting requirements );"
34,page_34,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 35 of 67 • Withdrawal for reasons that include, but are not limited to: o Subject found not to meet eligibility criteria o Subject did not get randomized o Subject choice to withdraw consent o Device explanted and not replaced with a CRT -D system o VAD insertion or heart transplant o Investigator discretion o Lost to follow -up, despite best efforts to locate the subject; o Three documen ted attempts to contact the subject, including one certified letter, are required to declare a subject lost to follow up. 11.10. Source Documents Original source documents are required to be retained at the center. Where copies of the original source document as well as printouts of original electronic source documents are retained, these shall be signed and dated by a member of the investigational site team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document. NOTE: If thermal paper from the device programmer was used for source documentation, photocopies or printed pdfs should be prepared and kept for source documentation. 12. Statistical Considerations 12.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint will compare the CRT response rates of randomize d subject s. CRT response is defined by >15% decrease in LVESV from pre -implant baseline through 6 months. Hypotheses The following set of hypotheses will be used to evaluate the Primary Endpoint: H o: p (SmartDelay) ≤ p (Fixed) H1: p (SmartDelay) > p (Fixed) Where p represents the proportion of CRT responders. Response is defined as a >15% decrease LVESV ([LVESV 6M – LVESV BL]/ LVESV BL < - 15%). Sample Size An estimated 726 subjects will be enrolled in the study in order to achieve a target of at least 436 subjects to complete randomization. Enrollment will continue until at least 436 patients are randomized or the number of required randomized subjects as de termined by interim sample size re- assessment. A total of 370 complete datasets at 6 months are required to sufficiently power the endpoint."
35,page_35,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 36 of 67 Sample size was calculated using the following assumptions: • Patient cohort = all randomized subjects ( RV-LV ≥ 70 ms ) • Effect size = 14% difference (based on ability to detect at least 75% of the 19% difference observed in SMART AV) • Estimated CRT response rate in Fixed AV Delay group = 53% • Randomization allocation = 1:1 • Subject s contributing to analysis = 51% (60%*85%) of enrolled subjects o 60% of enrolled subjects with RV- LV ≥ 70 ms o 85% of randomized subject s with complete datasets at 6 months among subject s with RV- LV ≥ 70 ms • One-sided alpha = 2.5% The required sample size to sufficiently power the analysis evaluating a median cutoff is less than the sample size described above. Statistical Methods Randomized subjects with paired LVESV data – baseline and 6 months – will be included in the analysis. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomization group. To avoid making erroneous assumptions about incomplete/missing endpoint data, data from subjects with incomplete/missing data will not be imputed; therefore the statistical analysis of the Primary Endpoint will be a modified intention -to-treat analysis. A chi -square test employing a one-sided alpha of 2.5% will compare the proportion of responders in the SmartDelay randomized group to the Fixed AV Delay randomized group. If the p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be re jected. A pure intention -to-treat analysis, in which the incomplete/missing endpoint data is imputed and included in the analysis, may be performed as a sensitivity analysis. 12.2. General Statistical Methods Analysis Sets All subject s with paired data at base line and 6 months will be included the analysis of the outcome of interest (i.e., LVESV, subject global assessment, etc. ). Control of Systematic Error/Bias Subject s will be randomized to minimize subject selection bias. To eliminate the potential for a placebo effect to affect the Primary Endpoint results, the objective measure of LVESV was chosen. Every attempt will be made to blind subject s to their randomized treatment assignment in order to minimize a placebo effect on qualitative analyses, such as quality of life. To reduce the inter -observer variability that can occur with echocardiographic measurements, a core lab blinded to treatment assignment will be used."
36,page_36,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 37 of 67 Number of Subjects per Investigative Site A maximum of 72 enrolled subjects will be allowed from an investigational site , equal to 10% of the expected 726 subjects to be enrolled in the study. 12.3. Additional Data Analyses Other Endpoints/Measurements The following outcomes will be evaluated in addition to the Primary Endpoint analysi s, each comparing subjects according to their randomized groups: • LVESV as a continuous variable • Clinical Composite Endpoint o All-cause mortality o Heart failure events (as defined in Section 19.1 ) o NYHA Class o Quality of Life (Patient Global assessment instrument ) • Components of the Clinical Composite Endpoint • KCCQ • Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) Tertiary/Exploratory Analyses The following tertiary analyses will be performed and considered exploratory in nature: • Six minute walk, compared between randomized groups. • Optimal cutoff analysis. An RV -LV cutoff of 70 ms was used to identify which subjects will be randomized. Analyses will be performed to find the optimal cutoff – greater than or equal to 70 ms – as determined by the data. Primary Endpoint Sensitivity Analyses The Primary Endpoint, in addition to the additional analyses listed above, w ill be evaluated using modified intention -to-treat methodology, in which subject s with complete datasets are evaluated according to their randomized treatment groups. Sensitivity analyses include the following: • Pure intention- to-treat – Subject s are analy zed according to their randomized group and missing data is imputed via multiple imputation • On treatment – Subject s are analyzed according to the actual treatment received • Per protocol – Subjects are analyzed according to their randomized group, but limited to subject s that received the randomized assignment."
37,page_37,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 38 of 67 Interim Analyses When at least half of the required 6 month datasets (N = 185) have been completed and reviewed by the core lab, an interim sample size re- assessment will be performed. The pooled and blinded response rate across both groups will be assessed in this interim sample size re-assessment cohort. The observed rate will be weighted by the number of patients in each group and compared to the assumed weighted rate. If the observed rate is less than the assumed rate, the number of patients required for randomization will be increased accordingly, up to a maximum of 456 randomized subjects . The treatment effect will not be calculated, thereby maintaining the blind. There are no formal interim analyses planned to terminate the study for effectiveness of futility. Subgroup Analyses The subgroups that will be evaluated include, but are not limited to, the following: • Age < 65 years vs. ≥ 65 years • Females vs. Males • Ischemic vs. Non -ischemic etiolog y • LBBB vs Non -LBBB • QRS < 150 ms vs. ≥ 150 ms • Apical vs. Non- apical lead placement (for each RV lead and LV lead placement) • NYHA Class I/II vs. III/IV • SmartDelay recommended programming o LV only vs. biventricular (BiV) pacing o AV Delay (equal to 120±20 ms vs. all others) The interaction between the subgroup and randomized groups will be evaluated (e.g., gender by randomization group). Additionally, each subgroup will have the SmartDelay vs. Fixed comparison calculated separately (e.g., SmartDelay vs. Fixed evaluated in Females). Multivariable Analyses Multivariate analyses will be performed using characteristics listed in Section 12.3.5 Error! Reference source not found. . Additional covariates may also be considered. The primary approach to multivariate modeling will be as follows: • Univariate to Multivariate: Univariate modeling is first performed. Significant covariates are considered for inclusion in the final multivariate model. Non - significant covariates are dropped from consideration. A model selection technique (e.g., best subsets, stepwise regression) is then employed to determine the final multiv ariate model. Additionally, the following multivariate modeling approaches may be used: • Recursive Partitioning: The overall population is classified into mutually exclusive subgroups in the form of a decision tree. Each characteristic is dichotomized, though"
38,page_38,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 39 of 67 the cutpoint used for dichotomization is determined by the data during the analysis. To avoid potential problems with model overfitting, methods related to recursive partitioning – such as random forests or stochastic gradient boosting – may be emplo yed. • Risk Score: Characteristics considered to be associated with CRT Response – determined by analyses of SMART Registry data or by clinical/medical experts – will be combined and converted into a score that can be used to predict CRT Response. Changes to Planned Analyses Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the analyses will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan approved prior to performing the analyses. Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the change. 13. Data Management 13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system. The clinical database will reside on a production server hosted by EDC System . All changes made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review by the sponsor or its representative. The associated RAVE software and database have been designed to meet regulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical studies pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are performed regularly. The Investigator provides his/her electronic signature on the appropriate electronic case report forms (eCRFs) in compliance with local regulations. A written signature on printouts of the eCRFs must also be provided if required by local regulation. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a new electronic signature by the Investigator acknowledging and approving the changes. Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the EDC system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. Site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database. 13.2. Data Retention The Principal Investigator or his/her designee or Investigational site will maintain, at the investigative site, all essential study documents and source documentation that support the data collected on the study subjects in compliance with ICH/GCP guidelines. Documents must be ret ained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of the clinical investigation of"

These documents will be retained for a longer period of time by agreement with BSC or in compliance with other country/regional/ local regulations. The Principal Investigator or his/her designee will take measures to ensure that these essential documents are not accidentally damaged or destroyed. If for any reason the Principal Investigator or his/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody must be transferred to an individual who will assume responsibility and BSC must receive written notification of this custodial chang e. Sites are required to inform Boston Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case files are stored off site and are not readily available. 13.3. Core Laboratories All echocardiography measurements will be performed by an independent Echocardiography Core Laboratory. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory determined values will be used for the Primary Endpoint analysis as well as all echo related additional analyses. 14. Amendments If a protocol revision is necessary which affects the rights, safety or welfare of the subject or scientific integrity of the data, an amendment is required. Appropriate approvals (e.g., IRB/EC) of the revised protocol must be obtained prior to implementation. 15. Deviations An Investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol, except to protect the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigator shall notify the sponsor and when applicable the reviewing IRB/EC of any deviation from the investigational plan to protect the life or physical well- being of a subject in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Such notice shall be give n as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurred, or per prevailing local requirements, if sooner than 5 working days. All deviations from the investigational plan, with the reason for the deviation and the date of occu rrence, must be documented and reported to the sponsor using the deviation CRF in the EDC system. Sites may also be required to report deviations to the IRB/EC, per local guidelines and government regulations. Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate corrective and preventive actions (including IRB notification, site re-training, or site discontinuation/termination ) will be put into place by the sponsor."

Risks A ssociated with Participation in the Clinical Study In additi on to the risks common to all patients who receive CRT implantation, subject s participating in the SMART CRT study may be exposed to additional risks. Specifically, some subject s may be at risk for arrhythmias during the six -minute walk testing. However, the intensity of the exercise is at the discretion of the individual subject , and the test (without electrocardiogram monitoring) has been performed in thousands of subject s with HF or cardiomyopathy17,18,19 without serious adverse events. Moreover, risks can be minimized by addressing the following safety issues: performing the test in a location where a rapid, appropriate response to an emergency is possible with a crash cart in a near known location; a technician certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitatio n with a minimum of Basic Life Support 20; it is up to the physician ordering the test to decide whether physician attendance at a specific test is required as physicians are not required to be present at all tests. Some addi tional risks may apply to those subject s for which the SmartDelay test is run. Tachycardia therapy is disabled during SmartDelay optimization. The SmartDelay test also temporarily switches to a DDD mode of pacing with a lower rate limit of 40ppm and an AV Delay of 400ms. Any subject with symptomatic bradycardia may be affecte d. 18.4. Risk Minimization Actions Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject' s physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow -ups and by promptly supplying BSC with all pertinent information required by this protocol. 18.5. Anticipated Benefits There may be no additional benefit to the subject due to the study specific progr amming . However, medical science and future patients may benefit from their participation in this clinical study. If there is a superior or inferior arm, the subjects can be programmed at the conclusion of the study to the best programming suitable to thei r needs. 18.6. Risk to Benefit Rationale The implantable device systems and accessories used for this clinical study will be commercially available and are considered to be standard of care for patient s indicated for such implants. The risks involved with subje ct participation in this study are essentially the same as those for patients not participating in the study. 19. Safety Reporting 19.1. Reportable Events by investigational site to Boston Scientific It is the responsibility of the investigator to assess and report to BSC any event which occurs in any of following categories:"

For Event reporting the medical diagnosis must be reported. In case the diagnosis is not available, individual symptoms can be reported to fulfill reporting timelines. If a diagnosis becomes available at a later stage, it must be added to the reported event. If it is unclear whether or not an event fits one of the above categories, or if the event cannot be isolated from the device or procedure, it should be submitted as an adverse event and/or device deficiency. Any AE event required by the protocol , experienced by the study subject after informed consent and once considered enrolled in the study (as defined in study subject classification section), whether during or subsequent to the procedure, must be recorded in the eCRF. Underlying diseases are not reported as AEs unless there is an increase in severity of frequency during the course of the investigation. Death should not be reported as an SAE, but should be reported as an outcome of an SAE and only one SAE should have the outcome documented as fatal (see Table 19- 1 for AE definitions).

Informed Consent Subject participation in this clinical study is voluntary. Informed Consent is required from each subject or his/her legally authorized representative. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that Informed Consent is obtained prior to the use of any investigational devices, study- required procedures and/or testing, or data collection. The obtaining and documentation of Informed Consent must be in accor dance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO 14155, any applicable national regulations, and local Ethics Committee and/or Regulatory authority body, as applicable. The ICF must be accepted by BSC or it s delegate (e.g. CRO), and approved by the site’s IRB/EC, or central IRB, if applicable. Boston Scientific will provide a study- specific template of the ICF to investigators participating in this study. The ICF template may be modified to meet the requirem ents of the investigative site’s IRB/EC. Any modification requires acceptance from BSC prior to use of the form. The ICF must be in a language understandable to the subject and if needed, BSC will assist the site in obtaining a written consent translation. Translated consent forms must also have IRB/EC approval prior to their use. Privacy language shall be included in the body of the form or as a separate form as applicable. The process of obtaining Informed Consent shall at a minimum include the follo wing steps, as well as any other steps required by applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines : • be conducted by the Principal Investigator or designee authorized to conduct the process, • include a description of all aspects of the clinical study tha t are relevant to the subject’s decision to participate throughout the clinical study, • avoid any coercion of or undue influence of subjects to participate, • not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights, • use native language that is non- technical and u nderstandable to the subject or his/her legal representative, • provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions if necessary, • ensure important new information is provided to new and existing subjects throughout the clinical stu dy. The ICF shall always be signed and personally dated by the subject or legal representative competent to sign the ICF under the applicable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines and by the investigator and/ or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent process. If a legal representative signs, the subject shall be asked to provide informed consent for continued participation as soon as his/her medical condition allows. The original signed ICF will be retained by the site and a copy of the signed and dated document and any other written information must be given to the person signing the form. Failure to obtain subject consent will be reported by BSC to the applicable regulatory body according to their requirements (e.g., FDA requirement is within 5 working days of learning"

Any violations of the informed consent process must be reported as deviations to the sponsor and local regulatory authorities (e.g. IRB/EC), as appropriate. If new information becomes avai lable that can significantly affect a subject's future health and medical care, that information shall be provided to the affected subject(s) in written form via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested to sign and date an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a study, other situations may necessitate revision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to the applicable laws, protocol, a change in Principal Investigator, adminis trative changes, or following annual review by the IRB/EC. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IRB/EC. Acceptance by Boston Scientific is required if changes to the revised ICF are requested by the site’s IRB/EC. The IRB/EC will determine th e subject population to be re - consented. 21. Committees 21.1. Safety Monitoring Process To promote early detection of safety issues, the BSC Medical Safety group will provide evaluations of safety events. A CEC will provide evaluations of all HF events and deaths in which HF could not be eliminated as the cause . Success of this program requires dynamic collection of unmonitored data as soon as the event is reported. During regularly scheduled monitoring activities , clinical research monitors will suppor t the dynamic reporting process through their review of source document and other data information. The BSC Medical Safety group includes physicians with expertise in the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to evaluate and classify the event s into the categories outlined above. 21.2. Steering Committee The Steering Committee is independent of Boston Scientific RM and provides oversight for the overall conduct of the study with regard to protocol development, study progress, subject safety, and overall data quality and integrity. 21.3. Clinical Events Committee A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) is an independent group of individuals with pert inent expertise that reviews and adjudicates predefined events as reported by study investigators. For this study, c ommittee members will include a minimum of three practitioners with training in Electrophysiology (EP) and/ or Cardiology with the necessary therapeutic and subject matter expertise to adjudicate HF events and subject deaths. CEC responsibilities, qualifications, membership, and committee procedures are outlined in the CEC charter."

Appendices 27.1. Echocardiography Protocol The following parameters must be measured as part of the echocardiography exam at the pre - implant and 6 month visits: • LVESV / LVEDV (by Simpson’s Method of Discs) • LVEF • Valve function: tricuspid, mitral & aortic regurgitation • LA volume The measurements should be taken at the Six Month Follow -Up visit with pacing therapy active. Digitally store data in a DICOM format then copy to a CD -R. Maintain a copy of the study CD-R at the site and either send or upload a copy to the Echocardiography Core Lab within 10 days of completion. Each site will be responsible for identifying experienced sonographers (echocardiographic technicians) who will perform study echocardiograms, which will be a limited version of the standard echocardiographic examination. Sites will be supplied with training materials that will describe in detail the methodology for obtaining study echocardiograms. Training sessions will be conducted and documented for all participating sites. A subset of a standard echocardiographic examination will be performed. All subjects will undergo 2- D echocardiography with the following views: Parasternal Long Axis View (PLAX): o 2D imaging of Left Ventricle to determine septal and posterior wall thickness and LV diameters at end diastole and end systole. Make measurements in the mid -LV adjacent to postero -lateral papillary muscle. LV outflow diameter is measured in the frame following aortic valve opening. o Color Doppler imaging performed for presence of mitral regurgitation. Color Doppler imaging should be performed with a nyquist limit (scale) .5 -.6m/sec. Demonstrate MR jet at the coaptation of the mitral leaflets for measurement of jet wid th. Parasternal Short Axis View (PSAX)/right ventricular outflow view: o Pulsed Wave Doppler of the right ventricular outflow tract velocities should be obtained just proximal to the pulmonary valve leaflets to measure pre -ejection period"

Six-Minute Walk Test The six -minute walk test is a self -paced sub -maximal exercise test that has proven useful as an outcome measure for patients with congestive HF. Previous studies18,19 have shown that"
64,page_64,"C2067 Form/Template 90702637 Rev/Ver AH Confidential S MART CRT Study Protocol, 92055794, Rev/Ver D Page 65 of 67 this test is well tolerated by individuals and is more closely related to the patient’s daily activities than maximal exercise testing. The walking test should be conducted in an enclosed corridor on a course approximately 100 feet (30.5 meters) long. The length should be marked in either feet or meters to allow easy measurement of the distance walked. The corridor should not be heavily trans ited and should be free of obstacles and distractions. Chairs should be placed at either end of the course so that subject s may rest when needed. If for any reason an individual physician does not recommend a subject to perform the six -minute walk then rec ord the reason on the case report form. Instructions The subject is to take nothing by mouth except for clear liquids for at least two hours prior to the test. Prescribed medications should be taken as usual. Subject s should be advised not to smoke for at least two hours prior to exercise and to wear suitable footwear. Subject s are instructed to walk the marked course from end to end at their own pace, covering as much distance as possible in six -minute s. Subject s may slow down or stop to rest if necessary, but should be instructed to resume walking when they feel they are able to do so. The aim is that at the end of the test, the subject believes that they could not have walked any further in the six-minute s. The following instructions are to be read to the subject verbatim: “The purpose of this test is to determine how far you can walk in six -minute s. You will start here and go to the end of the hall, turn around, and walk back. After arriving back at the starting point, you will go back and forth again. Go back and forth as many times as you can in the six -minute period. If necessary, stop and rest and stay here until you can start again. However, the most important thing about the test is that you cover as much distance as possible during the six -minute period.” “I will let you know when each minute has passed. When I say ‘STOP’ after six-minute s, please stand right where you are.’ “Do you have any questions about the test?” “Please explain to me what you are going to do.” “Are you r eady?” “Start when I say ‘GO’.” Protocol The walk test should be performed after completing the physical assessment of the subject . Subject safety is the highest priority, and the walk test should not be initiated if the physician, coordinator or subjec t has concerns regarding the subject ’s ability to perform the test. If the"

Stand the subject at the beginning of the course. 2. Simultaneously say ‘GO” and start the watch. Observe the subject for the six-minute period while recording the successful completion of each length of the course. In order to standardize the test, encouragement is not of fered during the walk. Do not otherwise speak to the subject except to answer questions he or she poses. Stop the test if the subject reports severe shortness of breath, muscular pain, dizziness, or angina symptoms. 3. At the end of the six -minute interval , tell the subject to “STOP”. 4. Record the distance traveled to the nearest foot or meter. If the subject ceases participation prior to the end of the six -minute interval, record the distance covered (to the nearest foot or meter) and the subject ’s heart rate at the time he or she stops walking. 27.3. Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) The KCCQ is a disease- specific instrument for monitoring the health status and quality of life of subjects with congestive heart failure. It includes a total of 23 items that assess quality of life in the following domains: physical function, symptom frequency and severity, symptom stability, self -efficacy and knowledge, social function, and overall quality of life. These domains can be combined into a functional st atus summary score (derived from the physical function and symptom scales) and an overall summary score which combines the physical function, symptom, social function and quality of life domains. The KCCQ has been validated in subjects with CHF using a va riety of standard techniques (1), is highly reproducible among stable subjects. In cross -sectional analyses, the KCCQ has been shown to be highly correlated with event -free survival. Finally, the responsiveness of the KCCQ as assessed by the “responsiveness statistic” (ratio of mean change among subjects with improved CHF to the standard deviation among stable subjects) is superior to other measures including the SF -36, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire, and NYHA classification (Spertus JA, personal communication).
