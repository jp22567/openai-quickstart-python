5,page_5,"Ixazomib Study No. C16029 Page 5of 139 Protocol Incorporating Amendment 06 31August 2020 1.3 Protocol Amendment 06 Summary of Changes Rationale for Amendment 06 This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 06. The primary reason for thi s amendment is to modify the study assessments, now that the data cutoff date for the study analysis (the only planned formal analysis) has been reached (31 May 2020). Only patients who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study drugs will cont inue o n the study. Because no further formal statist ical analyses will be performed, only assessments contribut ing to long -term safet y data are required. Most study assessments besides safet y are discont inued to ease the burden of protocol -mandated assessments o n patients. Patients continuing their current study treatm ent may do so until such time as other m eans of accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should co mplete an End of Treatment (EOT) visit and transit ion onto an alternative sup ply of (eg, commercially available) ixazo mib or pomalido mide, as well as dexamethasone, or onto another standard of care treatment. Discontinued pati ents will be treated by their physici an per l ocal standard of care. Upon implementation of Amendment 06, da ta collection requirements will be limited to collectio n of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). All other study assessments are no longer required. All central laboratory assessments are discontinued. Qualit y of life and healt hcare utilization (HU) assessments and co llection of concomitant medicat ions and procedures are discontinued. Patients will not be fo llowed for the progression -free survival (PFS)or overall survival (OS) fo llow-up peri ods, because PFS and OS data are no longer bei ng co llected. See the updated Schedule of Events in Appendix Afor more detailed informat ion (the previous, full Schedule of Events is now moved to Appendix Lfor reference only). Descript ions of how to manage study procedures during unavo idable circumstances, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19) pandemic, have addit ionally been added. Minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not affect ing the conduct of the study are included for clarificat ion and administrative purposes only. For specific descript ions of text changes and locat ion of the changes, see Appendix M. Changes in Amendment 06 1.To note that the data cutoff date for the study analysis, which is the only planned form al analysis for this study , has now occurred. 2.To note that, now that the data cutof f date for the study analysis has occurred, all central efficacy and invest igator assessments of response for protocol purposes are now discontinued. 3.To note that, now that the data cutoff date for the study analysis has occurred, the object ive and endpo int of the study has changed to sol ely continue to collect long-term safet y data.

The 3 stratification factors are International Staging System stage (I or II vs III at study entry), prior lines of therapy (2 vs 3 or more), and age (<65 vs ≥65 years). Patients will be randomized i n a 3:2 ratio to receive ixazomib+dexamethasone (ixa+dex; Arm A) or pomalidomide+dexamethasone (pom+dex; Arm B), until first confirmed progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicities. Primary Objective: As of Amendment 06, the objective is to continue to collect long -term safety data from patients who are continuing on ixazomib and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all other study objectives and endpoints is complete and no furth er formal analyses will be conducted. However, the original primary objective is retained below for reference only. To compare the effect of ixa+dex versus pom+dex on progression -free survival (PFS) in patients with relapsed and/or refracto ry multiple myel oma (RRMM) who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy, including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor, and are refractory to lenalidomide but not refractory to proteasome inhibitors. Secondary Objectives: As of Amendment 06, the objective is to continue to collect long -term safety data from patients who are continuing on ixazomib and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all other study objectives and endpoints is complete a nd no further formal analyses will be conducted. However, the original secondary objectives are retained below for reference only. To compare overall survival (OS) in patients treated with ixa+dex versus pom+dex. To compare duration of response, overall re sponse rate (ORR), time to response, and time to progression with ixa+dex versus pom+dex. To obtain health -related quality of life (QOL) data related to physical functioning of patients treated with ixa+dex versus pom+dex. To assess health -related QOL by a dditional function and symptom domains of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire –Cor e 30 (EORTC QLQ - C30) instrument and by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire –multiple myeloma module (EORTC QLQ -MY20) and 5-level classification system of the EuroQol 5-Dimensional Health Questionnaire (EQ -5D-5L) instruments. To evaluate health care utilization (HU) by patients receiving ixa+dex versus those receiving pom+dex. To collect plasma concentration -time data for ixazomib to contribute to population pharmacokinetic characterization of ixazomib and to conduct exposure -response analyses for patients receiving ixa+dex. Safety: To compare safety/tolerability of ixa+dex to that of pom+dex.

Patients who have had any dose reductions, holds , or delay s because of ixazomib toxicities will not dose escalate. Dose escalation beyond the start of Cycle 2 is permit ted o nly when dose escalation was inadvertently missed at Cycle 2. Ixazomib will be administered orally on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28 -day cycle, combined with dexamethasone 20 mg (or 10 mg if patient is aged ≥75years) orally on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of each 28 -day cycle until PD .In cases where only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available (eg, 4 mg dexamethasone is the only dosage available), the following dexamethasone schedule is recommended for patients aged ≥75 years: 12 mg dexame thasone will be given on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every 28 -day cycle; and 8 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 2, 9, 16, and 23 of ever y 28-day cycle.

Duration of Treatment: Patients will receive study thera py until PD, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or sponsor termination of study.Period of Evaluation: Up to 28 months Main Criteria for Inclusion: Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM) according to standard criteria. All patients must have had a relapse or PD after having received 2 or more prior lines of systemic therapy. (A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycle sof a planned treatment program; this may consist of 1 or more planned cycles of single -agent therapy or combination therapy, as well as a sequen ceof treatments administered in a planned manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by autologous stem -cell transplantation, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy . Typically each line of therapy is separated by PD. Discussion with the medical monitor may help clarify the number of prior lines of therapy for a prospective study participant.) All patients must be refractory to lenalidomi de, defined as having received at least 2 consecutive cycles of lenalidomide as a single agent or within a lenalidomide -containing regimen and having had PD during treatment with or within 60 days after the last dose of lenalidomide. The starting dose of l enalidomide should have been 25 mg (or as low as 10 mg in the case of renal function impairment or other safety concern), and the final dose should have been a minimum of 10 mg. All patients must have received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a bortezomib -or carfilzomib -containing regimen, and either: –Achieved at least a partial response (PR) and did not have PD during treatment with or within 60 days after the last dose of bortezomib or carfilzomib, OR –Had bortezomib and/or carfilzomib intolerance (defi ned as discontinuation because of drug -related adverse Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use"

Main Criterion for Exclusion: Patients must not have received prior ixazomib or pomalidomide and must not have participated in a previous ixazomib clinical study. Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses: The primary endpoint for this study is PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of confirmed PD, as evaluated by investigators on the basis of central laboratory results according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. The secondary endpoints are OS; ORR (defined as complet e response, ver y good partial response (VGPR), or PR [per IMWG criteria]); duration of response; time to response; time to progression (TTP); health -related QOL as measured by the physical functioning domain of the EORTC QLQ -C30; health -related QOL as meas ured by other domains of the EORTC QLQ -C30, by the EORTC QLQ -MY20, and by the EQ-5D-5L; health care utilization as measured by the number and duration of medical encounters; and safety/tolerability. After the data cutoff date for the study analysis (inclu ding for PFS) has occurred, all central efficacy and investigator assessments of response for protocol purposes will be discontinued. As of Amendment 06, the data cutoff date for the study analysis (31 May 2020) has been reached. Only patients who continue to demonstrate clinical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study drugs will continue on the study . As no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only assessments contributing to long -term safety data are required. Most study assessments besides safety are discontinued to ease the burden of protocol -mandated assessments on patients. Patients continuing their current study treatment may do so until such time as other means of accessing the study drugs are arranged. When possible, patients should complete an End of Treatment visit and transition onto an alternative supply of (eg, commercially available) ixazomib or pomalidomide, as well as dexamethasone, or onto another standard of care treatment. Discontinued patients will be treated by their physician per local standard of care. Upon implementation of Amendment 06, data collection requirements will be limited to collection of AEs and serious AEs. All other study assessments are no longer required. All central laboratory as sessments are discontinued. Quality of life and health care utilization assessments and collection of concomitant medications and procedures are discontinued. Patients will not be followed for the PFS or OS follow -up periods, as PFS and OS data are no long er being collected. Statistical Considerations: There will be 1 study analysis for PFS and secondary endpoints. Sample Size Justification: Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled in total. The primary endpoint is PFS. Approximately 81 PFS events would be needed to provide 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.20 level of significance with an HR of 0.62.

Inhibi tion of the 20S proteasome has been validated as a therapeuti c target for the treatment of malignancies using VELCADE (bortezomib) for Injection, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc’s first -in-class proteasom e inhibitor [2]. Ixazo mib (MLN2238) refers to the bio logically active boronic acid form of t he drug substance. The drug substance is administered as a stable citrate ester, designated as ixazo mib citrate (MLN9708). Under physio logical condi tions, ixazomib citrate rapidly hydrolyzes to the biologically active boroni c acid, i xazo mib. Ixazo mib is a peptide boronic acid that is structurally different fro m bortezomib. Detailed informat ion regarding the nonclinical pharmaco logy and toxicology of ixazo mib can be found in the ixazo mib Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 4.1.1.1 Approval of Ixazomib+ Lenalidomide and Dex amethasone for Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Ixazo mib in co mbinat ion with lenalido mide and dexamethasone (LenDex) was approved (under the brand name NINLARO) by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015 for th e treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy [3,4] , with approvals subsequent ly in Canada, Israel, Australia, the European Unio n (EU), and Singapore and in Switzerland forpatients who have received at least 1 prior therapy and have high-risk characterist ics or have received at least 2 prior therapies . Addi tionally, NINLARO is approved as a Medical Service Product in Venezuela. The pivotal phase 3 Study C16010 was the basis for the approval, invo lving 722 patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myelo ma (RRMM) [ 4]. The primary endpo int of PFS was met in the intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion at the primary analysis, with a significant PFS benefit for patients receiving ixazo mib+LenDex versus placebo+LenDex (hazard ratio [HR]=0.742, p=0.012; median PFS 20.6 vs 14.7 months). The PFS benefit in the ixazomib regimen was supported by improvements versus the placebo regimen in other efficacy data. At a median fo llow-up of approximately 23 m onths, the median OS had not been reached in either regimen. The rates of SAEs were similar in the 2 regimens (47% with ixazomib, 49% with placebo), as were the rates of death during the study period (4% and 6%, respectively); Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 74% an d 69% of the pati ents, respectively . Overall , the addi tion of ixazo mib to LenDex did not add substant ial toxicity. The PFS benefit and safety profile seen in global Study C16010 have been substant iated in the China Cont inuat ion study , a second doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled study of similar design and the same inclusio n criteria, with 115 patients with RRMM, all enrolled in China [5]. In addition, an OS benefit in favor of the ixazo mib+LenDex group was observed at the final analysis [ 6].

Regardless of the route of administr ation, in the twice-week ly dosing schedule, ixazomib is given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day cycle, and in the weekly dosing schedule, ixazomib is given on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Phase 1, phase 1/2, and phase 2 studies are ongoing in MM, relapsed and/or refractory systemic light-chain amyloidosis (RRAL), solid tumors, a nd lymphoma. In addition, phase 1 studies have been completed in patients with renal impair ment who have RRMM or advanced solid tumors (Study C16015); patients with hepatic impair ment who have advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies (Study C16018); and in an absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion study in patients with advanced solid tumors or lym phoma (Study C16016). Phase 3 studies in RRMM, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), and RRAL are under way. As of 27 March 2016, for SAE and fatality incidences, a total of 3346 patients have been exposed to ixazomib. Specifically, data are available from 929 patients known to have received at least 1 dose of either the IV or oral ixazomib formulations across the clinical development program; in addition, 2417 patients have been enrolled in the following phase 3 clinical trials: !Double-blind, placebo-controlled Study C16010 and Study C16010 China Continuation study of ixazomib versus placebo in combination with LenDex in patients with RRMM (described in Section 4.1.1.1) . !Double-blind, placebo-controlled Study C16014 a nd Study C16014 extension in South Korea of ixazomib versus placebo in combination with LenDex in patients with NDMM. !Double-b lind, placebo-contro lled Study C16019 of ixazomib versus placebo as maintenance in patients with NDMM who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) before entering the study. !Double-bli nd, placebo-controlled St udy C16021 of ixazomib versus placebo as maintenance in patients with NDMM who have not undergone ASCT. !Open-label Study C16011 of ixazomib and dexamethasone (ixa+dex) versus physician’s choice of a de xamethasone-containing regimen in patients with RRAL. 4.1.1.3 Investigator-Initiated Study Relevant to This Protocol Results of the investigator-initiated study of ixa+dex in patients with RRMM (MC1181, NCT01415882; principal investigator, ) are of particular importance for Study C16029, the focus of this protocol [7,8] . In that study, patients with relapsed MM were treated with ixazomib 4.0 or 5.5 mg weekly for 3 of 4 weeks and with dexamethasone 40 mg weekly.

It is the second most common hematol ogical malignancy , consti tuting approximately 1% of all reported neoplasms and approximately 13% of hemat ologic cancers worldwide [9].The incidence of MM is expected to increase over the next decade , which highlights the need for more effect ive MM therapies [ 10]. Moreover, to a greater extent in the future than now, MM will be a disease that primarily affects older persons (those a ged 64 to 84 years) [11], who generally have a worse prognosis than younger persons. 4.2.1 Current Medical Treatments for MM Although MM is considered a fatal disease, duration of survival has improved dramat ically over the last 2 decades because of advances in understanding the disease bio logy as well as improvements in treatment and supportive care strategies. Between 1990 and 2007, the cancer death rate for people wit h MM in the United States decreased by approximately 9% f or men and 13% for women, owing to the introduction of stem cell transplantation and the novel agents bortezomib, thalido mide, and lenalido mide [ 12]. Correspondingly, 5 -year survival improved fro m 25% in 197 5 to 39% i n 2006 [ 13]. Similar improvements in survival rates among European patients wi th MM have been shown, particularly amo ng younger pati ents [ 14,15] . Moreover, newer agents continue to be introduced, including carfilzo mib, pomalido mide, elotuzumab, and daratum umab. These newer agents have been shown to improve survival amo ng ol der pati ents, with the 6 -year OS among patients older than 65 years increasing fro m 31% am ong those diagnosed in 2001 - 2005 to 56% among those diagnosed in 2006 -2010 (p<0.001) [16].Nonetheless, responses to currently available therapies are temporary , and m ost pati ents receive mult iple therapi es and co mbinat ion therapies over the course of their disease. First-line treatment options are determined by a patient’s eligibilit y, or lack thereof, for ASCT [ 17,18] .Regardless of whether the patient is transplant eligible, MM is sensit ive to a number of cytotoxi c drugs, including proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzo mib, alkylat ing agents, immuno modulatory drugs (IMi Ds) (eg, thalido mide and lenalido mide), corti costeroi ds, and mo noclonal ant ibodies (eg, elotuzumab and daratumumab) [ 19-24 ]. However, even wit h suc h advances and risk -adapted approaches, nearly all pati ents eventually relapse or become refractory and require subsequent treatment [25,26] ; thus, new treatment options are urgent ly needed . In particular, new therapies with less toxicit y are needed for elderly pat ients to continue to improve the prognosi s of this populat ion that comprises most MM patients [ 16]. 4.2.2 Unmet Medical Need Addressed by This Clinical Study MM rem ains an incurable disease for most patients and development of RRMM is an inevitable realit yfor alm ost all patients. While there is no widely accepted standard of care for RRMM, patients ty pically receive several lines of therapy with combinat ions of drugs over the course of their disease. Further, MM is heterogeneous, and no single treatment re gimen will be effect ive for all patients [ 27]. Consequent ly, treatment decisio ns are carefully based on patient and disease Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use"
23,page_23,"Ixazomib Study No. C16029 Page 23of 139 Protocol Incorporating Amendment 06 31August 2020 characterist ics. Hi storically , with each subsequent recurrence of MM, patients have a lower probabilit y of responding to therapy [28-33] . Therefore, there is a need for regimens that are effect ive in later therapies. In addit ion, patients who require treatment after receiving 2 prior lines of therapy may experience l ong-term side effects as a consequence of being exposed to mult iple cytotoxi c drugs wi th varying toxicit y profiles (eg, neuropathy , dec reased bone marrow reserve). Many patients in their third or later line of therapy are not abl e to tol erate the toxi city of a 3-drug regimen and would benefit fro m a less toxic doublet (see Section 4.3.3 ). (A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment program; this may consist of 1 or more planned cycles of single -agent therapy or combinat ion therapy , as well as a sequence of treatm ents administered in a planned manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induct ion therapy followed by ASCT, fo llowed by maintenance is considered 1 line o f therapy [1].Typically, each line of therapy is separated by progressive disease [PD]. Discussion wit h the medical mo nitor may help clarify the number of pri or lines of therapy for each prospective study parti cipant. ) As the incidence of MM in older patients increases, so does the need for therapy that is effect ive but also tolerable and that maintains qualit y of life (QOL) [ 34]. At fir st relapse, the goal of therap y is often similar to that for newly diagnosed patients, with a focus on a more aggressive treatment and a higher acceptance for toxicit y, but at l ater stages and wit h older age, therapeuti c goals m ay change significant ly, toward an increased emphasis on QOL, safet y, tolerabilit y, and c onvenience, in addit ion to efficacy. Pat ients typically value spending time away fro m the hospital and clinic as their disease advances. Therefore, these patients may prefer an ent irely oral treatm ent regimen. In addition, many elderly pat ients may also be unable to tolerate more -toxic 3-drug combinat ions and thus woul d benefit fro m an efficacious but less toxic doublet. Real-world clinical pract ice data illustrate a significant correlation between duration o f therapy and probabilit y of survival. Recently, this was docum ented wi th real-world electroni c medical record data from a US -based study showing that each addit ional mo nth of treatm ent in second -line RRMM was associated with a reduced risk o f death at 1 year after init iation of second -line therap y (HR=0 .67; 95% CI] 0.59, 0.77) [ 35]. Further, currently available therapies have been associated with dose -limit ing toxicit ies and added treatm ent burdens to patients and their care givers. For example, proteasome inhibitors approved in the relapsed setting require frequent hospital visits for IV (bortezomib and carfilzo mib) or subcutaneous (bortezomib) administration [ 2,36] . Similarly, ne wly approved m onocl onal antibodies such as daratumumab require frequent, prolonged IV infusio ns [ 37]. IV infusio ns of anticancer agents, or any parenteral agents, require admi nistrati on in a hospital or clinic setting and add m ore than drug costs to the healt h econo mic burden, including, but not limited to, the cost of the use of the facilit y and i ts staff plus the cost of transportation to the facilit y in addit ion to the overa ll costs associated with therapy. Moreover, AEs that are associated with current ly available agents impact a patient’s QOL and can lead to dose reductions and/or early treatment discontinuat ion, which in turn result in suboptimal treatment as well as poten tial loss of t ime able to perform work . Such AEs include peripheral neuropathy and hypotension (bortezomib), second primary malignancies (l enalido mide), neutropenia, allergic react ions, infusio n-related reactions (daratum umab), vascular events (carfilzo mib), thrombot ic events (lenalido mide and Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use"

Finally, concern regarding the risk of teratogenicit y of the IMiDs (including pomalido mide) has led to creation of the Pregnancy Prevent ion Programme in the European Union and the Risk Evaluat ion and Mit igation Strategies (REMS) programs in the United States. These programs increase the burdens placed on patients, heal th care providers, and health care clinics. Consideration o f the toxicit y and the treatm ent b urden to patients is important in this populat ion because pat ients with relapsed MM are often sicker and carry with them som e of the residual effects of their init ial therapy [43]. Minimizing potent ial long-term adverse effects while maintaining efficacy is an important goal in the treatment of RRMM [43,44] . However, currently available therapies do not provide sustained improvements in disease control. For example, the median PFS for pomalidomide+dexamethasone (pom +dex) in patients in their third or later line of therapy in the registrati on-enabling MM -003 study (NIMBUS) [ 45]was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.4-4.6 months) versus 1.9 months (95% CI 1.9 -2.1 months) with high -dose dexamethasone. Although the 3.8 months was a clinically meaningful and statist ically significant improvement over the 1.9 months, it was not a prolonged response. In that same study , pom +dex provi ded a 4.1-mont h improvement in OS. In addit ion, a study o f single -agent daratumumab used to treat a similar populat ion—US and EU patients with RRMM —showed a m edian PFS of 3.7 months and an ORR o f 29.2% [ 46]. These survival and response findings support the observation that advanced MM cont inues to be an ar ea of high unmet need, including a need for treatment approaches that prolong disease control while minimizing burden to patients (safet y, oral convenience) and to the healt h care system. The convenience of the all -oral ixazo mib regimen benefits act ive wo rking pat ients in addit ion to those elderly or frail patients who would prefer to avo id traveling for frequent long hospital visits. Furtherm ore, the nursing t ime involved wit h administration of IV regimens as co mpared with the all-oral ixazo mib regimen is an important consideration, while the safet y profile speaks to patients’ abilit y to have a l ong-term regimen wit h maintenance o f disease control . 4.2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 4.2.3.1 Benefits Ixazo mib in co mbinat ion with LenDex has been approved by the US FDA and othe r agencies for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy [3,4]. The explorat ion of ixazomib for other therapeutic areas is ongoing. To date, activit y in MM has been seen with single -agent ixazo mib and wit h ixazo mib co mbined with established therapies. In addition, single -agent activit y has been observed in relapsed amylo idosis and indo lent non -Hodgkin lympho ma. The pivotal phase 3 Study C16010 was the basis for the ap proval , involving 722 patients with RRMM [4].

At a median fo llow-up of approximately 23 months, the median OS had not been reached in either regimen; nevertheless, the 2-year OS rate was 77.5%, which is one of the largest achieved to date in phase 3 studies o f RRMM. The PFS benefit seen in glo bal Study C16010 hasbeen substant iated in the China Continuation study , a second doubl e-blind, pl acebo -controlled study of similar desi gn and the same inclusio n criteria, wi th 115 patients with RRMM, all enro lled in Chi na[5]. In thi s study , the primary endpo int of PFS was significant ly improved in the ixazo mib regimen as co mpared with the placebo regimen, wi th HR=0.598 and p=0.035 (with a median fo llow -up of approximately 8months, the m edian PFS was 6.7 vs 4.0 months, respectively ). The PFS benefit in the ixazomib regimen was supported by improvements with the ixazo mib regimen versus the placebo regimen in ORR (56% vs 31%) and TTP (median 7.3 vs 4.1 months). The reasons for the shorter median PFS in the China Cont inuat ion populat ion than in the Study C16010 ITT populat ion are likely the fact that Chinese patients are diagnosed with MM when their disease is m ore advanced as compared with the global popul ation[47,48] and t hat the China Cont inuat ion pat ients were more frequently refractory to thalido mide (54% vs 12%, respectively ), which can cause reduced efficac y of subsequent lenalidomide -containing regimens [ 49].At the final analysis, an OS benefit in favor of the ixazo mib+LenDex co mbination was observed [ 6].In summary, the data fro m the China Continuat ion study support Study C16010 data, showing a positive treatment effect with the ixazo mib regimen. The St udy C16010 and China Cont inuat ion findings are supportive of the current study . In both studi es, the addi tion of ixazo mib to LenDex was associated with a survival benefit ; notably, all patients had RRMM that could have been pretreated with, but not refract ory to, IMi Ds and proteasome inhibitors. In Study C16010 [ 4],theIMiD -pretreated populat ionhad a similar PFS benefit with ixazo mib as did the IMiD -naïve population (HRs, 0.74 and 0.70), and the proteasome inhibitor -pretreated populat ion hada similar PFS benefit as did the proteasome inhibitor -naive popul ation (HRs, 0.74 and 0.75). Thus, there is randomized evidence of an ixazo mib treatment effect in pat ients with at least 2 pri or lines of therapy , including pri or IMi D treatm ent and pri or proteasome inhibitor treatm ent, similar to the patients who will be enro lled in t he current study. On the basis of these findings, as well as support for doublet (rather than triplet) therapy (eg, [50], and the approval o f pom+dex for RRMM), thi s study is being conduc ted to test the hy pothesis that ixazo mib in combinat ion with a corti costeroi d may be an effect ive treatment of RRMM. Overall, i xazo mib show ssigns of antitumor acti vity, as evi denced by at l east 50% reduction in disease burden in so me pat ients, including patients that have been heavily pretreated as well as those wi th newly diagnosed MM, and prolongs stabilizat ion of the underlying disease in other patients across all ongoing studies. Though addit ional data con tinue to be obtained to further establish the c linical benefit of this drug, the emerging data support the continued development of ixazo mib for the treatm ent of pati ents wi th hematol ogic and solid tum or malignancies as well as ixazo mib as part of doublet therapy for RRMM.

The initial group of this study investigated single-agent oral ixazomib administered at 5.5 mg weekly for 3 weeks of a 28-day cycle with dexamethasone added if a patient had a suboptimal response (minimal response by end of Cycle 2 or lack of partial response [PR] at end of Cycle 4) or PD. Results observed in this initial experience with 5.5 mg ixazomib led to study modification, with the addition of a randomized portion, consisting of 2 treatment groups comparing oral ixazomib doses of 4 and 5.5 mg, each in combination with dexamethasone. These 2 groups inform the comparative safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ixazomib (4 or 5.5 mg) administered weekly for 3 weeks of a 28-day cycle plus oral dexamethasone (20 mg) administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of the 28-day cycle in adults with measurable MM who have received ≥1 prior lines of therapy and who are not refractory to proteasome inhibitor therapy. Patients received a median of 7 cycles of therapy (range, 1-31 cycles) across the study; 53 (76%) and 34 (49%) patients received at least 4 and 8 cycles, respectively, and 21 (30%) patients continued in the study for >12 cycles. The median number of treatment cycles was similar for the 2 groups: 8 (range, 1-28) and 7 (range, 1-31) for the 4 mg and 5.5 mg dose groups, respectively. The total number of cycles delivered was similar between the 2 groups, with 347 cycles administered to the 4 mg dose group and 341 for the 5.5 mg dose group. Dose modifications for ixazomib were required in a higher proportion of pa tients in the 5.5 mg dose group compared with the 4 mg dose group (43% vs 17%), while dose modifications for dexamethasone occurred in 34% and 23%, respectively. Thus, more than half the patients starting treatment at 5.5 mg ixazomib continued treatmen t without dose modification. Treatment delays were equivalent between the 2 ixazomib dose levels, with 26% and 29% of patients requiring dose delays in the 4 mg and 5.5 mg ixazomib groups, resp ectively. In terms of delivered dose, 95% of the intended dose of ixazomib was delivered in the 4 mg group compared with 85% of the intended dose in the 5.5 mg group. An AE of any grade that was considered at least possibly related was reported in 100% of the patients in both groups. There were no treatment-related deaths in either group; 2 patients died on study in the 4 mg ixazomib group (respiratory syncytial virus and multiorgan failure approximately 10 months after first dose; pancreatic cancer approximately 2 years after first dose; all were assessed as unrelated to study medication). Grade 3 or 4 AEs considered at least possibly related to study treatm ent were reported for 9 (26%) and 2 (6%) patients in the lower-dose group and in 19 (54%) and 2 (6%) patients in the higher-dose group, respectively. Both of the Grade 4 events reported in the 5.5 mg ixazomib group were considered related to study treatment. The most common Grade ≥2 AEs included fatigue, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea. Peripheral neuropathy that was considered at least possibly related to study treatment was seen in 33 patients (Grade 1), 8 patients (Grade 2), and 2 patient s (Grade 3; both in the 5.5 mg dose group). No cumulative hematological toxicity was observed in either group of the study, and the reported thrombocytopenia AEs usually resolved before the next cycle. Overall, the majority of AEs were Grade 3 or less in both the 4 mg and 5.5 mg ixazomib dose groups.

These data indicate that there is a subpopulation of patients who are able to tolerate 5.5 mg ixa+dex. In the current study design, the intent is to identify this subpopulation based on excellent tolerability of ixazomib 4 mg in the first cycle and have the potential to dose escalate. The investigators in the study recommended that careful attention be given to the toxicity associated with the hi gher dose and that timely dose reductions be considered to mitigate the adverse effects [7,8] . Indeed, to mitigate the inherent risks in clinical studies of ixazomib, patients are monitored closely for anticipated toxicities. Guidance for the management of AEs (see Section 8.8) and procedures for reducing doses (see Section 8.4) are provided, and drug dosage can be reduced either by decreasing the dose administered or by holding of the scheduled tr eatment. Further information is provided in the IB. 4.3 Rationale for the Proposed Study 4.3.1 Need for Non-IMiD, Cost-Effectiv e Combination Therapies in RRMM With the recent approval of lenalidomide in front-line MM both in the United States and the European Union, the use of this IMiD as primar y therapy will become increasingly prevalent. Because all patients with MM will ultimately relapse and most will develop lenalidomide-resistant disease, alternatives to lenalidomide will be re quired in later lines of therapy. Also, use of a non-IMiD combination in this setting will lower the burdens placed on patients, health care providers , and health care clinics, because a Pregnancy Prevention Programme (European Union) or a REMS program (United States) will no longer be required. Although the typical later-line therapy for patients with RRMM is triplet therapy, some triplet combinations have not shown superior efficacy over doublets involving dexamethasone (eg, bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone [VMP] or bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone [VTD] vs bortezomib with dexamethasone [VD])—even among elderly patients being treated in community practices [50]. Dexamethasone-based doublets like VD have also been shown as effective and tolerable for elderly patients with RRMM [51]. Ixa+dex is a new potentially beneficial doublet therapy for RRMM patients. Furthermore, many elderly and/or heavily pretreated patients may not be able to tolerate the toxicity of a triplet drug combination. 4.3.2 Need for All-Oral Combination Therapies in Patients With RRMM at Later Lines of Therapy Both ixa+dex and the comparator, pom+dex, are pa rticularly compelling options for third-line RRMM patients because many of these heavily pretr eated patients, who are in the later stages of their disease, may prefer an all-oral regimen. Such a regimen will benefit patients who are not able or do not wish to travel to treatment clinics for week ly or more-frequent IV infusions. An entirely oral treatment option may therefore afford pati ents a better QOL. Furthermore, because the investigational regimen is an entirely oral th erapy, an all-oral, standard-of-care comparator, pom+dex, provides a balanced treatment burden between the 2 regimens.PPD Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usedex. x. the toxthe to mititigate igate ixazomixazom nt of AEt of A ided, aned, a g of the of th ion Theon Th e MM bMM therapytherapy elapse anlapse a requireequir l lower l lowe ause a Puse a ) will nowill n therapy herap wn supern supe an, and n, and vs bortvs bor munitmunit y ve and tve and neficial eficia treated reate Need Need ThT Both iBoth RRRR t"
28,page_28,"Ixazomib Study No. C16029 Page 28 of 139 Protocol Incorporating Amendment 06 31 August 2020 A recently published study [52] summarizes cross-sectional data from >7000 patients with MM who were being treated across 7 European countries in 2014. In that study, bortezomib-based therapies were the most commonly used induc tion regimens, and 61% of patients who received bortezomib at first line went on to receive lenalidomide at second line. Third-line therapy was more variable, with the therapies divided amo ng pomalidomide, other agents (eg, bendamustine), and bortezomib retreatment (used in 43% of patients who had received it at first line). In the third-line setting, salvage therapy with either regimen in Study C16029—that is, an entirely oral combination of either pom+dex or ixa+dex—may be preferred by some patients to retreatment with bortezomib (either IV or subcutaneous) or treatment with another IV therapy, such as daratumumab, recently approved by both the FDA and European Medicines Agency in the salvage setting after treatment with a pro teasome inhibitor and an IMiD [37,53] . Furthermore, the efficacy of available therap ies could be improved upon for this patient population. As noted above, in the NIMBUS study, use of pom+low-dose dex resulted in a median PFS of only 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.6- 4.7 months). S imilarly, the median PFS with daratumumab was 4.0 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.6 months) [54]. For this study, daratumumab was considered as a potential comparator; however, given that treatment with daratumumab requires travel to a clinic for IV infusion and premedication, an entirely oral combination was determined to be a more appropriate control for this study. In addition, a comparis on of ixa+dex to daratumumab single agent would not allow for the characterization of the ixazomib contribution to the observed treatment effect, unlike a comparison of ixa+dex to pom+dex, in which the dexamethasone contribution would be similar in both treatment groups. For this reason, this study will compare an experimental regimen including ixazomib, which typically has been studied in combination with LenDex, but here will be combined with dexamethasone only. As a control regimen, pomalidomide will be used in combination with dexamethasone. 4.3.3 Possible Benefit-Risk of Ixa+Dex versus Pom+Dex Preliminary data suggest that, under some circumstances, ixa+dex may have favorable efficacy as compared with pom+dex. and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic have conducted an investigator-initiated phase 2 study of ixazomib in patients with RRMM who were considered not refractory to bortezomib [ 7,8]. The preliminary data suggested that greater clinical benefit may be achieved with the use of ixa+dex, with 4 mg and 5.5 mg doses of ixazomib, compared with historical data with pom+dex (described in Section 4.2.2 above). Therefore, this company-sponsored study is intended to provide furt her assessment on the feasibility and safety of the dose escalation of 4 mg to 5.5 mg ixazomib after the first cycle. Pomalidomide is indicated for use in combination with dexamethasone in adults with RRMM who have received ≥2 prior treatment reg imens, including both lenalidomide and bortezomib, and have demonstrated PD on the last therapy. In this study , pom+dex will be administered to patients who have received ≥2 prior lines of therapy, have been exposed but are not refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, and are refractory to lenalidomide. This is a subgroup of the population of patients for whom pomalidomide is currently approved and who may derive particular benefit from a proteasome inhibitor. Pomalidomide given with de xamethasone is an accepted standard of care for this patient population.PPD Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Uses uststine), ine) n the n the entntirirelyl o retrearetre apypy, suc, su AgencyAgenc pon for n for th resulted esulte FS with S wit umumabmuma umab remab r on was dn was ixa+dexa+de b contribcon in whichn whi eason, thason, been stbeen ly.

29,page_29,"Ixazomib Study No. C16029 Page 29 of 139 Protocol Incorporating Amendment 06 31 August 2020 The risks of both pomalidomide and ixazomib in the patient population eligible for this study appear manageable with appropriate prophylaxis, dose holds, and/or dose modification. In summary, patients receiving pomalidomide are likely to have greater risks of thromboembo lic events and neutropenia, while those receiving ixazomib are more at risk of experiencing thrombocytopenia and gastrointestinal events—all of which appear to be largely manageable with appropriate monitoring, prophylaxis, dose holds, and/or dose modifications. 4.3.4 Ixazomib Dose Rationale The ixazomib dosing regimen for this study wa s informed by the phase 2 Mayo Clinic study (conducted by and colleagues [7,8] and described in Section 4.2.3.2) of ixazomib in combination with dexamethasone conducted in patients with relapsed MM who were not refractory to bortezomib. In the randomized portion of the study with 2 treatment groups, patients received ixazomib at either 4 mg or 5.5 mg on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle, in combination with 20 mg dexamethasone on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle. Thirty-five patients were randomized to each group. The ORR for patients randomized to receive ixazomib at 5.5 mg was found to be higher (54%) than that for the 4 mg patients (31%). Additionally, a trend was observed between the average ixazomib dose (calculated to first best response [PR or better]) and the probability of ≥PR (p=0.0795, N=70), suggesting that higher doses of ixazo mib may result in higher ORR. Event-free survival was similar across the tertiles of average ixazomib dose; however, it should be noted that this small study was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference in event-free survival. As noted in Section 4.2.3.2, a higher frequency of Grade ≥3 AEs that were considered at least possibly related to study therapy was observed in the 5.5 mg ixazomib group than in the 4 mg ixazomib group (54% vs 26%). Dose reductions for ixazomib were also required for a higher percentage of patients in the 5.5 mg ixazomib group (43%, vs 17% in the 4 mg ixazomib group). Collectively, the available data from the randomized phase 2 study [7,8] indicate that both the 4 mg and 5.5 mg doses of ixazomib are active, with the 5.5 mg dose being associated with a higher ORR, although it is not yet known whether this dose will result in longer PFS. The 5.5 mg dose was associated with a higher frequency of AEs and more dose modifications. As a result, in an effort to provide an opportunity for maximum clinical benefit without excessive toxicity, a 4 mg starting dose for ixazomib will be used in this study, with escalation to 5.5 mg at the start of Cycle 2 for those patients who tolerate the 4 mg dose in Cycle 1 (as specified in Section 8.4.1) . Because the study population is patie nts with advanced disease in later-line therapy, the timing of dose escalation at the start of Cycle 2 was selected so that patients who appear to be tolerating ixazomib can escalate quickly to a higher dose and potentially improve their chance of achieving disease control before experien cing PD. Also, the main potential AEs (eg, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal events, rash) are acute AEs that are expected to be seen early in the treatment course, further providing a rationale for an intrapatient dose escalation decision after Cycle 1.PPD Property of Takyykeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Useble e wiwiththiiii yo Clinio Clin ))ofofiiffxax MM whoM who 2 treatm2 trea f each 2f each and 16 and 1 t 5.5 mgt 5.5 m trend wrend R or betor be of ixazoof ixaz rage ixage ix t a statisa sta er frequr freq ywas obwas o %).

For example, a planned treatment approach of induct ion therapy followed by autol ogous SCT, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line o f therapy[1].Typically, each line of therapy is separated by PD.

In cases where only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available (eg, 4 mg dexamethasone is the only dosage available), the fo llowing dexamethasone schedule is recommended for patients aged ≥75 years: 12 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every 28 -day cycle; and 8 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 2, 9, 16, and 23 of every 28-day cycle. For Cy cle 1, all patients will receive a starting dose of 4 mg of ixazomib.

The date and time of each dose of study therapy shoul d be recorded by the pati ent in the pati ent di ary. Refer to the Study Manual for additional instructi ons regarding study therapy administrati on. Patients shoul d be m onitored f or toxi city as necessary and doses of the appropriate study therapy shoul d be m odifie d as needed to accommodate patient tolerance to treatment; this may include symptom atic treatment, dose holds, and adjust ments of the dose. Each AE should be attributed to a specific drug (ie, ixazo mib, pomalido mide, or dexamethasone), if possible, so that dose modificat ions can be made accordingly. Only 1 dose adjust ment per cycle will be performed for a given agent when toxicit y is suspected to be related primarily to that agent. Reduction o f 1 agent and not the other is appropriate if the toxicit y is suspected to be rel ated primarily to that 1 agent. 8.1 Investigational Therapy: Ixazomib Administration (Arm A) Ixazo mib capsules will be supplied by the sponsor as single capsules at 4 different dose strengths, containing 5.5, 4.0, 3.0, and 2.3 mg of ixazo mib. The dose strengths will allow for delivery o f the unit starting dose (4.0 mg), dose escalat ion to 5.5 mg, or dose reductions (2.3, 3.0 mg) as needed during treatment. In patients randomized to Arm A, ixazo mib will be given as a single, oral dose weekly (Day s 1, 8, and 15) for 3 weeks, fo llowed by 1 week wi thout ixazo mib in a 28 -day cycle. Day 1 dosing in Cycle 1 through Cy cle 6 m ust be administered in the clinic, as must the first cycle of dose escalat ion to 5.5 m g of ixazomib; other cy cle doses m ay be taken at hom e. Refer to Section 8.10.1.3 and the Study Manual for addit ional instructi ons regarding study therapy administrati on. The starting dose for ixazo mib is 4 mg, with escalatio n to 5.5 mg at the start of Cycle 2 for patients who tolerate the 4mg dose in Cycle 1 (specifically, patients who do not experience any new Grade 1 peri pheral neuropathy with pain or other ixazomib -related Grade ≥2 nonhemat ologi c or Grade ≥3 neutropenia or thrombocy topeni ain Cycle 1). Patients who have had any dose reductions, holds, or delays because of ixazo mibtoxicities will not dose escalate. Dose escalat ion beyo nd the start of Cycle 2 is permitted only when dose escal ation was inadvertent ly missed at Cycle 2 and will requi re consul tation wi th a Millennium project clinician or designee. Patients shoul d be instructed to swallow ixazomib capsules whole with water and not to break, chew, or open the capsules. Ixazo mib shou ld be taken on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at l east 2 hours after food. The capsule should be swallowed with a sip o f water.

It is recommended that dexamethasone be taken at least 2 hours before the ixazomib dose on the ixazo mib dosing days (see Section 8.3). 8.2 Reference/Control Therapy: Pomalidomide Administration (Arm B) Patients rando mized to Arm B will be dosed with pomalido mide per local prescribing informat ion [41,42] :oral pom alidomide at a dose of 4 mg daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day cycle. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended (see Section 8.8.2). Also see local prescribing information [ 41,42] for further dosing instructions. 8.3 Standard of Care Therapy: Dexamethasone Administration (Both Arms) Each treatm ent arm will receive 40 m g of dexamethasone per week, with a difference in dosing schedule across study arms. Patients in Arm A will receive a total of 40 mg dexamethasone split across 2 consecut ive days (to maximize the prophylact ic ant i -emetic effect around the ixazo mib dosing) and patients in Arm B will receive a 40 mg dexamethasone dose in 1 day (as per the pomalidomide prescribing informat ion), as detailed below. Patients rando mized to Arm A will receive 20 mg oral dexamethasone (or 10 mg if patient is aged ≥75 y ears) on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23 of each 28-day cycle. In cases where only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available (eg, 4 mg dexamethasone is the only dosage available), the following dexamethasone schedule is reco mmended for patients aged ≥75 y ears: 12 m g dexamethasone will be given o n Day s 1, 8, 15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle; and 8 m g dexamethasone will be given on Day s 2, 9, 16, and 23 of every 28-day cycle. Patients rando mized to Arm B will receive 40 mg oral dexamethasone (or 20 mg if patient is aged ≥75 y ears) on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28 -day cy cle, per the pom alidomide local prescribing inform ationthat specifies dexamethasone dosing when used in co mbinat ion with pom alidomide [41,42] . The dexamethasone dose will be determined by the patient’s age at time of rando mizat ion. In the event that a patient is aged 74 years or younger at rando mizat ion and turns 75 or older w hile taking part in the study , the pati ent’s dexamethasone dose will only be changed fro m the dose at rando mizat ion in the event of dexamethasone -related AEs. Dexamethasone should be taken at approximately the same t ime each dosing day. If a dose of dexame thasone is missed, the dose should be taken as soon as the patient remembers it. If enough time has elapsed that it is almo st time for the next dose (within 6 hours), the missed dose should be skipped and the next dose taken according to the regular dosing schedule. A double dose should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If the patient vomit s after taking a dose, the patient shoul d not repeat the dose but should resume dosing at the time of the next scheduled dose. In patients randomized to Arm A, i t is recommended that dexamethasone be administered at least 2 hours before the ixazo mib dose on the ixazo mib dosing days (to maximize the potential antiemet ic effect).

Therefore, if ixazo mib is held, dexamethasone should also be held. Likewise, if p omalidomide is held, dexamethasone should be held. If dexamethasone is held, either ixazo mib or pomalido mide should be held, based on the patient’s treatment group determined at randomizat ion. 8.4.1 Intrapatient Dose Escalation of Ixazomib (Arm A) A starting dos e of 4 mg of ixazomib will be used at Cycle 1 for all pat ients in Arm A. Patients who do not experience any new Grade 1 peripheral neuropathy with pain or other ixazo mib-related Grade ≥2 nonhematologic or Grade ≥3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia in Cycle 1 will dose escalate to 5.5 mg of ixazo mib on the same schedule at the start of Cycle 2. Patients who have had any dose reductions, holds, or del ays because of ixazomib toxicities will not dose escalate. Dose escalat ion bey ond the start of Cycle 2 is permit ted only when dose escal ation was inadvertent ly missed at Cy cle 2 and will require consultat ion with a Millennium project clinician or designee. 8.4.2 Criteria for Beginning or Delaying a Subsequent Treatment Cycle 8.4.2.1 Criteria for Beginning the Next Treatment Cycle With Ixa+Dex (Arm A) Treatment with ixazomib will be repeated every 28 day s in Arm A. The cri teria for toxi city recovery before the pati ent can begin the next cycle of treatment are as follows: ANC ≥1000/mm3. Platelet coun t ≥75,000/mm3. All nonhematologi c toxicit y considered to be related to treatm ent with study therapy must have resolved to Grade ≤1 or to the patient’s baseline values or to a severit y level considered stable and tolerable by the investigator/patient (eg, Grade 2 chronic kidney disease du e to underlying MM). If the patient does not meet the above -cited cri teria for retreatm ent, ini tiation of the next cycle of ixa+dex shoul d be delayed for 1 week. After 1 week, the patient should be re -evaluated to determine whether the criteria for retreat ment have been met. If the patient continues to not meet the previously cited criteria, delay ixa +dex and continue to re -evaluate. Should the start of the next cycle need to be delayed ≥2 weeks because of incomplete recovery from treatment -related toxici ty, the ixa +dex doseswill be reduced by 1 dose level when therapy resumes. Should ixa +dex need to be delayed for 4 weeks because of inco mplete recovery from treatm ent-related toxicit y, ixa+dex shoul d be discont inued or dose reduction of 1 or more than 1 dos e levels should be considered if, in the invest igator’s view, therapy st ill has a reasonable probabilit y of provi ding a benefit.

Erythematous Rash With or Without Pruritus Rash may range from limited ery thematous areas, macular or small papular bumps that may or may not be prurit ic over a few areas o f the body , to a m ore generalized eruption that is predominant ly on the trunk or extremit ies. Rash has been most commonly characterized as maculopapular or macular. To date, when it does occur, rash is most commo nly reported within the first 3 cycles of therapy. The rash is often transient and self -limit ing and is typic ally Grade 1 or 2 in severit y. If rash occurs, considerat ion should be given to alternate causes of the rash such as concomitant medicat ions, infect ions, etc. Symptom atic m easures such as ant ihistamines or corticosteroids (oral or topical) have been succes sfully used to manage rash and have been used prophylactically in subsequent cy cles. The use of a topical, IV, or oral steroid (eg, prednisone ≤10 m g per day or equivalent) i s permitted. Management of a Grade 3 rash may require IV antihistamines or cortico steroi ds. Administration of ixazo mib (and other causative agent if given in combinat ion) should be modified per protocol and reinit iated at a reduced level fro m where rash was noted (also per protocol). In line with clinical practice, dermatology consult a nd biopsy of Grade 3 or higher rash or any SAE involving rash is reco mmended. Prophylactic measures should also be considered if a patient has previously developed a rash (eg, using a thick, alcohol -free emo llient cream on dry areas of the body or oral or topical antihistamines). The rare risks of Stevens -Johnson syndro me, TEN, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndro me), and pemphigus vulgaris have been reported in onco logy studi es when ixazomib (or placebo) was given wit h conco mitant medicat ions that are known to cause rash (eg, Bactrim, lenalido mide, aspirin), and/or in the setting of confounding treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).

Fluid deficit should be prompt ly corrected before administration of ixazomib and as needed during treatm ent to avoi d dehydrat ion. Hypotension Symptom atic hypotensio n and orthostatic hypotension wit h or without syncope have been reported with ixazo mib. Blood pressure should be closely mo nitored as per standard of care while the pati ent is on study treatm ent, and fluid deficit should be corrected as needed, especially in the setting of conco mitant symptom s such as nausea, vomit ing, diarrhea, or decreased appetite.

Upon implementation of Amendment 06, PRO and OS data will no longer be collected. EORTC QLQ -C30 Cancer -specific health -related QOL will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 [59] (Appendix H). The EORTC QLQ -C30 contains 30 items across 5 funct ional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fat igue, nausea and vo miting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, const ipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies) and a global healt h status/QOL scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a litt le, quite a bit, and very much), wi th 2 questi ons relying on a 7 -point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging fro m 0 to 100. For the funct ional subscales and the global healt h status/QOL subscale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom subscales, lower scores represent better QOL. The physical funct ioning domain of EORTC QLQ -C30 consists of 5 items covering the patient’s daily physical act ivities. It has been validated to measure physi cal activity changes in pat ients wit h MM [60,61] . Because of the relevance o f physical funct ion in MM, the physical funct ioning domain o f EORTC QLQ -C30 has been used as a primary endpoint in som e MM studi es [ 61].

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associ ated w ith the use of a medicinal (invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the administration of study thera py. An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered by the investigator to be a clinically significant change fro m baseline. 10.1.3 SAE Definition SAE m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death. Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe). Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see clarificati onin the paragraph in Sect ion 10.2 on planned hospitalizat ions). Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disabilit y is defined as a substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions). Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not resul t in death, be immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardi ze the pati ent, requi re medical or surgi cal interventi on to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent.

In thi s study , intensi ty for each AE, including any laboratory abnorm ality, will be determined using the NCI CTCA E, Versi on 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [62].Clarificat ion shoul d be made between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms seri ous and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache ). Thi s is NOT the sam e as serious , which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessa rily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 i s considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporti ng obliga tions. 10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs All AEs spontaneously reported by the pati ent and/or in response to an open question fro m study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE. Wh en possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underlying patho logy shoul d be noted as 1 comprehensive event. Regardless of causality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 10.1) must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the peri od of observati on) by the investigator to the Millennium Global Pharm acovigilance department or designee (contact informat ion provi ded below). This shoul d be done by faxing the SAE Form within 24 hours after becoming aware of the event. The SAE Form , created specifically by Millennium , will be provi ded to each clinical study site. A sample of the SAE Form may be found in the Study Manual. Fo llow-up informat ion o n the SAE or serious pretreatm ent event m ay be requested by Millennium . SAE report i nformat ion must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. The paper SAE forms should be submitted via fax (see fax numbers below) within 24 hours of awareness. In case of fax, site personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n of all pages and include an email address on the fax cover sheet so that an acknowledgment of receipt can be returned via email wit hin 1 business day. Email submissio n of paper SAE forms wit h a PDF attachment should only be used in the case where fax is not possible within 24 hours of receiving the event. In case of email, site personnel need to confirm successful transmissio n by await ing an acknowledgment of the receipt via email wit hin 1 business day. If SAEs are reported via fax or by email, the EDC applicat ion must be u pdated as soon as possible with the appropriate informat ion.

Deviations from the statistical analyses outlined in this protocol will be indicated in the statist ical analysis plan; any further modifications will be noted in the clinical study report. Study C16029 is a phase 2 study with PFS as the primary endpoint. The preliminary data from the phase 2 study by et al., an investigator-initiated study, demonstrated that greater clinical benefit (eg, ORR) may be achieved with the use of ixa+dex, with 4 mg and 5.5 mg doses of ixazomib, compared with pom+dex [ 7,8]. Therefore, this company-s ponsored study is intended to provide further assessment on 1) the feasibility and safety of the dose escalation of 4 mg to 5.5 mg ixazomib after the first cycle, and 2) the efficacy of ixa+dex. 13.1.1 Analysis Sets The populations used for analysis will include the following: !Safety population : The safety population is defined as all patients who receive at least 1 dose of any study therapy. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. That is, those patients who are randomized to the active arm but receive the regimen in the control arm will be included in the control arm; those patients who are randomized to the control arm but receive the regimen in the active arm will be included in the active arm for safety analyses. !ITT population: The ITT population is defined as all patients who are randomized. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they are randomized to receive, regardless of any errors of dosing. 13.1.2 Analysis of Demograph ics and Other Baseline Disease Characteristics The demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized in a descriptive fashion. Data to be evaluated will include age, sex, race or ethnic group, weight, baseline disease characteristics, and other parameters, as appropriate. 13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis All available efficacy data will be included in data listings and tabulations.

PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of confirmed PD or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients without docum entati on of PD will be censored at the date of the last response assessment that is SD or better. PFS will be analyzed after approximately 81 PFS events have been observed. Unstratified analyses of PFS will be conducted. A 2-sided, unstratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatment groups with respect to PFS at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.20. In addition, an unadjusted unstratified Cox model will be used to estimate the HR and its 80% and 95% CIs for the treatment effect. The KM survival curves and KM m edians (if est imable), along with their 2 -sided 95% CIs, will also be provided for each treatm ent group. Sensit ivity analyses for PFS will include: PFS assessed by stratified analyses in the ITT populat ion. Subgroup analyses will be perform ed for PFS rel ative to baseline stratificat ion factors and demographic data such as sex, race or ethnic group, and age, as appropriate. 13.1.3.2 Analyses of Secondary Efficacy The primary endpoint of PFS will be supported by prespecified evidence of clinical benef it as measured by other secondary endpoints. Other secondary efficacy parameters are OS, ORR, durati on of response, time to response, and TTP. Disease response related endpoints will be analyzed using invest igator -assessed response rate for the ITT population. OS will be analyzed on the basis o f the ITT population and is defined as the time from rando mizat ion to death fro m any cause. Patients wit hout documentation of death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date last known to be alive. A 2-sided, unstratified log -rank test will be used to compare the treatment and control groups with respect to OS. In addition, an unadjusted unstratified Cox model will be used to estimate the HR and its 80% and 95% CIs for the treatm ent effect. OS will be also tested at 2 -sided alpha=0.2. The KM survival curves and KM medians (if est imable), along with their 95% CIs, will also be provided for each study group. ORR is defined as the rates of PR, VGPR, or CR, as evaluated by an invest igator on the basis of central laboratory resul ts according to IMWG criteria [ 55]. The percentage of each response category (CR, VGPR, and PR) and of the combination CR +VGPR will be determined. Durati on of response is defined as the time fro m the first documentation of PR or bett er to the first docum entati on of PD. Responders wit hout documentation of PD will be censored at the date of the last assessed response of PR or better. Duration of CR will be summarized descript ively using the KM m ethod.

TTP will be analyzed on the basis o f the ITT populat ion using methods similar to those used for PFS. 13.1.4 PK Analysis PK data collected in this study may contribute to populat ion PK and exposur e/response (safety and efficacy) analyses. These analyses may include data fro m other ixazo mib clinical studies and will be separately developed and reported. 13.1.5 QOL and HU Analyses Analyses of pat ient-reported QOL outcomes will be performed for patients with data at baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measurement. Analyses of HU will be performed for the ITT popul ation. The QOL analyses will be completed for all subscales, but particular emphasis will be placed on the Physical Funct ioning subscale. The main healt h-related QOL endpoint is time to maintained deteri oration of Physical Functioning domain scores from the EORTC QLQ -C30, based on a minimally important difference of 10 (primary analysis) [63-65] and 5 (sensit ivity analysis) [ 66]. The summary and subscale scores of EORTC QLQ -C30 and subscale scores of QLQ -MY20 will also be analyzed. Specifically, the actual value and change fro m baseline scores will be summarized using descript ive statist ics by treatment group over time. The chang e from baseline on summary and subscale scores may also be analyzed using linear mixed models by incorporating the measurements across different time points. Addit ionally , the number and percentages of patients showing a clinically meaningful change from baseline will be summarized by treatment group over time. Quest ionnaire compliance will also be summarized. Published manuals/guidance for these quest ionnaires will be used for scoring and handling of missing data. Sensit ivity analyses may be conducted to study the impact of missing data. EQ-5D- 5L item scores and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores will be summarized using descript ive statistics by treatment group over time.

For incidence proportions, the relative risks, defined as the ratio of incidence proportions between the 2 randomized treatment groups, will be provided along with their 95% CIs. For incidence rates, the relative risks, along with their 95% CIs, will be calculated using an exponential regression model for lifetime data (assuming constant hazards). Because of the distinct nature of hematologic and nonhematologic neoplasms, and the emerging signals of new primary malignancies for IMiDs, analyses of new primary malignancies may be performed separately for hematologic and nonhematologic malignancies. 13.1.7 Control of Overall Typ e I Error for the Primary Endpoint of PFS Type I error is controlled by the primary endpoi nt, because only 1 test is planned for primary endpoint of PFS at a 2-sided level of 0.20. 13.2 Determination of Sample Size Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled. The primary endpoint is PFS with assumption of an HR of 0.62 (median PFS, 7.3 months for ixa+dex vs 4.5 months for pom+dex). The analysis of PFS will be performed on the basis of approximately 81 PFS events in total (for 80% power at a 2-sided 0.20 level of significance). The PFS assumption for pom+dex is based on the PFS of 3.9 months (with a 95% CI of 3.5-4.6) for the subgroup of patients in the NIMBUS study with 2 prior lin es who were lenalidomide refractory [45], with a higher value of 4.5 months chosen to be on the conservative side. The PFS assumption for ixa+dex is based on the PFS of 9.6 months in a similar population (2 prior lines, lenalidomide refractory), calculated on the basis of data from the study as discussed above. Because this latter study had a smaller population and the PFS had a wider 95% CI (4.6- 16.3) than the NIMBUS study, a more conservative value of 7.3 months was chosen.PPDy alignanaligna able infoble in nce e proppro 5% CIs. % CI g an expan ex ologic nlogic of new of new ogic magic m PrimaPrim point, beint, zeze be enrobe enr months month he basishe bas nificancifican fofor pomr po atients itient gher valher va is baseis ba yy), cal), calyy cu study hastudy h dyy, a m, a"

Alternative monitoring approaches should be used only where all owed by applicable l ocal regulati ons and permitted by the IR B/IEC. 14.2 Protocol Deviations The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require deviat ion from protocol -specified pr ocedures, the investigator should consult with the sponsor or designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria. The sponsor will assess any protocol deviat ion; if it is likely to affect to a significant degree the safet y and ri ghts of a subject or the reliabilit y and robustness o f the data generated, it will be reported to regulatory authori ties as a seri ous breach o f GCP and the protocol.

Each invest igator will conduct the study according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix B. The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices containing requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities. The rati onale for the open -study design is primarily to reduce the treatm ent burden on study patients. A pl acebo control woul d requi re pat ients to ingest a large number of addit ional pills (23addit ional placebo tablets per cycle for patients receiving po m+dex, and 41 additional placebo tablets per cy cle for pati ents receiving ixa+dex).

Unless otherwise specified, occasional changes are allowable within an additiona l 2-day window for holidays, vacations, and other administra tive reasons. If a visit or procedure cannot be performed within the window, then the Millennium project clinician or designee should be consulted.

Remote reconsenting is permitted as long as the process adheres to site, IRB/IEC, and GCP standards and local regulat ions. (c) Patients should be assessed and treated according to local standard of care. Collect and record only clinically significant findings as AEs in the eCRF. (d) Alternative methods for administering study procedures/assessments may be considered when it is not possible for the pati ent to come to the study site due to extenuating circumstances (eg, due to the COVID -19 pandemic). Alternative methods should be considered for performing the assessments by other means than the patient presenting to the clinic (eg, remote assessment, having lab oratory assessment performed at a facility closer to the patient’s home).

(a) Tests and procedures should be performed on schedule, within a 2 -day window for Day 1 of each cycle. Unless oth erwise specified, occasional changes are allowable within an additional 2 -day window for holidays, vacations, and other administrative reasons. If a visit or procedure cannot be performed within the window, then the Millennium project clinician or designee should be consulted. If the study schedule is shifted, assessments should be shifted to be aligned with the new schedule. Not e that, except for hematology and chemistry laboratory samples (see footnote k below), all required tests and procedures for a spe cific visit should be done on the same day as the study visit. (b) Before discontinuing a patient from treatment for PD, the Progressive Disease Review form must be completed as soon as po ssible, permitting pertinent data to be confirmed by a Millennium pr oject clinician or designee. (c) Patients who have stopped treatment for any reason other than PD will first enter the PFS Follow -up period. Patients who have PD while on study therapy, during the Treatment period, will skip the PFS Follow -up period and w ill enter directly into the OS Follow -up period. Patients in the PFS Follow -up period who have PD or start subsequent anticancer therapy will end PFS Follow -up and will enter into the OS Follow -up period. See Figure 6.bfor a detailed flow chart for both follow -up periods. (d) All Arm A patients who tolerated the 4 mg dose of ixazomib in Cycle 1 (see Section 6.1.2 ) should dose escalate to 5.5 mg on Cycle 2 Day 1. If the patient qualified for escalation but escalation was inadvertently missed at Cycle 2 Day 1, escalation at a later cycle may be allo wed after consultation with the Millennium project clinician or designee; in that case, the patient must have Day 15 hematology samples collected in addition to Day 1 hematology samples. Patients who dose escalate to 5.5 mg must receive the first cycle of the 5.5 mg dose in the clinic rather than taking it at home. (e) Confirmation of patient eligibility by a Millennium project clinician or designee is required before randomization. Cycle 1 Day 1 should be no later than 7 days after the date of randomizatio n. (f) Measurement of blood pressure and heart rate is to be performed at screening, along with temperature and respiratory rate . During the Treatment period, measurement of blood pressure and heart rate is to be performed; temperature and respiratory rat e are collected only as clinically indicated. (g) Patient -reported outcomes and HU assessment (eg, number of medical encounters) should be completed on the same day as the study visit , before any other study procedures are performed or study therapy is adm inistered. At any time point when a clinic visit is not otherwise required (ie, during the OS Follow -up period), the EQ -5D-5L questionnaire may be administered over the telephone by trained site staff. (h) Imaging to assess status of bone disease will be d one at Screening (within 8 weeks before randomization) for all patients by means of skeletal survey, CT, MRI, or PET -CT. Additional assessments for bone disease can be done at the discretion of the investigator (ie, for suspected increased or new bone lesi ons or PD) and should be done by the same modality. (i) Imaging to assess extramedullary disease will be done at Screening (within 8 weeks before randomization) for all patients by means of CT, MRI, or PET -CT. In patients for whom extramedullary disease i s found at Screening, additional assessments should be done, using the same modality, at Cycle 1 Day 1 and every 3 cycles thereafter, unless the screening assessment is completed before 14 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1; then the next assessment can be on Cyc le 3 Day 1. (j) In Arm A, 3 serum pregnancy tests must be performed for women of childbearing potential. The Cycle 1 Day 1 pregnancy test may be collected up to 3 days before dosing and results must be available and negative before dosing. In Arm B, for wo men of childbearing potential, 2 pregnancy tests (with 1 or both being a serum test) must be performed before starting pom+dex and results must be available and negative before dosing —the first within 10 to 14 days before dosing and the second within 24 ho urs before dosing. Then testing must be performed weekly during the first month and monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles, or every 2 wee ks (at Day 15) in women with irregular menstrual cycles. In Arm B at the EOT visit, the test must b e a serum pregnancy test. The results of each test must be available and negative before the study therapy is administered. P regnancy tests may also be repeated during the study upon request by IECs/IRBs or if required by local regulations. (k) Hematology and chemistry laboratory samples will be collected locally and may be collected up to 3 days before Day 1 of each cycle or pr ior to dosing on Day 1. For Cycles 1 and 2 in both arms, the laboratory samples may be collected 24 hours prior to dosing on Day 15 or before dosing on Day 15. In addition, for Arm B (pom+dex) only, hematology samples will be collected at Cycle 1 and at Cycle 2 Days 8 and 22. Samples may be collected 24 hours before, or prior to dosing on, D ays 8 and 22. Laboratory reports must be rev iewed by the investigator prior to dosing for all cycle visits, and clinical significance must be indicated. In addition, the investigator must assess any AEs or concomitant medication changes prior to dosing. Local laboratory evaluations and evaluation of SPEP and UPEP for confirmation of PD may be done more frequently at the investigator’s discretion (ie, for acute management of TEAEs).

(l) If the screening test was performed more than 14 days before the first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), the test will be repeated befo re dosing. The test closest to the first dose will be considered Baseline. Note that 24-hour urine collection is permitted before screening if it is part of standard clinical practi ce at the site.

Note that 24-hour urine collection is permitted before screening if it is part of standard clinical practice at the site.(n) Blood samples for IgM, IgG, and IgA will be obtained at Screening and throughout the study at the time points specified. If the screening test was performed more than 14 days before the first dose (Cycle 1 Day1), the test will be repeated before dosing. The test closest to the first dose will be consi dered Baseline.

(r) When peripheral neuropathy occurs, each subsequent monthly evaluation will record the grade of peripheral neuropathy at tha t visit. (This is in contrast to other AEs where only increases in grade are recorded until the maximum grade is reached and then followed at that grade until complete resolution or return to Baseline.)

The corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol. Change 1: To note thatthe data cutoff date for the study analysis, which is the only planned forma l analysis for this study , has now occurred. The change occurs in Sect ion 6.1.4 Statistical Analyses : Initial wording:Upon com pletion of this study , approximately 120 pati ents will have been enrolled globally . The PFS analysis will occur after approximately 81 PFS events have been observed (after approximately 28 months from first patient enrollment), for 80% power at a 2 -sided 0.20 level o f significance. Analysis o f all secondary endpoints will occur at the same t ime as the PFS analysis; no further analyses are planned. Amended or new wording:Upon com pletion of this study , approximately 120 pati ents will have been enrol led globally . The PFSstudy analysis for PFS will occur after approximately 81 PFS events have been observed (after approximately 28 months from first patient enrollment), for 80% power at a 2- sided 0.20 level of significance. Analysis o f all secondary endp oints will occur at the same time as the PFS this study analysis , which is the only planned formal analysis for this study ; no further formal analyses are planned. Long -term safety data collected after the data cutoff date for the study analysis will be sum marized descriptively in a clinical study report addendum. Rationale for Change: To clarify aspects of the study analysis. Change 2: To note that, now that the data cutoff date for the study analysis has occurred, all central efficacy and investigator assessments of response for protocol purposes are now discontinued. The primary change occurs in Section 9.4.12 Disease Response Assessment by Investigator : Initial wording:Patients will be assessed for disease response according to the IMWG uniform response criteria, versio n 2011 (see Appendix G), unt il the PFS endpo int has been met for this study. At that time, all central efficacy and investigator assessments of disease response for protocol purposes will be stopped. Amended or new wording:After the primary endpo int ofdata cutoff date for the study analysis (including for PFS)has been met occurred , all central efficacy and investi gator assessments of response for protocol purposes will be discont inued ; patients will be fo llowed for survival and the appropriate data collected ..

128,page_128,"Ixazomib Study No. C16029 Page 128of 139 Protocol Incorporating Amendment 06 31August 2020 Change 3: To note that, now that the data cutoff date for the study analysis has occurred, the objective and endpo int of the study has changed to solely cont inue to collect long -term safet y dat a. The primary change occurs in Section 5.0STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS and Section 6.1.3 Study Assessments : Added text:[Section 5.0] As of Amendment 06, the objective and en dpoint are to continue to collect long-term safety data from patients who are continuing on ixazomib and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone because of continuing clinical benefit. Data collection for all other study objectives and endpoints is complete and no further formal analyses will be conducted. However, the original lists of objectives and endpoints are retained below for reference only. Added text:[Section 6.1.3] Upon implementation of Amendment 06, data collection requirements will be limited to collection of AEs and SAE s. All other study assessments are no longer required. All central laboratory assessments are discontinued. Quality of life and HUassessments are discontinued. Patients will not be followed for the PFS or OS follow -up periods, because PFS and OS data are no longer being collected. Rationale for Change: To clarify the study objective and endpo int at this point in the study . The changes also occur in the fo llowing sect ions: Secti on 2.0STUDY SUMMARY Change 4: To note that as of the current amendment, now that the data cutoff date for the study analysis has occurred, only pat ients who conti nue to dem onstrate clinical benefit but have no access to study drugs other than staying in the study maystay in the study . The primary change occurs in Section 6.1.3 Study Assessments , Secti on 9.8Withdrawal o f Patients From Study , and Sect ion 9.9Study Closure : Added text:[Section 6.1.3] Only patients who continue to demonstrate cli nical benefit but who do not have other means of access to the study drugs will continue on the study. As no further formal statistical analyses will be performed, only assessments contributing to long- term safety data are required. Most study assessments besides safety are discontinued to ease the burden of protocol- mandated assessments on patients. Patients continuing their current study treatment may do so until such time as other means of accessing the study drugs are arranged.
