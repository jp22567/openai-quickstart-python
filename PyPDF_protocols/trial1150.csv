This under recognized disease is o ften not diagnosed fo r many years and ty picall y presents in people between 20 and 40 years of age leading to progressive disability and adverse effects on q uality of life. Tofacitinib inhibits signaling of cytokines that are integral to ly mphocy te activation , proliferation, a nd func tion and may thus result in suppression of multiple aspects of the immune response. This forms the basis of the rationale to in vestigat e the effect of tofacitinib in active A S. This study is a follow- up to the A3921119 Phase 2b study of tofacitinib in act iveAS. Objectives andEndpoints Primary Objectives: Primary Endpoint:  Tocompare theefficacy oftofacitinib 5mgBID versus placebo on theASAS20 response rateatWeek 16in subjects with active ASthathave hadaninadequate response toprevious treatm ent. ASAS 20response atWeek 16. Key Secondary Objective: Key Secondary Endpoint:  To compare the efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg BID ver sus placebo on the ASAS40 response rate atWeek 16 in subjects with active AS that have had an inadequate respons e to previ ous treatment. ASAS40 response atWeek 16. Other Secondary Objectives: Other Secondary Endpoints:  Tocompare thesafety and tolera bility of tofacitinib 5mgBID versus p lacebo in s ubjects with active AS thathave hadaninadequate response topreviou s treatment. Incidence andseverity ofAdverse Events (AE).  Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination and12-lead ECG parameters.  To compare the efficacy ( including health -related quality of life , function, p ain,and fatigue ) of tofacit inib 5 mg BID versus placebo at all time points in subjects with active AS that have had an inadequate response to previous trea tment. ASAS20response atallother time points .  ASAS40 response atallother time points.  Change fr om baseline in Ankylo singSpondylitis Disease Activity Score using C-Reactive Protein (ASDAS CRP)atalltime points.  Change from baseline in hsCRP at all ti me point s.  Change from baseline in Ankylosing Spon dylitis Quality ofLife (ASQoL) atalltime points collected .  Change fr om base line in Short -Form -36Health Survey- Version 2 Acute (SF -36v2) at all time points collected.  Change from baseline in Bath Ankylos ingSpon dylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) includi ng the 5 co mponents (lateral spine flexion, tragus -to-wall distance, lumba r flexion,maximal intermalleolar distance and cervical rotation) at alltime points.  Change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT -F) (3endpoints: to tal score, experience domain and impact do main scores) atalltime points  Change from baseline in Patients Global Assessment of Disease (PGA) at all time points col lected."

An estimate of approxima tely 480 AS subjects will be screened globall y in order that approximately 240 eligible subjects (120 per arm) will be randomized in a 1:1 rati o to tofacitinib 5 mg BID (twice dail y)ormatchin g placebo BID. Active disease is required for entry into this study and is defined as: Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing Spondy litis (1984), Bath Anky losing Spondy litis Disease Activity Index (BASD AI)score of 4 and back pain score (BA SDA I Questi on 2) of 4despite an adequate therapeutic t rial with 2 or mor e non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (or intolerance to NSAIDs). Eligible subjects will be treated with one of the two sequences for 1 6 weeks followed by treatment with t ofacitinib 5 mg BID for an additional 32 weeks. The d uration of participation for eligible subjects will be approximately 56 weeks. This will include a screening period of approximately 30 day s, a 16 -week dou ble-blind treatment period, a 32- week open -label treatment period and a 28 day follow -up period. Du ring the 16-week trea tment p eriod subjects will visit the clinic every two weeks ( 3 day s) until the Week 4 visit and then every 4 weeks (7 day s) unti l com pletion of Week 16. At the Week 16 visit all subj ects wil l be assigned to open -label tofacitinib an d will visit the clin ic every two months ( 7 day s) until week 48. Subjects will then return to the clinic for a Follow -up visit approximately 28 day safter the wee k 48 visit. The investigators, subjects and sponsor study team will remain blinded to the f irst 16 weeks of trea tment a ssignment through the entire duration of the trial until database release. Amendment 3 All subjects in the study will be evaluated for r iskfactors for venous thromboembolism (VTE)(2019 ESC guid elines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmo nary embolism developed in collaboration with the ERS. European Heart Journal (2020) 41;543- 603). The study investigator or designee will need to review each subject’s medical history and study records, including their concomitant medications, to determine whethe r he/she is at high risk for devel oping VTE. A subject may be at hig h risk for VTE if he/she: •has heart failure or prior my ocardial infa rctionwithin the pa st 3 months; •has inherited coagulation disorders; •has had VTE, either deep venous thromb osis or pulm onary embolism; •is taking combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therap y;"

INTRODUCTION 1.1.Mechanism of Action/Indication Tofacitini bisbeing develo pedforthetreatment ofadult subjects withactive anky losing spondy litis(AS) who have hadaninadequate response toprevious non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) treatment. Tofacitinib i s a potent, selec tive inhibitor of the Janus Kina se (JAK) f amily of kinase swith a high degree of selectivit y against other kinases in the human genome. In kinase assays, tofacitinib, inhibits JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and to a lesser extent Ty K2. In cellular se ttings where JAK kinases signal in pairs, tofacitinib prefe rentiall y inhib its signaling b y heterod imeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1 with functional selectivity over receptors that sign al via pairs of JAK2.1,2,3 This affects signaling via IL -17, IL -21 and IL-23which have been implicated in AS pathology .3Antibodies to IL-17have de monstrated efficacy in AS.3 Through direct and indirect inhibition of cy tokine pathway s, tofacitinib c an modulate immune responses and red uce or prevent inflammation.3 1.2.Background andRationale ASisprevale nt among spondy loarthropathies, agroup ofarthritic conditions affecting the spine. AScauses bone erosions intheaxial skeleton andchron icinflammation atthe insertion of ligaments andtendons which results innew bone formation andeventua l anky losis ofthejoints .The diagnosis is conf irmed by pelvic x -rays that meet Modified New York Criteria for An kylosing Spondy litis(1984) (See Appendix 2). ASusuallyprogre sses from sacral inflammation initiating inthesacroilia cjoints toprogressive spine anky losis over time leading toback pain, lossofmobility , fatigue, stiffness andfunctional impairment. AS isfrequentl yassociated with peripheral arthritis,enthesi tis,osteoporosis andextraartic ular manif estations such asanterior uveitis andinflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This under -recognized disease isoften notdiagnose dformany years andtypically presents in people between 20and40years of a gewith a slightly higher prevalence inmalesleading to progressive disability andadverse effects onquality oflife.4,5 Itisestimated thatthis condition affects approxima tely0.1-1.1% oftheCaucasian a dultpopul ation globally .5,6 Theetiology ofASiscurrently unknown but a genetic linkwasnoted in90-95% of people with ASwho arepositive forHLA -B27 allele andriskincre ases with HLA -B27-positive relatives.5,7,8 There i s currently no cure for AS. As a result patients with AS fa ce a poor quality of life with increased rates of work disab ility and unemploy ment and an ever increasing costtosociety .9,10 In the past several y ears there has bee n signific ant progress in the management of AS. With the advent of new consensus- based criteria issued by Assessmen ts in Anky losing Sp ondy litis Intern ational Societ y (AS AS)/the European League Ag ainst Rheum atism (EULAR) gro up, the earlier identification o f patients with AS is pos sible.11 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) ha sproven valuable in identify ing ear ly sacroiliitis and spondylitis with detectio n of enthes itisand synoviti s in the axial skeleton.12"

Given these considerations, it is appropriate to investigate tofacitinib in a bDMARD naïve population, as well as th ose who have had an inadequate response to TNFi. 1.2.1. Summary ofEfficacy 1.2.1.1. Rheuma toidArthritis Tofacitinib has demonstrated e fficacy inRA as both mon otherapy and in combination with methotrexate in Phase 2 and 3 studies. Efficacy in relie ving signs and s ymptoms and in restoring ph ysical function was demonstrated by American Coll ege ofRheumatolo gy 20% response (ACR20) primary endpoint a nd secondary efficacy endpoints including ACR50, ACR70, Disease Activity Score for 28 Joints (DAS 28) and the Health Assessme nt Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ -DI). Additionally , radiographic assessments showe d tofacitinib reduced or inhibit ed the progression of str uctural damage. Evidence of sustained efficacy of tofacitinib treatment in RA was provided from data in open -label extension studies. In the long -term follow -up studies A 3921024 (ongoin g at the time of anal ysis) and A3921041, effi cacy was m aintained in th ese studies through at least 96months. No additional long term safet y issues were identi fied. 1.2.1.2. Psoriatic Art hritis The tofacitinib P hase 3 program was designed to evaluate the saf ety and efficacy of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg BI D in subje cts with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The 2pivotal studies (A3921091, A3921125) compared the effic acy of both tofacitinib doses to that of the placebo over 3 months for improvemen ts in multi ple Ps A domains, examined the onset of efficacy , and assess ed the persiste nce of efficacy (over a period of greater than 3months) of both tofacitinib doses in csDM ARD inadequate respo nder (csDMARD -IR) TNFi -naïve and TNFi -IR populations. For bo th studies the AC R20 respons e rate and the mean HAQ -DI (dec rease) wer e statistically h igher for both tofac itinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID dose treatment groups than the placebo tre atment group at Mont h 3. For both studies, e arly onset of efficacy in ACR20 resp onse was shown with both tof acitinib doses as demonstrated by a statis ticall y signifi cant superior response to placebo at Week 2, Month 1, and Month 2. ACR50 response rates d emonstrated superior ity to placebo at Month 3 for both studies. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID was approv edbythe FDA for the treatment of PsA as of 14Decembe r 2017 and by theEMA as of 25 June 2018. 1.2.1.3. Ulcerative Colitis Efficacy in UC was shown in Phase 2 and 3 st udies. I n Phase 3 induction studies (A3921094 and A3921095) the proportion of subjects showing r emission by Week 8 was statistically signif icantl y greater in the tofa citinib 10 mg BID group as compared with the placebo group.

Tofacitinib 5 an d 10 mg BID was approved for the treatment of UC in the U Sas of 30 May 2018 and in Japan as of 25 May 2018. 1.2.1.4. AS A dose -ranging Phase 2 study , A39211 19, evaluated the e fficacy and safet y of tof acitinib in AS subjects with an inad equate resp onse to NSAIDs. The primary endpoint estimated t he dose-response relationship using the Emax model for the ASAS20 response rate at Week 12. Tofacitinib 5 mg and 1 0mg BID had respons e rates with model based estimated differences from placebo o f 22.9% and 27.3% respective ly. Normal approximation analy sis of the ASAS20 at Week 1 2demonstrated tofacitinib 5 mg BID was the onl y dose statistically superior to the place bo. Secondary endpo ints generall y demonstrat ed greater improvements with tofacit inib5 and 10 m g BID than th e placebo. 1.2.2. Summary of Safety The clinical development pr ogram for tofacitinib (oral administration) has included patients with RA, juvenile idiopa thic arthritis (J IA), PsA, UC, PsO, renal tra nsplant rejection, Crohn’s disease ( CD) and AS, enrolledin 48 Phase 2, Phase 3 and LTE studies. Cumulativ ely through 05 May 2018, it is estimated that 23,038 subjects have participated in tofacitinib clinical t rials worldwide, wit h more than 14,473 subjec ts receiving at least 1 study dose of oral tofaciti nib, in eithe r a randomized clinical study orLTE study . Of these subje cts,approximately 8700 subjects continue to receive tofacitinib by participating in LTE or other t ypes of c ontinuation studies. Potential safety risks for subjects trea ted with to facitinib are bas ed on the totality of the data including nonclinical obse rvations, clinical observations, as well as safety risks reported for other therapies that may share common pa thway s with tofacitinib. These risks are discussed briefl y in the following s ection. Additional information for this com pound may be found in the single reference safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.3. Overall Risk -Benefit 1.2.3.1. Potential Benefits Given thechronic nature ofthisdisorder andthelimited avail able therapies, there remains an unmet medical need foraneffective oraltreatment forAS. I n addition, patients may have an inadequate response to available treatme nt options such as TNFi.

Potential Risks The risks associated with tof acitinib are similar to the risks associated with the use of other bDMARDS, including a po tential risk for dev elopment of serious and o ther infections, eg,tuberculosis and viral rea ctivat ionsuch as herpes zoster (HZ). In the RA program, t he serious infe ction rate in the tofacitinib-treated subjects was consistent with the rates of serious inf ections in patients treated with other thera peutic interventions including bDMAR Ds. Serious in fections were more frequent among the elderly (>65 years), subjects withdiabetes mellitus and subjects treated previously with biological agents. Rates of HZ infections in tofaci tinib-treated subjects with RA were increased compared with placebo -treated RA subjects a nd historical controls; this inc luded an i ncreased risk o fHZ infections in Asian RA subjects compared with non -Asian RA subjects. In the tofaciti nib RA clinical deve lopment program, the rate of HZ varied significantly across c ountries an d regions. The i ncidence rates of HZ in Japan an d Korea we re notabl y high erthan the rates observed in other regions/countries. The reason for the increased risk of HZ in Japan and Korea is unclear. Decrease s in white blood cell counts, partic ularly neutroph ils and ly mphocytes, and decreased in hemoglo bin have been observed. Th ese effects are usually mild to moderate and returned to normal after discontinuation of therapy . Anemia is a possible consequence o f JAK2 inhibition. Experience to da te indicate s thatanemia is easily monitored, usuall y manage able witho ut discontinuat ion of treatment, and reversible on discontinuation of tofacitinib. Neutropenia is of pri mary concern b y virtue of its relationship to an increased risk of infection. Th us far no a ssociation between the occurrence of neutropenia and infect ion has been obse rved in the tofacitinib program. Treatment with tofacitinib was associated with increase sin levels of Low D ensity Lipoprotein (LDL) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) c holesterol, with the ratios of mean LDL/HDL cholesterol unch anged. In the previous c ontrolled trials, elevation of LDL cholesterol generall y returned to pre -treatment levels after discontinuatio n of tofacitinib. In light of the association of RA and acce lerated ath eroscl erosis, car diovascular (CV) mortalit y and m orbidity CV events were eva luated b y an independent adjudication committee. Review of cardiovascular events by thecommittee reported in RA and PsO studies sug gest that tofacitinib was not associated with a n increas e in maj or adverse cardiovascular events . Also obs erved in previous studies were slight increases in measured serum creatinine and serum transaminases. Th is effect generally returned to normal after discontinuation of therap y. A singl e RA subjec t experienced pos sible drug -induced liver injury (DILI) whi le being treate dwith tofacitinib and methotrexate. Tofacitinib was discontinued and the subject recover ed following treatme nt with prednisone and az athioprine. The time course of the subject’s biochem ical abnormalities were aty pical for DILI, however investigation did not reveal an alternative etiology . No additional possible DILI cases and no confirmed H y’s Law cases have b een identified during adjudication by the Hepatic Event Revie w Committee (HERC)."

Other malignanci es observed (at varying frequencies depending on the popula tion under stud y) include breast cancer, lymphoma, melanomas, colon and prostate cancer. Pancreatic and o ther cancers have a lso been reported less fr equently . Cases of gastrointestinal (GI) perfor ation wer e observ ed in RA subjects taking tofacit inib, often in the settin gof diverticulitis. All affected subjects had underl ying risk factors, including a histo ry of concomitant dr ug treatment with (NSAIDS) and/or corticosteroids that have b een associa ted with an incre ased risk of GI tract injury .43,44 Isolated events of GI perforation have al so been reported in clini cal trials in other tofacitinib indi cations inc luding one (prefe rred term: appendicitis) in the PsA progra m, 8 in the UC pr ogram, 3 in the CD program and 2 in the renal transplant program. Interstitial lung dise ase (ILD), a complex co-morbidity in RA subje cts, has also been reported in RA su bjects rece iving tofacitinib . While data from the RA develo pment prog ram do not iden tify a pulmonary toxicity for tofacitinib, an increased risk of ILD was observed in Asian RA subjects as compa red to non- Asian subjects but there was no consistent dose relationship. Basedonnonclin ical data, there is a potential risk for t eratogenicity with tofacitinib. A more detailed discussion of tofacitinib safet y can be found in the Inve stigator’s Brochure . 1.2.4. Clinical Pharmacokineti cs The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of tofaciti nib ischaracteri zed by rapid absorption, rapid elimination (terminal half -life of ~3 hours) and dose proportional PK. Co- administration with a high fat meal incre ased the tofacitinib AUC by 14% and decreased Cmaxby26%; no dosage adjustments or meal restric tions during chronic dosing are warranted. T he clearan ce mechanisms f ortofacitinib in humans appear to be both non -renal and renal excretion of the parent dru g, the former accounting for approximately 2/3 of the total clearance. The metabolism of tofaci tinib appears to be primaril y mediated b y Cytochrome P4 50 enzy me 3A4 ( CYP3A4) with minor contribution from CYP2C19 as suggested b y data from poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. ThePKoftofacitinib issimilar between Caucasians andJapanese healt hyvoluntee rs. Invitro studies have shown that tofacitinib does not significantl y inhibit the major drug metabolizing CYPs, indicating a low potential for tofacitinib to incr ease the exposure of other drugs. This was demonstrated in a clinical study wher e tofacitin ib didnot have a n effect on the pharmacokinetics of an ora l dose of midaz olam (a highl y sensitive CYP3A substrate) in health y volunteers. On the other hand, inhib itors and inducers of CYP3A4/5 are"

Co -admin istrationof tofa citinib with fluconazole, a mode rately potent inhibitor o fCYP3A4 and a potent inhibitor of CYP2C19, resulted in 79% and 27% increases in the AUC a nd C maxof tofacitin ib, respectivel y. Co-administration of tofacitinib with methotrexate ha d no e ffect on th e PK of tofacitinib and resulted in an approximate 10% de crease in the AUC of methotrexate. The extent of decrease in methotrexate exposure does no t warrant modificat ions to the individualize d dosing of methotrexate. Co- admini stration of tofacitinib with cyclosporine and oral tacrolimu s, moderat e and weak CYP3 A4inhibitors, respectivel y, resulted in increases of 73% and 21% in AUCinf of tofacitinib . In both cases, to facitinib C maxwas decrea sed slightly ; ratio 91%, for tacroli mus and 83% , for cyclosporine. Consistent with the ~30% cont ribution of renal clearan ceto the total clearance of tofacitinib, mean exposure in end stage renal disease (ESRD) subjects (on a non-dial ysis day ) was approxim ately 40% higher compared with histo rical healt hy subject data. In contrast, in a separate stud y, mean ex posure was appr oximately 125% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment compared with healthy subje cts. Mild and moder ate renal impaired subjec ts had 37% and 43% higher exposure, respectivel y, compared with healthy subjects. Based onthese data, subjects with estimatedcreatinine clearance <40mL/min willbe excluded from thisstudy aswillconcomitant useofmoderate topotent inhibitors of CYP3 A4/5 . Further clinical pharmacology background information on t ofacitinib can be found in the current version of the Inv estigator’s Brochure. 1.2.5. Drug Development andStudy Rationale The effects of tofacitinib on cytokines (including the cross over to JAK1 wh ich may result in some attenuation o f signaling by additional cy tokines, such as IL -6 and IFN -γ)that are integral to ly mphocy te activation, proliferation, and function and inhibition of their signaling may thus result in suppressi on of multiple aspects of the immune response. Cy tokines IL -17, IL-21 and IL -23 have bee n implicated in AS pathology and antibodie s to IL- 17 have demonstrated efficacy in AS.3 This forms t he basis of the rati onale to investigate the effect of tofacitinib in active AS. Anky losing Spondy litis as a chronic inflammatory disease sha res many characteristics w ith RA and PsA such as inflammation and bone erosions. The axial inflamma tion that is sp ecific to AS, is the inflammation in the spin e. This can lead to bone erosions, new bone formatio n and ank ylosis of the spine. In addition, RA, PsA, and AS share man y similar circulating pro inflammatory cytokines, including IL -6, IL -17, IL-23, TNF -andTNF-.45 Increased concentrations of IL -6 have been observed i n patients with chronic inflamma tory conditions such AS.45-48"

Approximately 200 subje cts (~50 per arm) were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 4 treatment sequences for a total of 12 weeks of treatment. At Week 12 the primary endpoint E maxmodel ASAS20 response rates for the tofacitinib 2 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID treatment groups and placebo treatment group were 56.0%, 63.0%, 67.4% and 40.1%, respectivel y. The tofac itinib 5 mg and 10 mg BID treatment groups ha d numericall y greater ASAS20 response rates than the placebo treated group at Week 12, and great er mean improvement from Baseline in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of disease score, total back pain, inflammatio nscore, and nocturnal spinal pain than the p lacebo group. There was statistically significant gr eater impro vement in ASAS40 rates, ASDAS CRPvalues, ASDAS CRP clinic ally important improvement, improvement in mean BASDAI values, and BASDAI50 response rate a tWeek 12 for all tofacitinib treatment groups compared to the placebo. Secondary endpoints such as BASDAI50 and Bath Anky losing Spondy litisFunctional Index (BASFI ), as well as patient -reported outcomes such as AS Quality of Life (ASQoL ) were also met. E fficacy was also de monstrated through objective measures such as the Spondy loarthritis Research C onsortium o f Canada (SPARCC) MRI index of d isease activity scores. There was statistically significant greater improvement from Baseline for LS mean SPARCC M RI index of disease activity score of the SI joints compared to placebo for the tofacitinib 5 mg B ID and 10 m g BID treatment groups. There w as also statistically significant greater improvement from Baseline for L S mean SPARCC MRI index of disease activit yscore of the spine compared to placebo for the tofacitinib 2 mg BID, 5 mg BID and 10mg BID trea tment group s, with the 5 and 10 mg doses sh owing statistical signif icance. The safet y profiles for both the tofacitinib treated and placebo treated groups we re similar. The tot ality of these results forms the basis of our decision to move to Phase 3. 1.2.6. DoseSelection Rationale Tofacitinib 5 mg BID willbeevaluated inthis Phase 3study inAS. Tofacitinib doses of 5 and 10 mg BID were demonstrated to be efficac ious in RA and PsA subjects in those respecti ve clinical development programs. The primary endpoi nt Emax model anal ysis estimated an ASAS20 response rate of 63.0% a fter tofacitinib 5 mg BID, a 22.9% rate higher than placebo. Supportive normal approximati on analy sis demonstr ated an ASAS20 response r ate after tofacitinib 5 mg BID significantl y higher t han placebo (80.8% vs41.2%; p<0.001); tofacitinib 2 mg and 10 mg B ID demonstrated greater response rate than placebo but were not significant (51.9% and 55.8%, respectivel y). A consistent magnitude of efficacy was not observed after the lowest dose (2 mg BID) of tofacitinib, especiall y with more objective endpoints such as MRI . Compared to 5 mg BID, the 10 mg tofacitinib dose did not demonstrate consistent o rclinically meaning ful additional improvemen ts in efficacy across study endpoints. No new safet yconcerns w ere identified in the Phase 2 AS study at any dose of tofacitinib."

Selected assessments dur ing the stu dy will need to be completed by a qualified blinded assessor. This blinded assessor should be blinded to subject’s baseline treatment assignment, all previously completed efficacy assessments (including patient’s global assessment) and all safety data (eg, laboratory results, adverse ev ents) in order that the current assessments are completed in an objective manner throughout the study . Amendment 3 All subjects in the study will be evaluated f or risk factors for VTE50. The st udy investigator o r designee will need to review each subject’s med ical history and study records, including their concomitant medica tions, to determine whether he/she is at high risk for developing VTE. A subject may be at high ri sk for VTE if he/she: •has heart failure or prior my ocardial infarct ion within past 3 months; •has inherited coag ulation disorders; •has had VTE, either deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism; •is taki ng combined hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement thera py; •has a malignancy (asso ciation is strongest with cancers other than non - melanoma skin cancers); •is undergoing major surgery or is immobilized. Additional ri sk factors for VTE, such as age, diabetes, obesity (BM I≥30 kg/m2), smoking status, hy pertension, and first de gree famil y history of VT E should also be t aken into consideration b y the investigator and the sponsor medical monitor when evaluating the benefit:risk for each individual subject whether to discontinue from open- label 5 mg BID dose of tofacit inib.

For this study , the investigational prod ucts are tofacitini b and placebo. 5.1.Allocation toTreatment Alloc ation of subjects to treatment g roups will proceed throug h the use of an interactive response t echnolo gy (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [ IWR]). The site personnel (stud y coordin ator or specified d esignee) will be required to enter or select informat ion including but not li mited to the user’s identification (ID ) and password, the protocol num ber, patient population (bDMARD -naïve or TN Fi-IRorbDMARD use [non-IR]) and the subject n umber. The site pe rsonnel will then be provided with a treatmen t assign ment, randomization numb er, and dispensable unit (DU) or conta iner number when investig ational product is being supplied via the IRT sy stem. TheIRT s ystem wi llprovide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation repor t must be sto red in the site’s f iles. The s tudy-specif ic IRT reference manual will pro vide t hecontact infor mation and further detail s on the use of the IRT sy stem. Subjects willbe randomized attheBase linevisit ina1:1ratiotoone of thefollowing two parallel blinded treatment sequen ces for a total of 16 weeks of treatment. Eligibl e subj ects will be tre ated with one of the two sequences for 16 weeks followed by treatment with tofacitinib 5 mg BID f or an additional 32 week s."

During the fe asibility phase of clinic al trial preparatio n, the sponsor conducted a survey of the countries and sites likely to partic ipate in the study. Whil e there was c ountry-to-country variabi lity, the overall proportion of bDMARD -naïve and T NFi-IRor bDMARD use ( non-IR) was approximately 80%/20% respective ly. The clinical trial was thus designed to reflect this prevalence. Subjec ts with more than 2 TNFi failures were excluded due to th e high er like lihood that they could be refractory to tof acitin ibtherap y, an o bservation noted in other tofacitinib trials in RA and PsA. At the end of the 16 wee k doub le-blinded treat ment period, all subjects will be assigned t o open -label tofacitinib 5 mg BID to Week 48.

The me thod will be an electroni c process. B linding codes shoul d be broken o nly in exce ptional circumstances when knowl edge o f the actual tre atment code is absolutely essential for furt her management of the subject. Investigators are enc ouraged to discuss with a member of the study team if they belie ve that unblindin g is n ecessar y.

Subject Compliance Subjec t compli ance with dosing administration will be verified by accounting ofreturned contai ners a nd inve stigational product at each visit. Complia nce fo r the tablets wi llbe calculated b y each bottle and document ed. If compliance is <80%, the investigator or desig nee is to counsel the su bject and ensure steps ar e taken to im prove compliance. Subjec ts, who are less t han 80% compliant with the dosag e regi men for any two consecutive visit periods , should be withdrawn from the investigational product. In the event th at the investigational p roduct is held due to an AE, infection orelective surger y, in accorda nce with the protocol -specified time frames, comp liance should st ill be calculated for the visit period, but withdrawal from the investigational product w ould be assessed. If the subjec t is over-compliant with the investiga tional product (int ention al or a ccidental) the investigator or designee is to couns el the subject and ensure correct under standing of the investigational product dosing regimen. The investigato r should contact the Pfi zer Medical Monitor or designee prompt lywith any over -complian ce (>12 0%) that ma y potentially impact the safe use of t heinvestigational product or that may result in a serious a dverse event. 5.4.Investigational Product Supplie s 5.4.1.

Theinvestigational pr oduct will be packaged a nd labeled in such a manner that the subject and study staff will be unable to determine from the dispensed packaging to which treatment arm the subjec t is assigned during the double -blind treatment p eriod. At st udyvisits sufficie nt inv estigat ional product will be dispensed to complete dosing until the next scheduled visit. The am ount of investigati onal product dispensed at each visit must be recorded . At study visits the subject must return all in vestigational product and the amount of inves tigational product returned will be recorde d to a cc ount for all d ispensed investigational product. 5.5.Administra tion Investigational product willbe dispensed tosubjects toself-administer after appropriate traini ngandspecif icinstructions areprovided. Instructions on dosing will be provided on the Subject Dosing Card. At all visits ,thescheduled dose of inve stigational product will be taken bythesubjectintheclinic. At the end o f each visit, sites will instruct subj ects, when to take their investi gational pr oduct prior to their next study visit. Subj ects sho uld receive open -label i nvestigational product at the Week 16 visit and should receive the fir st dose of the open -label investigational p roduct at the clinic . Tofacitinib tablets or ma tching placebo for oral administration may be taken with or with out food. Subjects will swallow the investigational product whole, and w ill not manipula te or chew th e investiga tional product prior to swallowi ng.

During the double- blind t reatment period, if the investigator deems it necessary to withh old the investigational product to treat a non -serious in fection or ot hermedical condition, temporary withholdin g is permitted for up to 5 days. If temporary withhol ding of the investigation al product exceeding 5 days is required for a medical reason (eg , electi ve surgery ), the investi gator must contact the Pf izer Medical Monitor for approva l. Temporary withholding of the investigational product, as de scribed above, i s permitted once during t he stud y without ob taining prior approval from the Pfizer Medica l Monito r. Any additional reque st(s) for temporary withh olding of the investigational pr oduct during the double blind period require(s) documented app roval by the Pfi zer Medical Monitor.

Investigation al Product Storage The investiga tor or an a pproved representative, eg, pharm acist, will ensure that all investigational products are sto red in asecured area w ith controlled a ccess under required storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulat oryrequirements. Investig ationa l products should be stored in their origina l cont ainers and in a ccordance with the labels. Any stora gecond itions stated in the Investigator’ s Brochure will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the product lab el. Site sy stems mus t be c apable of measuri ng and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimu m, daily minimum and maximum temper atures forall site stora ge locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products). Thisshould be captu red fr om the time of in vestigational product receipt thr oughou t the study . Evenfor continuous- monitoring sy stems , a log orsite procedure that ensures ac tive evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that theminimum and max imum tempera ture is che cked each business day to confirm that no excursion oc curred since the last evaluation and toprovidethe site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- working day s upon ret urnto normal operat ions. The o peration of the temperature monitoring devic e and storage unit (f orexample, refrigerator), as applicabl e, should be regularl y inspected to ens ure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be rep orted to Pf izer upon discovery . The site sh ould a ctively pursue opt ions for returning the product to the stora ge conditions de scribed in the l abeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, includin g any actions taken, must be doc umented and reported to Pfizer. Once an exc ursion is identified, th e investigational product must be quarant ined and not used until Pfizer pro vides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfi zer approves the use of the investigational produc t afte r the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational pr oduct prior to Pfi zer approval wil l be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for ea ch exc ursion will be provided to the site.

In order for this calculation to be completed, the investigator is responsible to ensure completeness of the PROs an d appropriately conduct the assessments that comp rise thi s endpoint. ASAS20 and ASAS40 assess 4 domains: the “Patient Global Assessment of Disease”, Spinal Pain (total back pain), Function (BASFI) and Inflammation (from the BASDAI). ASAS20 improvement is defined as 20% a nd 1 unit in at least 3 domains on a sc ale of 0- 10 and no worsening of 20% and 1unitin the rema ining domain. ASAS40 improvement criteria are"

ASAS 5/6 assesses 6 domains: the domains as noted in the ASAS20 and 40, CRP and Spinal mobility , specificall y lateral spinal flexion (from the BASMI). Improvement is define d as 20% in at least 5 domains. ASAS partial remissi on is based on th e same 4 ASAS domains noted above. Part ial remission is defined as a response if a scor e of 2 or le ss (on a scale of 0 -10) for each of the 4domains. 7.2.2. Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease ActivityScore (ASDAS CRP) The ASDASCRP end point is derive d from several pa tient reported outcomes and CRP which will be calculated b y the sponsor. I n order for t his calculation to be completed, the investigator is responsible to ensure completeness of the PROs and appropriately conduct the assess ments that comp rise this endpoin t. Following is the formula use d for calculating the ASDASCRP .53 ASDAS CRP= 0.121 × Back Pain + 0.058 × Duration ofMorning Stiffness + 0.110 × Patient Global +0.073 ×Peripher alPain/Swellin g +0.579×Ln(CRP mg/L+1).52 Question 2 oftheBASDAI provide sthedata forBack Pain, Question 6 oftheBASDAI provides thedata forDuration ofMorning Stiffness, thescore from thePatient Globa l Assessment ofDisease isutilized forthePatient Global andQuestion 3 oftheBASDAI contributes thedata forPeriphe ralPain/Swe lling.

Constricting clothing should beremoved toensure thesubject canadeq uately move forthe examinations andvisualization of anatomical positions where necessary . 7.2.5.1. Latera lSpinal Flexion The subject should st and upright and the subject’s he ad and back should rest against the wall as close as possible with shoulders level and feet 30 cm apart and feet parallel. There should be no flexion in the knees, no bending forward. Subject’s hands should be resting on h is/her lateral thighs. At the t ip of the middle finger, place a mark on the thigh. This is the neutral position mark. Measure and record the neutral position. Have the subject bend sideway s without bending knees or lifting heels while attempting to kee pthe shoulders in the same position (flexion position). Place a second mark and record the lateral flexion (left or ri ght as appro priate) using a centimeter tape measure. Measure and record two tries for the left an d two tries for the right. The results of the two tr ies are recorded for left and right separatel y in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm. The difference between the n eutral posit ion and the lateral flexion for each side will be calculated by the sponsor and the be tter of two tries will be used in the analysis of the data. Alternativ ely, measure the distance betwee n the subject’s middle fingertip and the floor before (t his is the neutral position) and after bending sideways. Record the neutral position in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm. Measure and record t wo tries for the left and two tr ies for the right. The results of the t wo tries are recorded for the left and right sep arately in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm. The difference between the neutral position and the lateral flexion for each site will be calculate d by the sponsor and the better of two tries will be used in th e anal ysis.

Maximal Intermalleolar Distance The subject should lie supine with the knees straight and feet/toes pointing s traight up. The subject is asked to s eparate the leg s as far as possi ble and the distance between the medial malleoli is measured (in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm). Measure and record two tries on the appropriate eCRF. 7.2.5.5. Cervical Rotation Subject should be sit ting straight on a chair with chin lev el and hands on their knees. Th e qualified blinded assessor pla ces a goniometer at the top of the head in line with the nose. The qualified blinded assessor asks the subject to rotate the neck maximally to the left, follows with the goniometer and records the angle between the sagittal plane and the new plane after r otation. Ensure the subject keeps shoulders still and n o neck or shoulder flexion occurs. A second reading is obtained and the both of the readings are recorded. The procedure is repeated f or the right si de and the both o f the readings are recorded for the righ t side. The better of the two for each side is selected for scoring. Scoring is done by calculating the mean of the left and right measurement a nd is recorded in degrees (0-90). 7.2.6. SpinalMobility: Chest Expansion This assessment is performed by the qualif ied blinded assessor. It is recommended that the same quali fied personnel be used for each visit. Spinal Mobility includes the measures collecte d in the BASMI and Chest Expansion. F or collecting c hest expansion the subject should have their hand s rest on or behind the head. With the subject standing and at maximal inspiration, measure the chest circumference at nipple line or at the 4th intercos tal space (in cm to the nearest 0.1 cm) anteriorl y. Re-measure the chest circumference at maximal expiration. The difference between maximal inspiration and expiration of the two attempts will be obtained and recorded. The better of the two attempts wil l be utilized for data reporting. 7.2.7.

These re quirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of events: (1) SAEs; (2)non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) e xposure to the investig ational product under study during pregna ncy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfi zer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll(regardless of whether associated with an AE), except occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy , exposure via breastfeedin g, occupational exposur e (regardless of whether associated with an AE) All observed or volunteered ev ents regardless of t reatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigat ional product(s) will be reporte d as described in the following paragraphs. Events listed i n the table above that requir e reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Even t (CT S AE) Report Form with in 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be re ported regardless of whether the eve nt is determined by the investigator to be related t o an investi gational product under study . In parti cular, if t he SAE is fatal or life -threa tening, notification to Pfizer Safet y must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event inf ormation. This time fr ame also applies to additiona l new (follow- up) information on previously forward ed reports. In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediatel y aware of the occurrence of an ev ent, the investigator must report th e event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the ti me of his/her first awareness of the ev ent. For ea ch event, theinvestigator mu st purs ue and obtain adequate information bot h to determine the outcome and t o assess whether it meets the criter ia for classification a s an SAE (see the Seriou s Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigat or may be requested b y Pfizer Safety t o obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded o n the CRF . In general, this will include a descrip tion of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to"

I n the case of a subjec t death, a summary of avail able autopsy findings must be submitte d as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional in formation must be repor ted on the CT SAE Report Form ; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, labor atory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted by the sponsor, any non- serious AE that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the deter mination of caseseriousness, furthe r information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clin ical study . 8.1.1. Additional Detail s on Recordi ng Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed i n the tab le above will be rec orded o n the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t shoul d be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same da ta are collected, the forms must be completed in a consiste nt manner. AEs shou ld be r ecorded using concise medical terminol ogy and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT S AE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adver se Event Information The investigator i s to record on the C RF a ll directly obse rved AE s and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y subject. In additio n, each study subject will be questi oned about the occurren ce of AEs in a non- leading ma nner. 8.1.3. Withdr awal due to Adverse Events (see also th e Subje ctsDiscontinuation from the Investigationa l Product section) Withdr awal due to AEs should be distinguis hed from withdrawal due to other causes, accor ding t o the defini tion o f AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the in vestigational product because of an SA E, the SAE must be recorded on the eCRF and reported, as appropriate , on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance wit h the Requ irements section above. Subjects that are wit hdrawn due to an AE will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow -up pr ocedures. The onl y exc eption to this is when a subject specific ally withdraws consent for an y further contact with him or her or persons previ ously authorized by the subject to provide this information. In this case, n o further evaluation should be perfo rmed, and no additional data should be collect ed. The sponsor may retainand continue to use an y data collected b efore suc h withdrawal of cons ent. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Inform ation The time period for active ly eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collectio n period”) for each subject b egins from t he tim e the subject provides informed consent, whi ch is obt ained before the sub ject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any"

For subjects w ho are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a sub ject during the ac tive c ollection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the in vestigator becomes awar e of them; at a minimum , all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to inv estigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active c ollection period and until the event or i ts seq uelae resolve or stabilize at a level accept able to t he investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recordi ng Non -serious AEs and SAEs on t he CRF During the active collection period, both non- seriou s AEs and SAEs are reco rded o n the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the even t or its sequelae re solve o r stabilize at a level acceptable to t he investigator, and Pfizer conc urs with that assessment. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investig ator’s assessment of ca usalit y must be pr ovided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investiga tor must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report su ch an assessment in accordance w ith the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessme nt is the de terminati on of whether there exists a reasonable possibilit y that the investiga tional product caused or contributed to an AE ; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal re lationship should be pr ovided. If the investi gator does not know whet heror not the investigational product cause d the eve nt, then the event w ill be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes , as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causali ty assessment is “unkno wn but not related ” to i nvestigational product, this should be clear ly docume nted on study records. In addition, if the investigator determin es that an SAE is associated wit h study procedures, the investigator must record this causa l relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedica ted secti on of the CT SAE Rep ort For m and in accordance with the SAE repor ting requirements."

Adverse Events An AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence i n a study subject administered a pro duct or medical device; the event need not nec essari ly have a ca usal r elationship with the treatment or usage. Ex amples of AEs include, but ar e not l imited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and s ymptoms; Changes in ph ysical examina tion findings; Hypersen sitivity ; Progression/w orseni ng of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additi onally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via bre astfee ding; Medica tion e rror; Occupational exposure."

Abnormal Test F indings Abnormal objective te st find ings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions ar e met: Test result is associated wi th accompan ying symptom s; and/or Test result r equire s additional diagn ostic testing or medical/surgical interventi on; and/or Test result leads to a ch ange in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the inve stigational product, si gnificant additional co ncomit ant drug tre atment , or other therapy ; and/or Test result is co nsidered to be an AE by the i nvestig ator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an a bnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does no t constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that i s determined to be anerror does not require recording as an A E. 8.2.3. Seriou s Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at an y dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening ( immediate risk of death ); Requires inpatient h ospita lization or prolongat ion of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disabil ity/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct norma l life functions); Results in congen ital anomaly /birth defe ct. Or that is considered to be: An impor tant m edical event. Medical and scientific judgmen t is exer cised in determining whethe r an event is an important medical eve nt. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in de ath or hospitalization. Howe ver, if it i s dete rmined that the event may jeopardize the subject or m ay require intervent ion to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event shou ld be reported as serious. Examples of such events are inte nsive treatment in an e mergen cy room or a t home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not r esult in hospitalization; or development of d rug dependency or drug abuse."

Approp riate laboratory invest igations, including but not l imited tocultures should beperformed toestablish theetiolo gyofany serious infection. All ad verse events, including serious advers e events, should be reported as described in Section 8on A dverse Event Reporting. 8.2.6. Hospitalization Hosp italization is defined as an yinitia l admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent heal thcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer wit hin th e hospital to an acute/intensive care unit ( eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a m edical floor, medical floor to a coron ary care unit, or neurological f loor to a tuberculosis unit). An em ergency room visit does not necessaril y consti tute a hospitaliza tion; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for me dical i mportance. Hospitalization does not in clude the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, careg iver relief); Skilled n ursing facilities; Nursi ng homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/ same -day/ambulatory procedure s). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospit alization in the absence of a pr ecipitating clinical AE is not in it self an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatm ent of a pre existing condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a wo rsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreat ment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep) ; Admi nistrative a dmissi on (eg, for yearly physical examination);"

These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the e ntire protocol and/or for the indivi dual subject. Diagnosti c and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive proc edures, such as surgery , should not be repor ted as SA Es. However, the me dical c ondition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if i t meets the definition of an SAE. F or example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporti ng per iodshould be reported if the SAE requirements are me t, and the resulting append ectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. Severity Assessment If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator wil l use the adjectives MI LD, MODERATE, or S EVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For pur poses of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as follo ws: MILD Does not interfere wit h subject's usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some ex tent with subject's usu al fun ction. SEVE RE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual f unction. Note the distincti on betw een the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significant ly with the subjec t's us ualfunction) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.3.Special Situations 8.3.1. Protocol -Specified S erious Adverse Events There are no p rotocol -specified SAEs in this study . All SAE s will be reported to Pf izer Safety by the investigator as described in previ ous sections, and wi ll be h andled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.3.2.

These subjects fai l to a dapt and the refore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and seriou s liver i njury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a trans aminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequentl y to d etermine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible .” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotr ansferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) eleva tions (>2 × ULN) by several days or weeks . The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AS T/ALT is/ are still elevated above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values wi ll be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevation s are detected, AST/ALT value s might have decre ased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potenti al DILI. Therefore, abnorm al elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are consider ed potential DILI (asse ssed per Hy ’s law crite ria) c ases and sho uld al ways be considered important medical events, even bef ore all other possible caus es of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject ’s individual baseline values and underl ying co nditions. Subjects who present with the following la boratory abnormaliti es should be evaluated further as potential D ILI (H y’s law) cases to definiti vely determine the etiology of the a bnormal laboratory valu es: Subjects with AST/A LT andTBili basel ine va lues within the normal range who subsequentl y present with AST OR AL T val ues >3 × ULN AND a TBili value >2×ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For s ubjects with baseline A ST OR ALT ORTBili value s above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definitio n menti oned above, as needed, depending on wh ich values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT bas eline values above the normal range: AST or AL T values >2 times the ba seline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whi chever is smaller). Preexisti ng valu es of TBili above the normal range: TB ili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reaches >3 × ULN (whiche ver is smaller). Rises in A ST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed indivi dually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potent ial Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor."

In addition, the investigato r must submit informati on regarding environmen tal ex posure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports t hat she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product b y inhalation or spillage) to Pfi zer Safety using the EDP supplementa l form. This must be d one irrespective of whe ther a n AE has occ urred and within 24 hours of awareness of the expo sure. The information submit ted should include the anticipated date of de livery (see below for informatio n related to termination of pregnanc y). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general i nforma tion on the pregna ncyand its outcome for all EDP reports with an unkno wn outcome.

Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE pa ge. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately. Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and non-serious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE . 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data col lected in this trial are given here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained by Pfizer. This analysis plan may modify what is outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition or its analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Sample Size Determination The primary efficacy analysis is to compare the ASAS20 response r ate at Week 16 of the tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo via the normal approximation f or the difference in binomial proportions. Assuming a placebo response rate of 40% f or ASAS20 response at Week 16, a sample size of 120 per arm will yield about 89% power to detect a difference of at least 20% between tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo at a two-sid ed significance level of 5%. In the Phase 2 proof of concept trial A3921119, ASAS20 resp onse rates at Week 12 were 63% and 40% for tofacitinib 5 mg BID and placebo, respectiv ely. 9.2. Efficacy Analysis There will be a total of 2 planned analyses conducted when all a pplicable subjects have completed their Week 16 and Week 48 (including follow-up) visits, respectively. The investigators, subjects and sponsor study team will remain blin ded to the first 16 weeks of treatment assignment through the entire duration of the trial un til database release at Week 48. The first analysis (Week 16 analysis) will include all eff icacy data through Week 16 and the safety data through the data cutoff date. As the primary endpoint (ASAS20), the key secondary endpoint (ASAS40) and the other Type I error controlled secondary endpoints are at Week 16, there will be no additional ad justment made for Type I error rate at the final analysis at Week 48. The efficacy analys is results through Week 16 obtained from the Week 16 analysis will be considered final and d efinitive. CCI"
106,page_106,"Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) A3921120 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 03 April 2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 107 The Week 48 analysis will be conducted when all the applicable sub jects have completed their Week 48 (including follow-up) visit and the database is rel eased. All the Week 48 analysis results will be secondary in nature. The Week 48 analy sis will contain results for earlier visits prior to or at Week 16 including those for the pri mary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint; however they will serve as a sensitivity ana lysis only to ensure there are no major changes to the definitive results for the primary endp oint and the key secondary endpoint obtained at the Week 16 analysis. 9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint The ASAS20 response rate at Week 16 is the primary efficacy end point in this trial. The analysis of primary endpoint will be based on the full analysis set, which includes all randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of investigational product. For the primary analysis, the normal approximation for the difference in binomi al proportions adjusting for the stratification factor (ie, prior treatment history: bDMARD- naïve vs TNFi-IR) at randomization via the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel approach will be used to estimate the treatment effect (treatment difference, standard error, 95% con fidence interval) and to test (Normal Z-test) test the superiority of tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placebo and to generate confidence interval for the difference. Missing values for any reason will be handled by setting the ASAS20 value to nonresponsive. Note that this can be viewed as a composite endpoint in the sense that a response requires the subject comp letes a visit of interest eg, Week 16, and achieves a response per the defined ASAS20 respons e criteria (otherwise it is considered a nonresponse). Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess robustness of t he primary analysis due to missing data and will be detailed in the SAP. 9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary and Other Endpoints Methods for the analysis of secondary endpoints and other endpo ints will be enumerated in the SAP. Briefly, binary variables will follow the analyses us ing the normal approximation to estimating binomial proportions as described for the ASAS20 and continuous endpoints will be analyzed as change from baseline as appropriate with a m ixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) that include fixed effects of treatment group, visit, and treatment-group by visit interaction, stratification factor (ie, prior treatmen t history: bDMARD-naïve vs TNFi-IR) at randomization, and baseline value. An unstructured variance covariance matrix will be used, provided the model converges, otherwise an altern ative covariance structure will be attempted. Descriptive statistics may also be calculat ed and displayed. 9.2.3. Control for Type I Error Rate This protocol is designed to establish the superiority of tofac itinib 5 mg BID to placebo for the treatment of active AS based on the primary endpoint of ASA S20 at Week 16 in subjects who have had an inadequate response to previous treatments.CCI"

Type I error will be controlled at 2 -sided 5% or equivalentl y 1-sided 2.5%. For the pri mary endpoint of ASAS20 at Week 16, if the 2 -sided p value is 5%, the superiori ty of tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placeb o will be declared f or this primary endpoint and theprimary objectiveof this study is met.Hy pothesis testing wil l continue to the global family of select set of secondary endpoints state d below ( Global Type I Error Control (for the primary endpoint and a select set of secondary endpoints)) . For e ach of t he endpoints within this family , superiority of tofacitinib 5 mg BID to placebo will be declared i f statistical significance is achieved under the step- down testing pro cedure. In addition, three other fa milies of hy potheses , ASAS family endpoints (Type I Error Control f or Endpoints in the ASAS Family ), ASAS20’s earl ier time points ( Type I Er ror Control for ASAS20 at Earlier Time Points) a nd ASAS40’s earlier time points ( Type I Error Control for ASAS40 at Earlier Time Points) will also be tested. F or each of the endpoint s or time points of ASAS20/ASAS40, superiority of tofaci tinib 5 mg BID to placebo w ill be declared if statistical signifi cance is achieved under its resp ective step -down testing procedure. Global Type I Error Control (for the primary endpoin t and a sele ct set of secondary endpoints): The family -wise Ty pe I error rate will be controlled at the 2-sided 5% (or equivalently 1-sided 2.5%) significance level usi ng a step -down testing procedure for the primary endpoin t of ASAS20, the key secondary e ndpoint of A SAS40 and a select set of secondary endpoints at W eek 16 te sted in the seque nce below: ASAS20, ASAS40, change from baseline in ASDAS CRP, change from baseline in hsCRP, change from baseline in ASQoL , change from baseline in SF -36v2 Phy sical Com ponent Summa ry (PCS), change from baseline in BASMI, and chang e from ba seline in the FAC IT-F Total score . When an endpoint fails to dec lare statistical significance, this endpoint and the remaining endpo ints lower in the hi erarch y will be consider ed non-s ignificant. The rationale for the selection and ordering of t he select set of secondary endpoints are clinical importance, precedence and likelihood of statistical suc cess based on the results of the A39 21119 study. Type I Error Control for Endpoi nts in t he ASAS Fami ly:∆ in Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of diseas e, change from baseline in total bac k pain, ∆BASFI, and change from baseline in in inflammation ( average of questions 5 and 6 of BASDAI) are the 4 ASAS components used in deriving ASAS20, thus t hey are conside red belonging to the ASAS family of endpoints. A step-down testing procedure will be applied to them and tested in the sequence below: ASAS20, change from baseline in PGA, change from base line in total back pain, change from baselin e in BAS FI, and chan ge from baseline in inflammation ( average of quest ions 5 and 6 of BASDAI) at Week 16. When an endpoint fails to declare statistical significance, this endpoint and the remaining endpoints low er in the hierarchy will be considered non -significa nt. Though thi s testing scheme does not protect the Ty pe I er ror for the family of all possible comparisons, it will provide Ty pe I error protection for testing the family of ASAS endpoints.

Though this testing scheme does not protect the Ty pe I error fo r the famil y ofall possible comparisons, it will provide Ty peI error protection for testing the family of ASAS40 time points. 9.3.Safety Analysis Allthesafety data willbesummarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistic s,andgraph icalpresentations: Incidence andseverity ofadve rseevent s; Categorical summary ofabsolute vital signs andvital sign changes compared to baseline bysubject; Serious infections, defined as an yinfection (viral, bacterial, andfungal )requiring hospital izationorparenteral antimicrobials, willbesumm arized; Anysafety events thattrigger withdrawal of asubject; Safety laboratory tests willbesummarized according toPfizer standards.

Members of these safet y even t adjudication committees will be blinded to treat ment assignment in order to allow for unbiased assessments. These committees include a Cardiovascular Endpoint Adjudication Committee (CV EAC ), Opportunistic Infection review Committee (OIRC), Malignancy Adjudication Committee (MAC), Hepatic Event Review Committee (HERC) and Gastrointestinal Perforation Review Committee (GIPRC). In addition to these external committees, an internal committee o f medically trained qualified Pfizer personn el with expertise in the assessment and diagnosis of respiratory disea se will r eview and categorize potential events of interstitial lung disease (Interstitial L ung Disease Review Committee, ILDRC). Further information about these committees can be found in their respective cha rters, including specific descriptions of the s cope of t heir responsibilities and the process and definitions to review and assess specific safet y events. Additional safet y event adjudicati on review committees may be established as considere d appropriat e.As described above, individual committee chart ers will provide specific descriptions of the scope of the responsibilities and the processes and definitions used to review and assess specific safet y events. In addition to the event adjudicat ion or revie w committees described above, all biopsies of potentially malignant tumors, suspicious ly mphadenopathy , or possible extranodal lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD), should be submitted to the ce ntral laboratory for review by the central laborator y pathologists .

Case Repor t Forms/El ectronic Dat a Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF sh ould be u nderstood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be com pleted for each includ ed subject. The completed original CRFs are the s ole prope rty of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appro priate regulatory authorities, without wri tten permi ssion from Pf izer. The investigator shall ensure that the CRF s are sec urely stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room t o prevent access b y unauthorized third parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection an d reporti ng of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuri ng that they are accurate, authentic/original, attri butable, com plete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneou s), endur ing, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entries m adein the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initiale d, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or t he ph ysician subject chart. In these cases, data collected on t he CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfiz er that clearl y identifies those data that will be r ecorded on t he CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the so urce docu ment. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all part icipating subje cts (sufficient information to link records, eg , CRFs an d hospital records), all original signed informed consent/assent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source docume nts, and detailed records of treatment dis position, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, mee ting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, accor ding to local regulations, or as specified in the cl inical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The invest igator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are retained. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study recor ds for the required pe riod (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should b e prospec tively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another ins titution, or an independent third party arranged b y Pfizer."

The investigator must obt ain Pfizer's written permission before dis posing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12.ETH ICS 12.1. Insti tutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protoco l, protocol amendments, informed consent d ocuments, and other re levant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applic able, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an a mendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approva l is wher e the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the I RB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the im plementation. 12.2.
