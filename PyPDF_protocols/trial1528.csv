Amendment 2 (21January 2021) The overall rationale of the protocol am endment: The overall rationale of the protocol amendment is to change the first key secondary endpoint to a clinically meaningful endpoint for evaluating the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms by intranasal esketamine. Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: The first key secondary endpoint is being changed to aclinically meaningful endpoint for evaluating the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms by intranasal esketamine . The current key secondary endpoint is being changed to an “Other Secondary Endpoint”. Corresponding updates are being made to key secondary and other secondary objectives. Synopsis Objectives and Endpoints; 2.1.Objectives and EndpointsKey Secondary Objectives The key secondary objectives are to assess the effect of intranasal esketamine plus a new ly initiated oral antidepressant compared w ith a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo on the following parameters in adult subjects with TRD: Change from baseline in the MADRS tota l score at 24 hours post first dose Other Secondary Objectives To assess the effect of intranasal esketamine plus a ne wly initiated oral antidepressant compared with a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo on the following parameters in adult subjects with TRD: Onset of clinical response by Day 2 Secondary Endpoints MADRS: The first key secondary endpoint is the change from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours post first dose in depressive symptoms, as measured by the MADRS total score. Other Secondary Endpoints Proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response ( ≥50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score) by Day 2 that is maintained through the end of the 4-week double- blind treatment phase with o ne excursion allowed."

Efficacy MeasuresMADRS In addition to the primary efficacy measure, the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1, prior to randomization) to 24 hours post dose (Day 2) w ill be included as a key secondary efficacy endpoint to evaluate rapid reduction of depressive symptoms. MADRS will also be used to evaluate a secondary objective assessing the onset of clinical response (ie, antidepressant effect) by Day 2 that is maintained for the duration of the double- blind treatment phase. Onset of clinical response is defined as ≥50% improvement in MADRS total score by Day 2 (ie, the day after taking the first dose of double -blind intranasal medication) that is maintained through the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase with one excursion allowed. Additionally, MADRS will be used to evaluate a secondary objective assessing the proportion of subjects in remission (MADRS total score ≤12) at the end of the 4-week double- blind treatment phase; and the proportion who remain in remission (MADRS total s core ≤12) through to the end of the follow -up phase. 9.2.1.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Evaluation Montgomery- Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score The MADRS will also be administered using a modified recall period of 24 hours for the key secondary efficacy evaluation related to change from baseline to 24 hours. Synopsis Statistical Methods: Efficacy Analyses; 11.3. Efficacy AnalysesSecondary Endpoints For the analysis of the first of the two key secondary efficacy endpoints, change from baseline in MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose (Day 2), will be analyzed using the same model described above for the MADRS total score at Week 4 in the double -blind treatment phase. To strongly control Type I error across the primary and the two key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence approach15,16will be applied to adjust for multiplicity. The hypotheses will be tested sequentially in the following order: Change in MADRS total score at the end of the 4 -week double- blind treatment phase Change in MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose The proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response by Day 2 (in the event that no MADRS was collected on Day 2, a MADRS collected on Day 3 could be used) that is maintained for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase ( ≥50% reduction in MADRS total score by the second day after taking the first dose of double -blind medication that continued through the end of the double- blind phase) i n esketamine arm will be compared w ith the active comparator using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi - square test adjusting for country and class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI).

Rationale: Update to footnote “d” of the Time and Events Schedule (screening/prospective observational phase and double -blind treatment phase) to clarify the MADRS assessment at Visit 2. 1. Time and Events Schedule (screening/prospective observational phase and double- blind treatment phase)Footnote “d” will be updated as follows: Performed forsubject swho require a taper period or who do not require a taper period but their Visit 1.3 and Visit 2.1 occur more than 1 week apart; the result will be considered as the subject’s baseline MADRS for the double -blind treatment phase. For all other subjects, the baseline MADRS for the double -blind treatment phase will be the MADRS performed at t he end of Week -4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Rationale: Minor errors w ere noted Throughout the protocol Minor grammatical, formatting, or spelling changes were made. Amendment 1 (23August 2019 ) The overall rationale ofthe protocol am endment :The overall r ationale of the protocol amendment is to provide updates in line with feedback from investigators and theHuman Genetic Resource Administration Office of China (HGR AO),and to provide overall clarification on procedures , wherever applicable . Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale : Correction to criteri afor recruiting subjects w ith major depressive disorder (MDD) Synopsis Study Population; 3.2.1. Study Population; 4.1. Inclusion Criteri a; 9.1.2. Screening/Prospective Observational PhaseInclusion criteri onNo.2 and associated text revised as follows (strikethrough text deleted): At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, subject must meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders –Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD or single- episode MDD (if single episode MDD, the duration must be ≥2 years) , without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the MINI. Rationale: Clarification that the testing of oral antidepressant levels in blood during the Screening/ Prospective Observation Phase is optional. 4.1.

Exclusion Criteri a Exclusion C riteri onNo. 10 revised as follows (strikethrough text deleted): Subject has clinically significant ECG abnormalities at the start of the s creening/ prospective observat ional p hase or on Day 1 of the double -blind treatm ent p hase prior to randomization, defined as:  During screening, a QT interval corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF): ≥470msec in males and ≥480 msec in females ; if the QTcF is prolonged on the initial ECG, the average QTcF of three ECGs, recorded 4 minutes apart, must not be ≥450 msec.  On Day 1 ( predose), a QT interval corrected according to Fridericia’ s formula (QTcF): ≥470msec in males and ≥480 msec in female s based on the site-evaluated ECG ; if the QTcF is prolonged on the initial ECG, the average QTcF of three ECGs, recorded 4 minutes apart, must not be ≥450 msec . Rationale: Revised to reflect that there is no evidence to date to support the potential for e sketamine to induce liver toxicity, with the cut -off level for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in serum , as evidence of underlying hepatoxicity in subjects at screening, raised from ≥2 times to ≥3 times the upper limit of norm al, and deletion of reference to elevations in bilirubin levels at screening, which are indicative of Gilbert’s disease 4.2. Exclusion Criteri a Exclusion C riterion No. 12 revised as follows (bold text added, strikethrough text deleted): Subject has a history of, or symptoms and signs suggestive of, liver cirrhosis (eg, esophageal varices, ascites, and increased prothrombin time) OR alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) values ≥2x 3x the upper limit of normal or total bilirubin > 1.5 times the ULN in the screening/prospective observational phase. Repeat of screening test for abnormal ALT and AST is permitted once during the screening period provided per investigator discretion and provided there is an alternat ive explanation for the out of range value. For elevations in bilirubin, if in the opinion of the investigator and agreed upon by the sponsor’s medical officer, the elevation in bilirubin is consistent with Gilbert’s disease, the subject may participate i n the study."

MDD is associated with excess mortality, and with years of potential life lost. About 30% of patients fail to achieve remis sion despite treatment with multiple antidepressant medications, and are considered to have treatment -resistant depression (TRD). There is a significant need to develop novel treatments based upon relevant pathophysiologic pathways underlying MDD for the r apid relief of symptoms of depression, especially in patients with TRD. Esketamine is an N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine, and has been shown to have approximately 3-to 4fold stronger binding affinity for the phencyclidine (PCP) site of the N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor than the R-enantiomer. The mechanism of action of ketamine and esketamine is distinct from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant treatments and ketamine profoundly affec ts fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases brain- derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, and stimulates synaptogenesis. Janssen Research & Development (JRD) is developing intranasal esketamine as an antidepressant therapy. A higher NMDA receptor affinity of esketamine allows a lower volume of medication to be adm inistered via the non- invasive, rapidly absorbed intranasal route. The current study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of flexibly dosed intran asal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant in adult subjects with TRD. Th e study will serve as a Phase 3 short -term efficacy and safety study in support of Chinese regulatory agency requirements for registration of intranasal esketamine for the treatment of TRD. OBJECTIVE S, ENDPOINTS, AND HYPOTHESIS Objective s Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of switching adult subjects with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they have not responded) to flexibly dosed intranasal esketamine (56mg or 84mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms, as assessed by the change from baseline in the Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from Day 1 (pre- randomization) to the end of the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase.

OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, multicenter study in male and female adult subjects with TRD to assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of flexibly dosed intranasal esketamine (56 mg or 84 m g) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. The study has 3 phases;  Screening/Prospective Observational Phase  Double- blind Treatment Phase  Follow -up Phase Overview of Study Phases Screening/ Prospective Observational phase (4 -week duration + optional 3 -week taper period) This phase will prospectively assess treatment response to the subject’s current oral antidepressant treatment regimen. At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, the subject must have had documented non-response to at least 1 antidepressant treatment (based on Massachuset ts General Hospital [MGH] -Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [ATRQ] [MGH -ATRQ]) in the current episode of depression, and subject is taking a different oral antid epressant treatment (on the MGH -ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medicat ions being taken for depression at screening (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Dose adjustment is permitted per clinical judgmen t, but the oral antidepressant treatment is to remain at or above the minimum therapeutic dose (per the MGH -ATRQ) through the end of Week 4. After 4 weeks, subjects who are non -responders to their current oral antidepressant treatment (as assessed by independent, remote raters) may be eligible to proceed to the double-blind treatment phase. Non-response at the end of the screening/prospective obse rvational phase is defined as ≤25% improvement in the MADRS total score from Week 1 to Week 4 and a MADRS total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. Eligible subjects who are entering the double -blind treatment phase will discontinue all their current medication(s) being used for depression treatment, including adjunctive/augmentation therapies. Of note, subjects taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon ) dur ing the screening/prospective observational phase , can continue these medications, but no Not applicable to China"

If clinically indicated, a subject’s current antide pressant treatment(s) may be tapered and discontinued over an additional, optional period of up to 3weeks per the local prescribing information or clinical judgment , or discontinued and switched directly to one of the four new oral antidepressant medicati ons on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, per clinical judgment. Double -blind Treatment Phase (4 -week duration) Approximately 234 eligible subjects (210 Chinese subjects, 24 non-Chinese subjects) with TRD, will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (n=117 subjects per treatment arm, with approximately 105 Chinese subjects per arm) to receive double -blind treatment with either intranasal esketamine or intranasal placebo. The intranasal treatment sessions (esketamine 56 mg, 84 mg or placebo) will occur twice per week for 4weeks as a flexible dose regimen at the study site. In addition, all subjects will initiate a new open -label oral antidepressant on Day 1, that will be taken daily for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase. The assigned oralantidepressant will be 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release [XR]), that the subject has not previously had a non -response to in the current depressive episode, has not been previousl y intolerant to (lifetime), and is available in the participating country . Subjects who were taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon) during the screening/prospective observational phase can continue these medications during the double -blind treatment phase. No dose increases beyond the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam or new benzodiazepine medications are permitted during the double -blind treatment phase, with the exception of the use of permitted benzodiazepine rescue medication (eg, alprazolam, clorazepate, triazolam, lorazepam and temazepam) . Refer to the Time and Events Schedule for a list of study evaluations that will be performed during the double -blind treatment phase. If a subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind treatment phase for reasons other than withdrawal of consent, an Early Withdrawal visit should be conducted within 1 week of the date of discontinuation, followed by the follow -up phase . Follow -upPhase (8 -weeks or until relapse) The follow -upphase will include allsubjects who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication in the double -blind treatment phase. No intranasal study medication will be administered during this phase. At the start of the follow -up phase, further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subjec t’s treating physician and medication changes are permitted. The decision to continue the oral antidepressant in this phase will be at the discretion of the investigator. This follow -up phase will provide additional information required to assess the cours e of the subject’s major depressive episode over an 8-week period. Safety and tolerability, including potential withdrawal symptoms, following discontinuation of intranasal esketamine will also be assessed. The follow -up phase is completed at the end of the 8-week period or when a subject meets the criteria below for relapse ( inremitters and responders ), whichever occurs earlier . Relapse is defined as any of the following:  MADRS total score ≥22 for 2 consecutive assessments separated by 5 to 15 days. The date of the second MADRS assessment will be used for the date of relapse."

If hospitalized for any of these events, the start date of hospitalization will be used for the date of relapse. Otherwise the date of the event will be used if the subject is not hospit alized.  In case more than one relapse criteria are met, the earlier date will be defined as the date of relapse for this subject. The total duration of a subject’s study participation will be up to 19weeks (including an optional 3-week taper period) forsubjects completing the 8-week follow -up phase. STUDY POPULATION The study population will consist of approximately 234 subjects (210 Chinese subjects and 24non-Chinese subjects )with TRD . After giving informed consent, subjects who are 18 to 64 years of age (inclusive), will be screened to determine eligibility for study participation. Subjects must meet Diag nostic and Statist ical Manual of Mental Disorders –Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD or single -episode MDD, without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [DSM -5 diagnostic code 296.23 or 296.33]. An independent rater will conduct the MADRS at screening as well as confirming the diagno sis and the validity of the major depressive episode. At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, subjects must have had non-response (ie,lack of clinically meaningful improvement, defined as ≤25% improvement) to ≥1 but ≤5 (if current episode is ˃2 years or undefinable , upper limit is only applicable to the last 2 years) oral antidepressant treatments, taken at adequate dosage and for adequate duration, as assessed using the MGH -ATRQ and documented by records (eg, medical/pharmacy/presc ription records or a letter from treating physician, etc.), for the current episode of depression. In addition, the subject must currently be taking one of a different oral antidepressant treatment (on the MGH -ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Dose adjustment is permitted per clinical judgment, but the oral antidepressant treatment is to remain at or above the minimum therapeutic dose (per the MGH -ATRQ) through the end of Week 4.Antidepressa nt treatment adherence will be assessed using the PAQ. Subjects who report missing ≥4 days of antidepressant medication treatment(s) in the prior 2 -week period will be considered as screen failed due to inadequate adherence. Non-response at the end of the screening/prospective observational phase is defined as ≤25% improvement from Week 1 to Week 4 in the MADRS total score and a MADRS total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. Treatment -resistant depression is defined as a lack of clinically meaningful improv ement after treatment with at least 2 different antidepressant agents prescribed in adequate doses for adequate duration. The subject’s current major depressive episode, depression symptom severity (Week 1 MADRS total score ≥28 required), and antidepressan t treatment response in their current depressive episode (retrospectively assessed) must be deemed valid for participation in the clinical study based on aClinical Validation Inventory for Study Admission (C-VISA).The C-VISAis a tool to facilitate subje ct selection for MDD clinical studies, with a goal to ensure enrollment of subjects who have symptoms that reflect the current state of illness and that these symptoms can be reliably measured with appropriate measurement tools.

Subjects, who in the current depressive episode have received vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) or who have received deep brain stimulation (DBS), in the current depressive episode will be excluded. Subjects will also be excluded if they have a current or prior DSM -5 diagnosis of a psychotic disorder or MDD with psychotic features, bipolar or related disorders (confirmed by the MINI), obsessive compulsive disorder (current only), intelle ctual disability (DSM -5 diagnostic codes 317, 318.0, 318.1, 318.2, 315.8, and 319), autism spectrum disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, or narcissistic personality disorder; if they have homicidal ideation/intent or suicidal ideation with some intent to act within 6 months prior to the start of the screening/prospective observational phase per the investigator’s clinical judgment and/or based on the Columbia S uicide Severity Rating Sca le (C-SSRS); or if they have a history of moderate or severe substance or alcohol use disorder according to DSM -5 criteria. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION During the double -blind treatment phase, subjects will be randomized to receive double -blind intranasal treatment with esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) or placebo. In addition, subjects will simultaneously initiate a new, open- label oral antidepressant on Day 1 that will be continued for the duration of the 4 -week double - blind treatment phase. Double -Blind Treatm ent Phase Intranasal Study Medication All subjects will self-administer the intranasal study drug (esketamine or placebo) at treatment sessions twice a week for 4 weeks at the study site. The first treatment session will be on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase. Intranasal treatment sessions will not take place on consecutive days. Prior to the first intranasal dose on Day 1, subjects will practice spraying (into the air, not intranasally) a demonstration intranasal device that is filled with placeb o solution. On Day 1, subjects randomized to intranasal esketamine will start with a dose of 56mg. On any of the subsequent dosing days (Day 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 25), the investigator can judge, based on efficacy and tolerance, whether to increase the dose of intranasal esketamine to 84 mg or to maintain the dose at 56 mg. In the event that an increase in dose is poorly tolerated, the investigator may decide to reduce the dose to 56mg. Food will be restricted for at least 2 hours before each administration of study drug. Drinking of fluids will be restricted for at least 30 minutes before the first nasal spray. On all intranasal treatment session days, a site staff member with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eg, Basic Life Support c ourse or equivalent course) that is up to date per local regulations, must be present with the subject during the intranasal treatment sessions and the postdose observation period. In addition, equipment for supportive ventilation and resuscitation needs t o be present. Subjects must remain at the site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge. At the time of discharge, subjects should be accompanied by a responsible adult when released from the clinical site. Subjects must not drive a car or work with machines for 24 hours after receiving intranasal study drug. Oral Antidepressant Study Medication Starting on Day 1, a new, open -label oral antidepressant treatment will be initiated in all subjects. The oral antidepressa nt will be 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine XR). The antidepressant medication will be assigned by the investig ator based on review of MGH -ATRQ and relevant prior antidepressant medication information and will be one that the subject has not previously had a non -response to in the current depressive episode, has not been previously intoleran t to (lifetime), and is available in the participating country."

The use of the titration schedule is mandatory. Doses are not to exceed the maximum dose defined in the titration schedule. If higher doses are not tolerated, a down -titration is permitted based on cl inical judgment. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS Primary Efficacy Evaluation and Endpoint The primary efficacy evaluation will be the MADRS total score. The MADRS will be performed by independent remote raters during the study. The Structured Interview Guide for theMontgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA: Williams 2008) will be used for each administration. The MADRS is a clinician -rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be change from baseline in MADRS total score from Day 1 pre-randomization to the end of the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase. Secondary Efficacy Evaluation and Endpoints Key Secondary Efficacy Evaluations and Endpoints  MADRS: The first ke y secondary endpoint is change from baseline (Day 1, predose) to 24 hours post first dose in depressive symptoms, as measured by the MADRS total score.  Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) : The SDS is a subject -reported outcome measure that will be used to asses s functional impairment and associated disability. The second key secondary endpoint is the change in SDS total score as measured by the change from baseline (Day 1 prior to randomization) to the end of the 4- week double -blind treatment phase. Other Secon dary Efficacy Evaluations and Endpoints  Proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response ( ≥50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score) by Day 2 that is maintained through the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase with one excursion allowed.  Proportion of responders (50% reduction from baseline in MADRS total score) at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase.  Proportion of subjects in remission (MADRS 12) at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase.  Proportion of subjects who remain in remission (MADRS ≤12) through to the end of the follow -up phase.  Change from baseline (Day 1 ,prior to ran domization) to the end of the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase in: o Severity of depressive illness, using the C linical Global Impression –Severity (CGI -S); o Anxiety symptoms, using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7), and o Health- related quality of life and health status, as assess ed by the EuroQol -5 dimension - 5level (EQ -5D-5L)."

See Section 9.2for further details PHARMACOK INETIC EVALUATIONS Pharmacokinetic Venous blood samples of approximately 4 mL will be collected from Chinese subjects at all clinical sites, for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine (JNJ-54135419), and other metabolites (if warranted), at thetime points specified in the Time and Events Schedule. The exact dates and times of PK blood sampling must be recorded. BIOMARKER , PHARMACOGENOMIC (DNA) AND EXPRESSION (RNA) EVALUATIONS Assessment of biomarkers and their potential relationship to intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant and to maintenance/stabilization of response, non-response, and relapse will be explored. Blood samples will be collected to measure genetic and epigenetic markers (including but not limited to BDNF allelic variants) and protein markers (including but not limited to growth factors, inflammation, endocrine, or metabolic markers). Samples of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and biomarkers (protein and RNA) may be used to help address emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimately individualized therapies. Subjects who agree to participate in the biomarker, pharmacogenomic (DNA) and expression (RNA) component will need to sign a separate written informed consent form. SAFETY EVALUATIONS Safety evaluations will include: Monitoring of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), pregnancy testing (for women of childbearing potential), urine drug screen, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) , vital signs, pulse oximetry, physical examination, and body weight measurements.  Nasal examinations  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), to assess potential suicidal ideation and behavior  Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), to assess treatment -emergent dissociative symptoms  Physician Withdrawal Checklist (20 items; PWC- 20) to assess potential withdrawal symptoms following cessation of intranasal esketamine treatment Not applicable to China"

Safety Analysis Set : All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication or 1 dose of oral antidepressant medication in the double -blind treatment phase. Sample Size Determination Assuming a t reatment difference for the double- blind treatment phase of 6.5points in MADRS total score between esketamine plus oral antidepressant compared with oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo at the Week 4 endpoint, a standard deviation of 12, a one -sided significance level of 0.025, a drop -out rate of 25%, 117subjects will be randomized to each treatment arm to achieve greater than 90% power and a sample size of 105 Chinese subjects per treatment arm (total n = 210) plus 12 non- Chinese subjects per treatment arm (total of n = 24) will be included. The treatment difference and standard deviation used in this calculation were based on results from Panel A of the ESKETINTRD2003 study and based on clinical judgment. Efficacy Analyses Efficacy analys es will be performed on the full analysis set, which will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study drug and 1 dose of oral antidepressant medication, in the double -blind treatment phase. Primary Endpoint The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the stud y, is defined by the following 4 components:  Population: subjects with treatment -resistant depression ;  Variable : change from Day 1 to end of 4 -week double -blind treatment phase;  Intervention Effect : the effect of the initially randomized treatment together with the oral antidepressant medication that would have been observed had all subjects remained on their treatment throughout t he double -blind treatment phase;  Summary Measure : the difference in variable means. The primary analysis will be based on the full analysis set and the MADRS total scores collected during the double -blind treatment phase. For the primary efficacy analysis, change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 4 in the double - blind treatment phase will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include baseline MADRS total score as a covariate, and treatment, country, class of antidepressant (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors [SNRI] or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor [SSRI]), day, and day-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Comparison of the esketamine plus oral antidepressant arm to the active comparator (oral antidepressant plus intranasal pla cebo) arm will be performed using the appropriate contrast. Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint to assess the robustness of the results to missing data might be performed. The detailed assumptions and methods will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP)."

The second key efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in SDS total score at Week 4 in the double -blind treatment phase, will be analyzed using the same models des cribed above for the MADRS total score. To strongly control Type I error across the primary and the two key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence approach will be applied to adjust for multiplicity. The hypotheses will be tested sequentially in the following order:  Change in MADRS total score at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase  Change in MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose  Change in SDS total score Further details of this approach will be provided in the SAP. The proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response by Day 2 (in the event that no MADRS was collected on Day 2, a MADRS collected on Day 3 could be used) that is maintained for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase (≥50% reduction in MADR S total score by the second day after taking the first dose of double -blind medication that continued through the end of the double -blind phase) in esketamine arm will be compared with the active comparator using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel chi -square test a djusting for country and class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI). Subjects who discontinued the study prior to the end of the double -blind treatment phase will not be considered to have maintained clinical response. Response and remission rates will be summ arized at each visit. The proportion of subjects who remain in remission through to the end of the follow -up phase will be presented. Change from baseline in GAD -7 total scores at the end of the 4- week double -blind treatment phase will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model, with treatment, country and class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) as factors, and the respective baseline score as the covariate. Ranks of change from baseline in CGI-S scores during the 4-week double -blind treatment phase will be analyz ed using the MMRM for repeated measures ,asdescribed above for the MADRS and SDS total scores. Dimension scores of EQ -5D-5L descriptive system, health status index, and the overall health status score will be summarized over time. Additionally, scores of all efficacy endpoints will be summarized for all visits in the double -blind period. Summaries will be provided to show consistency of effect among relevant subgroups (eg, antidepressant class SSRI [escitalopram, sertraline] and SNRI [duloxetine, venlafaxi ne]). For subjects who receive esketamine during the double -blind treatment phase, the proportion of subjects who relapse during the follow -up phase will be summarized separately for subjects who are remitters (MADRS ≤12 at the end of the double -blind treatment phase) and for subjects who are responders but not remitters (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score, but MADRS ˃12 at the end of the double -blind treatment phase). In addition, the time to relapse during the follow -up phase will be estimated by theKaplan- Meier method separately for subjects who are remitters, and for subjects who are responders but not remitters . Descriptive statistics (number of relapses, number of censored subjects, and median, 25th,and 75thpercentile of time to relapse, if est imable) will be provided."

INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD), a serious, recurrent, and disabling psychiatric illness, is the second leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide. MDD is associated with excess mortality , and with years of potential life lost. About 30% of patients fail to achieve remission despite treatment with multiple antidepressant medications and are considered to have treatment - resistant depression (TRD ). There is a significant need to develop novel treatments based upon relevant pathoph ysiologic pathway s underl ying MDD for the rapid relief of symptoms of depression, especiall y in patients with TRD. Esketamine is an N-methy l-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It is the S-enantiomer of racemic ketamine and has been shown to have approximately 3-to 4-fold stronger binding affinit y for the phency clidine (PCP) site of the N-methy l-D-aspar tate (NMDA) receptor than the R-enantiomer. The mechanism of action of ketamine and esketamine is distinct from conventional monoaminergic antidepressant treatments and ketamine profoundl y affects fast excitatory glutamate transmission, increases brain -derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, and stimulates sy naptogen esis. Janssen Research & Development (JRD) is developing intranasal esketamine as an antidepressant therap y. A higher NMDA receptor affinity of esketamine allows a lower volume of medication to be administered via the non -invasive, rapidl y absorbed intrana sal route. The current study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safet y, and tolerability of flexibly dosed intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant in adult subjects with TRD. The study will serve as a Phase 3 short -term efficacy and safet y study in support of Chinese regulatory agency requirements for registration of intranasal esketamine for the treatment of TRD. The term “sponsor” used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact Information page (s), which will be provided as a separate document. 1.1. Background 1.1.1. Nonclinical Studies Safety Pharmacology The following text is quoted from the United States (US) prescribing information for anesthetic Ketalar®(ketamine hydrochloride injection)37is provided below: Intravenous Ketalar®produces a fall in arterial blood pressure in the Rhesus monkey and a rise in arterial blood pressure in the dog. In this respect the dog mimics the cardiovascular effect observed in man. The pressor response to Ketalar®injected into intact, anaesthetize ddogs is accompanied by a tachycardia, rise in cardiac output and a fall in total peripheral resistance. The pressor response to Ketalar®is reduced or blocked by chlorpromazine (central depressant and peripheral α-adrenergic blockade), by β-adrenergic bl ockade, and by ganglionic blockade."

In a 3-month repeat -dose toxicity study with intranasall y administered esketamine in dogs, no relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were noted up to the highest dose tested, ie,72mg/day. Heart rate was slightl y increased. The cardiovascular safet y of racemic ketamine and esketamine in humans and animals is summarized in the I nvestigator's Brochure.34 Toxicology Repeat -Dose Toxicity Studies In repeat -dose toxicity studies with intranasally administered esketamine in rats up to 9 mg/day for 6 months, and dogs up to 72 mg/day for 3 months of duration, the clinical observations mainly related to the central nervous system (eg, changes in activity and gait). No adverse effects were noted up to the highest dose tested, ie, 9 mg/day in rats and 72 mg/day in dogs. These observations reflected the (exaggerated) pharmacology of the test compound. Minor histologic findings were noted in the nasal cavit y. These tissue changes were not considered adverse. In 3-and 9 -month repeat -dose toxicity studies with intranasall y administered esketamine in dogs, no relevant electrocardiogram (ECG) changes were noted up 72 mg/day. Heart rate was slightly increased. Further details can be found in the I nvestigator's Brochure.34 Genetic Toxicity A series of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies was conducted wit h ketamine and esketamine. The weight of evidence indicates that esketamine poses no genotoxic risk to humans.34 Neurotoxicity Racemic ketamine has been reported toinduce neurotoxicity in animal fetuses, and in juvenile, adolescent, and adult animals, as evidenced by histopathologic brain lesions and functional sequelae. The precise thresholds for dose and duration of exposure causing neurotoxicity in animals remain to be established. The relevance to humans of ketamine’s neurotoxic action in animals is unknown. In studies exploring neurotoxic effects of ketamine on juvenile and prenatal monkey s, neuroapoptosis was observed to be more widespread in fetal brains than in neonatal brains, after administration of ketamine anesthesia IV for 5 hours. In fetal brains, the cerebellum, caudate nucleus, putamen, and nucleus accumbens were most severel y affected. In neonatal brains, the cerebellum was not affected; the strongest neuroapoptotic response was noted in the basal ganglia and several thalamic areas."
38,page_38,"JNJ-54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol ESKETINTRD3006 Amendment 2 Confidential –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 39 Status: Approved , Date: 21 January 2021In juvenile rodents, ketamine induced apoptotic neurodegeneration was observed that was more widespread than in adult rodents, with the developing brain affected in several major regions. Neuronal cell death was induced in the dorsolateral thalamus at blood levels of ketamine of 14µg/mL (7 times the human anesthetic blood level of approximately 2 µg/mL ). No significant neurotoxic effects occurred in juvenile Rhesus monkey s if the anesthesia was administered byIM induction followed by IV maintenance for a duration of 3 hours. Ketamine infusion for 9 or 24 hours increased neuronal cell death in the frontal cortex, but no significant changes were noted in the hippocampus, thal amus, striatum, or amy gdala. Cognitive impairments were observed beginning around 10 months of age, and persisted at 3.5 years of age. The clinical studies will exclude neonates, infants, children, pregnant women, and breastfeeding women. Therefore, ketami ne’s neurotoxicity in juvenile animals does not represent a safety risk to eligible adult subjects. Moreover, the large dosages and prolonged treatment durations associated with neurotoxicity in juvenile animals do not suggest a concern. Chronic treatment with ketamine at high dose levels affected the brain of adolescent monkey s, as evidenced b y histopathologic lesions and functional impairment. The neurotoxicity of ketamine in adult animals is also associated with high dose levels, in contrast to the rela tively low dose levels of esketamine associated with antidepressant efficacy in humans. In single -dose and 14-day repeated -neurotoxicity studies with intranasally administered esketamine in rats, no histopathologic brain lesions were noted even upon high exposures, as achieved at 54 mg/day in the 14-day study. In the 6-month rat and9-month dog repeat -dose toxicology studies with intranasall y administered esketamine, where the animals were of adolescent age at initiation of treatment, and in the pre-and post-natal developmental toxicit y study in rats, no evidence of neurotoxicity was found. Consequentl y, the risk of neurotoxicity associated with intranasal administration of esketamine to adult and adolescent patients is considered low.34 Abuse Potential Animal studies with ketamine suggest that it would have abuse potential in humans. These studies included self -administration and withdrawal experiments in several sp ecies.34 Reproductive Toxicity In a rat fertility and early embry onic developmental toxicity study with intranasall y administered esketamine, no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive capacity or performance were found. Rat and rabbit embry o-fetal developmental toxicity studies with intranasally administered racemic ketamine did not reveal evidence of reproductive toxicity . However, when monkey fetuses were exposed in utero to high dose levels of racemic ketamine, neurotoxicity was observed. Intranasall y administered esketamine did not affect pre-and postnatal development in rats. However, high dose levels of racemic ketamine induced neurotoxicity in early postnatal rat pups.34"

Cardiovascular toxicity In guinea pig tissues, ketamine -induced negative inotropic effects and shortening of action potentia l duration at the 0-mV level was observed, likely as a result of the suppression of inward calcium current, whereas in rat left atria ketamine -induced positive inotropic effects and prolongation of action potential duration at the 0-mV level was observed, likely as a result of a decrease in calcium -insens itive transient outward current.20The inhibitory action on membrane currents may partl y explain t he species and tissue differences in inotropic responses to ketamine. Blood pressure responses to ketamine also vary with the laboratory species and with experimental conditions. Blood pressure is increased in normotensive and renal hypertensive rats with and without adrenalectom y and under pentobarbital anesthesia. The US prescribing information for the anesthetic Ketalar®(ketamine hydrochloride [HCl] for injection) provides the following guidance. Intravenous Ketalar®produces a fall in arterial blood pressure in the Rhesus monkey and a rise in arterial blood pressure in the dog. In this respect the dog mimics the cardiovascular effect observed in man. The pressor response to Ketalar®injected into intact, unanesthetiz ed dogs is accompanied by a tachycardia, rise in cardiac output and a fall in total peripheral resistance. It causes a fall in perfusion pressure following a large dose. The tachy cardia and increase in my ocardial contractile force seen in intact animals does not appear in isolated hearts. These observations support the hypothesis that the hypertension produced by Ketalar®is due to selective activation of central cardiac stimulating mechanisms leading to an increase in cardiac output. The dog would be considered the most predictive species in terms of ketamine’s cardiovascular effects in humans, but the antidepressant effects of ketamine were studied only in rodent models. The myocardial contractility effects and blood pressure responses to ketamine vary between species.34Consequently , a margin of safet y could not be reliabl y derived from the available animal data. Overall Conclusion The currentl y available nonclinical safety studies support chronic intranasal administration of esketamine in human subjects up to a dosage of 84 mg/day . Further details can be found in the I nvestigator's Brochure.34 1.1.2. Clinical Studies The clinical program for esketamine includes: a comprehensive clinical pharmacology program in healthy volunteers and special populations to fully characterize the product’s pharmacokin etic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) activity , including Phase 2 studies with IV esketamine and ketamine; a Phase 2 dose response study in adults with TRD; a Phase 2 proof -of-concept study in the related condition of MDD with imminent risk for suicide ; and d ata from 5 completed Phase 3"

Human Pharmacokinetics Metabolism Ketamine (and esketamine) undergoes extensive metabolism by hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP). In humans, N- demethy lation to norketamine is the major route of metabolism, which can undergo further metabolism to form hydroxynorketamine. Ketamine and norketamine are extensively hydroxylated to a series of 6 hydroxynorketamine metabolites and 2hydroxyketamine metabolites.75Like ketamine, norketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist at the NMDA receptor.19 Norketamine has a half-life in plasma of approximately 5 hours.38The major human hepatic CYPs that catal yze ketamine and esket amine N-demeth ylation in vitro are CYP2B6 and CYP3A4.29,31,78 The CYP enzymes responsible for the formation of norketamine metabolites include CYP2A6 and CYP2B6.53Published results of a clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) study indicate that esketamine does not invert to the R -enantiomer.26 Excr etion Racemic ketamine and its metabolites have been previously shown to be predominantly excreted in the urine. An average of 91% and 3% of a tritium -labeled dose (1mg/kg) administered to 6healthy subjects was recovered in urine and feces, respectivel y.4Less than 3% of an administered dose was excreted in urine as parent drug.75"

The recovered radioactivity consisted primarily of esketamine metabolites. For the IV and oral routes of administration, <1% of the dose was excreted in the urine as unchanged drug. A summary of the PK of esketamine administered by the IV and intranasal routes is provided below. Intravenous Esketamine Subjects with TRD received 0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg esketamine as a 40-minute IV infusion during Study ESK ETIVTRD2001.9Maximum concentrations of esk etamine were observed at the end of the infusion. Mean values for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) increased with an increase in the esketamine dose administered (80.9 and 135 ng/mL, respectively , and 150 and 218ng*h/mL, respectively , for 0.2mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg esketamine). The mean plasma clearance of esketamine was high (109 L/h and 141 L/h for the 0.2 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg doses, respectively ), as it was similar to or exceeded hepatic blood flow in humans.8The large volume of distribution suggests that esketamine distributes widely into tissues (236 L and 303 L, respectivel y). The half-life of esketamine in plasma was 2.14 and 2.65 hours, respectively , for the 2 doses. Intranasal Esketamine Plasma esketamine PK results from Studies ESKETINTRD1001, ESK ETINTRD1002, ESKETINTRD1003, and the double -blind phase of Panel A of the ESKETINTRD2003 that inform dose selection for the Phase 3 program are described below.5,6,7,10The results demonstrate that plasma esketamine concentrations produced by effective IV regimens (0.2 mg/kg and 0.4mg/kg as 40 minute infusions) may be achieved by the intranasal route. Study ESKETINTRD1001 included 3 cohorts of subjects who were healthy male and female subjects.5The intranasal esketamine treatments were self-administered under the direct supervision of the investigator or designee. Subjects in Cohorts 1 and 3 received esketamine doses that ranged from 28 to 112 mg. The regimens were self-administered in the uprigh t position. No instructions were given with regards to sniffing after administration. The reported median time for Cmaxvalues of esketamine ranged from 0.37 to 0.83 hours from the time the first spray was administered (ie, 0.33 to 0.5 hours after the lastspray was administered). The doses of 28 to 112mg produced mean Cmaxvalues ranging from 63.3 to 151 ng/mL, whereas mean area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinite time (AUC ∞)values ranged from 164 to 565ng*h/mL. Mean Cmaxand AUC values of esketamine increased in a less than dose-proportional manner across the dose regimens. Furthermore, there was substantial overlap in the range of individual Cmaxand AUC values among the 3 doses. The mean terminal half-life of esketamine ranged from 5.86 to 9.83 hours across all treatments. Subjects in Cohort 2 received 84 mg in a semi -reclined position and were instructed to sniff after each spray . Higher mean C maxand AUC ∞ values were observed in this cohort (174 ng/mL and 437ng*h/mL, respectively ) compared with the same esketamine dose self-administered by subjects in Cohort 1 (107 ng/mL and 400 ng*h/mL , respectivel y).

As a result ,the instructions for self-administration of intranasal esketamine were adapted to include the semi -reclined position of the head and sniffing fol lowing dosing for all future studies. During the Phase 1 study ESKETINTRD1002, healthy Japanese and Caucasian subjects received single intranasal doses of esketamine 28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg in a crossover manner.6On average, plasma esketamine Cmaxand AUC values were up to 48% higher in Japanese subjects compared with Caucasian subjects. In study ESKETINTRD1008, healthy Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Caucasian subjects received a single intranasal dose of 56 mg esketamine. The mean esketamine C maxand AUC values were approximately 40% higher in Japanese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects. In general, smaller differences in esketamine and noresketamine exposure were observed when comparing other Asian subjects (Hans Chinese and Korean) to Cauca sian subjects. Mean esketamine Cmaxand AUC ∞values were 14% and 33% higher, respectivel y, in Han Chinese subjects compared to Caucasian subjects. The incidence and type of treatment -emergent adverse events most frequently reported, as defined by system -organ-class, were comparable for subjects in all 4 population cohorts . Study ESKETINTRD1003 compared the PK, safety , and tolerability of intranasally administered esketamine in healthy elderly (65 years of age) and younger adult subjects (18 to 55 years ofage, inclusive).7Subjects received a single intranasal treatment of esketamine 28 mg. The Tmaxof esketamine was approximately 30minutes for both age groups. The geometric means of Cmaxand AUC ∞, for esketamine were approximately 21% and 17% higher, respectivel y, in the elderl y compared with younger adult subjects. Study ESKETINTRD2003, is a recen tly completed 2-panel, doubly randomized, double -blind, placeb o-controlled, multicenter stud y.55Panel A was conducted in the United States and Belg ium and Panel B in Japan. Panel A assessed the efficacy and safety of 3 dose strengths of intranasal esketamine (28, 56, and 84 mg) administered twice a week in subjects with TRD. Panel B was designed to assess the efficacy and safet y of 14mg and 56mg dose strengths. Results of a preliminary analysisof data from the double -blind phase of Panel A indicate mean (standard deviation) esketamine concentrations at 40 minutes postdo se were 36.4 ng/mL (16.4), 58.1 ng/mL (24.5), and 72.5 ng/mL (34.2), respectivel y, for the 3 doses (data on file). The mean esketamine concentrations in plasma samples collected on Days 1 and 11 were similar, suggesting that the PK are consistent after repeated administration.10 1.1.2.2.

Esketamine (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg administered over 40 minutes) has similar, rapid, and robust antidepressant effect sas that seen with IV ketamine. A double -blind, double -randomization, placebo- controlled stud y (ESKETIVTRD2001) enrolled 30 adult subjects with TRD: 10 in the IV placebo group, 9 in the IV esketamine 0.20 mg/kg group, and 11 in the I V esketamine 0.40- mg/kg group (based on Day 1 randomization).9The intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis of the primary efficac y variable (change in Montgo mery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score from baseline [Day 1]to Day 2) indicated that the improvement in both IV esketamine dose groups were statistically significant (1-sided p-value=0.001 in both dose groups) compared with the placebo group. The mean (standard deviation) change from baseline [Day 1]to Day 2 in MADRS total score was -4.9 (4.72) in the placebo group, -16.8 (10.12) in the IV esketamine 0.20 mg/kg group, and -17.8 (9.45) in the IV esketamine 0.40 mg/kg group. The studies li sted above assessed the efficacy of IV ketamine or IV esketamine after a single dose as the primary endpoint. The average duration of response to a single dose of ketamine (0.5mg/kg) was approximately 5 days. An open -label study demonstrated that the response to the first dose could be maintained by multiple infusions 3 times a week over 2 weeks. The duration of response lasted for approximately 19 day s.1 The KETIVTRD2002 study assessed whether multiple doses of IV ketamine given twice a week would also maintain the antidepressant response; the data from this study suggest that IV ketamine (0.50 mg/kg over 40 minutes) administered twice a week was sufficient for maintaining the initial effect over a 4 week treatment period.11 As noted above, Study ESKETI NTRD2003 is a 2-panel, doubly randomiz ed, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter stud y.10Panel A was conducted in the United States and Belgium and Panel B in Japan. Panel A assessed the efficacy and safety of 3 dose strengths of intranasal esketamine (28, 56, and 84 mg) administered twice a week in subjects with TRD. Panel B was designed to assess the efficacy and safet y of 14 mg and 56 mg dose strengths. I n Panel A, subjects in period 1 (1-week duration) were randomly assigned in a 3:1:1:1 ratio to placebo (33 subjects),"

Data from the double -blind phase of Panel A indicates that of the 67subjects randomized in Period 1, 63 entered Period 2 (1 -week duration), in which 28 placebo subjects who were eligible for re-randomization at the end of Period 1, were randoml y assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to placebo (N=6), esketamine 28 mg (N=8), esketamine 56mg (N=9), or esketamine 84 mg (N=5). Subjects eligible for re-randomization had to have a Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology –Self Report (QIDS -SR16) total score >11 at the end of Period 1. The improvement (with respect to change i n MADRS total score from baseline Day 1 to Da y 8) in all 3 intranasal esketamine dose groups reached statistical significance (p=0.021, p=0.001, and p<0.001 for esketamine 28 mg, 56 mg, and 84 mg, respectivel y) compared with placebo. The results of the 2 periods were consistent. The mean differences from placebo on Day 8 (after 1week of treatment), estimated using data from the combined periods, were: Esketamine 28 mg: -4.2 (SE 2.09) Esketamine 56 mg: -6.3 (SE 2.07) Esketamine 84 mg: -9.0 (SE 2.13) Theeffect sizes in Period 1 for esketamine compared with placebo were: Esketamine 28 mg: 0.43 (CI -0.259 -1.118) Esketamine 56 mg: 0.92 (CI 0.201-1.621) Esketamine 84 mg: 1.19 (CI 0.473-1.883) The duration of effect with the 28-mg dose appears to be shorter, with the MADRS total score higher on Day 8 than on Day 2. The duration of effect for the 56-and 84-mg doses appears to support twice -a-week dosing. In Panel B, a significant improvement in symptoms of depression as measured by the MADRS total score was detected in the esketamine 56mg treatment group compared with the placebo group (-3.7 [SE 2.81]; p=0.096) during Period 1. Smaller improvements in MADRS total score were detected in the esketamine 14 mg group compared with the placebo group (+1.8 [SE 2.62]) during Period 1. These data with intranasal esketamine support the hypotheses that intranasal esketamine is effective as a treatment for depressi on, that it has rapid onset of effect within 2 hours, and that multiple repeated sessions dose-dependently show sustained response throughout the study duration. A clear dose response was seen in the double -blind data in Panel A, and the point estimates and confidence intervals suggest a high effect size (Cohen’s D) with the 56mg and 84mg dose groups, support ing further development."

Ketamine is marketed as a racemic mixture and in Europe also as the S-enantiomer, esketamine. Ketamine was first introduced as an anesthetic in 1963 and is considered to have an excellent medical safety profile (Ketalar®Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] 2011; Ketanest®S SmPC 2011).28,36 Withi n the US prescribing information for ketamine HCl for injection and the SmPC for esketamine HCl for injection, the following adverse reactions were listed as very common, common, or frequent occurrences: Emergence or recovery reactions, elev ated blood pressure and pulse rate, stimulation of respira tion, nausea, and vomiting. See the table below for details.

Characteristics: Severit y varied from pleasant dreamlike states, vivid imagery, hallucinations, and emergence delirium. Some states were accompanied by confusion, excite ment, and irrational behavior, which some patients recalled as an unpleasant experience.Frequency :Recovery reactions were common. When esketamine was the sole anesthetic, up to 30% of patients displayed dose -dependent recovery reactions. Characteristics: Reactions included vivid dreams (including nightmares), nausea and vomiting, increased salivation, blurred vision, dizziness, and motor restlessness c Cardiac disordersBlood pressure and pulse rate were frequently elevated after administration. However, hypotension and brady cardia have been observed. Arrhy thmia has also occurred.Common occurrences were temporary tachy cardia and increase in blood pressure and heart rate (approximatel y 20% of the initial value was typical). Resp iratory , thoracic, and mediastinal disordersAlthough stimulation of respiration was a frequently observed effect, severe depression of respiration or apnea also could occur after rapid intravenous administration of high doses.Common effects were increase in vascular resistance in pulmonary circulation and increase in mucus secretion. Increased oxygen consumption, laryngospasms, and temporary respiratory depression were common; the risk of respiratory depression was noted to depend on dose and injection sp eed. Gastro - intestinal disordersNo gastrointestinal effects were listed as frequent, but the USPI stated that anorexia, nausea, and vomiting have been observed.Common effects included nausea and vomiting.

Within the SmPC for intravenous esketamine,38the following are reported as common adverse effects: transient tachycardia, vivid dreams (including nightmares), nausea and vomiting, increased blood pressure, increased salivation, blurred vision, dizziness, motor unrest, increase in vascular resistance in pulmonary circulation and increase in mucus secretion, increased oxygen consumption, laryngospasms, and temporary respiratory depression. It is reported that the risk of respiratory depression t ypicall y depends on the dosage and injection speed.36 Administration of intranasal esketamine is associated with adverse events, all of which are transient in nature and typically resolve within 2 hours orless from the start of drug administration. In Panel A of the Phase 2 study with intranasal esketamine (ESKETINTRD2003), the most common TEAE s (>10% of subjects in the pooled esketamine treatment groups) during the double -blind phase were : Dizziness, head ache, dissociation, dysgeusia (metallic taste), nausea, dissociative disorder, and oral hypoesthesia.10Dissociative symptoms were the most typical of these adverse events observed post dose and were characterized by feeling unreal or detached from reality or byperceptual changes. Transient perceptual changes (dissociation), dizziness, and nausea were t ypically seen immediately after drug administration, resolving by 2hours. No deaths were reported in the double -blind or open -label phases of ESKETINTRD2003. There was one death (placebo/esketamine 14mg/OL esketamine treatment group) due to completed suicide in Panel B on Study Day45 during the follow -up phase of the study ,20 days after the subject received the last dose of study medication. The investigator considered the event to be ‘not related’ to study medication. A total of 3 subjects experienced at least one serious adverse event (SAE) during the study .In Panel A, o ne subject (placebo/placebo treatment group) experienced a SAE of esophagitis on Study Day15 during the double -blind phase that was considered by the investigator to be ‘not related’ to study medication ;one subject (esketamine 56 mg/esketamine 56mg/OL esketamine treatment group), experienced a SAE of ectopic pregnancy on Study Da y 40 during the open -label phase, which led to withdrawal of study medication .The subject subsequentl y experienced another SAE of general physical health deterioration on study Day 44of the follow -up phase after cessation of study medication . The investigator considered that both events were ‘not related’ to study medication. In Panel B, one subject experienced a SAE of confusional state during the follow -up phase , 10 days after receiving the last dose of study medication. The sponsor considered the event ‘not related’ to study medication based on the short half-life of esketamine and the time of onset of the TEAE. A total of 4subjects in Pan el A experienced TEAEs which led to withdrawal of study medication. Three subjects withdrew during the double -blind phase because of TEAEs. One subject in the esketamine 28mg group experienced a TEAE of syncope of severe intensity on Study Day 2 (Period 1), 1day after receiving the first dose of study medication . The investigator considered the event to be ‘possibly related’ to study medication; the sponsor considered the event ‘not related’ to study medication based on the short half -life of esketamine a nd the onset of the TEAE of sy ncope.

The investigator considered the event to be very likely related to the study agent. One subject experience an SAE of ectopic pregnancy (considered by the investigator as ‘not related’ to study medication; see above) .63 Dissociative symptoms measured on the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS)3were dose-dependent , with significan t reductions in severity observed onmultiple dosing,over the 2 weeks. No psychotic symptoms were seen. Transient increases in mean blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) were observed post dose following the intranasal esketamine administration. The mean (standard deviation; SD) peak systolic blood pressure after the first administration in each dose group was : Placebo: 124.2 (11.51) mmHg; an increase of 5.4 (7.84) mmHg Esketamine 28 mg: 131.8 (15.49) mmHg; an increase of 10.4 (10.44) mmHg Esketamine 56 mg: 130.4 (18.64) mmHg; an increase of 11.2 (15.01) mmHg Esketamine 84 mg: 146.1 (19.9) mmHg; an increase of 17.1 (15.5) mmHg Mean (SD) peak diastolic blood pressure after the first administration in each dose group was: Placebo: 81.2 (8.36) mmHg; an increase of 3.8 (7.99) mmHg Esketamine 28 mg: 85.7 (9.16) mmHg; an increase of 6.5 (7.00) mmHg Esketamine 56 mg: 86.5 (11.34) mmHg ; an increase of 7.2 (9.67) mmHg Esketamine 84 mg: 87.8 (10.62) mmHg; an increase of 8.1 (9.12) mmHg The blood pressure increase ty picall y resolved within 2 hours. Unlike dissociative sy mptoms, the blood pressure changes observed do not appear to attenuate over time with multiple doses. Transient increases in heart rate were also observed in parallel with blood pressure change. There was no clinicall y meaningful change in blood ox ygen level. Adverse Events Associated with Chronic Use of Ketamine There are n o controlled studies of long -term use with esketamine/ketamine in patients with MDD. Much of the literature on chronic use of ketamine comes from data gathered from street/illegal use of the drug, rather than systematically conducted clinical studies. Data therefore should be interpreted with caution, as in many cases, no baseline pre-drug data are available and drug exposure is poorly documented. In a 1-year longitudinal study , 150 subjects were divided into 5 groups of 30subjects each: Frequent ketamine users (more than 4 times per week), infrequent ketamine users (at least once a month), abstinent users (abstinent for at least 1 month), polydrug controls, and non- users of illicit drugs.48Eight y percent of the participants were retested at the end of 1year. Cognitive deficits (including impairment in spatial working memory , pattern recognition memory and category"
48,page_48,"JNJ-54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol ESKETINTRD3006 Amendment 2 Confidential –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 49 Status: Approved , Date: 21 January 2021fluency ) were mainl y observed in frequent users and not with the infrequent users. Short -lasting, dose-dependent effects of psychosis were associated with ketamine users. There was no increase in symptoms over time, and symptoms were completely reversible upon stopping use of ketamine. As noted, these data should be interpreted with caution, as baseline data predating drug use were not available. Furthermore, in their recent review, Morgan and Curran report that there is little evidence of any link between chronic, heavy use of ketamine and diagnosis of a psychotic disorder.47 The principal action of ketamine is at the NMDA receptor, and the consequences of ketamine use on cognition have been widel y investigated. Several studies have examined cognitive function in infrequent and frequent ketamine users.13,46,48,50Overall, infrequent or recreational ketamine use does not appear to be associated with long-term cognitive impairment.48The most robust findings are that frequent ketamine users (more than 5 times a week) exhibit impairments in both short -and long- term memory .46Although dosages have varied, dosages reported by ketamine users in this study were much higher than the dosages of ketamine or equivalent doses of esketamine intended for use in treating TRD. Memory impairments may be reversible when individuals stop using the drug, as they were not found in a group of 30 ex-ketamine users who had been abstinent for at least a year.46,47 Ketamine -induced ulcerative cystitis is a recentl y identified complication.47The most common symptoms are frequency and urgency of urination, dysuria, urge incontinence, and occasionall y painful hematuria (blood in urine). Computerized tomograph y scans revealed a marked thickening of the bladder wall, a small bladder capacity , and perivesicular stranding consistent with severe inflammation. At cystoscopy , all patients had severe ulcerative cystitis. Biopsies in 4 of these cases found denuded urothelial mucosa with thin layers of reactive and regenerating epithelial cells, and ulcerations with vascular granulation tissue and scattered inflammatory cells. Cessation of ketamine use provided some relief of symptoms. Most of the described cases are in near-daily users of ketamine for recreational purposes. The prevalence is difficult to determine, as it is seen in recreational users who often do not seek help. The majorit y of cases resolve after stopping ketamine use, one -third remaining static. Abuse Liability, Dependence, and Withdrawal There are a number of reports of ketam ine dependence in the literature33,35,45,52but no large -scale studies, and so the incidence of ketamine dependence is largel y unknown.47An interview stud y of 90 ketamine users found that 57 % of frequent users, 43% of infrequent users, and 60% of ex -users expressed concerns about ketamine addiction.49The majority of frequent users in that study reported using the drug without stopping until supplies ran out, so compulsive patterns of behavior are also a concern. Oral ketamine has also been evaluated as a positive control in human abuse potential studies, with dosages of 65 mg and 110 mgreported as appropriate for use as positive controls for future abuse potential studies of compounds with a similar mechanism of action or with possible perception -altering effects.68There is conflicting evidence of the existence of a ""withdrawal syndrome"" after cessation of ketamine use.47Cravings seem to be a key problem in frequent users: 28 of the 30 daily users in 1 stud y reported having tried to stop taking the drug but failed; all reported ketamine cravings as the reason for failure.47The same study found that 12 of the 30 daily users reported withdrawal symptoms characterized by anxiety , shaking, sweating, and"

A few published case studies also show craving and somatic and psychological aspects of anxiety as withdrawal sy mptoms.12,42However, a specific ketamine withdrawal s yndrome has not y et been described.47 Please refer to the Investigator's Brochure for a summary of the adverse events reported in ketamine and esketamine studies.34 1.2. Active Comparator This study will evaluate the efficacy of switching adult subjects with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they have not responded) to a flexible dose regimen of intranasal esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepress ant, compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo. In the double -blind treatment phase, subjects will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 commerciall y available oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of antidepressant medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s: Escitalopram or Sertraline), or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI s: Duloxetine or Venlafaxi ne extended release [XR]), that the subject has not previously had a non -response to, in the current major depressive episode, and has not been previously intolerant to (lifetime). The indications and safety information provided below for each oral antidepressant are from the US prescribing informa tion.17,21,65,71For further information, please refer to the appropriate package insert applicable to the local country in which the study is being conducted. In the US, all oral antidepressant sinclude a black box warning in the prescribing information regarding suicidality and antidepressant drugs. In China, a similar warning is included in the label. The black box warning informs the prescriber that antidepressant treatment(s) increase the risk compared with placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality ) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short -term studies of MDD and other psychiatric disorders. It states that anyone considering using the antidepressant in this population must balance the risk with the clinical need. Refer to the US and Chinese prescribing information for the entire content of the black box warning.17,21,65,71 1.2.1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors 1.2.1.1. Escitalopram Escitalopram is indicated in adults for acute and maintenance treatment of MDD and acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder.21 The starting dosage for MDD in the US prescribing information is 10 mg once daily, and in China, the commonly used dosage is 10 mg once daily, with a maximum of 20 mg once dailyfor both countries . If the dosage is increased to 20 mg, this should occur after a minimum of 1 week. No additional benefits have been seen at 20 mg/day dose."

Contraindications to the use of escitalopram include serotonin s yndrome and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) use (concomitant use with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders, linezolid, or IV meth ylene blue; use within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI intended to treat ps ychiatric disorders [in addition, an MAOI should not be use d within 14 da ys of stopping escitalopram]); concomitant use with pimozide; and known hypersensitivity to escitalopram or citalopram or an y of the inactive ingredients. As with most SSRI s, a gradual reduction in the dosage rather than abrupt cessation of escitalopram treatment is recommended whenever possible. 1.2.1.2. Sertraline Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated in adults for the treatment of MDD, obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder (with or without agorapho bia), post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and social anxiet y disorder.65 According to both the US and China prescribing information, sertraline should be administered at a dose of 50mg once daily for the treatment of MDD. While a relationship between dose and effect has not been established for MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, or social anxiety disorder, patients were dosed in a range of 50-200 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of sertraline for the treatment of these indications. Consequently , a dose of 50 mg, administered once daily, is recom mended as the initial therapeutic dose. Patients not responding to a 50 mg dose may benefit from dose increases up to a maximum of 200 mg/day . Given the 24-hour elimination half-life of sertraline, dose changes should not occur at intervals of less than 1 week. The maximum dose of sertraline in the current study is 200mg/day. Contraindications to the use of sertraline include serotonin syndrome and MAOI use (concomitant use with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders, linezolid, or IV methylene blue; use within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI intended to treat ps ychiatric disorders); concomitant use with pimozide; and known hy persensitivity to sertraline or any of the inactive ingredients. In adult subjects, the most common TEAEs associat ed with the use of sertraline (incidence of at least 5% for sertraline or at least twice that for placebo within at least one of the indications) were ejaculation failure, dry mouth, increased sweating, somnolence, tremor, dizziness, fatigue, pain, malaise, abdominal pain, anorexia, constipation, diarrhea/loose stools, dyspepsia, nausea, agitation, insomnia, and decreased libido. As with most SSRI s, a gradual reduction in the dosage rather than abrupt cessation treatment is recommended whenever possible."

Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors 1.2.2.1. Duloxetine Duloxetine is indicated in adults for MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and chronic musculoskeletal pain.17 The starting dosage for MDD in both the US and China prescribing information is 40 to 60mg/day. The dosage for acute treatment is 40 to 60 mg/day, with maintenance treatment at 60mg/day . For some patients, it may be desirable to start at 30 mg once daily for 1 week, to allow patients to adjust to the medication before increasing to 60 mg once dail y.74 In the current study , subjects should be initiated with 60 mg/day . Subjects that have in the past shown increased sensitivity towards SSRI /SNRI s can, at the discretion of the treating physician, be started on a 30 mg dose and up-titrated into the therapeutic range of 60mg by the start of Week- 2 of the double -blind treatment phase. The maximum dosage is 120 mg/day , although there is no eviden ce that dosages greater than 60mg/day confer any additional benefits. The maximum dose to be used in this study is 60mg/day . For pooled studies for all approved indications, the most commonly observed adverse reactions in duloxetine -treated subjects (incidence of at least 5% and at least twice the incidence in placebo subjects) were nausea, dry mouth, somnol ence, fatigue, constipation, decreased appetite, and hyperhidrosis. As observed in diabetic peripheral neuropathy studies, duloxetine treatment worsens gl ycemic control in some subjects with diabetes. Contraindications to the use of duloxetine include use of anMAOI concomitantly or within 2weeks of MAOI use; and use in patients with uncontrolled narrow -angle glaucoma. A gradual reduction in the dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible. 1.2.2.2. Venlafaxine Extended- release Venlafaxine X R is indicated in adults for MDD and social anxiety disorder.71 The starting dosage for MDD in both the US and China prescribing information is 75 mg/day (in some patients, 37.5 mg/day for 4 to 7 days), with a dosage increase by 75 mg/day at intervals of 4days or longer, and a maximum dosage of 225 mg/day . Dosage reductions are recommended for hepatic impairment (including mild) and renal impairment. Contraindicat ions to the use of venlafaxine XR include serotonin syndrome and MAOI use (concomitant use with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders, linezolid, or IV methylene blue; use within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI intended to treat psychiat ric disorders); concomitant use with pimozide; and known hy persensitivity to venlafaxine XR or any of the inactive ingredients."

Sustained hypertension is noted within the Warnings and Precautions section. Preexisting hypertension should be controlled before treatment with venlafaxine XR. It is recommended that patients receiving venlafaxine XR tablets have regular moni toring of blood pressure. For patients who experience a sustained increase in blood pressure while receiving venlafaxine XR, either dosage reduction or discontinuation should be considered. Across most indications, a dose-related increase in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure was evident in venlafaxine XR -treated patients. Across all clinical studies, 1.4% of subjects in the venlafaxine XR-treated groups experienced a ≥15-mmHg increase in supine diastolic blood pressure, with blood pressure ≥105 mmHg, compared with 0.9% of subjects in the placebo groups. Similarly , 1% of subjects in the venlafaxine XR-treated groups experienced a ≥20mmHg increase in supine systolic blood pressure, with blood pressure ≥180 mmHg, compared with 0.3% of subjects in the placebo groups. A gradual dosage reduction, individualized as necessary , is recommended to avoid discontinuation symptoms. 1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study The current study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safety , tolerability and pharmacokinetics of flexible doses of intranasal esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant in adult subjects with TRD. The study will serve as a Phase 3 efficacy and safet y study in support of regulatory agency requirements in China for registration of intranasal esketamine for the treatment of TRD. 2.

Overvie w of Study Phases Screening/ Prospective Observational phase (4-week duration + optional 3- week taper period) This phase will prospectively assess treatment response to the subject’s current oral antidepressant treatment regimen. At the start of the scree ning/prospective observational phase, the subject must have had documented non- response to at least 1 antidepressant treatment (based on Massachuset ts General Hospital –Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH -ATRQ]) in the current episode of depression, and subject is taking a different oral antidepressant treatment (on the MGH -ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Dose adjustment is permitted per clinical judgment, but the oral antid epressant treatment is to remain at or above the minimum therapeutic dose (per the MGH -ATRQ) through the end of Week 4.Antidepressant treatment adherence will be assessed using the PAQ. Subjects who report missing ≥4 days of antidepressant medication treatment(s) in the prior 2-week period will be considered as screen failed due to inadequate adherence. After 4 weeks, subjects who are non-responders to their current oral antidepressant treatment (as assessed by independent, remote raters) may be eligible to proceed to the double -blind treatment phase. Non -response at the end of the screening/prospective observational phase is defined as ≤25% improvement in the MADRS total score from Week 1 to Week 4 and a MADRS tota l score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. Eligible subjects who are entering the double -blind treatment phase will discontinue all of their current medication(s) being taken for depression (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies ), and any other prohibited psy chotropic medications (including adjunctive atypical antips ychotics ). Subjects taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg,zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon ) during the screening/prospective observational phase, can continue these medications during the treatment phase No dose increases beyond the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam or new benzodiazepine medications are permitted during the screening/prospective observational phase. If clinically indicated, a subject’s current antidepressant treatment(s) may be tapered and discontinued over an additional, optional period of up to 3weeks per the local prescribing information or clinical judgment, or discontinued and switched directl y to one of the four new oral antidepressant medications on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, per clinical judgment."

The intranasal treatment sessions (esketamine 56 mg, 84 mg or placebo) will occur twice per week for 4 weeks as a flexible dose regimen at the study site. In addition, all subjects will initiate a new open -label oral antidepressant on Day 1, that will be taken daily for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase . The assigned oral antidepressant will be 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medica tions (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release [XR]), that the subject has not previously had a non -response to in the current depressive episode, has not been previously intolerant to (lifetime), and is available in the parti cipating country . Subjects who were taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon) during the screening/prospective observational phase can continue these medications during the double -blind treatment phase. No dose increases beyond the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam or new benzodiazepine medications are permitted during the double- blind treatment phase, with the exception of the use of permitted benzodiazepine rescue medication (eg, alprazolam, clorazepate, triazolam, lorazepam and temazepam) . Intranasal Treatment Sessions: All subjects will self-administer the intranasal study medication (esketamine or placebo) at treatment sessions occurring twice a week for 4 weeks at the clinical site. Treatment is assigned by the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). Table 1in Section 6.2describes how each treatment session will be administered in the d ouble -blind treatment phase. On Day 1, subjects randomized to intranasal esketamine will start with a dose of 56mg. On any of the subsequent dosing day s (Day 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 25), the investigator can judge, based on efficacy and tolerability , whether to increase the dose of intranasal esketamine to 84mg or to maintain the dose at 56mg. In the event that an increase in dose is poorl y tolerated, the investigator may decide to reduce the dose to 56 mg. Oral Antidepressant Treatment: Starting on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, a new open -label oral antidepressant treatment will be initiated in all subjects. The oral antidepressant selected will be 1 of the 4 oral antidepressant medications allowed (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release [XR]). The antidepressant medication will be assigned b y the investigator based on review of MGH -ATRQ and relevant prior antidepressant medication information and will be one that the subject has not previously had a non -response to, in the current major depressive e pisode, has not been previousl y intolerant to (lifetime) , and is available in participating country ."

Doses are not to exceed the maximum dose defined in the titration schedule. If higher doses are not tolerated, a dow n-titration is permitted based on clinical judgment. Refer to the Time and Events Schedule for a list of study evaluations that will be performed during the double-blind treatment phase. If a subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind treatment phase for reasons other than withdrawal of consent, an Early Withdrawal visit should be conducted within 1 week of the date of discontinuation , followed by the follow -up phase . Follow -up Phase (8 -weeks or until relapse) The follow -up phase will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication in the double -blind treatment phase. No intranasal study medication will be administered during this phase. At the start of the follow- up phase, further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating physician and medication changes are permitted. The decision to continue the oral antidepressant in this phase will be at the discretion of the investigator. This follow -up phase will provide additional information required to assess the course of the subject’s major depressive episode over an 8-week period.

Study Population The study population will consist of approximately 234subjects (210 Chi nese subjects, 24 non- Chinese subjects) with TRD. After giving informed consent, subjects who are 18 to 64years of age (inclusive), will be screened to determine eligibility for study participation. Subjects must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders –Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnostic criteria for recurrent MDD or single -episode MDD , without psychotic features, based upon clinical assessment and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsy chiatric Interview (MINI) [DSM -5 diagnostic code 296.23 or 296.33]. An independent rater will conduct the MADRS at screening as well as confirming the diagnosis and the validity of the major depressive episode .81"

At the start of this study , subjects must have had non-response (ie, lack of clinicall y meaningful improvement, defined as ≤25% improvement) to ≥1 but ≤5 (if current episode is ˃2years or undefinable, upper limit is only applicable to the last 2 years) oral antidepressant treatments, taken at adequate dosage and for adequate duration, as assessed using the MGH -ATRQ and documented by records (eg, medical/pharmacy /prescription records or a letter from treating physician, etc.) for the current episode of depression. Subjects who have had some initial response but then lose the response (eg, tolerance effects/bradyph ylaxis) to an antidepressant treatment will not be considered to have failed that antidepressant treatment. The use of historical da ta to define non-response to treatment prior to patient enrollment in a treatment study is considered practical and valid. The MGH -ATRQ is a validated tool assessing treatment response. In addition, at the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, subject s must currently be taking one of a different oral antidepressant treatment (on the MGH -ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including adjunctive/ augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of Week -1 through the end of Week -4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Dose adjustment is permitted per clinical judgment, but the oral antidepressant treatment is to remain at or above the minimum therapeutic dose (per the MGH -ATRQ) through the end of Week -4.Antidepressant treatment adherence will be assessed using the PAQ. Subjects who report missing ≥4 day s of antidepressant medicat ion treatment(s) in the prior 2 -week period will be considered as screen failed due to inadequate adherence. Non-response at the end of the screening/prospective observational phase is defined as ≤25% improvement in the MADRS total score from Week 1 to Week 4 and a MADRS total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. The subject’s current major depressive episode, depression symptom severity (Week 1 MADRS total score ≥28 required), and antidepressant treatment response in their current depressive episode (retrospectivel y assessed) must be deemed valid for participation in the clinical study based on a C-VISA. The C-VISA is a tool to facilitate subject selection for MDD clinical studies, with a goal to ensure enrollment of subjects who have symptoms that reflect the current state of illness and that these symptoms can be reliabl y measured with appropriate measurement tools, as well as to help reduce placebo response . Potential subjects will be excluded from participating in the study if they have previousl y demonstrated non-response of depressive symptoms to esketamine or ketamine in the current major depressive episode, or to all 4 of the oral antidepressant treatment options available for the double -blind treatment phase (ie, duloxetine, escitalopram, ser traline, and venlafaxine XR) in the current major depressive episode (based on MGH -ATRQ), or an adequate course of treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the current major depressive episode, defined as at least 7treatments with unilateral/ bilateral ECT.

Study Phases The Company sponsored phase 3 esketamine studies (ESKETINTRD3001, ESKETI NTRD3002, ESKETINTRD3003, ESKETINTRD3004 and ESKETINTRD3005)56,57,58,59,60in subjects with treatment resistant depression, all consist of a 4 week screening/prospective observational phase plus an optional 3 week taper, and a 4 week induction or treatment phase. The follow -up phase is of variable duration. The 4 -week duration of the screening/prospective observational phase will provide adequate time to assess subject eligibility according to the study entry criteria while also allowing for a prospective confirmation of non-response to the current antidepressant treatment(s) that is continued for the duration of this phase. This method of recruitment allows subjects to enter the study on a variet y of different antidepressant medications that they had been taking, which mimics clinical practice and yet allows for prospective demonstration of treatment resistance to the current antidepressant treatment. Even though there is no depression rating score available at the start of the antidepressant treatment, subjects at screening will have to meet criteria for moderate to severe depression. After 4 weeks of prospective observation of continuation of the current antidepressant treatment and assessment of treatment response, subjects who meet the predefined non-response criteria and are eligible to enter the double -blind treatment phase will discontinue all of the current antidepressant treatments, including adjunctive/augmentation therapies, prior to starting the next phase. Non -responders who are eligible to enter the double -blind treatment phase are permitted to have up t o 3 additional weeks to taper and discontinue their current antidepressant treatment prior to entry into the double -blind treatment phase per the local prescribing information or clinical judgment (eg, tolerability concerns). The optional taper period of up to 3 weeks is expected to provide an adequate amount of time for taper and discontinuation. As described in Section 1.1.2 , the duration of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase was selected based upon the onset of effect of t ypical antidepressant treatments and that the duration is considered to be sufficiently long to show the antidepressant effects of the active comparator. Preliminary findings from an analy sis of antidepressant treatments were presented recentl y, as well as a completed analy sis of 24 recent MDD studies that compared study durations of 4, 6, and 8weeks. Exploratory analyses were conducted for each of the stud y durations using mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) but excluding data bey ond the duration of interest. These preliminary findings suggest that it is plausible to shorten the study duration down to 4 weeks.40,79 Similarly , it has been demonstrated that improvement of ≥25% on the Hamilton Depression"

For subjects entering the follow -upphase, the 8-week duration following the last dose of intranasal study medication will allow sufficient time to assess safet y and tolerability after cessation of intranasal study medication. Given the frequency of esketamine administration, the 8-week follow -up should be sufficient to assess potential withdrawal symptoms and reversibility ofany drug related adverse events and/or laboratory abnormalities. Itwill provide additional information required to assess the course of the subject’s major depressive episode over an 8-week period. During this phase, the subject may continue to receive oral antidepressant treatment or follow clinical/standard of care, as judged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating physician . 3.2.3. Blinding and Randomization Blinded intranasal treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collec tion and evaluation of clinical endpoints. An intranasal placebo control will be used in the double -blind treatment phase to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of intranasal active treatment . Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups , and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. The randomization will be stratified by country , class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) and consent to biomarker evaluation(Yes or No) with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to pl acebo or esketamine. The stratification is aimed at balancing treatment groups across two countries ,class of antidepressant and whether subjects consent to biomarker evaluation . 3.2.4. Treatment Groups and Dose Selection The 2 treatment groups in the double -blind treatment phase are: Active comparator (open -label new oral antidepressant) plus intranasal placebo Intranasal esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg ) plus open- label new oral antidepressant During the double -blind treatment phase, subjects will be random ized to receive intranasal treatment with esketamine (56 mg or 84 mg) or placebo. In addition, subjects will simultaneously initiate a new, open -label oral antidepressant on Day 1 that will be continued for the duration of the 4- week double -blind treatment phase. Not applicable to China"

Intranasal Study Drug The dose selection (56 mg and 84 mg) and administration interval (2 treatment sessions per week for 4 weeks) for this study were based on the sponsor’s previous clinical data, notabl y results from Studies ESKETIVTRD2001, KETIVTRD2002, ESKETINTRD1001, and Panel A of Study ESKETINTRD2003, described above in Section 1.1.2 . The data from Stud y ES KETINTRD2003 Panel A support the h ypotheses that both the 56 mg and 84mgdoses are effective as a treatment for depression in subjects with TRD, that they have a rapid onset of effect, and that 2 treatment sessions per week can sustain the response throughout the 4-week duration of the double -blind treatment phase. In addition, the 56mg and 84mg dosages were generally well tolerated by subjects. Small differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic profile of esketamine between health y Chinese and Caucasian subjects who were administered a single 56mg intranasal dose of esketamine (ESKETINTRD1008)8. The mean plasma Cmaxand AU ∞of esketamine were approximately 15% and 33% higher, respectivel y, in Chinese subjects as compared to Caucasian subjects. The mean terminal half-life was slightl y longer in Chinese subjects (8.8hours) than in Caucasians (6.8hours). Intranasall y administered esketamine 56mg was well tolerated in both cohorts. Based on comparable responses of the two population cohorts to the 56mg dose, and on data from the Caucasian population (ESKETINTRD2003)10, we expected the 84mg dose to be both efficacious and tolerated in the Chinese population. The use of flexible dosing, rather than using a fixed dose, of intranasal esketamine is considered to facilitate improved tolerability by graduall y increasing to a higher dose and will also inform clinical practice, as many clinicians prefer to gradually increase, and then adjust as clinically required, the dose of an antidepressant medication. Oral Antidepressant On Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, a new, open -label oral antidepressant treatment will be initiated in all subjects. Each subject will be assigned to receive 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications from 2 different classes of antidepressant treatments, an SSRI (escitalopram or sertraline) or an SNRI (duloxetine or venlafaxine XR). The oral antidepressant medication selected are all recommended as standard- of-care treatment sfor depression, and therefore expected to show comparable efficacy . The antidepressant medication will be assigned by the investigator based on review of MGH -ATRQ and relevant prior antidepressant medication information."

Doses are not to exceed the maximum dose defined in the titration schedule . If higher doses are not tolerated, a down -titration is permitted based on clinician’s judgment. 3.2.5. Efficacy Measures MADRS The 10-item clinician -administered MADRS was designed to be used in subjects with MDD to measure the overall severity of depressive s ymptoms.43,44The MADRS scale has been selected as the primary efficacy measure for this study because it is validated, reliable, and acceptable to regulatory health authorities as a primary scale to determine efficacy in major depression. The MADRS has been validated in Chinese subjects with MDD.81 The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in the MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1,prior to randomization) to the end of the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase. In addition to the primary efficacy measure, the change in MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1, prior to randomization) to 24 hours post dose (Day 2) will be included as akey secondary efficacy endpoint to evaluate rapid reduction of depressive s ymptom s. In this study , subjects in any of the 2 treatment groups who respond to the study medication (ie,responders) are defined as subjects who meet the criterion for response defined as ≥50% reduction in the MADRS total score from baseline (Day 1,pre-random ization) to the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase. MADRS will also be used to evaluate a secondary objective assessing the onset of clinical response (ie, antidepressant effect) by Day2 that is maintained for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase .Onset of clinical response is defined as ≥50% improvement in MADRS total score by Day2 (ie, the day after taking the first dose of double -blind intranasal medication) that is maintained through the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase with one excursion allowed. Additionally , MADRS will be used to evaluate a secondary objective assessing the proportion of subjects in remission (MADRS total score ≤12) at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase ;and the proportion who remain in remission (MADRS total score ≤12) through to the end of the follow -up phase . The proportion of subject who relapse during the follow -up phase will be evaluated separately for subjects who are remitters (MADRS total score ≤12) at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase and for subjects who are responders but not remitters (≥50% reduction in MADRS total score, but MADRS total score ˃12) at the end of the 4 -week double -blind treatment phase."

Pharmacokinetic A ssessments Serial p harmacokinetic blood samples ( 4mL,each) will be collected from Chinese subjects at all clinical sites, at the time points specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Concentration time data will allow estimation of individual PK parameters for esketamine, using a population PK modeling approach. The timing of PK sample collections waschosen to gather maximal information about the PK properties of esketamine while minimizing subject burden. The exact dates and times of PK blood sampling must be recorded. The concentrations of esketamine will be measured in plasma using a validated liquid chromatograph y coupled to tandem mass spectrometr y (LC MS/MS) achiral method. The concentration of other esketa mine metabolites may be measured in plasma, if required.  Biomarker, Pharmacogenomic (DNA ), and Expression (RNA ) Evaluations Assessment of biomarkers (protein and RNA) and their potential relationship to the different treatment groups and to maintenance/stabilization of response, non-response, and relapse will be explored. Blood samples will be collected to measure genetic and epigenetic markers (including but not limited to BDNF allelic variants) and protein markers (including but not limited to growth factors, inflammation, endocrine, or metabolic). Samples of deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) and biomarkers may be used to help address emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimately individualized therapies. Genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to inter-individual differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain inter-individua l variability in clinical outcomes and ma y help to identif y population subgroups that respond differently to a drug or subgroups that are more susceptible to relapse. In addition, pharmacogenomics research may allow for the identification of genetic factor s that influence the PK, PD, efficacy , safet y, or tolerability of the different treatment groups, and for the identification of genetic factors associated with TRD or MDD. Specifically , genetic and epigenetic changes in genes known to be in pathway s releva nt to depression (eg,hypothalam icpituitary adrenal [HPA] axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, and circadian rh ythm) will be evaluated. Protein, metabolite, and ribonucleic acid (RNA) biomarkers may aid in the elucidat ion of the mechanism of action of the different treatment groups or help to explain inter-individual variability in clinical outcomes or may help to identify population subgroups that respond differently to a drug or may help to identify subgroups that aremore susceptible to relapse .

The randomization will be balanced by using randomly permuted blocks and will be stratified by country , class oforal antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) and consent to biomarker evaluation (Yes or No) to be initiated in the double -blind treatment phase. The interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study drug kits for the subject. After the investigator selects the oral antidepressant treatment for the double -blind treatment phase, the site will enter this information into I WRS. The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS, and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely identify the subject. Blinding The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS,which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject. Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment (eg, intranasal study drug plasma concentrations, treatment allocation) will be handled with spe cial care to ensure that the integrity of the blind is maintained and the potential for bias is minimized. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data in question from view by the investigators, clinical team, or others as appr opriate until the time of database lock and unblinding. Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all subjects have completed the study and the database is finalized. Otherwise, the blind should be broken only if specific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing the treatment status of the subject. In such cases, the investigator may in an emergency determine the identity of the treatment by contacting the IWRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact the sponsor or its designee, if possible, to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone contact with the sponsor or its designee will be available 24 hours per day, 7 day s per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date and time of the unblinding will be documented by the IWRS, and reason for the unblinding must be documented by the electronic case report form (eCRF) and in the source document. The documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the subject's source documents in a secure manner. Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded should continue to return for scheduled earl y withdrawal and follow up visits. In genera l, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed and the clinical database is closed. To maintain the blinding of intranasal study medication, the esketamine and placebo intranasal devices will be indistingui shable. Please refer to Section 14(Study Drug Information) for information on the phy sical characteristics of the study drugs and devices."

DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTR ATION 6.1. Screening/Prospective O bservational Phase (4- week duration + optional 3-week taper period) This phase will prospectively assess treatment response to the subject’s current oral antidepressant treatment regimen. At the start of the screening/prospective observational phase, the subject must have had documented non- response to at least 1 antidepressant treatment (based on Massachuse tts General Hospital –Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire [MGH -ATRQ]) in the current episode of depression, and subject is taking a different oral antidepressant treatment (on the MGH -ATRQ) for at least the previous 2 weeks at or above the minimum therapeutic dose. This antidepressant treatment, as well as any other ongoing medications being taken for depression at screening (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies), will continue from the start of Week 1 through the end of Week 4 of the screening/prospective observational phase. Dose adjustment is permitted per clinical judgment, but the oral antidepressant treatment is to remain a t or above the minimum therapeutic dose (per the MGH -ATRQ) through the end of Week 4.Antidepressant treatment adherence will be assessed using the PAQ. Subjects who report missing ≥4 days of antidepressant medication treatment(s) in the prior 2-week perio d will be considered as screen failed due to inadequate adherence. The sponsor will not supply these antidepressant medication(s). After 4 weeks, subjects who are non-responders to their current oral antidepressant treatment (as assessed by independent, remote raters) may be eligible to proceed to the double -blind treatment phase. Non -response at the end of the screening/prospective observational phase is defined as ≤25% improvement in the MADRS total score from Week 1 to Week 4 and a MADRS total score of ≥28 on Week 2 and Week 4. The MADRS interview should be performed in Week 1 (Visit 1.1or as soon as possible ) of the screening /prospective observational phase. Eligible subjects who are entering the double -blind treatment phase will discontinue all current medication(s) being used for depression treatment (including adjunctive/augmentation therapies ), and any other prohibited psy chotropic medications (including a djunctive aty pical antips ychotics) . Subjects taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg,zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon ) during the screening/prospective observational phase, can continue these medications during the treatment phase. No dose incre ases beyond the equivalent of 6mg/day of lorazepam or new benzodiazepine medications are permitted during the screening/prospective observational phase. If clinicall y indicated, a subject’s current antidepressant treatment(s) may be tapered and discontinued over a n additional optional period of up to 3 weeks per the local prescribing information orperclinical judgment or discontinued and switched directl y to one of the four new oral antidepressant medications on Day 1 o f the double -blind treatment phase, per clinical judgment."

Double -blind Treatment Phase (4 -week duration) Approximately 234 eligible subjects (210 Chinese subjects, 24 non -Chinese subjects) with TRD, will be randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio (n=117 subjects per treatment arm, with approximately 105 Chinese subjects per arm) to receive double -blind treatment with either intranasal esketamine or intranasal placebo. The intranasal treatment sessions (esketamine 56mg, 84mg or placebo) will occur twice per week for 4 weeks as a flexible dose regimen at the study site. In addition, all subjects will initiate a new open -label oral antidepressant on Day 1, that will be taken daily for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase . The assigned oral antidepressant will be 1 of 4 oral antidepressant medications (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release [XR]), that the subject has not previously had a non -response to in the current depressive episode, has not been previously intolerant to (lifetime), and is available in the participating country . Subjects who were taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6mg/day of loraze pam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon , eszopiclone and ramelteon) during the screening/prospective observational phase can continue these medications during the double -blind treatment phase. No dose increases beyond the equivalent of 6 mg/day of lorazepam or new benzodiazepine medications are permitted during the double- blind treatment phase, with the exception of the use of permitted benzodiazepine rescue medication (eg, alprazolam, clorazepate, triazolam, lorazepam and temazepam) . Intranasal Treatment Sessions: All subjects will self-administer the intranasal study medication (esketamine or placebo) at treatment sessions occurring twice a week for 4 weeks at the clinical site. Treatment is assigned by the Interactive Web Response S ystem ( IWRS). The table below describes how each treatment session will be administered in the Double- Blind Treatment Phase.

All subjects will self-administer the intranasal study drug(esketamine or placebo) at treatment sessions twice a week for 4 weeks at the study site. The first treatment session will be on Day 1. Intranasal treatment sessions should not take place on consecutive day s. On Day 1, subjects randomized to intranasal esketamine will start with a dose of 56mg. On any of the subsequent dosing day s (Day 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 25), the investigator can judge, based on efficacy and tolerance, whether to increase the dose of intranasal esketamine to 84mg or to maintain thedose at 56mg. In the event that an increase in dose is poorl y tolerated, the investigator may decide to reduce the dose to 56mg. Food will be restricted for at least 2 hours before each administration of study drug. Drinking of any fluids will be restri cted for at least 30minutes before the first nasal spray . If the subject has nasal congestion on the dosing day, an intranasal decongestant can be used to reduce congestion or the dosing day be delayed (per the permitted visit window; see the Time and Events Schedule). If an intranasal decongestant is used to reduce congestion, it cannot be used within 1 hour prior to intranasal stud y drug dosing. On all intranasal treatment sessions, subjects must remain at the clinical site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge. On all intranasal treatment session days, a site staff member with training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eg,Basic Life Support course or equivalent course) that is up to date per local regulations, must be present with the subject during the intranasal treatment sessions and the postdose observation period. In addition, equipment for supportive ventilation and resuscitation needs to be present. Subjects must remain at the site until study procedures have been completed and the subject is ready for discharge. At the time of discharge, subjects should be accompanied by a responsible adult when released from the clinical site. Subjects must not drive a car or work with machines for 24 hours after receiv ing intranasal study drug. On intranasal dosing days, it is recommended that the oral antidepressant medication not be taken until at least 3hours after an intranasal treatment session, thus providing sufficient time for potential side -effects related to esketamine (including dissociation, increase in blood pressure) to have resolved . Oral Antidepressant Treatment: Starting on Day 1 of the double -blind treatment phase, a new open -label oral antidepressant treatment will be initiated in all subjects. The oral antidepressant selected will be 1 of the 4 oral antidepressant medications allowed (duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, or venlafaxine extended release [XR]). The antidepressant medication will be assigned b y the investigator based on review of MGH -ATRQ and relevant prior antidepressant medication information and will be one that the subject has not previously had a non-response to, in the current depressive episode, has not been previously intolerant to (lifetime) , and is available in the participati ng country ."

Follow -upPhase (8 -weeks or until relapse) The follow -up phase will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication in the double -blind treatment phase. No intranasal study medication will be administered during this phase. At the start of the follow- up phase, further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating physician and medication changes are permitted. The decision to continue the oral antidepressant in this phase will be at the discretion of the investigator. This follow -up phase will provide additional information required to assess the course of the subject’s major depressive episode over an 8-week period. Safet y and tolerability , including potential withdrawal symptoms, following discontinuation of intranasal esketamine will also be assessed.

Guidance on Blood Pressure Monitoring on Intranasal Treatment Session Days Given the potential for treatment emergent transient elevation in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the following guidance should be followed on intranasal dosing day s: If subsequent to fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria on Day 1 (ie, applicable for all other intranasal treatment session days after Day 1), a subject’s pre-dose systolic blood pressure (SBP) is >140 mmHg and/or diasto lic blood pressure (DBP) is >90mmHg, it is recommended to repeat the blood pressure measurement after subject rests in sitting or recumbent position. If after rest and repeated measurements, pre-dose SBP is >140 mmHg and/or DBP is >90 mmHg, then dosing should be postpo ned,and the subject scheduled to return on the following day or within the given visit window. If the blood pressure elevation still persists on the next visit, the subject will be scheduled for a consultation by cardiologist, other specialist, or primary care ph ysician, prior to further dosing. If at any postdose time point on the dosing day, the SBP is ≥180 mmHg but <200 mmHg and/or the DBP is ≥110 mmHg but <120 mmHg, further intranasal dosing should be interrupted and the subject should be referred to acardiologist, other specialist, or primary care ph ysician for a follow -up assessment. After the assessment by a cardiologist, other specialist, or primary care physician, if recommended by the referring doctor and considered appropriate according to the clinical judgment for the subject to continue in the study , the subject may continue with intranasal dosing if the pre-dose blood pressure at the next scheduled visit is within the acceptable range (see bullet point above). If at any postdose time point on the dosing day the SBP is ≥200 mmHg and/or the DBP is ≥120 mmHg, the subject must discontinue from further dosing and the subject should be referred to a cardiologist, other specialist or primary care physician for a follow -up assessment. During the double -blind treatment phase, at 1.5 hours postdose, if the SBP is ≥160 mmHg and/or the DBP ≥100 mmHg, assessments should continue every 30 minutes until: the blood pressure is <160 mmHg SBP and <100 mmHg DBP, or in the investigator’s clinical judgment, the sub ject it is clinically stable and can be discharged from the study site, or the subject is referred for appropriate medical care, if clinically indicated, or if the blood pressure remains ≥180 mmHg SBP and/or ≥110 mmHg DBP, 2 hours after dosing, the subject should be referred for immediate medical treatment. 7.

The antidepressant medication assigned by the investigator (based on review of the MGH -ATRQ and relevant prior antidepressant treatment information) will be one that the subject has not previously had a non-response to in the current depressive episode, has not been previously intolerant to (lifetime), and is available in the participating country . Dosing of the oral antidepressant will begin on Day 1and follow a protoco l specific titration schedule (Attachment 3). The use of the titration schedule provided is mandatory . Doses are not to exceed the maximum dose defined in the titratio n schedule. If higher doses are not tolerated, a down -titration is permitted based on clinical judgment. Subjects who were taking benzodiazepines (at dosages equal to or less than the equivalent of 6mg/day of lorazepam) and/or permitted non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone and ramelteon) during the screening/prospective observational phase can continue these medications during the double -blind treatment phase.

For information obtained via telephone contact, written documentation of the communication must be available for review in the source documents. During telephone contact visits with the subject by site personnel, adverse event and concomitant therap y information will be obtained. In addition, specified clinician -administered assessments will be performed b y appropriately qualified staff. At the e nd of the double -blind treatment phase, subjects will proce ed into the follow -upphase. Early Withdrawal If a subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind treatment phase for reasons other than withdrawal of consent, an Early Withdrawal visit should be conducted within 1week of the date of discontinuation , followed by the follow -up phase . If the Early Withdrawal visit occurs on the same day as a scheduled visit, the early withdrawal visit can be performed on the same day and duplicate assessments are not required. Further clinical/standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating physician. The study investigator and/or treating physician will determine whether or not the current oral antidepressant medication will continue. 9.1.4. Follow -upPhase The follow -up phase will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication in the double -blind treatment phase. No intranasal study medication will be administered during this phase. At the start of the follow- up phase, f urther clinical/standard of care for the treatment of de pression will be arranged by the study investigator and/or the subject’s treating physician and medication changes are permitted. The decision to continue the antidepressant will be at the discretion of the investigator .If the subject continues to receive the same antidepressant medication for the durat ion of the follow -up phase, then the antidepressant will be sourced by the sponsor. This follow -up phase will provide additional information required to assess the course of the subject’s major depressive episode over an 8-week period. Safet y and tolerability , including potential withdrawal symptoms, following discontinuation of intranasal esketamine will be assessed. The follow -up phase is completed at the end of the 8- week period or when a subject meets criteria below for relapse (in remitters and responders), whichever occurs earlier . Relapse is defined as an y of the following: MADRS total score ≥22 for 2 consecutive assessments separated b y 5 to 15 d ays. The date of the second MADRS assessment will be u sed for the date of relapse."

If hospitalized for any of these events, the start date of hospitalization will be used for the date of relapse. Otherwise the date of the event will be used if the subject is not hospitalized. In case more than one relapse criter ia are met, the earlier date will be defined as the date of relapse for this subject. The total duration of a subject’s study participation will be up to 19 -weeks (including an optional 3-week taper period) for subjects completing the 8-week follow -up phase. Clinic visits and remote assessment visits will be performed as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Telephone contact or clinic visit will be made to determine safet y and efficacy assessments and any reported adverse events every week for up to 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug, unless the subject has died, is lost to follow -up, or has withdrawn consent. If the informa tion is obtained via telephone contact, written documentation of the communication must be available for review in the source documents. If the subject has died, the date and cause of death will be collected and document on the CRF. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the End of the Study/Early Withdrawal will be followed b y the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported until completion of the subject's last stud y-related procedure. 9.2. Efficacy Evaluations 9.2.1. Evaluations It is recommended that the various subject -reported outcome assessments be completed prior to other procedures. 9.2.1.1. Primary Efficacy Evaluation The primary efficacy evaluation will be the MADRS total score. The MADRS will be performed by independent remote raters during the study . The Structured Interview Guide for the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (SIGMA: Williams 2008)76will be used for each administration. The MADRS is a clinician -rated scale designed to measure depression severity and detects changes due to antidepressant treatment. The scale consists of 10 items, each of which is scored from 0 (item not present or normal) to 6 (severe or continuous presence of the symptoms), for a total possible score of 60. Higher scores represent a more severe condition. The MADRS evaluates apparent sadness, reported sadne ss, inner tension, sleep, appetite , concentration, lassitude, inability to feel (interest level), pessimistic thoughts, and suicidal thoughts. The test exhibits high inter-rater reliability . The MADRS has been validated in Chinese subjects with MDD.81"

Key Secondary Efficacy Evaluation Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS )Total Score The MADRS will also be administered using a modified recall period of 24 hours for the key secondary efficacy evaluation related tochange from baseline to 24 hours. The feasibility of this shortened recall period has been confirmed with patients, and physicians, and there are data supporting the ps ychometric properties of this shortened recall period (data on file). Sheehan Disability Scale ( SDS) The SDS will be used to assess the secondary objective of functional impact and associated disability . The SDS is a subject -reported outcome measure that consists of a 5- item questionnaire which has been widel y used and accepted for assessment of functional impairment and associated disability .41,67The first three items assess disruption of (1) work/school, (2) social life, and (3)famil y life/home responsibilities using a 0-10 rating scale. The score for the first three items are summed to create a total score of 0-30 where a higher score indicates greater impairment. It also has one item on days lost from school or work and one item on day s when underproductive. The recall period for this study is 7 day s. 9.2.1.3. Other Secondary Efficacy Evaluations 9.2.1.3.1. Other Secondary Efficacy Evaluations (Clinician -completed) Clinical Global Impression –Severity (CGI -S) The CGI-S provides an overall clinician -determined summa ry measure of the severit y of the subject’s illness that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the subject’s history , psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the subject’s abilit y to function.27The CGI-S evaluates the severit y of psychopathology on a scale of 0 to 7. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating according to: 0=not assessed; 1=normal (not at all ill); 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderatel y ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severel y ill; 7=among the most extremely ill patients. The CGI-S permi ts a global evaluation of the subject’s condition at a given time. 9.2.1.3.2. Other Secondary Efficacy Evaluations (Patient -reported Outcomes) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD -7) The 7 -item subject -reported GAD -7 will be used to measure the secondar y objective of s ymptoms of anxiety . The GAD -7 is a brief and validated measure of overall anxiety. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale (0=not at all; 1=several da ys; 2=more than half the days; 3=nearly ever y day).69Item responses are summed to y ield a total score ( range of 0 to 21), with higher scores indicat ingmore anxiety .

It consists of the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive sy stem and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ- VAS). The EQ-5D- 5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: Mobility , self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Each of the 5 dimensions is divided into 5 levels of perceived problems (Level 1 indicating no problem, Level 2 indicating slight problems, Level 3 indica ting moderate problems, Level 4 indicating severe problems, and L evel 5 indicating extreme problems). The subject selects an answer for each of the 5 dimensions considering the response that best matches his or her health “toda y.” The descriptive system ca n be represented as a health state. The EQ-VAS self -rating records the respondent’s own assessment of his or her overall health status at the time of completion, on a scale of 0 to 100. The time taken to complete the questionnaire varies with age, health status, and setting but is likely to be around 1 minute. 9.3. Pharmacokinetics (Chinese subjects only) Whole blood samples will be used to evaluate the PK of esketamine (JNJ-54135419). Plasma collected for PK may additionally be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects that address concerns arising during or after the study period. Genetic anal yses will not be performed on these blood samples. Subject confidentiality will be maintained. 9.3.1. Evaluations Venous blood samples of approximately 4mL will be collected from Chinese subjects at all clinical sites, for measurement of plasma concentrations of esketamine (JNJ-54135419), (and other metabolites, if warranted) ,at the time points specified inthe Time and Events Schedule. The exact dates and times of PK blood sampling must be recorded. 9.3.2. Analytical Procedures Pharmacokinetics Serial pharmacokinetic blood samples (4 mL,each) will be collected from Chinese subjects at all study sites, at the time points specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Concentration time data will allow estimation of individual PK parameters for esketamine using a population PK modeling approach. The exact dates and times of PK blood sampling must be recorded. Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of esketamine using a validated, specific, and sensitive liquid chromatograph y-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method by or under the supervision of the sponsor. If required, some plasma samples may be analy zed to document the presence of other analytes (eg,circulating metabolites or denatonium) using a qualified research method. In addition, plasma PK samples may be stored for future analy sis of the metabolite profile. The bioanaly tical report, including a description of the assay and a summary of the assay performance data, will be included in the final clinical study report as an a ppendix."

Pharmacokinetic Parameters The plasma concentration -time data of esketamine will beanaly zed using population PK modeling. Typical population values of basic PK parameters (eg, esketamine clearance anddistribution volumes) will be estimated together with the inter-individual variability . Effects of subject demographics, laboratory parameter values, and other covaria tes on the PK of esketamine will be explored. The results of the population PK anal yses may be reported separately . 9.4. Biomarker, Pharmacogenomic (DNA ), and Expression (RNA ) Evaluations During the study , blood will be collected for the assessment of biomark ers at the time points indicated in the Time and Events schedule. The biomar ker blood samples should be collected prior to dosing. It is preferred that subjects adhere to a low- fat diet on the day of sample collection. In blood, biomarkers (protein, metabo lite, and ribonucleic acid [RNA]) related to (but not limited to) the immune system activity , hypothalamus pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activation, neurotrophic factors, and metabolic factors will be investigated. Biomarkers may be added or deleted based o n scientific information or technical innovations under the condition that the total volume of blood collected will not be increased. The biomarker data obtained from this study may also be included in an ongoing cross- study analysis to investigate the relationship between depression severity and phenot ypes and biomarkers. Blood samples for DNA analyses will be collected at the time points indicated in the Time and Events Schedule for the assessment of genetic and epigenetic variation in genes in pathway s relevant to depression (eg, HPA axis, inflammation, growth factors, monoamine transporters, ion channels, and circadian rhy thm). Genoty ping will be conducted onl y on the screening sample; pharmacogenomic and epigenetic evaluations may be performed on an y/all collected samples. DNA samples will be used for research related to esketamine, oral antidepressants, TRD, or MDD. They may also be used to develop tests/assays related to esketamine, oral antidepressants, TRD, or MDD. Pharmacogenomic research may consis t of the analy sis of 1 or more candidate genes or of the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (as appropriate) in relation to esketamine, oral antidepressants, TRD, or MDD clinical endpoints.

Safety Evaluations Any clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the study must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the eCRF. Any clinically significant abnormalities persisting at the end of the stud y/early withdrawal will be followed b y the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached. The study will include the following evaluations of safet y and tolerability according to the time points provided in the Time and Events Schedule. There may be instances where a subject has started a scheduled clinic visit in which an intranasal treatment session is planned, but due to predose vital sign measurements (eg, blood pressure value), a decision has been made to postpone/delay the intranasal treatment session within the visit window permitted per protocol. I n such cases, all time points (including predose) of the following assessments must be repeated on the actual intranasal treatment session day: vital sign (ie, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature), 12-lead ECG, C- SSRS (since last visit), pulse oximetry , and CADSS. Adverse Events Adverse events will be reported b y the subject (or, when appropriate, b y a caregi ver, surrogate, or the subject's legall y acceptable representative) for the duration of the study. Adverse events will be followed b y the investigator as specified in Section 12, Adverse Event Reporting. TEAEs of special interest will be examined separately (please refer to Section 3.2.6 , Safety Evaluations and Section 11.6, Safet y Anal yses). Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology and a urine sample for urinal ysis will be collected. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the study in the adverse event section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. The use of local labor atories is allowed in cases where initiation of treatment or safety follow -up is time-critical and the central laboratory results are not expected to be available before the need to begin dosing or if actions need to be taken for safet y reasons.

If oxygen saturation levels are <93% at any time during the 1.5-hour postdose interval, pulse oximetry will be recorded every 5 minutes until levels return to ≥93% or until the subject is referred for appropriate medical care, if clinically indicated. Physical Examination, Height, Body Weight Physical ex aminations, body weight, and height will be performed /measured as per the Time and Events Schedule. Nasal Examinations Nasal examinations (including the upper respiratory tract/throat) will be conducted by a qualified healthcare practitioner. The objecti ve of the examination at screening isto rule out any subjects with anatomical or medical conditions that may impede drug delivery or absorption. Subsequent examinations will consist of a visual inspection of the nostrils, nasal mucosa, and throat for nas al erythema, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, capillary/blood vessel disruption, and epistaxis, and will be graded as follows: Absent, mild, moderate, or severe. C-SSRS The C -SSRS will be performed to assess potential suicidal ideation and behavior. The C-SSRS is alow-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was developed in the National I nstitute of Mental Health Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess severit y and track suicid al events through an y treatment.54It is a clinical interview providing a summary of both suicidal ideation and behavior that can be administered during any evaluation or risk assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C -SSRS can also be used during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening. Two versions of the C-SSRS will be used in this study , the Baseline/Screening version, and the Since Last Visit version. The Baseline/Screening version of the C-SSRS will be used in the screening/prospective observational phase. In this version, suicidal ideation will be assessed at 2time points (“lifetime” and “in the past 6 months”) and suicidal behavior will be assessed at 2time points (“lifetime” and “in the past year”). All subsequent C -SSRS assessments in this study will use the Since Last Visit version, which will assess suicidal ideation and behavior since the subject’s last visit. CADSS The CADSS is an instrument for the measurement of present- state dissociative symptoms,3and will be administered to assess treatment -emergent dissociative sy mptoms.3 The CADSS consists of 23 subjective items, divided into 3 components: Depersonalization (Items 3 to 7, 20, and 23), derealization (Items 1, 2, 8 to 13, 16 to19, and 21) and amnesia (Items 14, 15, and 22).

An assessment will be performed on Day 25 to establish a baseline prior to discontinuation of intranasal esketamine treatment. In order to better assess potential withdrawal symptoms from the intranasal medication it is recommended that the oral antidepressant medication be continued for at least the first 2 weeks of the follow up phase unless determined as not clinically appropriate. The PWC -20 is a 20-item simple and accurate method to assess potential development of discontinuation symptoms after stopping of study drug. The PWC -20 is a reliable and sensitive instrument for the assessment of discontinuation symptoms.61Discontinuation symptoms occur early and disappear rather swiftly , depending upon speed of taper, daily medication dose, and drug elimination half -life. 9.6. Other Evaluations MINI Subjects will undergo MIN I (a brief, structured diagnostic interview) to confirm the diagnosis of MDD and to determine if there are other psychiatric conditions present. It has an administration time of approximately 15 minutes. MGH -ATRQ The MGH -ATRQ is used to determin e treatment resistance in MDD.14 The MGH -ATRQ evaluates the adequacy of duration and dosage of all antidepressant medications used for the current major depressive episode. In addition, the MGH -ATRQ assesses the degree of improvement on a scale from 0% (not improved at all) to 100% (completely improved). The MGH - ATRQ will be completed by the clinician in collaboration with the subject. Clinical Valid ation Inventory for Study Admission Independent psychiatrists/psy chologists will perform the Clinical Validation Inventory for Study Admission (C -VISA) in the screening/prospective observational phase for all subjects to confirm diagnosis of depression an d eligibility for the study .70 Further information regarding this assessment will be provided to sites in a separate document. PAQ Subjects’ adherence to their oral antidepressant treatment regimen during the screening/prospective observational phase will be assessed using the PAQ. It is a brief, 2-item subject -report outcome measure that was developed at the University of Texas South western Medical Center to assess how often the subject has taken, and whether he or she has made any changes to his/her antidepressant treatment regimen in the last 2 weeks. The total score is based on the response selected to Question 1 and is interpreted as0to 1 =adherent and 2or more=nonadherent."

If blood samples are collected via an indwelling cannula, an appropr iate amount (1 mL) of serosanguineous fluid slightl y greater than the dead space volume of the lock will be removed from the cannula and discarded before each blood sample is taken. After blood sample collection, the cannula will be flushed with 0.9% sodium chloride, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) (or equivalent) and charged with a volume equal to the dead space volume of the lock. Refer to the Time and Events Schedule for the timing and frequency of all sample collections. Instructions for the collection , handling, storage, and shipment of samples are found in the laboratory manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated in the laboratory manual. 10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/DISCONTINUA TION OF STUDY TREATMENT/ WITHDRA WAL FROM THE STUDY 10.1. Completion A subject will be considered to have completed the double -blind treatment phase of the study if he or she has completed the MADRS assessment at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase (ie, Day 28 MADRS). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for any reason before completi on of the double -blind treatment phase will not be considered to have completed the dou ble-blind treatment phase of the stud y. Subjects who enter the follow -upphase will be considered to have completed this phase of the study if he or she has completed the MADRS assessment at Week 8 of the follow -upphase , or when the subject meets criteria for relapse (in remitters and responders), whichever occurs earlier. 10.2.

See also guidance on blood pressure monitoring on intranasal dosing day s (Section 6.4). At any time point after baseline (Day 1, predose), the subject has a: QTcF change from baseline 60msec AND QTcF >480 msec, or QTcF >500 msec. Subject becomes pregnant Death If the subject withdraws from the study before the end of the double -blind treatment phase, an Early Withdrawal vi sit is to be performed , followed by the follow -up phase . If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by the study site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal. This should include at least 3telephone calls, certified letters, email requests, etc. To ensure access to follow -up subjects, the study sites should attempt to obtain both primary and secondary telephone contact numbers (eg, home, work, and mobile phone numbers), as well as other contact information (eg,email addresses) from subjects before randomization. In addition, the study site should emphasize the importance of follow -up information to the subject before randomization. The measures taken to follow up must be document ed. When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced. Withdrawal of Consent Every effort will be made in the study to ens ure withdrawal of consent is not selected as a reason for discontinuation when in fact the subject withdrew for an identifiable reason (eg,due to an adverse event or withdrew due to lack of efficacy)."

Subjects who are not agreeable to follow -up contact will be withdrawn from the study as “withdrawal of consent .”Subjects who no longer wish to take stud y drug but agree to provide follow- up information will be withdrawn from the double -blind treatment phase with the reason noted as “Other” and will specify the reason why. For a subject who does “withdrawal of consent”, it is recommended that the subject withdraw consent in writing; if the subject refuses or is physically unavailable, the study site should document and sign the reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing and maintain it with the subject’ s source records. The investigator will be responsible for making all required notifications to the Institutional Review Board (I RB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC). 10.3. Withdrawal from t he Use of Samples in Future Research The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for research (refer to Section 16.2.5 , Long Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . Details of the sample retention for research are presented in the main I CF. 11. STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan. 11.1. Subject Information For all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug, descriptive statistics will be provided. The primary efficacy and safet y analysis sets are defined below: Full Analysis Set: All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication and 1 dose of oral antidepressant in the double -blind treatment phase . Safety Analysis Set: All randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study medication or 1 dose of oral antidepressant in the double -blind treatment phase. The efficacy and safet y analyses in the double -blind treatment phase will be based on the full analysis set and safet y analysis set, respectivel y. Follow -up analy sis set which includes all subjects who enter follow -up phase will be used for both efficacy and safet y analy ses in the follow -up phase.

Sample Size Determination Assuming a treatment difference for the double -blind phase of 6.5 points in MADRS total score between esketamine plus oral antidepressant compared with oral antidepre ssant plus intranasal placebo at the Week 4 endpoint, a standard deviation of 12, a one-sided significance level of 0.025, and a drop -out rate of 25%, approximately 117 subjects will be randomized to each treatment arm to achieve greater than 90% power , and a sample size of 105 Chinese subjects per treatment arm (total n = 210) plus 12 non -Chinese subjects per treatment arm (total of n = 24) will be included . The treatment difference and standard deviation used in this calculation were based on results from Pane l A of the ESKETINTRD2003 study10and based on clinical judgment. 11.3. Efficacy Analyses Efficacy analyses will be performed on the full analysis set, which will include all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of intranasal study drug and 1 dose of oral antidepressant medication, in the dou ble-blind treatment phase. Primary Endpoint The primary estimand, the main clinical quantity of interest to be estimated in the study , is defined by the following 4 components: Population : subjects with treatment- resistant depression; Variable : change from Day 1 to end of 4- week double -blind treatment phase ; Intervention Effect : the effect of the initially randomized treatment together with the oral antidepressant medication that would have been observed had all subjects remained on their treatment throughout the double -blind treatment phase ; Summary Measure : the difference in variable means . The primary analy sis will be based on the full analy sis set and the MADRS total scores collected during the double -blind treatment phase. For the primary efficacy analysis, change from baseline in MADRS total score at Week 4 in the double -blind treatment phase will be anal yzed using a mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include baseline MADRS total score as a covariate, and treatment, country , class of antidepressant (Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors [SNRI ] or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor [SSRI ]), day, and day-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. Comparison of the esketamine plus oral antidepressant arm to the active comparator (oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo) arm will be performed using the appropriate contrast. Missing data will be closely monitored and additional s ensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint to assess the robustn ess of the results to missing data might be performed. The detailed assumptions and methods will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP) , if necessary ."

The second key efficacy endpoint, change from baseline in SDS total score at Week 4 in the double -blind treatment phase, will be analy zed using the same models described above for the MADRS total score. To strongl y control Type I error across the primary and the two key secondary efficacy endpoints, a fixed sequence approach15,16will be applied to adjust for multiplicity . The hypotheses will be tested sequentiall y in the following order: Change in MADRS total score at the end of the 4- week double -blind treatment phase Change in MADRS total score at 24 hours post first dose Change in SDS total score Further details of this approach will be provided in the SAP. The proportion of subjects showing onset of clinical response by Day 2 (in the event that no MADRS was col lected on Day 2, a MADRS collected on Day 3 could be used) that is maintained for the duration of the double -blind treatment phase (≥50% reduction in MADRS total score by the second day after taking the first dose of double -blind medication that continued through the end of the double -blind phase) in esketamine arm will be compared with the active comparator using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test adjusting for country and class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI). Subjects who discontinued the study prior to the end of the double -blind treatment phase will not be considered to have maintained clinical response. Response and remission rates will be summarized at each visit. The proportion of subjects who remain in remission through to the end of the follow-upphase will be presented. Change from baseline in GAD-7 total scores at the end of the 4-week double -blind treatment phase will be analy zed using an ANCOVA model, with treatment, country and class of antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) as factors, and the respective baseline score as the covariate. Ranks of change from baseline in CGI-S scores during the 4-week double -blind treatment phase will be analy zed using the MMRM for repeat measures ,as described for the MADRS and SDS total scores. Additional analy sis method for CGI-S will be used if necessary and the details will be provided in the SAP.

Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally associat ed with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product (definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]). This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing ofthe ICF (refer to Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events, for time of last adverse event recording). Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event based on ICH and EUGuidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (for example, the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. “Life threatening” does not refer to an event that hy pothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product Is medicall y important* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as imp ortant medical events that may not be immediatel y life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually beconsidered serious."

Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with theapplicable product reference safet y information. For esketamine, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the Reference Safet y Information Section of the Investigator's Brochure.34 For duloxetine, escitalopram, sertraline, and venlafaxine XR, the expectedness of an adverse event will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the SmPC or US prescr ibing information.17,18,21,22,65,66,71,72 Adverse Event Associated w ith the Use of the Drug An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likel y by the definitions listed under Attribution Defin itions in Section 12.1.2 . 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug. Doubtful An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . Possible An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanati on, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (eg, confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likel y, eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). Very Likely An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained by an alternative explanation, eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge)."

Severity Criteria An assessment of severity grade will be made using the followi ng general categorical descriptors: Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity . Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, l aboratory abnormalities). 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study drug that may require expedited reporting and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study drug Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor stud y drug Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor study drug Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the sponsor study drug, eg, name confusion) Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page of the eCRF. 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure (which may include contact for follow -up of safet y), with the exception of pregnancy which will b e reported up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study medication (females) or 90 day s after the last dose of study medication (partners of male participants). Serious adverse events, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator, must be repor ted using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported b y an investigator bey ond the time frame specified in the protocol. All events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event will be reported as serious adverse events, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. Anticipated events will be recorded and reported as described in Attachment 4."

Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the adverse event to study therapy . All measures required for adverse event management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to sponsor instructions. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of adverse events to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/IRB. A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/I RB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary , unless otherwise specified. For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, the subject must be provided with a ""wallet (study ) card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number Local sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staff only ) Site number Subject number Any other information that is required to do an emergency breaking of the blind 12.3.2.

An y event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalizatio n) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study must be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospitalizations for the following: Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or adverse event (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in long- term care facility ) Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the eCRF). Note: Hospitalizations that were planned before the signing of the ICF, and where the underly ing condition for wh ich the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be considered serious adverse events. Any adverse event that results in a prolongation of the originall y planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new serious adverse event. For convenienc e the investigator may choose to hospitalize the subject at times during the treatment period. The cause of death of a subject in a study , whether or not the event is expected or associated with the study drug, is considered a serious adverse event. 12.3.3. Pregna ncy All initial reports of pregnancy must be reported to the sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue further study treatment. Because the effect of the study drug on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the study will be reported by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required."

ETHICA L ASPECTS 16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations Clinical Study in Treatment- resista nt Major Depression Major depressive disorder is a common, severe, chronic, and often life-threatening illness. It is now the leading cause of disability worldwide. There is a clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for treatment -resistant de pression. Several clinical studies with esketamine , including the phase 2a global study ESKETINTRD2003, have shown robust antidepressant effects in patients with MDD, including TRD. Furthermore, these clinical studies have shown that esketamine is safe and well tolerated. Based on comparable pharmacokinetic profiles of intranasal esketamine between healthy Caucasian and Chinese subjects (ESKETINTRD1008)8, and pharmacokinetic, safet y and efficacy data from Caucasian subjects with TRD (ESKETINTRD2003)10, we expect the selected dose of intranasal esketamine to be both efficacious and tolerated in the Chinese population of subjects with TRD. Selection of Subjects The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine plus an oral antidepressant for the treatment of TRD. Thus, the stud y cannot be completed in healthy subjects. Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and req uirements of the study ,and during the study subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. For eligibility , subjects must have had non-response to at least 1 prior antidepressant treatment and be curre ntly taking an antidepressant treatment at the start of the screening/prospective observational phase that will be continued as prospective treatment in the screening/prospective observational phase. Only subjects with non-response to their current antidep ressant treatment after 4 weeks of prospectively observed treatment (for a total duration of antidepressant treatment of at least 6 weeks b y the end of the screening/prospective observational phase), will be eligible to proceed to the double -blind treatment phase, when all subjects will receive a new oral antidepressant in addition to intranasal esketamine or placebo. Subjects will receive 4 weeks of treatment in the double -blind treatment phase. The oral antidepressant initiated during the double - blind treatment phase will be continued for a further 8 weeks during the follow -upphase, to maintain the antidepressant effect. Subjects will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential adverse events of the study , and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled."
118,page_118,"JNJ-54135419 (esketamine) Clinical Protocol ESKETINTRD3006 Amendment 2 Confidential –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 119 Status: Approved , Date: 21 January 2021Justif ication for Using Placebo Intranasal placebo is being used as a double -blind for intranasal esketamine to maintain study blinding. All subjects will also receive a newl y initiated oral antidepressant during the double - blind treatment phase. Subjects will n ot be on placebo alone. Assessment of the potential efficacy of a new compound for the treatment of treatment- resistant major depression requires adequate and well controlled clinical studies. This superiority study will compare intranasal esketamine plus a newl y-initiated oral antidepressant to switching to an oral antidepressant as an active comparator. Recent analyses have shown response to placebo varies considerabl y, from 10% to 55%. Therefore, there is a concern that randomized, controlled studies that rely on comparison with standard antidepressant treatments alone will generate unreliable results with limited assay sensitivity . However, some have considered it unethical to do placebo -controlled studies in major depression due to the potential risk of irreversible harm.62In a m eta-analy sis of drug studies conducted in MDD, it was reported that adult subjects did not have higher rates of suicide behaviors or attempts in the placebo group compared with those receiving an active antidepressant.39These studies showed annual suicide rates of 0.8% on the investigational drug, 0.7% on the active comparator, and 0.4% on placebo. Thus, the risk of irreversible harm was not higher in the placebo arm compared with the active control arms. Some subjects may decide to not participate in a placebo -controlled study due to the potential for increased distress and d ysfunction from prolonged depression. Therefore, the use of an active -controlled study allows for assessment of efficacy of a new compound to allow for scientifically meaningful results. More over, the duration of the double -blind treatment phase is relativel y short (4-week duration). Subjects will visit the study site at least twice a week during the double -blind treatment phase and their symptoms will be carefull y monitored during each study visit. Safet y evaluations will include evaluation of suicidal ideation/behavior at each clinic visit. At any point in the study , the subject may withdraw consent or be removed from the study by the investigator if there are any clinical concerns. Intranasa l esketamine may not be available for subjects after the study . Precautions to Ensure Subject Safety in the Study Subjects may participate in the study only if they have adequate capacit y to give consent and after fully understanding the potential risks and giving an informed consent. Determination of capacit y will be made by the study investigator. Subjects may discontinue the study at any time. The probability of receiving placebo and the concept of random assignment will be explained to the subject. The duration of the study is short, minimizing the time on intranasal placebo (which is being administered with a newl y-initiated oral antidepressant). Potential disadvantages and adverse events of participating in the study and alternative treatment options will be discussed. For subjects who do not meet predefined response criteria during the study , clinical care will be arranged between the study investigator and their phy sician."

Subjects will be carefully monitored during the study and subjects who are unable to tolerate study drug during the double -blind treatment phase will be discontinued from the study . If the investigator judges it to be necessary to immediately stop study drug, he or she has the option to do so. Specific guidance is provided regarding blood pressure monitoring on intranasal dosing days (Section 6.4). Only subjects who had non-response to their current oral antidepressant treatment, where a clinician would consider changing it in the future due to lack of response, will be enrolled. Only qualified and trained investigators will participate in the study . The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be within the normal range allowed for this subject population over this time frame. The approximate blood volume to be collected will be 124.5 mL from each Chinese subject (34 mL for eligibility and safet y, 16 mL for PK, 74.5 mL for biomarker) and 108.5 mL from each non-Chinese subject (34mL for eligibility and safet y, and 74.5 mL for biomarker), which will be less than a Red Cross blood donation. 16.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance 16.2.1. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory and country -specific requirements.

The informe d consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and sponsor policy . Before enrollment in the study , the investigator or an authorized member of the study -site personnel must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study , and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at an y time. They will be informed that choosing to not participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his or her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally , they will be told that the investigator will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long -term follow up if needed and that their records ma y be accessed by health authorities and authorized sponsor personnel without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. By signing the ICF the subje ct is authorizing such access and agrees to allow his or her study physician to re-contact the subject for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safet y evaluations, if needed. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the oppo rtunit y to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study , consent should be appropriately recorded by means of the subject's personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a cop y of the ICF must be given to the subje ct. Where local regulations require, a separate ICF may be used for the required DNA component of the study . 16.2.4.

Study Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requireme nts of the IEC/I RB or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator Discontinuation of further study drug development Study is terminated by sponsor due to futility 17.10. On-Site A udits Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy . These audit s will require access to all study records, including source documents, for inspection and comparison with the eCRFs. Subject privacy must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and available forconsultation during routinel y scheduled study -site audit visits conducted b y the sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to revie w the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or she has been contacted b y a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. 17.11. Use of Information and Publication All infor mation, including but not limited to information regarding esketamine or the sponsor's operations (eg, patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not previously published, and any data, including pharmacogenomic or exploratory biomarker research data, generated as a result of this study , are considered confidential and remain the sole propert y of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study , and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written consent."

To permit the information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all data obtained in the study . The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and will contain eCRF data from all study sites that participated in the study and will represent uploaded data transferred from external service providers into the sponsor's database. Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the study will be used to determine acoordinating investigator. Results of pharmacogenomic or exploratory biomarker analy ses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report. Study subject identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below ) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work. Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (mu lticenter) data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study , a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60 days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60 days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with theinvestigator. The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and sub-study approaches, secondary results generall y should not be published before the prim ary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 12 months of the availability of the final data (tables, listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the design of the study or analysis and interpretation of the data, provided critical review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version. Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of,and the results of clinical studies as required by law."

For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events.17,18,21,22,34,65,66,71,72 For esketamine and major depressive disorder (MDD) (including treatment -resista nt depression [TRD]; based on DSM -5):  Suicidal thinking, ideation, and behavior  Sleep changes, difficulty sleeping, reduced sleep, abnormal sleep, tiredness, fatigue, and reduced energy  Difficulty in sexual desire, performance or satisfaction  Reduced appet ite and weight changes (loss or increase)  Activation or hypomania/ mania  Irritability, anger, and impulsive behavior  Agitation, tension, panic attacks, and phobia For esketamine, regarding events related to concomitant therapy with oral antidepressants (from the product’s reference safety information/US prescribing information):  Duloxetine  Most commonly observed adverse reactions from pooled studies of all indications (incidence of at least 5% and at least twice the incidence in placebo subjects) were nause a, dry mouth, somnolence, fatigue, constipation, decreased appetite, and hyperhidrosis (sweating). Duloxetine treatment worsens glycemic control in some subjects with diabetes.  Increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior; serot onin syndrome; hepatotoxicity; hepatic failure; orthostatic hypotension, syncope; abnormal bleeding; severe skin reactions, including erythema multiforme and Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS); activation of mania or hypomania; hyponatremia.  Venlafaxine XR  According to the US prescribing information, adverse events in short -term studies occurring in at least 5% of subjects receiving venlafaxine XR and at a rate twice the incidence in placebo subjects: abnormal ejaculation, gastrointestinal complaints (nausea, dry mouth, and anorexia), central nervous system complaints (dizziness, somnolence, and abnormal dreams), and sweating. Sustained hypertension is noted within Warnings and Precautions section.  Increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior, treatment -emergent insomnia and nervousness, activation of mania/hypomania, hyponatremia, mydriasis, abnormal bleeding, sustained hypertension, and serotonin syndrome.  Escitalopram  Most commonly observed adverse reactions (incidence of approximat ely 5% or greater and approximately twice the incidence in placebo subjects) were insomnia, ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay), nausea, sweating increased, fatigue, and somnolence.  Increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior, serotonin syndrome, activation of mania/hypomania, hyponatremia and abnormal bleeding"

Any event that meets serio us adverse event criteria will be reported to the sponsor within the appropriate timeline as described in Section 12.3.2 Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health Authorities. However, if based on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is possibly related to study drug, the sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner. Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safety committee within the sponsor’s organization that is independent of the sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the sponsor’s study team as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to the study drug. Statistical Analysis Details of statistical analysis of anticipated events, including the frequency of review and threshold to trigger an aggregate analysis of anticip ated events will be provided in a separate Anticipated Events Safety Monitoring Plan (ASMP)."

In alignment with guidance from the China Forums of Clinical Research Capacity Building and Human Research Participants Protection (CCHRPP) and any disaster/emergency response/good clinical practice (GCP) notification, that the clinical site may have alread y enforced in line with the Central Drug Evaluation (CDE ) guidance on Drug Clinical Trial Management under COVID -19 Pandemic Situation ,the sponsor is providing temporary options for study -related subject management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the stud y. This guidance does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement of the investigator to protect the health and well -being of subject s and site staff. The saf ety of the subjects and relevant study site person nel should be considered as priority . If, at any time, a subject ’s safet y is considered by the investigator to be at risk, study treatment may be discontinued after discussion with the sponsor , and study follow-up will be conducted according to GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO THIS PROTOCOL . Obtaining oral/verbal consent for ongoing subjects: Re-consenting of subjects will be perform ed as applicable for the measures taken (including remote consenting by phone) and according to local guidance for informed consent applicable during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified assessments for subject s on study treatment . Modifications to protocol -required assessments may be permitted after consultation between the participant and investigator, and with the agreement of the sponsor .Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical trial management system (CTMS) for protocol deviations. The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study , and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance. Modificat ions made to the study conduct as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic will be summarized in the clinical study report."

As restrictions are lifted and the acute phase of the COVID -19 pandemic resolves, sites should revert to original protocol conduct as soon as feasible. At each contact, subject s will be interviewed to collect safet y data. Subject s will also be questioned regarding general health status to fulfill any physical examination requirement . Evaluate the subject’s situation on a case by case basis and contact the study responsible physician for discussion and decision if necessary .Certain measures, such as those listed below, may be necessary and should be instituted in accordance with applicable (including local) laws, regulations, guidelines, and procedures. Screening / Prospective Observational Phase The following recommendations apply to those sites within regions where there is a high localized rate of COVID -19 infection: Screening of new subjects should be delay ed until the rate of COVID -19 infection is reduced and under control. Due to uncertaint y around the ability to conduct on site clinical visits, subjects that are currentl y in screening should be screen failed as pe r Exclusion Criterium 25 ( see Section 4.2) and clinical standard of care for the treatment of depression should bearranged by the study investigator and/or the subject's treating ph ysician. The sponsor will evaluate and approve / reject requests to rescr een an individual subject on a case-by-case basis after the COVID- 19 infection is under control. Double -blind Treatment Phase Due to the wide spread of site locations, the risk level of COVID -19 viral infection and restrictions might be different ateach site. The decision to continue with on-site intranasal dosing or to miss intranasal dosing and to conduct a remote phone call visit should be made by the investigator taking into consider ation the subject's disease status and the potential impact of the COVID -19 viral infection , and after consultation with the sponsor. Ifit is feasible for the subject to be assessed and dosed at the study site, and the subject is willing to do so, theoriginal protocol requirements and procedures should be followed. T o reduce time spent by the subject on site during the dosing day and limit direct contact with multiple site staff members, clinician rating scales (Clinical Global Impression –Severity [CGI-S], Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS ]and Physician Withdrawal Checklist; 20-item [PWC-20 ]) can be completed remotely (via phone). Site staff are advised to wear the necessary personal protective equipment when seeing the subject, to ensure thatthe subject is protected when on site , and to obtain subject information regarding recent travel or contact history of COVID -19suspected cases."

The subject should be contacted forassessments that can be conducted remotely by telephone as specified in the Time and Events schedule of the protocol. The subject should continue to take oral antidepressant (AD) as per protocol. Rating Scales : Every effort should be made to complete the Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS ) assessment remotel y as outlined in the protocol (ie, via telephone by an independent rater), and within the scheduled timeframe (see Time and Event s Schedule ). Ifthis cannot occur, the sponsor medical monitor or delegate should be contacted for directions. Data obtained from the clinician completed rating scale assessments and patient report outcome (PRO) that is outlined in the Remote Site Assisted Administration Form should be collected remotely per the electronic Clinical Outcome Assessments (eCOA) COVID -19 site administration assistance process . Safety Assessment s: information on adverse events and concomitant therapies should be obtained and documented at each remote visit as per the visit schedule .If it is determined by the investigator that it necessary to have laboratory assessments (such ashematology , chemistry , urine drug screen, urinaly sis, urine/serum pregnancy test) and echocardiographic (ECG) assessments , then these assessments could be done in a nearb y hospital/clinic or at a local lab oratory instead of at the central laboratory as stipulated in the protocol .Assessments that were not conducted will be regarded as missing data. Testing should be resumed as soon as the conditions permits. If a subject cannot be contacted for a remote visit, follow procedures in Section 10.2 of the protocol . Follow -up Phase Further clinical standard of care for the treatment of depression will be arranged by the investigator. Medication changes are permitted per protocol (see Section 9.1.4 ). The decision to continue with oral AD treatment, and the choice of oral AD will be at the discretion of the investigator taking into consideration the subject's disease status and the potential impact of the COVID -19 virus infection . Rating scales/safet y assessments can be completed remotely by telephone. Detailed guidance is specified in the prior section “ Double- blind Treatment Phase ” It is recommended that close contact be maintained with study subjects and remote contact arranged consistent with the subject’s regularl y scheduled visit interval. Study subject s who show worsening or who are at high risk for relapse may require more frequent monitoring as per investigator dis cretion."

After the acute phase of the COVID -19 pandemic, any potential subject who has had COVID -19 virus and has fully recovered may be considered for screening/re -screening following a discussion with the Sponsor’s study responsible physician. If a subject develops confirmed COVID -19 infection during the double -blind treatment phase, the principal investigator should contact the sponsor’s medical monitor to discuss the best course of action based on a risk/benefit assessment . If a subject develops confirmed COVI D-19 infection during the follow -up p hase, the principal investigator should contact the sponsor’s medical monitor. If feasible, the subject, should complete assessments remotely until recovered. The subject's COVID -19 infection should be reported to the sponsor following the usual Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event reporting requirements. Data Collection and Documentation Discontinuations of study treatment and withdrawal from the study due to COVID -19 related adverse events (AEs) /serious adverse events (SAEs )should be documented as discontinuation due to AE. If a subject has died due to COVI D-19, “death” should be selected as the reason for treatment discontinuation. Discontinuations for other COVID -19 reasons (eg, site closure) should be documented with the prefix “COVID -19-related” in the eCRF. All relevant communications and discussions applicable to the decision -making processes and actions taken in association with the situation related to COVID -19 should be documented in the eCRF, including (but not limi ted to the following examples): Site rater will verify that the correct subject is being interviewed and document in the source medical notes of this verification . For screen failures for a reason related to COVID -19, document the reason under “a violation for Exclusion Criterion 25” on the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria form, and also add the following comment on the Comments form: “Subject is screen failure due to COVID -19 outbreak.” For early withdrawal for a reason related to COVID- 19 (other than AE), document the reason under “Other” using the following format: “COVID -19 related [and additional details as appropriate]"" in the Disposition form. Document remote safety assessment for ongoing subject, revie w of adverse events and concomitant medications and safet y-related scale outcomes.

Oral/verbal consent for ongoing subjects Due to changes in this specific guidance in response to the global COVID -19 pandemic, it may influence subje ct’s willingness to continue participating in the study . Below is general guidance for capturing enough evidence for an oral/verbal consent. Country specific guidance should be followed for alternating consenting methods. The following should be collected and documented in the relevant subject record that is retained at the investigational study site 1. Who consented: Name of the subject. 2.When they consented: The time and date when the consent conversation took place 3.What they were told at the time: What changes or new aspect of the study the subject agreed to (eg.,some of scheduled study visits may be conducted by telephone instead of going into the study doctor’s office) 4.How they consented: The consent result, the method used (eg. ,telephone) 5.Who captured the oral/verbal consent: Name and signature of the Investigator or staff member who captured thesubject's consent . 6.Impartial witness ,if applicable : Who was present as impartial witness and how the impartial witness was selected . 7.Oral/verbal re consenti ng will be followed by written consent upon the subject's return to the site. Sites should refer to their continuity plans and local HA/I RB/EC guidance for appropriate methods of documenting evidence for verbal and/or other alternate consent methods. The acceptability of alternate consenting methods will vary by country based upon local/country guidance, laws, and regulations (which take precedence over the above Janssen guidance).
