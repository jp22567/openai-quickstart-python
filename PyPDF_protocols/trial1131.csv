T his allo ws to better explore the effect of tezepel umab in both the ≥ 300 eosinophils/ µL and < 300 eosinophils/ µL groups. Section 4.1 , Overall design –Added “When the target percentage of subjects for the eosinophil subgroup in a region is reached, consideration will be given to closing the IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that subgroup, which may be done ei ther overall or within a specific regio n. Once a subgroup is closed, subjects in the screening/run -in period in the closed subgroup will not be allowed to be randomized and will be screen failed .” To describe the approach for subgroup closure per region. Section 5.1 , Inclusion criteria , removed criterion #15 –“Non -sterilized males who are sexually active wit h a female partner of childbearing potential must use a condom pl us spermicide fro m Day 1 through 16 weeks after receipt of the final dose of IP. In those countri es where the above -ment ioned method for contraception is not available, a condom can be used alo ne. Male subjects must not donate or bank sperm during this sam e time period.” To align with the revised IB. Section 5.2 , Exclusion criteria # 6 –revised criteria to add in restrict ions related to the usage of vaping products “ Current sm okers or subjects wit h smoking history ≥10 pack- years and subjects using vapin g products, including electronic cigarettes. Former smokers with a smoking history of <10 pack y ears and users of vaping or e -cigarette products must have stopped for at least 6 months prior to visit 1 to be eligible.” To clarify the required timeframe forstopping of e -cigarettes prior to screening since its use is prohibited during the study . Section 5.2 , Exclusion criteria # 17 –reduced the timeframe for subjects who have been treated with bronchial thermoplast y from 24 to 12 mo nths prior to visit 1. T his allows sufficient time for any safety issues related to performing this procedure, (for example asthma exacerbations which occur within 1 -2 months after the procedure), to resolve and for efficacy related to the procedure to stabilize. Section 5.4 , Screen failures –Replaced “Incorrect Enrolment” with “Screen Failure” to align with the proper documentation of the disposit ion of the screen failed subjects within the eCRF. Section 5.5 , Re-Screening –clarified the treatment by adding intravenous in fr ont of antibiotics and systemic in front of ant iviral medication. The revised text reads: “Subjects with clinically significant infect ion, including respiratory infect ions requi ring intravenous antibiotics or systemic antiviral medicat ion during run -in sho uld be screen failed but may be re-screened 2 weeks after complet ion of the therapy.” To clarify the ty pe of treatm ent for a clinically significant infect ion that would require the subject to be screen failed. Section 5.5 , Re-Screening –Added “If the t imeframe between Screening and re -screening is more than 30 days, then all Visit 1 assessments should be repeated.” To reduce the risk of not"

Secti on6.2, Preparation/handling/storage/accountability – Dose preparation steps –Added that a 2 m L sterile sy ringe can be attached to a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle during IP dose preparation and subsequent ly used for IP administration. This change allows for use of a 2 mL sy ringe in addit ion to 3 mL sy ringe because i t meets the requirements for IP dose preparati on and dosing. Section 6.2 , Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose prepara tion steps –clarified that the vial labels alo ng with the vials can be discarded immediately post IP preparation as per si te’s SOP. Section 6.2 , Preparation/handling/storage/accountability –Dose administration –Removed wording “The subject, in the opi nion of the investigator, is experiencing an acute or emerging asthma exacerbation” from the list of scenarios when IP should not be administered. An exacerbation per se is not a contraindicat ion for IP administration. Reasons for not administering IP are well covered by the remaining bullets. Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Ensuring blinding – removed “bi omarker” fro m the following laboratory personnel that will have access to the rando mizat ion list. The reason for this change is that the laboratory does not require the rando mizat ion list for performing bio marker sample analysis. Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Ensuring blinding – Clarified that no other members of the study team , other than those listed earlier within this section, will have access to the rando mizat ion list unt il after the primary database lock. Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Methods for unblinding –replaced “pharmacists” with “Study Coordinator(s)” to clarify that the Study Coordinators i n addition to the Investigator will be provided access to unblin ding the treatment. This change allows alignment with the IXRS setup for this study. Section 6.3 , Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding – Methods for unblinding –replaced “unt il database lock” with “until prim ary database l ock after l ast subject com pletes week 48.” To accommodate a planned addit ional database lock once the last subject completes treatm ent phase (week 48). Section 6.5 , Table 6 –Restricted Medications -Short -acting beta -agonists (SABA) –Added “Only albuterol/salbutamo l is allowed to be used as a rescue medicat ion during the study , except duri ng exacerbations.” Since OCS titration criteria and ePRO alerts are based on salbutamo l use as rescue medication, the same ty pe of SABA shoul d be used in a ll subjects. Section 6.5 , Table 7 – Prohibited Medications –Added “Ephedrine (e.g. in antitussives or muco lytics) -Not allowed fro m visit 1, during run -in and optimizat ion phase, throughout the entire treatm ent peri od (even if the subject has discontinue d IP) until the fo llow up visi t week"
5,page_5,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 6 (146)60.” The reason for this change is to ensure consistency in standard of care and GINA guidelines. Section 6.5 , Table 7 – Prohibited Medications –Added “Opiates prn (e.g. in ant itussives) - Not allowed from visit 1, during run -in and optimization phase, throughout the ent ire treatm ent peri od (even if the subject has discont inued IP) until the fo llow up visit week 60.” The reason for this change is to ensure consistency with standard of care and GINA guidelines. Sectio n 6.5.2 , Rescue medicine –Added “Regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma symptoms is not allowed fro m enrolment (Visit 1) and throughout the study durati on. Prophylact ic use o f SABA (e.g. prior to planned exercise) or any other use than to curb worsening of asthma symptoms should be documented in medical notes and entered in the eCRF. Any such use of SABA must not be recorded in the Asthma Daily Diary. ” This change further clarifies that regularly scheduled SABA use in the absence of any asthma symptoms is not allowed and that the occasional prophylact ic use of SABA is not to be recorded in the eDiary . Section 7.1 , Discontinuation of study treatment –Under “Development of any study specific criteria for di scont inuat ion, any malignancy”, added the fo llowing statement “except subjects who develop basal cell carcino ma or localized squamous cell carcino ma of the skin, provided that the m alignancy is excised and determined to have clean margins.” This change allo ws subjects who have had excis ion of their lesions, which is considered curative, to continue study treatm ent. Section 7.1.1 , Procedures for discontinuation of study treatment; Section 8.3.10 , Disease under study –Replaced “termination” with “Discont inuat ion of Invest igational Produ ct” to reflect the corresponding eCRF module tit le. This change allows alignment with eCRF design. Section 7.3.2 , Discontinuation or suspension of entire study and site closure –Updated the title of this sect ion and added addit ional co mments about site closure. The rati onale for this change i s to specify the condi tions for closure of sites during and after study com pletion. Section 8.1.1.1 , OCS Dose Titration – OCS dose titration in the optimization phase –Dosing interval corrected from “10-30 m g” to “>10 -30 m g”. To ensure consistency with Table 8. Section 8.1.1.2 , Criteria for OCS dose reduction during the optimization and reduction phase –Added “It is at the discret ion of the Invest igator to continue with the OCS down- titration even if the criteria for OCS reduction have not been met. Such a decisio n must be just ified and docum ented in the source notes and captured in the eCRF. This deci sion must be notified to the AstraZeneca study physician within 2 business days.” This allows the Invest igator the opportunit y to continue down titrating OCS, if clinically indicated. This change recognizes that the Invest igator will balance their concern about si de effects rel ated to OCS use and the patient’s clinical status."
6,page_6,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 (146)Section 8.1.2.3 , Exacerbation management –Maintenance phase –Replaced “induct ion” wit h “maintenance” to correct the ty pographi cal error in the CSP. Section 8.1.5 , Fractional exhal ed nitric oxide (FENO) –Removed the wording “which will be recorded as “Yes or No” in the eCRF” from the sentence “Subjects will be asked whether they have had a respiratory infect ion in the 2 weeks prior to measurement.” This change aligns with the eCRF design. Section 8.2.4 , Vital Signs –Revised text to specify that the pulse rate will be obtained before blood pressure only if the manual measurement technique is used. This is to reflect that when the autom ated device is used the pulse and blood pressur e measurements are taken simultaneously . Section 8.2.4 , Vital Signs –Removed “in degrees Celsius” as the units of body temperature measurement. This is to accommodate the local guidelines as some regions may not be measuring in degrees Celsius. Section 8.2.6 , Glucocorticoid toxicity index –Revised the text to “Scoring should be perform ed as per SoA, using the rando misation assessment as the baseline.” This is to clarify that the first assessment of GTI is at the randomisation visit. Section 8.3.8 , Adverse Events of Special Interest –Added “systemic” in front of ant iviral medicat ions. The revised text reads: “Requiring treatment with systemic antiviral medicat ions, intravenous ant ibiotics or medicat ions for helmint h parasi tic infect ion”. To clarify that infect ions treated with local ant ivirals are not considered as adverse events of special interest. Section 8.4.2.2 , Paternal exposure –Removed “ Male subjects shoul d refrain fro m fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 16 weeks (5 half-lives) fo llowing the last dose.” To align with the revised IB. Section 8.4.2.2 , Paternal exposure –Added “ in the Pregnancy Report Form” to clarify where outcom e of all pregnancies will be reported. This change aligns wit h eCRF design. Section 8.4.2 .2, Paternal exposure –Added “Consent fro m the partner m ust be obtained before the Pregnancy Report Form is completed.” To clarify that consent is being obtained from the pregnant partner prior to complet ing the Pregnancy Report Form. Section 9.4 , Statis tical Analyses –Added “There will be two DBLs in this study. The primary DBL will be conducted after last subject completes Week 48, and the final DBL will be conducted once all pat ients have completed the last safet y follow-up visit (Week 60). All analys es of the primary and secondary object ives will be performed based on the primary DBL data . Following the primary DBL, data summaries created will be presented as an addendum to the CSR .” This provi des clari ty around timing of database locks and primary analysis evaluat ion.

Visits 3 and 4 can be performed as telephonic visits provided the subject and sites are confident to perform the visit remotely. Depending on clinical judgement, investigator may decide to call the subject on -site for visits 3 and 4 as well. Instructions for OCS dose titrations at visits 3 and 4 can be communicated to the subject on phone. The optimization phase may be extended to account for treatment of an exacerbation to a llow for 2 -week stable OCS dose prior to randomization. c At a minimum there should be at least 14 days window (could be extended to 17 days) between visit 1 and 2 and also between vi sit 5 and 6 (randomization). d All asthma medications taken in the 12 months prior to visit 1 must be recorded in th e eCRF along with reason for treatment.

FSH test done only in women < 50 years who have been amenorrheic for > 12months to confirm postmeno pausal status. g eDiary should be dispensed after all other assessments have been performed. h Daily Diary: Asthma symptom diary (ASD), general asthma symptom severity item, rescue medication use, night time awakenings and adherence to maintenance medications. i If Pre -BD FEV 1is met and reversibility is not met or vice versa, at visit 1; only the crit eria that was not met needs to be verified at visit 2. Post -BD spirometry should be performed 15 -30 min after administration of 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol. Reversibility can be documented in the previous 12 months pri or to or at visit 1 or visit 2. Note: Reversibility (both historical and during screening) is defined as FEV 1≥12% and ≥200 mL. j At visit 2 OCS dose titration will be attempted without referring to the protocol -captured set of baseline eDiary data. At other optimization visits eDiary dat a preceding the visits, will be compared to the baseline eDiary data derived from the interval between visit 1 and 2 for OCS dose titrati on decisions. Refer section 8.1.1.2 . k If the subject does not meet the criteria for following OCS dose reduction schedule at visits 3 or 4, the OCS dose should pre ferentially be returned to one level higher, unless the judgment of the investigator is to maintain the subject on their current do se of OCS, and visit 5 should be activated instead of visit 3 or 4 on the same day. Subject must be maintained on the optimized OCS dose for at least 2 weeks before randomization."

28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29 (146)Please Note: Changes below should only be implemented during the COVID -19 pandemic. During the COVID- 19 pandemic, changes are being impleme nted in order to ensure the safet y of study subjects, to m aintain compliance wi th good clinical pract ices, and to minimize risks to data integrit y. Where allowable by local heal th authori ties, ethi cs committees and healt hcare provider guidelines (e.g. hosp ital policies), these changes include: The opti on of home visit s including home administration of Investigat ional Product (IP) performed by a qualified Healt h Care Professio nal (HCP). Addit ional information rel ated to the visit can be obtained remotely by phone call and/or vi deo conference. The rationale for this change is to minimize the risk of subjects missing scheduled IP administration and visit assessments due to inabilit y/unwillingness to visit the site during the COVID -19 pandemic. Remote vi sits (phone call and/or video conference) to replace on -site visi ts, if subjects cannot attend the visits at the study site, at an al ternate si te or have ho me visits. The rationale for this change is to ensure that assessments and co llection of inform ation cont inue for visit s that cannot be done at the site, at an alternate site or at the subject’s home. This will reduce the risk of subject exposure to COVID -19. Decisio n on OCS dose based on remote interview of subject, eDiary data, and if applicable, ho me vis it physical examination and vital signs. The rationale for this change is to ensure optimal OCS dose for asthma control and to reduce the subject ris k of exposure to COVID -19. Subjects aimed to transit ion to the extensio n study D5180C00018 to continue par ticipat ion in the safety follow-up visit(s) (Week 54, Week 60) unt il the on -site (or al ternate si te) extensio n study rando mizat ion and IP administration can be conducted. The rationale for this change is to ensure randomization/first IP administration in t he extension study D5180C00018 can be performed at the site (alternate site) and to increase the chances o f subjects transit ioning to the extensio n study . Re-consent will be obtained remotely and/or verbally if allowed by l ocal and regi onal guidelines. Th e rati onale for this change i s to ensure that the subject agrees to the changes implemented due to the COVID -19 pandemic while minimizing the subject risk of exposure to COVID -19."

Other bio logics (mep olizumab and benralizumab) have been shown to effect ively reduce the AAER and have also been demo nstrated to enable reducti on in daily OCS dose in severe asthma pat ients requi ring maintenance therapy with OCS (Bel et al 2014 , Nai r et al 2017 ). Thus, there is reason to believe that tezepelumab should be effect ive in reducing the dai ly OCS dose in severe asthma patients on maintenance OCS treatm ent. The purpose of the present study is to dem onstrate the abilit y of tezepelumab versus placebo to enable reduct ions of the daily maintenance OCS use in adults with asthma also using high -dose ICS pl us LABA wi th or wi thout other asthma controller therapy , while m aintaining asthma control . 2.2 Background Asthma i s a chronic inflammatory airway disease characteri zed by bronchial hyperreactivi ty and reversible airflow limitat ion that causes wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness. Alt hough several treatments are available (e.g. ICS, LABA and LAMA), there is a clear unmet m edical need amo ng patients with severe asthma. Biologic therapies can provide addit ional asthma control for such patients. Omalizumab may be suitable for a subgroup of patients with proven reactivit y to an aeroallergen and elevated serum immunogl obulin E (IgE) levels who remain inadequately controlled with ICS pl us LABA (XOLAIR US PI 2016 ). Two addit ional bio logics, mepolizumab and reslizumab, have recently been approved for severe asthma with an eos inophilic phenotype ( NUCALA US PI 2015 , CINQAIR US PI 2016). Biologics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional treatment gui delines ( GINA 2017 ) as an add- on treatment to pati ents uncontrolled wi th LABA/ICS treatment. However, even when using current ly available bio logics, substant ial proporti ons of patients continue to experience exacerbations and may benefit from agents that target different mo lecular pathways ( Wenzel 2016 , Froi dure et al 2016 , Swedin et al 2017 ). Therefore, despite these additional therapeuti c opti ons, there is st ill a clear unmet medical need among pat ients with severe asthma, independent of IgE status or eosinophil l evel, who are unable to gain complete asthma control using currently available therapies. Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is an epit helial cell -derived cy tokine that i s produced in response to proinflammatory stimuli (e.g., infect ious, allergic and env ironmental stimuli) and traum a. TSLP has an upstream and central role in the init iation of inflammatory responses, and can act ivate a broad range of cell t ypes including eosinophils, mast cells, T cells, dendrit ic cells, type 2 innate lympho id cells and ba sophils ( Tedeschi SK et al 2017 , Watson and Gauvreau, 2014 ). Classically, TSLP may be a crit ical component in the init iation and perpetuation of the T helper 2 (Th2) response and the result ing cascade of cytokines associated with Th2 driven asthma ( Kaur and Bright ling 2012 ). Asthma is now recognized as a heterogenous disease with subsets of patients that do not exhibit Th2 -associ ated di sease ( Wenzel 2012 ). There are em erging data that TSLP may also mediate non -allergic (non -T hel per cell 2) inflammat ion (Tanaka et al 2009 ; Ziegler et al 2013 ). Given that TSLP is an upstream and pleiotropi c cytokine, the bl ockade"
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 41 (146)of TSLP is therefore anticipated to have broad impact on the spectrum of inflammatory responses seen in asthma. Tezepel umab is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG) 2λ monoclonal ant ibody (mAb) di rected against TSLP. Tezepelumab binds to human TSLP and prevents its interaction with TSLP receptor (TSLPR). Results of a co mpleted study in 31 adult subjects with mild atopic asthma (Study 20101183) demonstrated that administration of tezepelumab attenuated both the early and late phase allergic response and suppressed the expected increase in FENO fo llowing inhalat ion allergen challenge (Gauvreau et al 2014). Mul tiple doses of 700 m g IV tezepel umab dem onstrated an acceptable safet y profile in subjects with mild atopic asthma. Based upon these data, MedImmune/AZ have conducted a randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, dose range finding study in asthmatics who were inadequately controlled wit h medium -orhigh-dose ICS/LABA, with or without other controller medications. Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 was a Phase 2b mult icenter, mult inational, dose -ranging, double - blind, randomized, parallel -arm, placebo -controlled study to eval uate the effect of 3 dose levels of tezepel umab on the AAER in adult subjects with inadequately controlled, severe asthma (Corren et al 2017 ). Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 rat io to 1 of 3 dose levels of SC tezepel umab (280 m g every 2 weeks [Q2W], 210 mg Q4W, or 70 mg Q4W) or placebo (Q2W) for 52 weeks. A total of 584 subjects received at least 1 dose of IP (tezepelumab or placebo). Statistically significant AAERR of 61%, 72%, a nd 66% for the 70 mg Q4W, 210 mg Q4W, and 280 m g Q2W tezepel umab groups, respectively, compared with placebo were observed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion (p<0.001). Moreover, clinically significant benefits in lung funct ion, ACQ -6 and AQLQ+12 were observed. In addition, blood eosinophil numbers and FENO were significant ly suppressed. After repeated SC administration, mean serum tezepelumab trough concentration increased over time and achieved steady -state by week 12. Tezepelumab exhibited linear P K across the 3 doses. A total o f 5 (4.1%) pl acebo subjects and 8 (1.8%) tezepelumab subjects who had no detectable ADA at baseline had detectable ADA post -treatm ent; no subjects developed neutralizing ADA in the study . The resul ts of this study did not i dentify safet y signals associated with tezepelumab for any dosing regimen. The frequencies of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar between the placebo (62.2%) and the total tezepelumab (64.2%) dose groups and a majorit y of subjects had TEAE s that were mild or moderate in severit y and not related to investigat ional product. Few subjects had TEAEs that resulted in permanent discontinuation o f investigat ional product. Overall, tezepelumab was well -tolerated wi th an acceptable safet y profile and no safet y signals were ident ified. A detailed description o f the chemistry , pharmaco logy, efficacy , and safet y of tezepel umab is provi ded in the Invest igator’s Brochure . 2.3 Benefit/risk assessment In order to evaluate the clinical benefit -risk balance, precl inical and clinical data, as well as a review of the available informat ion for monocl onal antibodi es that are approved for and are in"
41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 42 (146)development for the treatment of severe asthma, have been considered. Benefits for tezepelumab over placebo include a clin ically meaningful AAERR, an increased FEV 1and an improvement in asthma control metrics. Tezepel umab has been well tolerated with no safety signals ident ified in studi es to date. No serious allergic reactions or anaphylact ic react ions considered related to tezepelumab were reported in the Phase 2 program. Alt hough TSLP suppressio n could theoretically have unant icipated immune -related si de effects impairing host defense against certain infect ions, there is no clear preclinical or clinical evidence supporting such a rol e and no safet y signals related to infect ions have been detected in the tezepelumab program. Potential risks with tezepelumab will be mitigated by the selected inclusion/exclusio n criteria and cont inuous monitoring of safet y data during the stud y. In the present study , measures are taken to mit igate the risk for embry onal, fetal and child exposure to tezepelumab. The benefit/risk assessment for tezepelumab in severe asthma based on the development through Phase 2 i s favourable. The future benefit / risk assessment will largely be defined by results fro m the Phase 3 program. More detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of tezepelumab may be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure.

For details on what is included in the efficacy and safet y endpo ints, see Section 3Objectives and Endpoints. This is a Phase 3, mult i-centre, randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study to eval uate the effect of 210 m g Q4W SC of tezepel umab on OCS dose reduction in adult subjects wi th OCS dependent asthma. The study will randomize approximately 152 subjects gl obally in a 1:1 rati o to either tezepel umab or pl acebo. The subjects will be stratified by region. All subjects m ust have received OCS for the treatment of asthma for at least 6 months prior to visit 1 and must have been on a stable dose of between ≥ 7.5 to ≤ 30m g (prednisone o r predniso lone) daily or daily equivalent for at least 1 month prior to visit 1. Subjects must have been on a medium- to high-dose ICS for the past 12 months and LABA wi th high dose ICS for at least 3 m onths pri or to vi sit 1. Addi tional maintenance asthma controller medicat ions are allowed according to standard practice of care. Their use must be docum ented for at l east 3 months prior to visit 1. See inclusio n criteria 4-7. Subjects in the study will be requi red to have had at least one asthma exacerbat ion in the past 12 months. Details on acceptable historical documentation is specified in sect ion 5.1. Eosinophils will be assessed using central lab analyses. Approximately 35% of the subjects will be targeted to have ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl at enrolment. When th e target percentage of subjects for the eosinophil subgroup in a region is reached, consideration will be given to closing the IWRS/IVRS rando mizat ion for that subgroup, which may be done ei ther overall or within a specific regio n. Once a subgroup is close d, subjects in the screening/run -in period in the closed subgroup will not be allowed to be randomized and will be screen failed. Secti on 6.5(Table 6and Table 7) provi des a list of medicat ion restrict ions and prohibit ions to be followed throughout the conduct of the clinical trial. The study will consist of a screening/run in period of 2 weeks, an OCS optimizat ion phase for up to 8 weeks and a treatment period of 48 weeks consist ing of a 4 -week induction phase, a 36 - week OCS reduction phase and an 8 -week m aintenance phase. The duration of the post -treatm ent follow-up period i s 12 weeks (week 48 -60). During the treatment period, IP will be administered SC starting at randomization and cont inue until week 44. IP will not be administered on week 48. There are up to 18 visit s from screening to scheduled end of treatment, followed by two follow - up visits. During the screening/run -in period, the subject must undergo all assessments per Table 1."
46,page_46,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47 (146)Prior to randomizat ion the subjects must meet all inclusion /exclusion criteria. If a subject does not m eet all inclusi on criteria or meets any exclusion cri teria as per section 5.1and section 5.2, the subject will be screen failed. Further details are specified in section 5.5. Subjects who ar e administered IP week 44 and complete the 48 -week study visit will com plete a 12-week post -treatment follow -up peri od. Subjects who prematurely discont inue IP during the study will be encouraged to undergo appropriate study visits/procedures for the full 48-week peri od. Subjects should have an IPD visit at 4 weeks fro m the final dose of IP. A fo llow-up visit should then be scheduled 16 weeks after last IP administration. Further information is provided in sect ion 7.1.1 . Any new treatments that are init iated will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Subjects remaining on IP for entire planned treatment period, may be eligible to en roll in the extensio n study . These subjects will transit ion to the extensio n study , after com pleting the EOT assessments at week 48 and thus they will not attend the follow -up visits at Week 54 and Week 60. 4.2 Scientific rationale for study design This is a g lobal study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of a fixed 210 m g dose of tezepel umab administered Q4W SC in severe asthma subjects who are on maintenance OCS and ICS/LABA therapy , with or wi thout addi tional asthma controller(s). The primary effic acy measure will be based on the percentage change from baseline in the prescribed, daily, average OCS dose at week 48 post randomizat ion while not losing asthma control. This study is doubl e blind to reduce the risk of bias. Tezepelumab is compared to pl acebo on top of standard of care to better assess the effect in the appropriate clinical context. This study is a rando mized, parallel group, double -blinded study in which subjects are stratified by region. The asthma study popul ation has been chosen as on e in need of reduction of the daily OCS dose. Subjects should be on maintenance OCS, high dose ICS and LABA to ensure that a severe asthmatic populat ion is included in the trial. In the optimization phase, the lowest OCS dose is defined as the OCS dose at which asthma control is maintained. The duration of the induct ion phase is defined by the time to reach effect in the phase 2b study . In the reducti on phase, stri ct cri teria will be fo llowed for down ti tration of the OCS dose. The maintenance phase is to assess the effect iveness to maintain asthma control without exacerbat ions. This study has a similar design and endpo ints as previous studies with mepo lizumab ( Bel et al 2014 ) and benralizumab ( Nair et al 2017 ). A difference in this study design from previous OCS sparing studies is that the duration of the present study is longer; 48 weeks co mpared to 24 -28 weeks in previous trials. The reduction phase in the present study has a longer durati on to allow more subjects to reduce daily OCS dose to 0 m g. In addi tion, the maintenance phase is of longer duration as co mpar ed to the previou s studi es to better evaluate the sustainabilit y of the treatment effect."
47,page_47,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 48 (146)This phase 3 study will evaluate the OCS reducti on capacit y of tezepelumab and the effect on the AAER and other aspects of lung function, asthma control, and safet y to further characterize the benefit -risk profile of the drug and understand how best to pos ition it in the treatment pathway . 4.3 Justification for dose A 210 m g Q4W dosing regimen was selected for the Phase 3 studies based on efficacy data and an exposure- response analysis fro m the Phase 2b Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 using popul ation PK/PD methodo logy. The populati on PK m odel of tezepel umab was developed based on all available data fro m 5 Phase 1 studies (Study 20070620, Study 20080390, Study 2010118, Study D5180C00003, Study D5180C00002), and 2 Phase 2 studies (Study D5240C00001 and Study CD-RI-MEDI9929 -1146). The exposure -response analysis was based on the Phase 2b Study CD-RI-MEDI9929-1146. Analysis of data fro m the phase 2b study identified a statist ically significant exposure -response against the primary efficacy endpo int of AAER and the pharma co-dynamic endpo int FENO. These relat ionships indicate that the dose of 70 mg Q4W is a sub -optimally effect ive dose and the dose of 210 mg Q4W is optimally effect ive. In summary, characterizat ion of AAERR data from Study CD-RI-MEDI9929- 1146 indicate the 21 0 mg Q4W dose provi des improved efficacy over the 70 mg Q4W dose, whereas the 280 mg Q2W dose did not further reduce the AAER. Therefore, the dose of 210 mg Q4W has been selected for evaluat ion in this study . Tezepel umab was well -tolerated at all doses and the safet y profile was well balanced between the tezepelumab and placebo groups with no evidence of a dose relationship to TEAEs. 4.4 End of study definition The end o f study is defined as when the last subject has co mpleted his/her last scheduled contact. A subject i s considered to have co mpleted the study when he/she has co mpleted his/her last scheduled contact. See Appendix A 6for guidelines for the dissemination of study resul ts. 5.

If there ar e any defects noted wi th the IP, the investigator and site monitor should be notified immediately. Preparation of IP must be performed by a qualified person (e.g., pharmacist or study nurse) at the site. The IP product does not contain preservat ives and an y unused portion must be discarded.

If storage time exceeds this l imit, a new dose must be prepared from new vials. To prepare the subject’s dose, the IP manager will select IP for administration according to the kit identificat ion numbers assigned by the IVRS. One vial of IP will be assigned by IVRS for each dose. Dose preparation steps: 1. Allow the vial to equilibrate at room temperature (about 30 minutes to 1 hour). Ensure that the vial is adequately protected from light during the warming process. Gently swirl the vial to ensure the contents are mixed to a clear, homog eneous so lution. Do not shake. 2. To prepare the IP for administration, remove the tab portion of the vial cap and clean the stopper with 70% ethyl alcoho l or equivalent. 3. Attach a 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle to a 2 mL or 3 mL sterile syringe. 4. Withdraw 1.9 mL of the IP from the vial. 5. Apply the appropriate label to the sy ringe. 6. Remove and discard the 21G 1½ -inch sterile disposable needle from the syringe. 7. Attach a new 27G ½ -inch sterile disposable needle to the same syringe in step 6. Assigned vial should be used at one time to prepare the dose required at each visit. Unused product in opened and dispensed vial should not be used for subsequent dosing and should be stored for IP accountabilit y.

The visit should be rescheduled within the allowed visit window and IP should be administered at that visit. If this is not possible, the IP administrat ion shoul d be skipped. If a subject skips 2 consecut ive IP administrations, the AZ study physician should be contacted to discuss further participat ion. If the subject reports an injection site react ion, the investigator or qualified designee will complete the AE eCRF page and an addit ional eCRF page with questions about the injection site reacti on. 6.3 Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding Subject enrolment and randomization The Investigator(s) should keep a subject screening log list ing of those who have entered pre - study screening. The Invest igator(s) will: 1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the potenti al subject before any study specific procedures are performed. 2. Assign the potential subject a unique enrolment number (which begins with an ‘E’) via the Interactive Web Response System/Interactive Voice Response Syst em (IWRS/IVRS). 3. Determine subject eligibilit y. 4. Assign the eligible subject unique rando mizat ion code via the Interactive Web Response Sy stem /Interactive Voice Response System (IWRS/IVRS). 5. Subjects will be allocated to receive tezepelumab or placebo in a 1 :1 rati o stratified by region. Rando mizat ion numbers will be grouped in blocks. If a subject withdraws fro m the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion code cannot be reused. Wit hdrawn subjects will not be replaced Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in the separate manual. Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized subjects Subjects who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any circumstances, be rando mized or receive study medicat ion. There can be no except ions to this rule. Subjects who"
60,page_60,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 61 (146)are enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria must not be rando mized or init iated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study . If a subject does not meet all the eligibilit y criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately . A discussi on shoul d occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the investigator reg arding whether to continue or discont inue the subject from treatment. Study treatm ent m ust be di scont inued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed to pose a safet y risk to the subject. In those cases where cont inuat ion of the study therapy is judged not to present a concern related to safet y and disease management, the rationale for continuing study therapy must be clearly documented. Regardless of what is decided about IP, all rando mized subjects shoul d remain in the study and the subjects should continue to be fo llowed up in accordance with defined study procedures. The AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisio ns are appropriately docum ented. Methods for assigning treatment groups Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially in each stratum as subjects beco me eligible for randomizat ion. The rando mizat ion code will be assigned fro m a rando mizat ion list prepared by a co mputerized system provi ded by Parexel Informatics on behalf of AstraZeneca (AZRand). All subjects will be stratified at randomizat ion by regio n. Approximately 35% of the subjects will be targeted to have ≥ 300 eosinophils/ μl at enrolment. Therefore, further enrolment of subjects with < 300 eosinophils/μl may be halted to achieve the requi red percentage . Ensuring blinding This is a double -blind study in which tezepelumab and placebo are not visually distinct from each other. All packaging and labelling of IP will be done in such way as to ensure blinding for all sponsor and investigational site staff.

Discont inuing study treatment is not the same as study wit hdrawal. Procedures to fo llow for study withdrawal are detailed bel ow in sect ion 7.3. If the subject decides to withdraw consent, then the reason for this must be recorded separately in the eCRF. A subject that deci des to prem aturely discontinue IP shoul d always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any adverse events. The reas on for premature discont inuing treatment and the date of last IP administration should be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects permanent ly discont inuing IP administration should be given locally available standard of care therapy , at the discret ion of the Invest igator. However, treatment with marketed or invest igational biologics i s not allowed unt il week 60 even if the subject has discontinued IP.

Asthma control and the criteria for OCS dose reducti on are described in sect ion 8.1.1.2 . The optimized OCS dose will be kept stable for 2 weeks prior to randomizat ion and will be considered the baseline OCS dose.

OCS dose reduction will co mmence at visit 7 and continue at 4 -week intervals unt il visit 15 in accordance with the OCS dose titration schedule described in sect ion 8.1.1.1 (reduction phase). During the reduction phase a minimum stable OCS dose, or complete eliminat ion of requirement for OCS, while maintaining asthma control, will be reached for each subject. If possible, no adjustments should be made to the OCS dose at visit 16 and 17 (maintenance period) and until visit 18 (End of treatment)."

The OCS dose titration will fo llow the same approach for both the optimization and the reducti on phase. The dose of OCS should be reduced if the subject meets the protocol defined criteria indicat ing that it is acceptable for the subject to reduce OCS, as described in sect ion 8.1.1.2 . When a subject does not meet these criteria defining asthma control, the investigator shoul d preferent ially increase up one step unl ess the j udgment of the invest igator is to maintain the subject on their current dose of OCS, depending on the rationale for not reducing per schedule. The OCS dose changes and their reasons must be documented in the source docum entati on and recorded in the appropriate eCRF form. OCS dose titration in the optimization phase In the OCS dose optimization phase, dose titration should begin at visit 2. Baseline readings to be used for dose titrations in the optimization period will be the mean of measures (morning PEFs, SABA use and night time awakenings) collected between visit 1 and visit 2. Dose reduction at visit 2 is the only titration visit during the optimization phase that will not be based upon a protocol -captured set of baseline data bec ause determining a change fro m baseline will not be possible. Visits 3 and 4 can be performed as telephonic visit s provided the subject and sites are confident to perform the visit remotely . Depending on clinical judgement, invest igator may instead decide to call the subject on -site for visits 3 and 4. OCS dose reductions can occur at 2 -week intervals according to the titration schedule ( Table 8). In the dosing interva l >10 -30 m g prednisone or predniso lone per day , the change in daily dose is 5 mg, whereas in the interval 7.5- 10 m g, the corresponding reduction is 2.5 mg.

The optimized dose of OCS will be decided by using the cri teria for the OCS dose reduction schedule, described in sect ion 8.1.1.2 , Table 9. In cases when the subject is optimized on their OCS dose at visit 3 or 4, visit 5 should be activated, instead of visit 3 or 4, on the same day and he/she shoul d be maintained at the optimiz ed dose of OCS for at least 2 weeks before being rando mized.

Similar to optimizat ion phase, though, is that dose reduction at visit 7 is the only t itration visit during the reduction phase that will not be based upon a protocol -captured set of baseline data (because the OCS dose is the same as during baseline).

Subject should meet all o f the criteria listed in Table 10to fo llow the dose ti tration schedule. Fo r OCS dose titrations at each visit subjects should have a minimum co mpliance of 10 of the last 14 days before the visit with morning and evening eDiary complet ion, OCS, ICS/LABA and other asthma controller use. Compliance is calculated from the data avail able fro m eDiary com pletion between visit s. In the event of a lower eDiary compliance, using the visit window period the planned visit could be delayed to allow for 10 of the last 14 days compliance or study physician shoul d be consul ted to deci de if the O CS dose reduction should fo llow as per schedule.

Similarly baseline values for the reduction phase will be calculated from a minimum of 10 out of 14 days before randomization visit. cNumber of nights with awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue medication will be counted from the most recent 7 days of available data. dEach nebulization used will be counted as 2 puffs. eInvestigator will provide detailed rationale in eCRF for not reducing the OCS dose. fInvestigator will provide detailed description, in the eCRF, of the signs/symptoms of AI for not reducing the OCS dose according to schedule. It is at the di screti on of the Investi gator to continue with the OCS down -titration even if the criteria for OCS reduction have not been met. Such a decisio n must be j ustified and documented in the source notes and captured in the eCRF. This decisio n must be notified to the AstraZeneca study physician wit hin 2 business days. When a decisio n is made to not reduce th e OCS dose according to the reduction algorithm, the reason(s) for not reducing OCS must be documented in the source notes and captured in the eCRF. Depending on the rationale for not reducing per schedule, the invest igator should preferentially increase u p one step unl ess the j udgment of the investigator is to maintain the"

This will be defined as the optimized OCS dose for the optimizat ion phase and the visit must be combined with Visit 5. Once the optimized OCS dose isreached, no further OCS dose reductions should be performed during the optimization phase. The subject should be maintained on that OCS dose until rando mizat ion (Vi sit 6). Subjects who do not meet all o f the criteria for continuing OCS down titration spec ified in Table 10during the reduction phase, should preferent ially be returned to the previous effective OCS dose (i .e. the higher dose level prior to not meeting the down -titration cri teria) after they have returned to their baseline level o f asthma control established prior to the randomizat ion visit. However, depending on the rationale for not reducing per schedule, the investigator may decide to maintain the subject on the OCS dose at which the down -titration cri teria were not m et. Further dose reductions, during the reduction phase, can be considered in the opinion of the Investigator (further reductions will fo llow the scheduled titration, see Table 9). The decisio n and reason must be captured in the eCRF. Throughout the reduction phase, subjects should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (AI). When subjects reach a prednisone/predniso lonedose of 5 m g/day the investigator should inform them o f the signs and symptom s of AI and provide them a steroid card informing healt h care providers that the subject may need addi tional corti costeroi ds in case of medical emergencies. In evaluat ing subjects for OCS dose reductions to below 5 mg/day the investigator should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of AI. The recommended init ial dose reducti on from 5 mg/day shoul d be to 2.5 m g/day .After 4 weeks at this OCS dose another reducti on to 0 m g/day shoul d be considered. However, if, in the judgment of the invest igator, OCS dose reduction should be more gradually tapered, dose reductions of 1 to 1.25 mg/day every 1 -4 weeks m ay be considered. For doses below 5 mg if the exact dose strength is not available in the country the daily dose to be administered could be achieved by dosing every other day . Daily dose will be the average of 2 days. See 0for help dosi ng < 5 m g in relat ion to tablet strength. Subjects with a final daily OCS dose >0 and ≤5 mg who are unable to reduce their OCS dose further due to AI, should be specified in eCRF. 8.1.2 Asthma exacerbations –Assessment and management During the study , an asthma exacerbat ion will be defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms (defined below) that leads to any of the fo llowing: A tem porary bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids (at a dose at least 1 level higher than the current ti tration step) for at l east 3 consecutive days to treat symptoms of asthma worsening; a single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3- day bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids. Note: Per protocol up titration of OCS dose to 1 level higher (as described in Table 9) is not considered an exacerbat ion event per se. An emergency room or urgent care visit (define d as evaluat ion and treatment for <24 hours in an emergency department or urgent care center) due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroi ds (as per the above). An in-patient hospi talizat ion (defined as admission to an inpatient facilit y and/or evalu ation and treatment in a healt hcare facilit y for ≥ 24 hours) due to asthma."
76,page_76,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 77 (146)For the purpose of the protocol, worsening of asthma is defined as new or increased symptoms and/or si gns i dentified by physical examinat ion/subject interview or by the subject as thma e- Diary. The ePRO device will be programmed to alert both the subject and study site when any of the pre-specified worsening thresho lds as m entioned in Table 11are crossed. Table 11 eDiary alert criteria Criteria a, bDefinition 1 Decrease in morning peak flow ≥20% on at least 2 consecutive days compared with baseline 2 An increase in rescue medication use of ≥ 4 puffs/day on at least 2 consecutive days compared with the average use during baseline or use of ≥12 puffs/day on any one day 3 An additional nebulized β2 agonist use on at least 2 consecutive days compared with the average use during baseline 4 An increase of 2 or more nights with awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue medication over a 7- day period ccompared with the average during baseline, and/or ≥6 out of previous 7 nights with awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue medication (this criterion should be met on 2 consecutive days) 5 An increase in total asthma symptom score (the sum of single -item global assessment of day time symptoms [evening assessment] and night time symptoms [morning assessment]) of at least 2 units above the baseline average or the highest possible score (daily score of 6), on at least 2 consecutive days When an alert is triggered as a result of the 2 -consecutive day rule, the alert will be reset following activation such that a lerts cannot be triggered on consecutive days. aAn alert in itself will not qualify as a clinically significant exacerbation and the site should follow up with the subject as appropriate. bBaseline values for alerts will be calculated from the most recen t 7 days of available data prior to visit 2 for the optimization phase and prior to randomization visit 6 for the treatment period. c Number of nights with awakenings due to asthma requiring rescue medication will be counted from most recent 7 days of available data. If an exacerbat ion event is not associated with deterioration in at least 1 of the pre -specified objective measurements , the invest igator will have to just ify the decisio n for defining the event as an exacerbat ion and record i t in the eC RF. Events that are not supported by any object ive assessment will be deemed not to be a protocol -defined exacerbat ion. For the protocol, the start of an exacerbation is defined as the start date of addit ional systemic corticosteroi ds or of a tem porary increase in a stable OCS background dose, date of ER or urgent care visits requiring addit ional systemic corti costeroi ds, or date of hospital admissio n due to asthma, whichever occurs earlier. The end date of an exacerbat ion is defined as the last date of ad ditional systemic corti costeroi ds (a single depot injectable dose of corticosteroids will be considered equivalent to a 3 -day course of systemic corticosteroids) or of a temporary increase in a stable OCS background dose, date of ER or urgent care visit, o r date of hospital discharge, whichever occurs later."

Reasonable attempts should be made by the Invest igator to bring the subject into the study site for evaluat ion of a diary alert or subject init iated contact due to asthma worsening, particula rly when it results in addit ional treatm ent being prescribed. Study site eval uations f or asthm a worsening may occur as an unscheduled (UNS) visit or as part of an ordinary site visi t if the worsening happens to be coincident with a scheduled visit window. A copy of the m edical record shoul d be obtained for exacerbations evaluated and treated at non -study sites (e.g., by the primary care HCP or at an ER/hospital) and details entered into the specific eCRF (EXACATE) module in a timely fashio n. Changes in conc omitant m edicat ion due to exacerbation must be recorded in the appropriate module o f the eCRF. 8.1.2.1 Exacerbation management during the run -in period Subjects who experience an asthma exacerbat ion during the run -in period may remain in the study . After the treatm ent of exacerbat ion, the subject should preferent ially be pl aced on an OCS dose one step (or more if considered necessary by the invest igator) higher than the dose they were on when the exacerbat ion occurred, unless the judgment of the invest igator i s to maintain the subject on their current dose of OCS. They should be on a stabl e OCS dose for a period of 2 - weeks before beginning the optimization phase. 8.1.2.2 Exacerbation management during the optimization phase If a subject experiences an asthma exacerbat ion during optimizat ion phase, OCS dose reduction shoul d stop. After the treatm ent of exacerbation, the subject should preferent ially be pl aced on an OCS dose one step (or more if considered necessary by the invest igator) higher than the dose they were on w hen the exacerbation occurred, unless the judgment of the investigator is to maintain the subject on their current dose of OCS. The optimizat ion phase could be extended to allow for the subject to be on a stable OCS dose for 2 weeks prior to randomizat ion. 8.1.2.3 Exacerbation management during the treatment period Those who experience an exacerbation after randomizat ion may remain on the IP at the Invest igator’s discret ion. Induction phase If a subject experiences an exacerbat ion during the induction phase, start of OCS dose reductions may be delayed. After the OCS bolus/burst to treat an exacerbat ion is complete, the subject may be returned to one step (or more if considered necessary by the invest igator) higher than the OCS dose they were on when the exacerbat ion occurred or the invest igator may decide to maintain the same OCS dose.

Further dose reductions during the reduction phase can be considered in the opinio n of the Invest igator. However, no further dose reductions should be performed after week 36. Maintenance phase If a subject experiences an exacerbat ion during the maintenance phase, after the OCS bo lus/burst is co mplete, the subject may be returned to one step (or more if considered necessary by the investigator) higher than the OCS dose they were on when the exac erbat ion occurred or the investigator may decide to m aintain the same OCS dose throughout the maintenance phase. 8.1.3 Spirometry 8.1.3.1 General requirements Lung funct ion (FEV 1and forced vital capacit y [FVC]) will be m easured by spirometry at the study site using equ ipment provided by a central vendor. S pirometry will be performed by the Invest igator or authorized delegate according to ATS/ERS guidelines ( Miller et al 2005 ). The vendor providing central spiro metry services will be responsible for assuring that the spirometer used by each si te meets ATS/ERS recommendat ions, and that the study site personnel who will be performing the testing are properly certified. Spiro metry calibrat ion will be detailed in a separate spi rometry procedure m anual . Subjects should be instructed to fo llow the requi red restri ctions for performing spiro metry as described in sect ions 5.3and Table 6. If the requi red restri ctions have not been adhered to, the investigator should reschedule the visit to the earli est opportunit y within the allowed visit window. Spirometry testing m ust be perform ed according to the schedule provided in SoA. All post - rando mizat ion spiro metry assessments shoul d be perform ed wi thin ± 1.5 hours of the time that the baseline Pre -BD spi rometry was performed. 8.1.3.2 Spirometry technique Detailed procedure for performing spiro metry will be described in a separate instruction manual. Details regarding assessment of the qualit y of spirometry and the best test report (BTR) process will also be detailed in the manual. A signed and dated copy of the spirogram printout m ust be kept at the study site for source data verification. Spirometry references The Gl obal Lung Funct ion Init iative (GLI) equations will be used to determine the predicted norm al values (PNV) and are pre -programmed int o the spirometer (Quanj er et al 2012 ). FEV 1, expressed as percent of the PNV, will be calculated as fo llows: FEV 1% of PNV = (FEV 1 measured/FEV 1PNV) x 100"

Bronchodilatation can be induced using albuterol (90 μg m etered dose) or salbutamol (100 μg metered dose) up to a maximum of 4 inhalat ions. In rare cases where a subject has an adverse or allergic reaction to albuterol/salbutamo l, levalbuterol (45 μg m etered dose; up to a maximum of 4 inhalat ions) can be used. Levalbuterol will not be supplied by the sponsor. It i s highly reco mmended to use a spacer device for this procedure. Nebulizer should not be used. A lower total dose (e.g., 2 inha lations instead of 4 puffs), can be used if there is a concern about any effect on the subject’s heart rate, tremor or safet y; the reason shoul d be noted in the subject’s medical record. If FEV 1reversibilit y has not been documented in the previous 12 mon ths prior to or at visit 1, further assessments to meet the reversibilit y criteria m ay be perform ed at visi t 2. It i s acceptable to stop further reversibilit y assessments once the criteria for reversibilit y are met. The highest pre -and post -BD FEV 1will b e used to determine reversibilit y. Reversibilit y is calculated as fo llows: % Reversibilit y = (post -BD FEV 1-pre-BD FEV 1) × 100/pre -BD FEV 1 8.1.4 Home PEF testing An electronic, hand -held spi rometer (AM3G+™) to measure PEF (ePEF meter) will be provided to the subject at visit 1. Subjects will be trained on at- home use of the ePEF meter at visit 1. Training will include explanat ion of device functionalit y and proper use of the ePEF meter. Hom e PEF testing will be performed by the subject in the m orning upon awa kening (and prior to taking their AM asthma controller) and in the evening at bedtime (and prior to taking their PM asthma controller). Recording of ho me PEF should start from the evening of visit 1 unt il the morning o f visit 18 (week 48). When possible, a mbulatory lung f unction measurements should be taken at least 6 hours after the last dose of SABA rescue medicat ion. Subjects should perform 3 successive peak flow manoeuvres while sitt ing or standing, but in the same posi tion at every testing. The Investi gator/authori zed delegate will check subject’s adherence to use of the PEF meter as shown in SoA. 8.1.5 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) Airway inflammat ion will be e valuated using a standardized single -breath FENO test in accordance with the SoA. The single exhalation technique reco mmended by the manufacturer will be fo llowed ( Alving et al 2017 )."
80,page_80,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 81 (146)Subjects will be asked whether they have had a respi ratory infecti on in the 2 weeks prior to measurement. The FENO measurements will not be performed within 2 weeks of a respiratory infect ion. The FENO test will be performed prior to spirometry . Subjects should not eat or drink 1 hour prior to having the FENO test. Subjects should not use their rescue SABA medicat ion (e.g., albuterol/salbutamo l) within6 hours of the measurement. Inhaled BDs (including ICS - LABA) shoul d be wi thheld for the effect duration specific to the BD as described in the spirometry section. If not, the assessment should be postponed till after the required time has passed since the meal or drink or the visit must be rescheduled within the allowed visit window. The NIOX VERO® Airway Inflammat ion Monitor will be used to measure FENO. Instructions for use of thi s monitor will be provi ded in a separate users’ manual. NIOX VERO® sensors will be replaced as recommended by the manufacturer. The vendor supplying the equipment will be responsible for ensuring that the equipment and procedures for the measurement of FENO are validated prior to the start of the study . All FENO m easurements wi ll be blinded for sites, subjects and sponsor throughout the study . All post -randomizat ion FENO assessments should be performed within ± 1.5 hours of the time that the rando mizat ion FENO was performed. 8.1.6 Patient reported outcomes Patient reported outcomes (PRO) data will be captured electronically using a handheld device (eDiary). Site personnel will be trained on using the eDiary . Detailed procedures for using eDiary and training the subjects will be described in a separate instru ction manual. Subjects will be trained on at -home use o f the eDi ary at visi t 1. Training will include explanat ion of device funct ionality and i ts proper use. The subject will also be asked to verify com pletion of training on the eDiary. The site staff will set assessment reminder alarms on the device. At -home PRO assessment will start the evening of visit 1 and continue thereafter at every morning and evening until study com pletion as per the SoA. Subj ects will be asked to bring the device back at each study visit. At si te PRO questi onnai res shoul d be com pleted pri or to any other assessments. The Invest igator/authorized delegate will check subject’s adherence to the com pleting PRO at each visit and even in between as shown in SoA. 8.1.6.1 Asthma Daily Diary The daily diary will be com pleted each day from the evening of visit 1 to the morning of visit 18. The m orning eDi ary will include: Asthma Symptom Diary (ASD) morning items, questions about rescue medicat ion, night time awakening, and use of maintenance medicat ions. The evening eDiary will incl ude: ASD evening i tems and quest ions about res cue medicat ions. Upon completion of the morning and evening quest ions the subject will co mplete the peak expiratory flow assessment. There will be triggers in the eDiary to al ert the subjects to signs of worsening of asthma and to contact their physician, please refer to Table 11. The subject should contact the investigator (or vice versa) for evaluation after receiving a diary alert."
81,page_81,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 82 (146)Asthma Symptom Diary Asthma symptoms will be recorded using the ASD ( Globe et al 2015 ). The ASD comprises 10 items (5 i tems in the m orning; 5 i tems in the evening). The morning items assess night time symptom severi ty in relati on to wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and the frequency o f night time awakening. The evening items assess symptom severit y in relation to wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness, and act ivity limitation since waking. Items are scored from “0” (no symptom, no night time awakening, or no activit y limitation) to “4” (very severe symptom , unable to sl eep, or extrem e act ivity limitat ion). A daily ASD score is the mean of the 10 items. R esponses for all 10 items are required to calculate the daily ASD score; otherwise, it is treated as missing. Calculat ion of a daily ASD score requires data fro m the evening diary assessment and the subsequent morning diary assessment. For the 7 -day averag e asthma symptom score, scoring is done with no imputation using the mean of at least 4 of the 7 daily ASD scores as a m ean weekly item score. The 7 -day average ASD score ranges fro m 0 to 4. Global asthma symptom items In addit ion to the ASD, subjects will complete a single -item global assessment of asthma symptoms (0 -3) each morning and evening. The sum o f evening and subsequent morning single global item scores (0 -6) will be used for the alerts system. Rescue medication The number of rescue medicat ion inhalations (puffs) and nebulizer treatments taken will be recorded by the subject in the eDiary twice daily (i.e., in the m orning and evening) beginning the evening of visit 1 unt il the morning of visit 18. The number of inhalat ions taken between the morning and evening l ung f uncti on assessments will be recorded in the evening. The number of inhalat ions taken between the evening and the morning will be recorded in the morning . Night time awakenings Night time awakenings due to asthma symptoms will be recorde d by the subject in the eDiary each m orning, beginning in the morning after visit 1 until the morning of visit 18, by answering the question whether he/she woke up during the night due to asthma symptoms with a “yes” or “no” response. Maintenance medication Maintenance medicat ion compliance will be recorded in the eDiary once daily in the m orning, beginning in the morning after visit 1 until the morning of Visit 18. There will be separate questions for checking compliance wit h OCS. 8.1.6.2 Asthma Control Questionn aire (ACQ -6) The ACQ- 6 captures asthma symptoms (night -time waking, symptoms on waking, activit y limitation, shortness o f breath, wheezing) and short -acting β2 -agonist use via subject -report."

The mean ACQ -6 score i s the m ean of the responses. Mean scores of ≤ 0.75 indicate well -controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and <1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score ≥1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006 ). Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful and a decrease of at least 0.5 is the responder defin itionfor ACQ -6. ACQ -6 will be co mpleted at the beginning o f site visi ts using eDiary in accordance wi th the SoA. For IPD subjects ACQ -6 can be co mpleted at home as w ell. 8.1.6.3 Standardised asthma quality of life questionnaire for 12 years and older (AQLQ(S)+12) The AQLQ(S)+12 is a quest ionnaire that measures the healt h-related qualit y of life experienced by asthma pat ients. The questionnaire comprises 4 separate domains (symptoms, act ivity limitations, emotional funct ion, and environmental stimuli). Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each of the quest ions on a 7- point scale ranging from 7 (no impairment) to 1 (severe impairment). The overall score is calculated as the mean response to all questions. The 4 indivi dual dom ain scores (symptom s, activit y limitat ions, emotional function, and environmental st imuli) are the means of the responses to the questions in each of the domains. The responder definit ion for AQLQ(s)+12 is 0.5- point improvement fro m baseline. The AQLQ(s)+12 will be co mpleted at the beginning of site visits using eDiary in accordance with the SoA. For IPD subjects AQLQ(S)+12 can be co mpleted at home as well. 8.1.6.4 St George’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) The SGRQ is a 50- item PRO instrum ent devel oped to m easure the healt h status of patients with airway obstructi on di seases ( Jones et al 1991). The questi onnaire is divided into 2 parts: part 1 consists of 8 items pertaining to the severit y of respi ratory symptom s in the preceding 4 weeks; part 2 consists of 42 items related to the daily act ivity and psychosoci al impacts of the individual’s respiratory condi tion. The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores (symptom s, activit y, and impacts). The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall healt h status. This total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impa irment, in which 100 represents the worst possible healt h status and 0 indicates the best possible health status. Likewise, the dom ain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat ive of greater impairment. Based on empirical data and interviews with patients, a mean change score of 4 units is associated with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID). Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by the developer in a user manual ( Jones et al 2009 ). SGRQ will be co mpleted at the beginning of site visit using eDiary in accordance with the SoA. 8.1.6.5 European qua lity of life -5 dimensions- 5 levels ( EQ-5D- 5L) The EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensio ns: m obilit y, self -care, usual activit ies, pain/disco mfort and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 response options (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels o f difficult y."
83,page_83,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 84 (146)The subject will be asked to indicate his/her current healt h state by selecting the m ost appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensio ns. The questionnaire also i ncludes a visual analogue scale, where the subject will be asked to rate current healt h status on a scale of 0 - 100, wi th 0 being the worst imaginable health state. The EQ -5D- 5L will be completed u sing eDiary in accordance wi th the SoA. 8.1.6.6 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire plus Classroom Impairment Questions (WPAI+CIQ) The WPAI+CIQ consists of quest ions about how asthma and asthma related issues im pact a subject’s abilit y to work, attend cl asses, and perform regul ar daily act ivities. The quest ionnaire relates to the subject’s experience over the previous 7 day s. The WPAI+CIQ will be used to measure self -reported productivit y loss. WPAI+CIQ will be completed at the beginning of site visits using eDiary in accordance wit h the SoA. For IPD subjects WPAI + CIQ can be co mpleted at home as well. 8.2 Safety assessments Planned time po ints for all safet y assessments are provided in the SoA. 8.2.1 Clinical safety laboratory assessments See Table 12for the list of clinical safet y laboratory tests to be perform ed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency .

Physical examinat ion (com plete and bri ef) will be perform ed at timelines as specified in the SoA, Invest igators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses, new or worsening abnormalit ies may qualify as adverse events, see section 8.3.7 for details. 8.2.4 Vital signs Vital signs (i .e. pul se, blood pressure, respiration rate and body temperature) will be obtained in accordance with SoA. Vital signs will be taken pri or to bl ood drawing, IP administration and, if possible, usual asthma controller medicat ion. Subjects should be observed for a minimum o f 2 hours after administration of the first two IP doses for the appearance of any acute drug reactions. For the remaining doses, subjects will be observed for a minimum o f 1 hour after IP administration for any such react ion. Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in a sitting posit ion with a com pletely autom ated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an autom ated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by at least 5 minutes of rest for the subject in a quiet setting without distractions (e .g., tel evision, cell phones). Pulse rate will be obtained before blood pressure, if the manual measurement technique is used. Respiration rate will be obtained after subject has been rest ing for at least 5 minutes, by count ing number of breaths (i.e., ho w many times the chest rises) for one minute. Body temperature will be measured prior to IP administration, in accordance with local standards. 8.2.5 Electrocardiograms A 12 -lead ECG will be taken in supine posit ion after resting for at least 15 minutes, prior to blood draw, FeNO, spirometry , BD administrati on and IP administration.

The composite GTI captures commo n glucocorti coid (GC) toxicities that are sensitive to differing cumulat ive GC doses over the period of a ty pical clinical trial (6 m onths to 3 y ears). The individual items within the GTI are weighted relat ive to each other for severit y, and the instrument has the capabilit y of measuring not only worsening of GC toxicity over baseline, but al so improvem ent. The composite GTI measures change in GC toxicit y rather than absol ute GC toxi city in order to account for the effects of prior GC therapy . Scoring should be performed as per SoA, using the rando misat ion assessment as the baseline. The GTI items were ranked in order of severit y within each dom ain. The relative weights for each toxicit y item were derived using mult icriteria decisio n analysis (MCDA). MCDA has been used for the creation of mult iple classification criteria sets in a variet y of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthrit is (Neogi T et al 2010 ), systemic sclerosis ( Johnson S R et al 2014 ), systemic lupus ery thematosus ( Tedeschi SK et al 2017 ). IgG4 -Related Disease classificat ion criteri a is presently under development (JH Stone; personal co mmunicat ion). The composite GTI will be assessed at the timepo ints given in the SoA. The fo llowing i tems will be assessed: BMI, glucose tolerance (HbA1c), blood pressure, LDL, steroid myopathy, skin toxicity, neuropsy chiatri c toxi city and Infect ion. 8.3 Collection of adverse events The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study are familiar with the content of this sect ion. The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in 0. AE will be reported by the subject (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the subject's legally authori zed representative).

For 5 ordered categories, there are 4 possible cumulat ive odds for each treatment group, corresponding to the 4 different possible binary splits, which are defined as fo llows: • Category 1 versus categori es (2,3,4,5) • Categories (1,2) versus categories (3,4,5) • Categories (1,2,3) versus categories (4,5) • Categories (1,2,3,4) versus category 5, where the ordered categories for OCS daily dose reduction are i n turn defined as: • Category 1: 90% -100% reduction • Category 2: 75% -<90% reduction • Category 3: 50% -<75% reduction • Category 4: >0% -<50% reduction"

The above hypothesis assumes that the 4 possible odds ratios between the 2 treatments as defined above are the same (this is the proportional odds assumpt ion). The di rection of superiorit y of tezepel umab is indicated by an odds rati o greater than 1. Key secondary endpoints H02: AAER ratio over 48 weeks (tezepelumab/placebo) = 1 versus H12: AAER ratio over 48 weeks (tezepelumab/placebo) ≠ 1 The di rection of superiorit y of tezepel umab is indicated by a rate rati o less than 1. 9.2 Sample size determination Approximately 152 subjects will be randomly assigned to study treatm ent using 1:1 allo cation between the two treatments. Since the primary analysis o f the primary endpo int will include all rando mised subjects as far as possible, no need is envisaged to adjust the number of subjects planned to be randomised in order to obtain a number of evaluable subjects. With 76 subjects per treatment group it is est imated that, using a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level, the power to reject the null hypothesis for the primary endpoint will be at least 90%, assuming: • An odds ratio of 2.75 and the proportional odds assumpt ion (see Sect ion 9.1) • The proporti on of subjects in the 5 differen t dose reducti on categori es is similar to what was observed in the Steroid Reduct ion with mepolizum ab Study (SIRIUS) ( Bel et al 2014 ). The following proportions have been assumed for placebo: Category 1 (90% - 100% reduction): 10% of subjects Category 2 (75% -<90% reduction): 10% of subjects Category 3 (50% -<75% reduction): 15% of subjects Category 4 (>0% -<50% reduction): 15% of subjects Category 5 (no reducti on or an increase): 50% of subjects The minimal detectable odds ratio still being significant with the above assumpt ions is 1.86. For the key secondary endpoint, 76 subjects per group has >80% power to reject the null hypothesis for rate ratios up to 0.39, us ing a 2 -sided 5% si gnificance level, and assuming: A placebo rate of 1.3 exacerbations/year in this study populati on A conservat ive assumption on the dispersio n parameter (2.4) Uniform dropout of 10%"

A comprehensive statist ical analysis plan will be developed and finalised before primary database lock and will describe the subject populat ions to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary of the pl anned stati stical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. Any deviat ions from this plan will be reported in the clinical study report. Frequency and percentages of subject disposit ion and reasons for discont inuat ion of IP will be presented. Subjects who prematurely discontinue the IP will be listed along wit h the reason for discontinuat ion. In addit ion, frequency and percentages of withdrawal from the study together with reasons will be presented. Dem ographics and subject characterist ics will be summarized by treatment group using frequency and percentages (for categorical variables) and n, mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, median and m aximum (for continuous variables) using the full analysis set. Relevant medical history /current m edical condit ions will be summarized by treatm ent group, system organ cl ass and preferred term of the MedDRA dict ionary using f requency and percentage of subjects for each treatment group. Prior and concomitant m edicat ions, categorized according to the WHO Drug Reference List dictionary which empl oys the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classificat ion system, will be summarized by treatm ent group as fr equency and percentage of subjects reporting usage. Prior medicat ions are defined as those which stopped before first dose of IP. Concomitant medicat ions are defined as those which eit her started or continued after first dose of IP. Important protocol devi ations will be defined prior to unblinding and summarised by treatment group. Subjects will not be excluded fro m analysis sets on the basis of any important protocol deviat ions.

100,page_100,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 101 (146)9.4.2 Definition of baseline In general, the last measurement at or prior to randomizat ion will serve as the baseline measurement. If there is no value at or prior to randomizat ion, then the baseline value will not be imputed and will be set to missing. The baseline OCS dose for the primary and secondary variables rel ated to OCS reducti on during the reduction and maintenance periods is defined as the most recent prescribed daily dose pri or to randomizat ion. For weekly means derived fro m subject diaries, baseline is defined as the mean of the available data in the most recent week prior to randomizat ion. If more than 3 days within that period is missing, then the baseline will be considered to be missing. For titration of the OCS dose baseline values for optimizat ion phase are calculated fro m completed eDi ary records of a minimum o f 10 out of 14 day s before visit 2. Similarly baseline values for the reduction phase will be calculated from a minimum o f 10 out of 14 day s before randomizat ion visit. Further details regarding baseline definit ions will be provided in the SAP. 9.4.3 Efficacy analyses 9.4.3.1 Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will quantify the effect of the init ially rando mised treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received. This analysis will therefore include all available data after treatment discont inuat ion for subjects who continue to attend monthly visits either at si te or b y telephone. Subjects will be encouraged to continue to undergo applicable study related visits/procedures for the full 48 -week peri od even after prem ature di scontinuati on of IP. The primary endpoint is the percentage reduction from baseline in daily OCS d ose at 48 weeks whilst not losing asthma control (as per Table 10), by defined categori es, where percent change from baseline is defined as {(final dose -baseline dose} /baseline dose)*100. Percent change fro m baseline will then be categorized per the categories in Sect ion 3. The final OCS dose is defined based on the prescribed dose, expressed as a dose per day , at week 48. If the subject is on a fixed daily dose, then the OCS dose is defined as that prescribed dose. If the subject i s on an every other day regimen, then the OCS dose is defined as the average amount prescribed to be taken each day. Further details on deriving the final OCS dose in specific situat ions including asthma deteri oration, discont inuat ion from study, and premature discont inuat ion from IP (with different options for subject fo llow up), will be specified in the SAP. The primary endpoint in the tezepelumab group will be compared to that in the placebo group using a proportional odds (ordinal logist ic regression) model. This model will be used to perform the stati stical test specified in Sect ion 9.1, and to estimate the treatment effect and its 95% confidence interval. The response variable in the model will be the ordered category number (1 -"
101,page_101,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 102 (146)5) at Week 48 as defined in Sect ion 9.1. Treatm ent and regi on will be included as factors in this model. Baseline OCS dose will also be included in the model as a continuous (linear) covariate. Frequency tables of the number and pr oportion of subjects in each of the response categories will be presented. Cumulat ive responder (percentage reduction) plots will be presented to aid interpretati on of the primary analysis. In addi tion, the number and proportion of subjects with final dail y oral corti costeroi d dose >0 and ≤5 mg, unable to reduce the OCS dose further due to adrenal insufficiency will be tabul ated. As further support to the primary analysis, the actual percentage reduction in daily OCS dose at Week 48 will be summarized descr iptively and compared between treatments using a Wilcoxon rank sum test stratified by region (van Elteren test). The consistency o f treatm ent effect across baseline bio markers and demographic variables will be evaluated descript ively, given the possible limit ations of sample size on statistical modelling approaches in this trial. Any further requirements for subgroup analysis, and exact definit ion of all relevant categories where needed, will be pre- specified in the SAP. Sensit ivity analyses on the primary endpo int will be performed, and will be fully specified in the SAP. These may include, but not necessarily be limited to: • Analysis which makes provisio n for data to be missing -not- at-random (MNAR) and which makes different assumpt ions regarding those subjects who di scont inue treatment or study prior to 48 weeks • The impact of different imputation strategies for the final OCS dose including switching to other asthma treatments • An invest igation into the proportional odds assumption, and if necessary further analyses which make fewer restrictions with regards to this assumpt ion and/or analyses using different response category defini tions • Analysis in which addit ional factors or covari ates are included. 9.4.3.2 Analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoints The main analysis o f the key secondary endpoint (AAER over 48 weeks) will quant ify the effect of the ini tially randomised treatment, regardless of the treatments that subjects actually received. This analysis will therefore include all available data after t reatment discont inuat ion. Subjects will be encouraged to continue to undergo applicable study related visits/procedures for the full 48-week period even after premature discont inuat ion of IP. AAER in the tezepelumab group will be co mpared to that seen in t he placebo group using a negat ive binomial model. This m odel will be used to estimate the rate ratio and its 95% confidence interval. The response variable in the model will be the number of asthma exacerbations experienced by a subject over the 48 -week tr eatment period (or shorter duration if not fo llowed up for the full 48 weeks). Treatment, region and history of exacerbat ions (≤2 or >2 in previous 12 months) will be included as factors in this model. The logarithm o f the time at risk"
102,page_102,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C000 09 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 103 (146)for exacerbat ion in the study will be used as an offset variable in the model, to adjust for subjects having different fo llow-up times during which the events occur. Time during an exacerbation and the 7 day s following an exacerbat ion in which a new exacerbat ion cannot occur, will not be included in the calculat ion of time at risk for exacerbat ion. Descript ive summaries of the AAER will also be presented. Sensit ivity analyses on the key secondary endpoint will be performed, and will be fully specified in the SAP. These may include, but not necessarily be limited to, similar items considered for the primary endpoint (where relevant). Rates for the individual exacerbat ion criteria (em ergency room or urgent care visit s due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids, hospita lization due to asthma, or use of systemic corticosteroi ds) will be summarized and analysed similarly. A sensit ivity analysis may be performed where adjudicat ion outcom e of the ER or urgent care visits, hospi talizat ions and all deaths will be considered. 9.4.3.3 Analysis of other efficacy endpoints Binary (responder) endpo ints which support the primary object ive wit h regards to OCS dose reducti on will be summarized using frequency tables. The odds rati o (tezepel umab/placebo) and its 95% confidence interval will be estimated for each endpo int from a logisti c regressio n model with factors for treatment and region, and baseline OCS dose included as a continuous (linear) covari ate. Other binary endpo ints will be summarized and analysed similarly; these analyses will be adjusted for regi on and baseline o f the corresponding endpo int. Changes fro m baseline in cont inuous variables will generally be analysed using a mixed model for repeated m easures (MMRM) model for each endpoint. This model will be used to estimate the treat ment effect at Week 48 and its 95% confidence interval. The response variable in the model will be the change from baseline at each scheduled post- randomisat ion visit up to and including Week 48, and irrespect ive of whether the subject remained on treatmen t and/or took other treatments. Treatment, visit, region and treatment by visit interacti on will be included as factors i n this model. The baseline o f the corresponding endpoint will also be included in the model as a continuous covari ate. Unstructured cov ariance will be assumed to m odel the relationship between pairs of response variables taken at different visits on the same subject. If the MMRM model fails to converge with unstructured covariance, the SAP will pre -specify the approach for select ing a sim pler covari ance structure. The Kenward- Roger approximat ion to estimat ing the degrees of freedo m will be used for tests of fixed effects derived from the MMRM model. Descript ive summaries of continuous endpo ints will also be presented. Adjusted means fro m the MMRM m odel above will be displayed graphically over time. Time to first asthma exacerbat ion will be summarised graphically using Kaplan -Meier est imates, and analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with factors for treatment and region."

113,page_113,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 (146)Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information B 1 Definition of adverse events An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or cli nical study subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nau sea, chest pain), or disease temporally associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration of a pre-exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no Study treatm ent has been administered. B 2 Definitions of serious adverse event A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:  Results in death  Is immediately life -threatening  Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion  Results in persistent or signif icant di sabili ty or incapaci ty.  Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect  Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may require medical treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. B 3 Life threatening ‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the subject ’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it might have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure). B 4 Hospitalisation Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE , although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, larynge al oedem a). Hospi tal admissi ons and/or surgi cal operati ons planned before or during a study are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study ."
114,page_114,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 115 (146)B 5 Important medical event or medical treatment Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important m edical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These shoul d usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug d oes not mean that i t is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used. Examples of such events are:  Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatm ent  Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophe n) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine  Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi talisat ion  Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  Adrenal crisis B 6 Intensity rating scale: 1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities) 3. severe (incapacitat ing, w ith inabilit y to perform norm al activities) It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y whereas seriousness is defined by the cri teria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe intensit y need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendi x B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B 2. B 7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug."
115,page_115,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 116 (146) Time Course. Expo sure to suspect drug. Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect drug?  Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxi cology) or drugs of the same pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical properties?  De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug?  No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge .  Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . In difficult cases, other factors could be considere d such as:  Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?  Is there a known mechanism? Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expressio n ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general , that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship. The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available da ta including enough information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteri orate d due to lack of effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y. B 8 Medication Error For the purposes of this clinical study a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that ei ther ca uses harm to the participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant. A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or parti cipant."
116,page_116,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 117 (146)Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.  occurred  was i dentified and intercepted before the participant received the drug  did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:  Drug name confusio n  Dispensing error e.g. medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to the parti cipant  Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of administrat ion  Drug not taken as indicated e.g. tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a solid tablet  Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature  Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS /IWRS errors)  Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors) Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:  Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one o f the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error  Parti cipant acci dentally missed drug dose(s) e.g. forgot to take medication  Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)  Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging  Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the medicat ion error."

The Principal Invest igator at each centre keeps full traceabilit y of co llected bio logical samples from the subjects while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate). The sample receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps docume ntation of recei pt of arrival. AstraZeneca will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory provi ders Samples retained for f urther use will be stored in the AZ -assigned bi obanks and will be registered by the AstraZeneca Bio bank Team during the ent ire life cycle. If required, AstraZeneca will ensure that remaining bio logical samples are returned to the site according to local re gulati ons or at the end of the retention period, whichever is the sooner. C 2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples If a subject withdraws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will be disposed of/destroyed, and the acti on documented. If samples are already analysed ,AstraZeneca is not obliged to destroy the resul ts of this research. As collect ion of the bio logical sample(s) i s an integral part of the study , then the subject i s withdrawn from further study parti cipation. The Principal Invest igator:  Ensures subjects’ wit hdrawal o f informed consent to the use of donated samples is notified immediately to AstraZeneca  Ensures that bio logical samples from that subject, if stored at the study site, are immediately identified, disposed of /destroy ed, and the action documented  Ensures the organizat ion(s) ho lding the samples is/are informed about the withdrawn consent immediately and that samples are disposed of/destroy ed, the acti on docum ented and the signed document retur ned to the study site  Ensures that the subject and AstraZeneca are informed about the sample disposal.

Variable response to therapy may be due to geneti c determinants that impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excret ion; mechanism of action of the drug; di sease aet iology; and/or mo lecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. Therefore, where local regulati ons and IRB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analysis from consent ing subjects. AstraZeneca intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to medicat ions. Genet ic research may lead to better u nderstanding of diseases, better diagnosis of diseases or other improvements in healt h care and to the discovery of new diagnosti cs, treatm ents or m edicat ions. In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions wit h well described clinical character istics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies. Genet ic research may consist of the analysis o f the structure of the subject ´s DNA, i.e. the entire geno me. The resul ts of genet ic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report (CSR) or in a separate study summary . The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confident iality. The samples will be retained while research on tezepelumab cont inues but no l onger than 15 years or other period as per local requirements. D 2 Genetic research plan and procedures Selection of genetic research population Study selection record All subjects will be asked to participate in this genetic research. Participat ion is voluntary and if a subject declines to participate there will be no penalt y or loss of benefit. The subject will not be excluded fro m any aspect of the m ain study . Inclusion criteria  For inclusio n in this genet ic research, subjects must fulfil all o f the inclusio n criteria described in the main body of the Clinical Study Protocol and: Provide informed consent for the genet ic sampling and analyses."
121,page_121,"Clinical Study Protocol - 4 AstraZeneca Tezepelumab -D5180C00009 CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 122 (146)Exclusion criteria Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any of the excl usion criteria specified in the main study or any of the fo llowing:  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant  Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusio n in 120 days of genetic sample collect ion Withdrawal of consent for genetic research: Subjects m ay withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study . Vol untary discont inuat ion will not prejudice further treatment. Procedures for discontinuat ion are outli ned in Sect ion 7of the m ain Clinical Study Protocol . Collection of samples for genetic research The blood samples for genetic research will be obtained fro m the subjects as per SoA. Although DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducin g bias through excluding subjects who may wit hdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such subjects would be important to include in any genet ic analysis. Samples will be collected, labelled, stored, and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual. Coding and storage of DNA samples The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genet ic analysis are important to maintain subject confident iality. Sam ples will be stored for a m aximum of 15years, from the date of l ast subject l ast visit, after whi ch they will be destroy ed. DNA is a finite resource that is used up during analyses. Samples will be stored and used until no further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. An addit ional second code will be assigned to the bloo d either before or at the time of DNA extracti on repl acing the information on the sample tube. Thereafter, the sample will be ident ifiable only by the second, unique number. This number is used to ident ify the sample and corresponding data at the AstraZene ca genet ics laboratories, or at the designated organisat ion. No personal details identifying the individual will be available to any person (AstraZeneca employee or desi gnated organi sations working wi th the DNA). The link between the subject enrolment/rand omisati on code and the second number will be maintained and stored in a secure environment, with restricted access at AstraZeneca or designated organisations. The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, facilitate correlat ion of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical data, all ow regulatory audi t, and permit tracing of samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal o f consent. Ethical and regulatory requirements The principles for ethical and regulatory requi rements for the study , including this genet ics research component, are outlined in Appendix D."

To participate in the genet ic component of the study the subject must sign and date both the consent form for the main study and the genet ic component of the study. Copies of both signed and dated consent forms must be given to the subject and the original filed at the study centre. The Principal Invest igator(s) is responsible for ensuring that consent is given freely and that the subject understands that they may freely discont inue from the genet ic aspect of the study at any time. Subject data protection AstraZeneca will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, any emplo yer, their family members, general physician unless required to do so by law. Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to the identi ty of the subject. Regul atory authori ties may requi re access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical informat ion and the genetic files would remain physically separate. Data management Any genoty pe data generated in t his study will be stored at a secure system at AstraZeneca and/or designated organizations to analyse the samples. AstraZeneca and its designated organisat ions may share summary results (such as genet ic differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease ) from this genetic research with other researchers, such as hospitals, academic organisat ions or health insurance co mpanies. This can be done by placing the results in scientific databases, where they can be combined with the resul ts of similar studi es to learn even more about healt h and disease. The researchers can only use thi s informat ion for health -related research purposes. Researchers may see summary results but they will not be able to see individual subject data or any personal identifiers. Some or all of the clinical datasets from the main study may be merged wi th the genet ic data in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database. Statistical methods and determination of sample size The number of subjects that will agree to par ticipate in the genet ic research is unknown. It is therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal statist ical evaluat ion or whether only descript ive statist ics will be generated. A Statist ical Analysis Plan may be prepared where appropriate."

All sources of l aboratory data are a ppropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL events; this includes samples taken at scheduled study visit s and other visits including central and all local laboratory evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study visits; for exam ple, PHL cri teria could be met by an elevated ALT from a central laboratory and/or elevated TBL from a local laboratory . The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for AEs that may indicate elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events. TheInvesti gator parti cipates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry other than drug induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the Invest igational Medicinal Product (IMP). The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y reporting processes. E 2 Definitions Potential Hy’s Law (PHL) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× upper limit o f norm al (ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any point during the study following the start of study medicat ionirrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Hy’s Law (HL) AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, whe re no other reason, other than the IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, e.g. elevated ALP indicat ing cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug."

E 3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases In order to i dentify cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in combinat ion:  ALT ≥ 3×ULN  AST ≥ 3×ULN  TBL ≥ 2×ULN Central laboratories being used: When a subject meets any o f the PHL i dentificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbinat ion, the central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Invest igator (and also to the AstraZeneca representative). The Investigator will also remain vigilan t for any local laboratory reports where the PHL ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:  Notify the AstraZeneca representative  Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory  Com plete the appro priate unscheduled laboratory CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal local laboratory test resul t When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central or local laboratory resul ts the Invest igator will wit hout del ay:  Determine whether the subject meets PHL criter ia (see Section E 2Definit ions wi thin this Appendix for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory reports fro m all previous visit s (including both central and local lab oratory resul ts) E 4 Follow -up E4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:  Inform the AstraZeneca representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria."

E4.2 Potential Hy’s Law criteria met If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:  Notify the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study Team  Within 1 day of PHL criteria being met, the Invest igator will report the case as an SAE of Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Important medical event’ and causalit y assessment ‘ yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting  For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required to submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change in the subject’s condit ion  The Study Physician conta cts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an approach for the study subjects’ fo llow-up (including any further laboratory testing) and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this contact the Invest igator will:  Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated. Completes follow-up SAE Form as required.  Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed with the Study Physician. This includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit shoul d be used.  Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available E 5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s L aw cases The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all cases where PHL cri teria are m et. As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether there is an alternative explanat ion for meet ing PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IMP, to ensure timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within 15 calendar days from date PHL criteria was m et.

Where there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:  If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the appropriate CRF  If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted Potential Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly wit h the new information (re assessing event term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ standard processes.

The World Healt h Organizat ion has categorized anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups, which are clinically indist inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (e.g. IgG and immune complex mediated) and nonimmuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this study are listed in section 2. A guide to the signs and symptoms and management of acute anaphylaxis is p rovided in section 3. Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrine, ant ihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat anaphylact ic reacti ons must be immediately available at study sites, and study personnel should be trained to recogni ze and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. If an anaphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the subject as soon as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for analysis of serum tryptase. G 2 Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis and Immune Complex Disease Anaphylaxis In adults, anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the fo llowing 3 cri teria is fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the skin, mucosal t issue, or both (e.g. generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swo llen lips -tongue - uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING (a) Respiratory com promise (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hy poxemia). (b) Reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunct ion (e.g. hy potoni a [collapse], syncope, incont inence). 2. Two or more of the fo llowing that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours): (a) Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (e.g. generalized hives, itch- flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula). (b) Respiratory com promise (e.g. dy spnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hy poxemia). (c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g. hy potonia [collapse], syncope, incont inence). (d) Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. crampy abdominal pain, vomit ing)."

Assessment of airway , breathing, ci rculation, and adequacy of mentati on 2. Administer epinephrine intramuscularly every 5-15 minutes, in appropriate doses, as necessary , depending on the presenting signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, to control signs and symptoms and prevent progression to more severe symptoms such as respi ratory distress, hypotension, shock and unconsciousness. Possibly appropriate, subsequent measures depending on response to epinephrine (e) Place subject in recumbent posit ion and elevate lower extremit ies. (f) Establish and maintain airway. (g) Administer oxy gen. (h) Establish venous access. (i)Norm al saline IV for fluid replacement. Specific measures to consider after epinephrine injections, where appropriate (j)Consider epinephrine infusio n. (k) Consider H1 and H2 ant ihistamines. (l)Consider nebulized β2 agonist [e.g. albuterol (salbutamo l)] for bronchospasm resistant to epinephrine. (m)Consider systemic corticosteroids. (n) Consider vasopressor (e.g. dopamine). (o) Consider glucagon for subject taking b -blocker. (p) Consider atropine for symptomat ic bradycardia. (q) Consider transportation to an emergency depart ment or an intensive care facilit y. (r) For cardi opulm onary arrest during anaphylaxis, high -dose epinephrine and prolon ged resuscitat ion efforts are encouraged, if necessary .

K 1 Home Visits to Replace On -Site Visits (where applicable) Due to l ocal travel restri ctions and/or site restrict ions, subjects may not wis h to or m ay not be able to go to the study site for study visits and related procedures. If an on -site visi t is not possible, it is reco mmended to have a home visit wit h home administration of IP by a qualified HCP (up to Visit 17) or without administratio n of IP for EOT Visit and Visits 19 and 20, provi ded thi s is acceptable within lo cal regulat ion/guidance. Addi tional informat ion related to the visit can be obtained remotely by phone call and/or vi deo conference. This is to ensure safet y of the study subj ects and minimum disruption to IP administration that may occur during the COVID -19 pandemic. Study assessments, where possible to be performed at home, should be conducted according to the SoA. At minimum, during ho me visit the qualified HCP is expected to: Collect informat ion on healt hcare resources utilization Perform a physical examinat ion Collect vital signs Collect adverse events Collect informat ion on asthma exacerbation Review concomitant medicat ions If possible, co llect blood and urine sample according to the SoA Conduct uri ne pregnancy test (dipstick), prior to IP administration, if applicable eDiary data revi ew/co mpletion Evaluat ion of OCS dose (done by Invest igator, can be done remotely after rele vant data is reviewed) Administer IP Observe the subject for one hour after IP administration for the signs or symptoms of any acute drug reactions Docum ent the visi t Please refer to the separate IP Home (or Alternat iveSite) Administration I nstructi ons for D5180C00009 Study Re: COVID -19 for more info rmation. K 2 Visits at an Alternate Location (where applicable) Study visit s including administration o f IP and study assessments according to the SoA can take place at an al ternat ive location away fro m infect ion risk zones, or cl oser to thesubject ’s hom e, provi ded thi s is acceptable within lo cal regulat ion/guidance.

Having a phone call and/or a video conference wit h the subject will allo w conduct of study procedures including reporting o f adverse events, concomitant medicat ion, informat ion on asthma contro l/exacerbat ion and healthcare resource utilizat ion as well as assessment and adjustm ent of OCS dose based on available sources of informat ion(see K 4)while minimiz ing the risk to subjects of COVID -19 exposure . K 4 OCS Titration During the COVID -19 Pandemic During the COVID- 19 pandemic, the Invest igator may make decisio ns on the OCS dose based on rem ote intervi ew of subject, eDi ary data and if applicable, home visit physical examinat ion and vital signs. If COVID -19 in any way interferes wi th OCS ti tration (e.g. suspected or confirmed COVID -19 infect ion or lack of sufficient informat ion due to COVID -19 pandemic) and/or titration decisio n is influenced by anyt hing else than described in CSP Section 8.1.1.2 , it needs to be specified in the eCRF/OCSDOSE form by including “COVID -19” phrase in the just ification for the decisio n. K 5 End of Treatment Visit / Transition to the Extension Study D5180C00018 If the EOT visit at Week 48 cannot be performed on -site, at an al ternate si te, or at the subject’s home, the EOT visit should be conducted as a remote visit. Subjects aimed to transit ion to the extensio n study D5180C00018 will cont inue participation in the safet y follow-up visit(s) (Week 54, Week 60) unt il the on-site(or al ternate si te) extensio n study randomizat ion and IP administration can be conducted. If on-site(or al ternate si te) randomisation / IP administrati on into the extensio n study D5180C00018 is not possible by the end of the study safet y follow-up (Week 60) , a subject will not transit ion to the extensio n study . These cases should be discussed wit h the AstraZeneca study physician. K 6 Re-consenting of Subjects During the COVID -19 Pandemic If a subject is unable to travel to the site due to the COVID -19 pandemic, it is necessary to obtain re-consent remotely and/or verbally for the implementation of th e new urgent changes in the study during the COVID -19 pandemic. This will minimize the risk to the subject of COVID -19 exposure with clinic visits. Applicable local guidelines and regulations on re -consent ing process shoul d be f ollowed."
