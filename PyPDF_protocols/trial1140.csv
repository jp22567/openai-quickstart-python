Early is defined as a maximum of less than 12 hours between onset of the cardiovascular organ -dysfunction and administration of ADRECIZUMAB. Refractoriness to fluid resuscitation is defined as a lack of response to the administration of 30 m L of fluid per kilogram of body weight or is determined according to a clinician’s assessment of inadequate hemodynamic results . It is intended to enroll 300 patients from surgical, medical and mixe d ICU at multiple centers in Europe. All patients will be treated according to “International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock”. Eligible patients (confirmed by central verification) will be randomized (1:1:2) to ADRECIZUMAB treatment arm A (2 mg/kg) or to ADRECIZUMAB treatment arm B (4 mg/kg) or to placebo as control group. Patients assigned to the treatment arm A or B will be adm inistered a single dose of ADRECIZUMAB as intravenous infusion over approximately 1 hour; patients assigned to the control group will be administered placebo as intravenous infusion over approximately 1 hour. As long as the patients are on the ICU, measurements of clinical signs and laboratory data will be collected for safety reasons and for determination of SOFA score. Additional blood samples for central laboratory analyses will be taken prior to start of IMP infusion (day 1) and 24 hours, 48 hou rs, 96 hours and 144 hours after end of infusion (+/ - 10 hours) or between scheduled assessments, if discharged earlier from the ICU ((whatever comes first) for measurement of biomarkers. The SOFA score and its components will be determined daily for all patients over the entire stay on the ICU ( 28 days or until discharge whatever comes first ) as long as an arterial line is in place . Safety monitoring for e ach patient will begin at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form and continue for 90 days after end of short -term infusion of study medication . At selected study centers a PK substudy will be performed to determine the profile of ADRECIZUMAB in 80 randomized patien ts."

Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP): Test Substance: ADRECIZUMAB ADRECIZUMAB (HAM8101) is a humanized IgG1 mono - clonal antibody (mAb). Dosage form: Solution for injection in 200 mg vials Strength: 10,4 m L HAM 8101 protein for an extractable volume of 10 mL Dose: 2 mg/kg single dose or 4 mg/kg single dose Route: i.v. infusion over approximately 1 hour Stored: 2 – 8 °C, protected from light (refrigerator) Reference Substance: Placebo Histidine -HCl and Glycine solution in water for injection . Route of administration corresponding to ADRECIZUMAB . Any study medication has to be diluted from the Drug Product Stock solution with sterile NaCl solution 0.9%. Study Endpoints Endpoint s for primary objective (safety and tolerability): • Mortality • Interruption of infusion • Severity and frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events Endpoints for s econdary objectives (efficacy and PK) : • Primary efficacy endpoint: Sepsis Support Index (SSI) defined as: days with organ support or dead within 14 days follow up . More preci sely: In the time frame of 14 day follow -up, each day on support with vasopressor, and/or mechanical ventilation (defined as any ventilation received on this day, independent from the duration of mechanical ventilation) , and/or renal dysfunction (defined as renal SOFA = 4), or not alive, is counted as 1. The sum over the follow -up period is defined as SSI. • Secondary efficacy endpoints: Sepsis Support Index (SSI) at day 28 follow -up - Penalized Sepsis Support Index (pSSI) at 14 and 28 day follow -up, defined similar to the SSI with the exception that patients that die get penalized by assigning the maximum value, i.e. the pSSI is set to 14 or 28 day respectively. - Persistent organ dysfunction or death at 14 and 28 day follow -up - Day 28 and day 90 mortality rate - SSI and pSSI excluding the renal component"

The DSMB will review and evaluate the safety data monthly during the course of the study and will recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or terminate the study based on the mortality rate. Steering Committee: The SC will provide oversight of the conduct of the study to ensure that the study is conducted to the rigorous standards set out in Good Clinical Practice. Statistical Methods: A total sample size of 300 patients is needed for the study and assuming that delta SSI is >10%, the power is > 80% to demonstrate an improvement of SSI of > 0 with at least 80% probability. The lower bound of the confidence interval will be determined based on the non -parametric Wilcoxon test. Power simulations are based on using real patient data on the combined endpoint from the ALBIOS study [2]. Simulations were extended to and results confirmed by data from the AdrenOSS observational study."

INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 3.1 Background Information 3.1.1 Septic Shock Sepsis is defined as life -threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in 2 total SOFA score points subsequent to the infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which underlying circulatory and cellular/metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality. Patients with septic shock can be identified with a clinical construct of sepsis with persisting hypotension requiring vasopresso rs to maintain MAP > 65 mm Hg and having a serum lactate level >2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) despite adequate volume resuscitation. With these criteria, hospital mortality is in excess of 40% [4, 22]. One important factor in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock seems to be Adrenomedullin (ADM), a circulating hormone and a local autocrine/ paracrine mediator. ADM is an autocrine and paracrine hormone where the local ADM concentration (i.e. in the immediate vicinity of endothelial and vascular muscle c ells) is assumed to be substantially higher than the plasma concentrations ; this applies for healthy conditions, but for sepsis as well. It is therefore assumed that the ADM plasma concentrations are an overspill of local concentrations. Therefore, the exact mechanism of action is difficult to explain based on the plasma concentrations . In several preclinical and clinical studies ADM was infused to healthy volunteers or CHF patients. The ADM infusion led to an arterial blood pressure decrease, increase of heart rate and cardiac index [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1 2, 18, 19, 24]. Ueda et al. reported that the plasma ADM concentrations in patients with septic shock were more than 10 -fold over normal [25]. Hirata et al have also shown that an increase of plasma ADM concentrations over time in septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients is associated with fatal outcome, whereas in septic patients who recovered from sepsis ADM concentrations decreased over time [6]. Nishio et al. investigated in a prospective clinical trial plasma concentrations of adrenomedullin in patients with septic s hock and the potential association of these concentrations with relaxation of vascular tone. The mean plasma concentration of adrenomedullin was markedly higher in patients than in controls (226.1 +/ - 66.4 [SEM] vs. 5.05 +/- 0.21 fmol/mL, p <.01). Moreover , these concentrations correlated significantly with cardiac index, stroke volume index, and heart rate values, and correlated significantly with decreases in diastolic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance index, and pulmonary vascular resistance index. They concluded, that the enhanced production of Adrenomedullin in patients with septic shock may contribute to reduced vascular tone, hypotension, or both [13]. ADM has also an effect on endothelial permeability via the phosphatidyl -Inositol -3-Kinas e/ Akt pathway. ADM reduces the endothelial permeabilty by reducing tyrosin -phosphorylation of VE - cadherin (Tyr 731) and enhances the binding of ß -catenin to the cytoplasmic tail of VE -cadherin which leads to enhanced vascular integrity."

Therefore, the non -clinical development program was based on the ICH S6(R1) guidance and in addition follows recommendat ions provided during a Scientific Advice Meeting with Paul Ehrlich Institute in November 2012. Mode of Action A possible mode of action for the anti -Adrenomedullin antibody Adrecizumab has been developed on the basis of published data, own experimental da ta and theoretical considerations. The model has been discussed with key opinion leaders in the field (Prof. Hippenstiel, Charité Berlin, Germany, and Prof. Ouafik, University Marseille, France). The mod el developed is described here: ADM is a relatively small peptide comprising 52 amino acids, which is synthesized mainly in endothelial and smooth muscle cells and is secreted from these cells. Several functions of ADM have been described, including vasodilatory activity and stabilization of endo thelial permeability. ADM acts in an autocrine/paracrine way but also as a hormone. Due to its small size, ADM is supposed to be able to freely diffuse between the blood circulation and the interstitium. The inner wall of blood vessels is composed of endot helial cells. Smooth muscle cells, on the contrary, have no direct contact to the blood circulation, as they are located distal at the basal site of the endothelial cell layer of arteries. Thus, it can be assumed that ADM located in the blood circulation c an act on endothelial cells to stabilize endothelial permeability, but from this compartment cannot directly exert its vasodilatory activity on smooth muscle cells. Rather, smooth muscle cells are accesible for ADM, when it is located in the interstitium. When the anti -Adrenomedullin antibody Adrecizumab is administered in the blood circulation at high concentrations by far exceeding those of plasma ADM, the compartmental distribution of ADM is altered. Adrecizumab, an IgG with a molecular weight of more t han 150 kDa, is too large to freely diffuse from the blood circulation to the interstitium. With its fast association kinetics Adrecizumab quickly binds to ADM in the blood circulation and „pulls“ ADM, which has been initially located in the interstitium, from this compartment to"
19,page_19,"Protocol No. ADR -02 EudraCT -No: 2016 -003883 -38 ____________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL Trial Protocol – Version 4.2, 28 -August 2019 Page 19 of 79 the blood circulation. The more Adrecizumab is applied, the stronger is the „pulling“ effect and the higher the resulting concentrations of Adrecizumab -bound ADM in the blood circulation. The increase of Adrecizumab -bound ADM in t he blood circulation occurs within 5 -15 minutes after administration of Adrecizumab, and no parallel increase of MR -proADM, another peptide derived from the same precursor as ADM, has been observed. Thus, it can be excluded that Adrecizumab leads to an imm ediate transcriptional activation of the ADM gene or release of a pool of ADM -precursor derived peptides from secretory vesicles, but that it rather induces a translocation of preformed ADM. As a consequence of this redistribution, the ADM concentration in the interstitium decreases, and less ADM is able to act on smooth muscle cells to exert its vasodilatory activity . In the progression to septic shock, when it comes to excessive vasodilation and hypotension, administration of Adrecizumab thus can reduce va sodilation by substracting excessive levels of interstitially located ADM. At the same time levels of Adrecizumab -bound ADM increase in the blood circulation, and it is assumed that this can be functionally relevant: Due to its epitope specificity for the N-terminal moiety of ADM, Adrecizumab is a special anti -Adrenomedullin antibody. While it is a high - affinity antibody, its binding to ADM does not completely block the function of ADM, but rather only partially reduces its capacity to elicit a second mess enger response. The net effect of an increase of Adrecizumab -bound ADM in the blood circulation on the one hand, and an only partial functional inhibition of ADM brought about by the binding of Adrecizumab on the other hand, is that more ADM activity is pr esent in the blood circulation after administration of Adrecizumab than without administration of Adrecizumab. The increased net activity in the blood circulation could promote stabilization of endothelial permeability. An additional effect of binding of Adrecizumab to ADM in the blood circulation could be an – at least partial and/or temporal – protection from otherwise occur ring proteolytic decay of ADM. Proteolytic degradation of ADM occurs at its N -terminus. It is exactly this site, where Adrecizumab b inds to ADM. 3.1.2. 1 Clinical Experience Prior to investigating ADRECIZUMAB in septic patients, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics/ -dynamics of single administrations of ADRECIZUMAB was evaluated in a Phase I study in healthy volunteers , consisting of two parts (Phase Ia and Phase Ib) . In the Phase Ia part h ealthy male subjects were randomized in a double -blind, placebo -controlled study with single escalating doses of ADRECIZUMAB administered as intravenous (i.v.) infusion in 3 sequential groups of 8 subjects each , 1st group 0,5 mg/kg, 2nd group 2 mg/kg, 3rd group 8 mg/kg (n=6 active, n = 2 placebo for each group). The main inclusion criteria were written informed consent, age 18 – 35 years, agreement to use a reliable way of contraception and a BMI between 18 and 30 kg/m². Subjects received a single i.v. dose of ADRECIZUMAB (0,5 mg/kg; 2 mg/kg; 8 mg/kg) or placebo by slow infusion over a 1-hour period in a research unit."

The apparent terminal elimination half -life is approximately 14 – 15 days. Due to the slow elimination the mean residence time was also long: ~ 17 days. The small volume of distribution also indicate s the weak distribution properties of ADRECIZUMAB . Thus, the administered dose is localized predominantly in the circulation and distributed and eliminated slowly. This phase 1 a study in healthy volunteers has been completed with the result that n o SAEs or SUSARs were observed, no clinically significant electrocardiogra phic abnormalities were observed , normal local tolerability and no obvious abnormalities, vital sig ns or clinical laboratory values. A Phase 1 b study was conducted to investigate the safety and tolerability of ADRECIZUMAB under inflammatory conditions in healthy volunteers. The experimental human endotoxemia model, in which healthy male volunteers receive a low dose of LPS derived from Escherichia coli, is widely used to study the effects of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo and is considered a safe and highly reproducible method to activate the innate immune system. After induction of the systemic inflammation the study design (ADRECIZUMAB doses and administration and study assessments) were the same as for the Phase Ia study. No clinical relevant AEs/SAEs were observed after administration of ADRECIZUMAB. After these phase I studies it is intended to start a phase II study in 300 patients with early septic shock . 3.2 Rationale for the Clinical Trial The importance and the potential clinical relevance of Adrenomedullin in sepsis has also been confirmed in several observational clinical studies with patients with sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. It could be demons trated in a pilot study that in patients who had a bio -ADM concentration < 70 pg/m L there was a significant lower mortality than those with a bio -ADM concentration > 70 pg/m L. Keep in mind that Adrenomedullin has to be amidated when biologically active (pl ease refer to more information to the investigator’s brochure). Interesting is the observation that those patients who had a higher bio -ADM concentration > 70 pg/m L and remained high over the next four days had a mortality of around 65%, but of those who had a significant decline of bio -ADM concentration over the next four days 100 % survived [14]. This observation was also confirmed by data from Marx et al. in septic patients on a surgical ICU. Patients with a bio -ADM concentration of 97.5 pg/m L had a sig nificant ly higher mortality rate than those with a bio -ADM concentration of 42.6 pg/m L. Patients who had a median bio-ADM concentrati on of around 40 pg/m L did not need any vasopressor support over the entire stay at ICU [21]. In a further observational study, similar observations were made in the FROG -ICU study: ICU patients with severe sepsis on admission (n=61) had a bio -ADM concentration of around 70 pg/mL compared to around 120 pg/m L in septic shock patients who received vasopressor/inotropics on the day of admission [16, 17]."
21,page_21,"Protocol No. ADR -02 EudraCT -No: 2016 -003883 -38 ____________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL Trial Protocol – Version 4.2, 28 -August 2019 Page 21 of 79 These data indicate that ADM plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis. ADRENOMED AG has developed an epitope –specific antibody for therapeutic use in patients with septic shock. Aim of a targeted therapy should be to maintain the beneficial effect of ADM, while counteracting an excess of ADM . Therefore, several mouse monoclonal anti -ADM antibodies were developed which inhibit the ADM function differently depending on their epitopes. While the anti -ADM antibody directed against C -terminal moiety of ADM led to a 100% inhibition of ADM activity, the anti -ADM antibody activity against the N -terminal moiety of ADM led to a inhibition of ADM function of approx. 35% - 50 % [23]. Only the antibody leading to a partial inhibition (directed against the N-terminal moiety of ADM) has shown the most benef it in preclinical septic models : Administration of this antibody largely improved survival in CLP mice [23], and in a resuscitated mouse CLP model led to an improvements of hemodynamics (reduced catecholamine demand to maintain MAP > 65 mmHg), increase of creatinine clearance, less positi ve fluid balance and reduced systemic inflammation [26]. Also, the CLP induced deterioration in kidney barrier function, expressed by extravascular albumin accumulation, was significantly reduced [15]. Therefore the antibody has been further developed to a humanized variant (ADRECIZUMAB). The main preclinical results obtained with ADRECIZUMAB can be summarized as follows: It was shown that the administration of ADRECIZUMAB in a two -hit pig model of systemic bacteremia led to an improvement of renal functi on, an attenuated inflammatory response and a significant reduction of vasopressor use in acute shock [20]. Delayed treatment of CLP rats improved mean arterial pressure [1]. Overall, these results illustrate that the administration of ADRECIZUMAB exerts b eneficial effects in sepsis models demonstrated by • reduced edema formation, • reduced fluid demand, • improved fluid balance • improved kidney function, • improved blood pressure and • reduced inflammation. ADRECIZUMAB was tested for safety extensively in mice, rats, dogs and in non -human primates. The NOAEL (none -observed adverse events level) in NHP was 100 mg/kg (max. tested) and the NOAEL in rats is 400 mg/kg (max. tested). 3.2.1 Study Design This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose-finding, multicenter randomized proof of concept phase II study using two doses of ADRECIZUMAB in patients with early septic shock and a bio -ADM plasma concentration at admission of > 70 pg/ml. “Early” septic shock is defined as a life -threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to a proven or suspected infection which leads to a decline of MAP < 65mm Hg which is refractory to fluid resuscitation and requires vasopressors. Early is defined as a maximum of < 12 hours between onset of the cardiovascular organ -dysfunction (start of vasopressor use) and administration of"

Refractoriness to fluid re suscitation is defined as a lack of response to the administration of 30 m L of fluid per kilogram of body weight or is determined according to a clinician’s assessment of inadequate hemodynamic results . In this phase II study 300 patients with early septi c shock and a plasma concentration of bio - ADM > 70 pg/m L from surgical , medical and mixed ICU at multiple centers in Europe will be randomized . This concept is based on the observation of the clinical observation study Adre nOSS-1, in which 201 ou t of 291 pa tients with septic shock and a bio -ADM concentration > 70 pg/m L had a 28 -day mortality rate of approximately 35% compared with 84 out of 291 patients with a bio -ADM concentration < 70 p g/mL who had a 28-day mortality rate of 23 %. All patients will be treated according to “International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock” [3]. 300 patients with early septic shock will be randomized into two treatment arms and one control group. After informed consent has be en signed by patient or legal ly designated representative and the result from plasma -ADM concentration (> 70 pg/ml) is available, i nclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked via a centralized procedure. After fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria patients will be assigned randomly ( randomization 1:1:2; four – block randomization per center) to the treatment arms (2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg) or to the placebo control group . Patients assigned to the treatment arms will be administered a s ingle dose of ADRECIZUMAB as i.v. infusion over approximately 1 hour; patients assigned to the control group will be administered placebo as i.v. infusion over approximately 1 hour . Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability of the therapy, b ut also for signs of clinical efficacy. As long as the patients are on the ICU, measurements of clinical signs and laboratory data will be collected for safety reasons and f or determination of SOFA score as long as arterial line is in place for determination of PaO2/FiO2 . Additional blood samples for determination of Adrenomedullin (prior to infusion) and the biomarker M R-proADM and inflammatory biomarkers PCT, IL -6 and penKid will be taken prior to star t of IMP infusion ( day 1 ) and within the time frame of 24 hours (+/ - 10 hours) after end of IMP infusion (day 2). Further blood sampling for biomarker assessment will follow at 48 hours, 96 hours and 144 hours after end of infusion (+/ - 10 hours) or betwee n scheduled assessments, if discharged earlier from ICU (whatever comes first) . Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 24 months. An interim analysis is planned after 50% of patients (n=150) have completed study after day 28 . 3.2.2 Dose Selection The rationale for the chosen doses of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg is based on model considerations: It was derived from in vitro studies (Adrenomedullin -induced cAMP response in CHO cells overexpressing hCRLR/RAMP3) that the local ADM concentration i s assumed to be substantially higher than what is found under normal conditions in plasma. This is also true for sepsis and septic shock situations – the local concentration of ADM is likely much higher than what is found in the plasma. It is therefore ass umed that the ADM plasma levels reflect an overspill of local concentrations. Since the aim is to provide with a single dose of"

These thoughts derived from model should be confirmed in this study. In a phase Ia/Ib study additional doses of ADRECIZUMAB (0.5 mg/ kg and up to 8 mg/kg) are tested for safety. No relevant AEs were observed in any of the groups in the Phase Ia study . The Phase Ib study was conducted and completed before start of the Phase II study. Nonclinical safety studies in various animal species have been conducted in order to cover the safety of the target dose. In summary, in all species no adverse events, even at the highest tested dose (in rodents up to 800 mg/kg) were detected. 3.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits and Risk Management Primary aim of this phase II study is to demonstrate safety and tolerability as well as efficacy of ADRECIZUMAB in patients with septic shock. The current phase II study is underpowered to detect a relevant reduction of 28 -day mortality by ADRECIZUMAB ; on the other hand, there is evidence from our animal models that ADRECIZUMAB can improve organ function. The improvement in organ function is measurable using days with relevant organ support (cardiac, renal, respiratory) while on ICU. Therefore, a composite endpoint of days with organ support AND all -cause of mortality will be used: the “Sepsis Support Index” (SSI). Further, it is intended to determine pharmacodynamics and p harmacokinetics of ADRECIZUMAB. ADRECIZUMAB is a humanized monoclonal antibody. Therefore, there is a general potential risk of an alle rgic reaction or allergic shock when administered to patients. To minimize this risk strict compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the conducted clinical trials is necessary. Furthermore, Adrecizumab should be given as an infusion over 1 h our to be able to stop the infusion in case of an allergic reaction AND patients should only be treated under the controlled environment of an ICU. In case of an allergic reaction or allergic shock in a study patient, the local standard treatment should be followed. During the first administration of ADRECIZUMAB to 36 male, healthy volunteers in the Phase Ia and phase Ib studies ADRECIZUMAB was very well tolerated and no serious adverse events, in particular no allergic reactions/allergic shock, and no cli nically relevant adverse events and no clinically relevant disturbances in the ECG were observed . Local tolerability was normal and there were no obvious deviations in the vital signs (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate) or in clinical laboratory v alues. The side effects of ADRECIZUMAB that occurred were equally distributed across all dosage groups, were only transient and required no medical treatment. The following adverse effects were observed: • Headache, 13 events; • Influenza -like symptoms/blocked nose, 27 events; • Back pain, 3 events ; • Shoulder pain, 4 events; • Nosebleeds, 2 events; • Inflammatory skin change (eczema), 2 events. The following s ide effects only occurred once: Skin infection (on the toe), skin rash at the infusion site, abdominal pain, blood loss in the rectum (once), dull pain/sensation in the thumb,"

ADRECIZUMAB has not been used before in septic patients. Therefore AEs could occur which are not predictable. The administration of ADRECIZUMAB in septic patients will occur after comprehensive preclinical studies have been conducted and after completion of the phase I a and phase Ib study in healthy volunteers with and without LPS challenge without observation of any relevant side effects. Therefore, the striking effect of ADRECIZUMAB in preclinical testing and excellent safety data from phase I a and phas e Ib study let expect a positive benefit/risk ratio for the treatment in patients with septic shock. Therefore it is considered to launch this phase II proof of concept study. Additional information can be found in the IB ."

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 5.1 Study Design This study is designed to evaluate the potential of ADR ECIZUMAB as targeted therapy in preselected patient using the biomarker ADM with regard to safety and tolerability, PK and efficacy. Therefore, it is intended to enroll patients with “early” septic shock (start of vasopressor therapy < 12 hours) and ADM level of > 70 pg/ml. For the purpose of this protocol a total of 300 patients from surgical , medical and mixed ICU will be randomize d at multiple centers in the European Union. For appropriate randomization the central Clinical Coordination Center (CCC) in Brussels will be used to confirm eligible patients prior to randomization to treatment arm A with ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg or to treatment arm B with ADRECIZUMAB 4 mg/kg or to the placebo control group in a 1:1:2 ra tio for a single dose in travenous infusion over 1 hour. As long as the patients are on the ICU, measurements of clinical signs and laboratory data will be collected for safety reasons and for determination of SOFA score as long as arterial line is in place for determination of PaO2/FiO2 . Additional blood samples for determination of ADRECIZUMAB , inflammatory biomarker and cardiac biomarkers will be taken prior to start of IMP infusion (day 1) and within the time frame of 24 hours (+/ - 10 hours) after end of IMP infusion (day 2). Further timepoints for blood sampling will follow as specified in Figure 2 at 48 hours, 96 hours and 144 hours after end of infusion (+/ - 10 hours) or between scheduled assessments, if discharge d earlier from ICU (whatever comes first) . The SOFA score and its components will be determined daily for all patients over the entire stay on the ICU until day 28 or discharge (whatever comes first ). Safety monitoring for e ach patient will begin at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form and continue for 90 days after end of short -term infusion of study medication . At selected study centers a PK substudy will be performed to determine the profile of ADRECIZUMAB in 80 randomized patients. Patient accrual is expected to be completed within 24 months . An interim analysis is planned after 50% of patients (n=150) have completed study day 28 . 5.2 Study Population 5.2.1 Selection of Study Population In this phase II study up to 300 adult male and female patients with “early” septic shock and a bio-ADM concentration at inclusion of > 70 pg/m L will participate. To qualify for randomization and treatment with the study medication, patients must meet all inclusion criter ia and none of the exclusion criteria at inclusion . Eligibility will be re-checked"

Unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for all follow -up visits 5.3 Patient Numbering Inclusion - and exclusion criteria from patients admitted to the ICU will be verified by the investigator to identify potential patients to be enrolled into the study. After availability of written informed consent by patient or leg ally designated representative (or other accepted procedure according to local requirements in case patient is unable to sign informed consent personally due to the emergency nature) patient will be assigned a unique 6- digit patient identification number in asc ending order at inclusion which will include country (1 digit) , site number (2 digits), patient number (3 digits). For example 1 -01-001, 1 -02-001, 2 -01- 001, 2 -02-001 etc. This patient identification number will be maintained throughout the stu dy without an y reassignment . The eligibility of each patient, based on assessment of all inclusion - and exclusion criteria including the bio-ADM concentration of > 70 pg/mL, must be confirmed by the central CCC prior to randomization to one of the two treatment arms o r to the placebo control group. An overview of the randomization procedure is provided in section 6.5. 5.4 Screen Failure Patients Patients who sign the informed consent form but fail to meet one or more of the eligibility criteria, or who decline study participation before receiving IMP, will be defined as screen failures. For those patients the investigator will be asked to contact the patient on day 14 for calculation of the SSI during stay at ICU (screening to day 14) as well as on follow -up day 28 and day 90 for recording and evaluation of survival / mortality. For assessment of the SSI (screening to day 14) and for recording and evaluation of survival / mortality data the investigator should seek to obtain the patient’s consent . 5.5 Discontinu ation of Individual Subjects Participation in this clinical study is strictly voluntary and any subject may withdraw from the study at any time without providing an explanation. This will not affect his/her right for future medical care. In the event that a patient withdraws from the study , the investigator must be informed immediately. The date, circumstances and any reason provided will be documented on the withdrawal page of the eCRF. If the patient already received the investigational treatment prior to withdrawal of consent, he /she will be asked to perform the assessments for day 28 or day of discharge and to complete the quality of life questionnair e on day 28 . For the completion of the paper telephone Euro -QoL-5 Quality of Life Short Form, the patient will be called from the investigator’s site on day 90 of the follow -up period. No data obtained after withdrawal of consent will be recorded on eCRFs - with the exception of any case of death until 90 days for safety reasons - and will not be evaluated as part of the clinical study . For recording and evaluation of survival / mortality data the investigator should seek to obtain the patient`s consent."

Possible reasons include: • Serious adverse event (SAE) considered to be related to treatment with the study medication • Any si tuation in which, in the investigator's opinion, a continuation of the treatment with the study medication would be harmful to the patient 's safety and well -being. Time, circumstances and reason/s for stopping treatment will be documented in the eCRF. The sponsor must be informed within 24 hours about any treatment discontinuation of a patient including the reason . Patients whose treatment is stopped stay in the study unless they withdraw consent. After the treatment is stopped, patient s are followed according to the plan for the follow -up visit s. Patients may be withdrawn from treatment or from the study by the investigator or the sponsor in case of a major protocol deviation considered being relevant by the investigator and/or the sponsor (e.g. deviation of selection criteria) or if new information arise making the continued study participation of a patient unadvisable. Patient s withdrawn from the study will be informed about the reasons for withdrawal. 5.6 Stopping of Clinical Trial All safety signals including suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) and SAEs will be reviewed on a continuous basis by the Data and Safety Monito ring Board (DSMB) (see section 12.5). The stopping rules defined below apply to any treatment -related AE and clinical laboratory assessments. However for clinical laboratory assessments, the rules apply only if deviations of laboratory parameters relate to the same organ system, indicating c linical significance. A single deviation of a laboratory value without any clinical symptoms will not be considered clinically significant. The stopping rules are stipulated as follows: • Following investigation of AEs the DSMB may recommend stopping the study if continuation may pose a substantial risk to subjects . • The DSMB may recommend stopping the study if previously unknown data become available and raise concern about the safety of th e study drug , so that continuation would pose a potential risk to the patient s. The sponsor may terminate the study for other important reasons at his discretion. Such reasons may be external information that impact the risk -benefit assessment for patient s or technical or operational reasons such as unexpectedly slow recruitment that may put the scientific value of the study at risk. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the investigator will promptly inform the patient and assure appr opriate therapy and follow -up. Furthermore, the study can be terminated at any time if the authorization and approval to conduct the study is withdrawn by ethics committee , by regulatory authority decision, insufficient accrual, emergency , new data impact ing the scientific value of the study on ethical grounds."

Any changes in concomitant medication must be recorded from screening until day 28 or discharge from ICU, (whatever comes first ) as well as on follow -up day 28 if patient was discharged from ICU before day 28 . Recording of treatment for ongoing AEs or SAEs will be continued after day 28 until resolution or until end of study for new AEs or SAEs occurred during the follow -up period. 5.8 Cornerstone Medication - Permitted Concomitant Medication The main therapy administered according to the international guidelines for treatment of patients with septic shock (Surviving Sepsis Campaign), e.g. enteral / parenteral nutrition, antimicrobiotic therapy (drug, dose, duration ), insulin, blood transfusion should be documented on a daily basis from screening to day 28 or discharge from ICU (whatever comes first ) as well as on follow -up day 28 if patient was discharged from ICU before day 28 . 5.9 Vasopressor Therapy Vasopressors are provided for patients with septic shock who do not respond to fluid resuscitation. Use of vasopressors (dopamine, dobutamine, phenylephrine) in combination with catecholamine (adrenaline, noradrenaline *) will be recorded from admission to ICU at time point of diagnosis of septic shock and daily ther eafter from day 1 through day 28 or discharge from IC U (whatever comes first ) (drug name, highest / lowest dose, starting time and duration of use of vasopressor therapy ). * used equivalent to epinephrine and norepinephrine 5.10 Lost to Follow -up For patient s whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for the follow -up visit on day 28 and fail to have the phone call on day 90 without stating an intention to withdraw, the investigator should show ""due diligence"" by contacting the subject , family or family physician as agreed in the informed consent and by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the patient, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letter s, etc. A subject should not be considered lost to follow -up until his/her scheduled phone call on day 90 would have occurred."

INVESTIGATONAL TREATMENTS 6.1 Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) ADRECIZUMAB (HAM8101) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the N -terminus of adrenomedulling (ADM) and intended for the treatment of sever sepsis and septic shock. The antibody was generated by complementarity determining region (CDR) grafting a murine IgG2a mAB, which wa s obtained by immunizing female Balb/c mice with the ADM 1 -10 peptide (H -YRQSMNQGSC -OH) using a peptide -BSA (bov ine serum albumin) – conjugate. The epitope of ADRECIZUMAB on ADM comprises the first 5 amino acids in the N -terminal region of the peptide hor mone, and binding requires the N -terminal tyrosine residue of ADM to be free. This epitope is identical among many mammalian species including mouse, rat, dog, pig and cynomolgus monkey. The binding of ADM to its receptor is achieved via the C - terminus, wh ich is identical across all species tested [27]. The quality control standards and requirements for each study medication are described in separate release protocols/certifi cates of analysis. ADRENOMED AG will supply ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg and placebo for intravenous infusion to the investigator as a sterile solution for infusion. Each vial will contain 200 mg ADRECIZUMAB. Excipients contained in ADRECIZUMAB are listed below. The solution will be diluted with NaC l 0,9% up to 50 mL to reach an osmotic strength of < 300 mOsmol/L. The volume has to be adjusted to the infusion volume of 0,5 mL/kg plus the dead volume that will remain in the line for infusio n.

Any temperature deviation (temperature below +2°C and /or above +8°C ) must be reported to the Sponsor for an evaluation if the IMP can be used or not . In case the IMP kit is stored in the local pharmacy one kit of IMP will be ordered according to the processes being in place at the hospital for transportation of the IMP to the ICU under ambient conditions once a patient has b een app roved for randomization. The vials will be warmed up to room temperature no longer than 1 hour prior to their use and product is diluted with sterile 0.9% sodium chloride for infusion. IMP administration has to be started within a maximum of 2 hours after its preparation. In case of interruption of IMP administration (e.g. technical issues), it is allowed to restart the IMP administration as long as the infusion can be completed with in 6 hours after IMP preparation. Cave: This patient is not eligible any longer for the PK substudy. No further PK samples should be collected. Treatment will consist of a body weight adjusted dose of ADRECIZ UMAB up to 100 kg body weight or an equivalent amount of placebo. Patients with a body weight of > 100 – 120 kg will get the highest dose of the assigned treatment arm. This is reasonable because the ADRECIZUMAB dose is administered in excess over Adrenomedulli n plasma concentrations and sufficient to still elicit increased Adrenomedullin concentration (>25 pg/ml) until seven days after application. Therefore differences will not be expected between different weight groups. All patients will receive an intraven ous infusion using an infusion pump over approximately 1 hour by medically trained personnel who are part of the study team. ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg and placebo will be administered under complete ly blinded conditions. Study medication will be provided in boxes according to the 4 –block -randomization list. Each box contains: • 1 vial ADREZICUMAB + 1 vial placebo • 2 vials ADREZICUMAB • 2 vials placebo • 2 vials placebo If the patient is assigned to one of the two treatment arms or to the placebo group the body weight adjusted dose of study medication is calculated according to the following formula: Infusion volume =20 mL – ( (100 kg – actual BW ) x 20) added up to 50 m L with 0.9% NaC l 100 For dose calculation, please refer to Appendix 4. The solution for infusion must be visually inspected prior to use. Only clear, colorless solutions without particles must be used. Should IMP kit fail to meet these criteria the corresponding IMP kit has to be separated and the sponsor h as to be contacted immediately."

Standard laboratory care should be used during handling and preparation of IMP kits , i.e. use of gloves and other protective c lothing to preve nt skin contact is recommended. 6.4 Accountability In agreement with the sponsor, the PI will designate a responsible person for receipt, storage and prepa ration of the study medication. Regular study drug reconciliation will be performe d throughout the study to document drug assigned, drug administered , and d rug remaining, or d rug inadvertently damaged. This reconciliation will be documented on the IMP Inventory Log. All study medication supplies and associated documentation will be reviewed and verified by the monitor at regular intervals. Any discrep ancies noted wil l be investig ated, resolved and documented prior to return for destruction of unused study drug. Used IMP vials will be kept at the center for monitoring/ reconciliation before they are discarded according to local requirements . Upon instruction by the sponsor unused IMP kits will be returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction. 6.5 Treatment Assignment 6.5.1 Randomization Procedures In order to ensure the appropriate number of patients to be enrolled on identifying a potential study patient the investigator is required to complete a site authorization worksheet for confirming patient eligibility by the central Clinical Coordination Ce nter (CCC). When appropriate investigator will receive confi rmation for randomization of patient from the CCC by providing a authorization number . Patient will then be randomly allocated to treatment arm A, to treatment arm B or to the placebo control gr oup in a 1:1:2 ran domization ratio (ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg, ADR ECIZUMAB 4 mg/kg and Placebo). Patient is not allowed to be enrolled until this confirmation has been received. The randomizat ion code list will be generated within the Biometrics Department of the designated CRO by an independent statisti cian not involved in the study. 6.5.2 Maintenance of the Randomization Code This study will be performed in a double -blind fash ion. The Investigator and site staff, patients, monitors, Sponsor an d CRO staff will remain bl inded to the treatment assignment until study closure. The investigational drug and its matching placebo are indistinguishable and all study drug kits will be packed in the same way. The randomization list is kept strictly confid ential. It is accessible only to authorized persons who are not involved in the conduct and analysis of the s tudy, until time of unblinding. Sets of sealed e nvelopes with the randomization codes will be prepared containing information about treatment and the dose the patient had received (dose of ADRECIZUMA B or placebo) for each patient:"

The blind ing should be broken only if specific emergency treatment would be indicated by knowing the treatment status of the patient. Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code must record the time, date and reason as well as his/her initials in the sourc e documents. Unblinding will result in discontinuation of the patient from the study. Unblind ing will be performed via the emergency envelopes. In such cases the sponsor must be contacted prior to breaking the code unless an emergency dictates otherwise. In all cases, the investigator is required to notify the sponsor within 24 hours following the code break reporting the reason for the un blinding. Unblinding will be performed at spm² for reportin g of SUSARs as required by CAs. All codes (whether broken or not) must be kept throughout the study period in the Investigator Site File. Accountability of all broken or unbroken codes will be performed at every monitoring visit until study closure and will be collected at the last monitoring visit by the monito r and forwarded to the sponsor if not otherwise instructed by sponsor . 6.5.4 Routine Unblinding After completion of the study, locking of the clinical database, and performance of a blinded data review, a routine unblinding wil l be authorized by the Spon sor."

Vital signs must be assessed as min/max values within 24 hours except at screening and on the follow -up visit day 28 . 8.5 Glasgow Coma Scale GCS will be used for daily assessment of impairment of conscious level in response to define stimuli after confirmation of eligibility on day 1 shortly before IMP administration . Lowest (worst) value of GCS will be recorded daily from day 2 to day 28 or discharge . Obse rvations on patient’s current conditions regar ding opening eyes, verbal communication and motoric reactions will be assessed. In the calculation of the score, the worst value for each paramenter in the 24 hours period will be used. When pati ent is stable, the estimation would be based on clinical experience. In sedated patients, the Glasgow Coma Score Scale at the time of the intubation will be used to evaluate the neurological status. When sedation is removed, the GCS is recorded to actual v alues. In the rare event that the patient experiences a stroke or bleeding after the initial intubation the GCS estimation of 3 – 4 will be used. 8.6 Fluid Balance Daily fluid intake will be calculated as the sum of all intravenous and oral fluids. The daily fluid output will be calculated as the sum of the volume of urine output, ultrafiltration fluid, drain fluid, and estimated gastrointestinal losses (including st ools only in the presence of profound diarrhea). Insensitive losses will not be taken into account because they are difficult to assess reliably. Daily fluid balance (according to baseline patient weight) will be calculated by subtracting the total fluid o utput f rom the total intake. Day 1 is defined with start of IMP infusion (whatever time it is) unil the next ICU day change at the individual hospital. Depending on IMP administration time day 1 can last more or less than 24 hours. 8.7 12-lead ECG A stan dard 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at screening in supine or semi -supine position , if not already done at any time after diagnosis of septic shock . The ECG device will compute overall rhythm analysis, heart rate, P wave, PQ interval, QRS duration, QT and QTc intervals. The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Bazett’s and Fridericia´s formula (QTcB and QTcF). Each original ECG recording will be evaluated by the investigator following automated measurement, and the interp retation of the results will follow the categories ‘normal’, ‘abnormal, not clinically significant’, or ‘abnormal, clinically significant’. ECG results will only be defined as an AE, if they are evaluated as ‘abnormal, clinically significant’. The investig ator will e valuat e and assesst the print out with initials and date . The tracing must then be stored with the patient 's source documents. ECG recording will be printed as an original rhythm strip with at least 5 evaluable ECG complexes ( cardiac cycles) for each lead. To avoid any variability caused by relocation, self - adhesive electrodes should be used for ECG recording ."

In order to verify the patient’s eligibility for the study during screening , lab values can be used wh ich have already been analysed for clinical routine (e.g. routine blood test at ICU) and not for study purposes specifically. However, only documentation from lab analyses should be considered , which is closest to the timepoint of IMP ad ministration . A center specific table of the reference ranges for eac h of the laboratory parameter measured with a description of the methods will be available in the Investigator’s Site File and sent to the sponsor before the study starts. Changes in reference ranges or in the methodology during the course of the study are to be communicated to the sponsor by the investigator. Laboratory values outside the reference ranges require a written comment by the investigator regarding their clinical significance throughout the clinical study. Evaluation and assessment by the inve stigator will be documented by dated signature or initials. Any lab abnormality assessed as “CS” must be recorded as an AE if not explained by a coexisting condition (documented in the medical history or reported AE during the study). If clinically releva nt abnormal values are obtained at any time during the course of the study additional blood samples for laboratory tests should be taken at the respective clinical unit . 8.8.1 Day 2 through day 7 or discharge (whatever comes first) Daily blood collection (taken at the morning routine) for assessment of safety laboratory markers (hematology – blood sample up to 2 mL blood , biochemistry – blood sample approximately 2,5 mL) will be performed . The fo llowing parameters will be assessed: BUN (calculated) or urea, sodium, potassium (at screening only), creatinine, total bilirubin, platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, blood lactate concentration, whith blood count , differential blood count (at screenin g only) . Blood Gas Analysis (BGA): PaO2/FiO2, arterial p H: Arterial blood collection (0,1 mL) will be performed for measurement /calculat ion of PaO2 /FiO2 and arterial p H. Recordings are to be performed prior to IMP administration (day 1) , minimal value as well as maxim al value and each day thereafter (until ICU discharge) or removal of arterial line . 8.8.2 Day 8 through Day 27 or discharge (whatever comes first): The following parameters will be measured daily: PaO2/FiO2 (if arterial line in place) , arterial pH and creatinine. Total bilirubin, platelet count and blood lactate con centrati on will be measured e very other day."

Female patients who are not of childbearing potential due to being postmenopausal (2 years without menstruation) or surgically sterilised (oophorectomy, hysterectomy and/or tubal ligation) do not need a pregnancy test. Pregnancy test will be performed before randomization and on day 28 (for patients still on ICU) or on day 28 follow -up (for patients discharged from ICU). Inquiry regarding a potential pregnancy will be made by the investigator at Day 90 (no test to be performed). 8.9 Blood Sampling for bio -ADM and Biomarker 8.9.1 Blood Sampling for measurement of bio -ADM ( screening ) For measurement of bio -ADM concentation a 5 mL EDTA plasma sample will be collected (derived from EDTA blood) . For measurement of bioactive Adrenomedullin in human EDTA - plasma the sphingotest® bio -ADMCDx, a immuno luminometric assay (ILMA) will be used. ADM measurement should be performed before randomization. Any ADM measurement performed after randomization will immediately excl ude the patient from the study. Bio-ADM is stable for up to 24 hours in EDTA blood and plasma at room temperature . The sample will be centrifuged, marked with the patient identification number and the sphingotest® assay performed according to the sphingotest® bio -ADMCDx instruction manual. The remaining plasma will be stored at -20 ºC or below at the site until shipment to the central laboratory (Sphingotec GmbH in Hennigsdorf, Germany ) for re -evaluation of the bio -ADM concentration . 8.9.2 Blood Sampling for Biomarker for central laboratory Blood samples for determination of the biomarkers MR-pro-ADM, inflammatory biomarkers PCT, IL -6 and penK id will be taken prior to start of IMP infusion (day 1) and within the time frame of 24 hours +/ - 10 hours after end of IMP infusion (day 2). Further timepoints for blood sampling for determination of the biomarkers will follow as specified in Figure 2. All remainings of the blood samples are stored for future analysis of additional exploratory biomarkers suitable for the safety and efficacy evaluation of the study. E xcluded are any genetic analys es. EDTA blood , 2 sample s of 7 m L content (resulting in approximately half the volume of plasma) are collected at each time point. The samples will be centrifuged within 3 hours of blood collection, marked with the patient identification number and stored at -20 ºC or below (please refer to laboratory manual).

Shipments from the site to the central laboratory should be done according to sponsor request , by secure transportation company that will provide boxes and dry ice . 8.10 Organ Dysfunction Characterized by SOFA Score It is intended to calculate the SOFA score on each day the patient remains in the ICU from day 1 (shortly before IMP administration ) and daily from day 2 through day 28 or discharge (whatever comes first) as an expression for organ dysfunction. Therefore, kidney function , Glasgow Coma S core, invasive/non -invasive mechanical ventilation and blood gas , liver function and coagulation system and vasopressor use will be documented daily . The data entered for day 1 must all be pre -treatment in order to calculate the baseline score. Data to be recorded for day 2 to day 28 are always the worst values within 24 hours. Therefore minimum and maximum daily values are collected for vasopressor dose and the laboratory par ameters PaO2/FiO2, creatinine, total bilirubin and platelet count . 8.11 Pharmacokinetic Analysis - Substudy Pharma cokinetic (PK) samples from 80 patients will be collected at designated sites participating in the PK substudy. Plasma samples for PK analysis from 80 patients receiving either ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg body weight ( treatment arm A) or ADRECIZUMAB 4 mg/kg body weight ( treatment arm B) or placebo (control group ) will be drawn at time points provided in Figure 2 for determination of plasma concentration of free ADR ECIZUMAB. Blood samples (2 mL EDTA blood at each time point ) will be obtained prior to IMP dosing and after 30 minutes as well as 24 hours 48 hours, 96 hours, 144 hours and 648 hours after end of infusion (during stay in ICU or on day 28 follow -up, if patient is discharged from ICU prior to day 28) . The a llowed time windows for the respective time poin ts are given in Figure 2.. Blood (approximately 2 ml) will be collected in EDTA plasma tubes. The samples will be centrifuged . Separated plasma will be split into two aliquots of at least 0,5 mL and transferred into two tubes labelled with the patient identification number to ensure blinding of the analyt ical data. The samples will be frozen and stored at -20 °C or below within 2 hours. One aliquot will be stored as back -up sample at the center up to finalization of laboratory measurements or will be shipped to the laboratory accor ding to the sponsor’s decision.

All other femal e patients are considered to be of childbearing potential. Women of childbearing poten tial and sexually active men must use highly effective contraception after randomization and until 6 months after the end of intravenous infusion . The following contraception methods are considered highly effective: • Hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) co ntraception (oral, intravaginal, trans -dermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation • Progesterone -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation • Intrauterine deviced (IUD) or intrauterine hormone relea sing systems (IUS) • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomy Women who become pregnant while participating in the clinical study must discontinue immediately. The pregnancy must be reported following procedures detailed in Section 9.3.1 . Also any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant must be reported and followed -up for its outcome . Patients should be informed that taking ADRECIZUMAB may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study . In order to participate in the clinical study they must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) for th e duration of the study up to 6 months after the end of intravenous infusion of IMP. If there is any doubt whether a patient will reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that patient should not be entered into the study . 8.12.2 Pregnancy The site will contact the patient at least monthly and document the patient’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the safety department of the sponsor without delay and within 24 h ours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g. death, abortion, congential anomaly, or other diabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the sponsor (see Section 9.4). 8.12.3 Breatfeeding Women It is unknown whether ADRECIZUMAB is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursi ng infant, patients who are breast -feeding are not eligible for randomization."

PHARMACOVIGILANCE 9.1 Definitions 9.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a product and which does not necessarily have a causal relation -ship with this treatment. Examples of AEs include one of the following or a combination of two or more of these factors: • Any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, illness, or syndrome • Abnormal laboratory values, if judged clinically significant in the opinion of the investigator • Worsening (change in nature, severity or freq uency) of a concomitant or pre -existing illness • An adverse event of the IMP including comparator or concomitant medication • Drug interactions • An adverse event of an invasive procedure required by the protocol • An accident or injury Any new data that may lea d to: • A re-evaluation of the benefit and risk ratio of the research or product being researched • Changes in the use of this product, in the research throughout study conduct, or research related to materials, or • Suspension or disc ontinuation or modification of the research protocol or similar research (even if the new data occurred in another country). For trials involving the first administration or use of a health product in persons with no conditions : any serious adverse reactions. All AEs fall into one of two categories: “non -serious” and “serious” (see Section 9.1.2). Pre-existing illness or symptoms of the sepsis should only be recorded as AEs if they worsen during the course of the treatment, i.e. either change by one degree of the CTCAE grading from baseline, or significant clinical change in severity (for CTCAE grading, please refer to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, June 14, 2010). Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interv entions themselves are not AEs, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. Planned surgical measures and the condition(s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was ( were) known before the period of observation and did not worsen during the trial. In the latter case the condition should be reported as medical history. 9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose (includ ing overdose): • Results in death"
51,page_51,"Protocol No. ADR -02 EudraCT -No: 2016 -003883 -38 ____________________________________________________________________________ CONFIDENTIAL Trial Protocol – Version 4.2, 28 -August 2019 Page 51 of 79 • Is life -threatening “Life -threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the SAE; it does not refer to an SAE that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. • Requires s ubject hospitalization or prolongati on of existing hospitalization. This means that hospital patient admission or prolongation of hospital stay was required for the treatment of the AE, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. Visits to a hospi tal by ambulance or to the emergency room without admission will not be regarded as hospitalization unless the event fulfils any other of the seriousness criteria . • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means a permanent or significant and substantial disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions. • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred. Important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an eme rgency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A diagnosis of cancer/malignant tumor during the course of a treatment should always be considered as medically important. Clarification of the difference in meaning between “severe” and “serious”: The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning. Seriou sness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. Other events to be reported on the SAE report form: • Misuse and overdose: Drug misuse and drug overdose should be reported in the same format and within the same timelines as an SAE, even if they may not result in an adverse outcome. If no SAE is associated, the case will be regarded as non -serious. An overdose is defined as any dose higher than the assigned treatment dose (i.e. if a patient assigned to a dose > 8 mg/kg body weight , this would qualify as “overdose”). • Exposure to drug during pregnancy or lactation: In the unlikely event of a pregnancy occurring during the course of this particular study , the patient should be withdrawn from study , but closely followed up during the entire course of the pregnancy and postpartum period. All recommendations described in the investigational drug brochure during pregnancy and lactation have to be carefully considered. The sponsor m ust be notified without delay. Parental and neonatal outcomes must be recorded even if they are completely norm al and without Adverse Events. Offspring should be followed up for at least 8 weeks after delivery."

Other emergencies will be treated symptom atically according to standard medical practice. 9.1.4 Investigational Product Complaints Pharmaceutical technical complaints associated with the investigational product mus t be reported to the sponsor immediately : ADRENOMED AG Neuendorfstr. 15a 16761 Hennigsdorf Germany The same reporting timelines as for serious adv erse events apply. 9.2 Period of Observation For the purpose of this study , the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from screening until 90 days after end of IMP administration. If the investigator detects an AE in a study patient after the end of the period of observation, and considers the event possibly related to prior study treatment or procedures, he or she should contact the sponsor to determine how the AE should be documented and reported. All AEs that occur in the course of a clinical study regardless of the causal relationship must be monitored and followed up until t he outcome is known (see also section 9.3.4 and 9.4) . There must be documented reasonable attempts to get this information. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up procedures are performed. 9.3 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events 9.3.1 Documentation and Reporting of Adverse Events by Investigator The investigator must document all AEs that occur during the observation period set in this protocol in the eCRF . Additional instructions may be provided in the Investigator Site File and in the eCRFs itself. The following approach will be taken for docum entation: All AEs (whether serious or non -serious,) must be documented on the “adverse event” page of the eCRF."

This form must be sent immediately, i.e. within 24 hours from the awareness of the SAE to the safety contact of the sponsor (spm² - safety projects & more GmbH). The investigator will document the da te when any study team member had first been aware of the report and fax all SAE reports (initial and follow -up reports) even if they are incomplete within one working day upon receipt to the safety department of the sponsor: spm² - safety projects & more GmbH Aurum 05 Goldbeckstr. 5 69493 Hirschberg a. d.

It should be clearly stated that no AE was observed. In this case, there is no need to c omplete the “adverse event” page in the eCRF. The event will not be considered as serious. Every attempt should be made to describe all AEs in terms of a diagnosis. If a clear diagnosis has been made, individual signs and symptoms should not be recorded u nless they represent atypical or extreme manifestations of the diagnosis, in which case they should be reported as separate events. If a clear diagnosis cannot be established, each sign and symptom must be recorded individually. The initial report should be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness and (serious) AE, the reason why the event was considered serious, date of onset and stop date (if applicable), diagnostic procedures and treatment of the event, relevant medical history and concomitant medication and action taken with trial medication. 9.3.2 Assessment of Severity The investigator will also provide an assessment of the severity of the event and causal relationship between the event and the investigational product or tri al procedures. The basis of assessing severity and causality is described as: • Grade 1 - mild event: Causing no limitations of usual activities; the subject may experience slight discomfort • Grade 2 - moderate event: Causing some limitation of usual activities; the subject may experience annoying discomfort • Grade 3 - severe event: Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the subject may experience intolerable discomfort or pain • Grade 4 - life-threatening or disabling event"

The investigator will apply th e terms “certain”, “probable/likely”, “possible”, “unlikely” or “unrelated” to determine causality. For regulatory E2B reporting, this assessment will be converted to the binary system of “reasonable possibility” and “no reasonable possibility” (see table below).

Any updates or substantial amendments will be considered accordingly. The Reference Safety Information for the investigational medicinal product will be the chapter “Reference Safety Information” of the current IB version for ADRECIZUMAB . Unexpected: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Reference Safety Infor mation or is not listed with the specificity or severity that has been observed. Unexpected, as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Reference Safety Information as occurring with a class of d rugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 9.3.6 Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events / SUSAR Reporting All AEs and SAEs will be classified according to severity and causality .The sponsor will report all those serious and unexpected AEs, which are judged by either the investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal relationship i.e. SUSAR, to the Competent Author ity, the concerned EC and the investigators according to applicable law without any delay . Unblinding: If applicable treatment codes will be broken prior to submission to authorities and concerned IRB/IECs, by the sponsor’s safety group, which is an indep endent entity within the sponsor. The study team will be kept blinded regarding treatment assignment. Development Safety Update Reports: The sponsor will prepare and submit development safety update reports to the Competent Authority and concerned EC. 9.4 Follow -up of Adverse Events All AEs will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation has been reached. Depending on the event, follow -up may require additional tests or medical procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist. The Investigator is expected to record any case of unexpected pregnancy throughout the treatment and follow -up periods until 90 days after the end of treatment.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS A full statistical analysis plan will be drawn up before the trial database is locked and analyzed. Prior to performing any statistical tests or fitting statistical models, an exploratory analysis of the baseline variables and outcome measures will be completed. The level and pattern of missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will analyzed and likely causes of any missing values will be investigated. 10.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics Demographic characteristics will be listed and summarized. 10.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Parameters All safety and tolerability assessment will be based on the safety analysis set, which is defined as all patients who have received study medication. 10.3 Handling of Withdr awals, Protocol Deviations and Missing Values Data from subjects who prematurely terminate the study will be used to the maximum extent possible. Missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint will be dealt with using sensitivity analysis. Details will be outlined in the statistical analysis plan. All protocol deviations will be listed. The deviations will be assessed as critical, major or minor with regard to their influence prior to locking the database. The reasons for exclusion of patients from any of the analysis sets will be listed and, where relevant, the data from these patients will be described separately. 10.4 Safety Analysis Safety monitoring will begin at the time the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and will continue for 90 days after short -term infusion of study medication . All AEs will be listed. The number and percent of patients experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by treatment arm / control group, relationship to study drug and severity/grade. SAE specific list ings for each patient population will be gen erated on reported SAEs, but not as SUSARs . Endpoints relevant for the primary objective of safety and tolerability are • Mortality • Interruption of infusion • Treatmant -emergent adverse events • Severity and frequ ency of adverse events Demographic and medical background data, secondary endpoints and safety variables are to be analyzed by means of descriptive and exploratory methods."

Categorical variables are to be summarized using number and percentage by category. Medical terms and adverse events are to be coded using the MedDRA Version 19.1 and summarized according to sy stem organ class and preferred term . Concomitant medica tions are to be coded using the WHO -Drug Dictionary and summarized to the therapeutical ly chemical (ATC) terminology. 10.5 Efficacy Analysis The p rimary analysis for efficacy will be based on combining both ADRECIZUMAB doses and comparing the treated group s versus the placebo group. A second -line analysis will compare the two dos es for differences in efficacy. For the primary efficacy endpoints, a fi rst analysis will determine whether the improvement due to treatment is > 0 with at least 80% probability , i.e. the lower bound of a 60% confidence interval must be larger than 0. Only if this is achieved, the classical p -value using the described methods will be calculated. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be done as intention -to-treat, i.e. patients will be analy zed with respect to the group they were randomized to. A per protocol analysis will be performed, excluding patients t hat did not receive the treatment according to protocol or that did not meet the inclusion criteria. In case patients did not receive the treatment they were randomized to, an analysis based on the actual treatment (as -treated -analysis) will also be perfo rmed. 10.5.1 Sepsis Support Index (SSI) and Penalized Sepsis Support Index (pSSI) SSI as primary efficacy endpoint is defined as days with organ support or dead within 14 day follow up. Organ support days are defined as days with vasopressor, mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy (defined as renal SOFA = 4 due to expected heterogeneity in treatment for renal failure). The SSI is calculated as follows: In the t ime frame of 14 day follow - up, each day on support with either vasopressor, and/or mechanical ventilation (defined as any mechanical ventilation received on this day, independent from the duration of mechanical ventilation) , and/or renal dysfunction, or no t alive, is counted as 1. The sum over the follow -up period is defined as SSI. SSI describes the effect of a given therapy in pre -defined patient population with sepsis at risk or septic shock. A penalized version of the Sepsis Support Index (pSSI) is def ined as above, but patients who die get penalized, i.e. the pSSI is set to 14 days . SSI and pSSI will also be evaluated for 28 day follow -up. The individual SSI components (cardiac, respiratory and renal failure) , as well as an SSI-Version excluding the re nal component, will also be evaluated separately. The non -parametric Wilcoxon test will be used to test the treatment effect .The effect measure, delta SSI, will be estimated by the Hodges -Lehmann estimator. A third version of a composite endpoint is also considered: Persistent organ dysfunction or death at 14 and 28 day follow up (as defined by [5])."

In the calculation of the score, the worst values for each parameter in the 24 hours period will be used. In sedated patients, the GCS at the time of intubation will be used. When sedation is removed, the GCS is recorded with actual values. In the rare event, that the patient exer iences a stroke or bleeding after the initial intubation the GCS estimation of 3 – 4 will be used. When the patient is stable, the estimation would be based on clinical experience. When using the SOFA score as an endpoint, patients deceased will be assign ed the maximum SOFA score (24). If the patient has been transferred from ICU to another ward and / or home the SOFA score will be set to 0. The total SOFA score will be calculated as the sum of daily SOFA scores during the ICU stay for each patient. The mean SOFA score is defined as the total SOFA score divided by the length of stay in the ICU. The highest SOFA score recorded during the ICU stay will also be reco rded. The delta - SOFA score is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum SOFA score during ICU hospitali zation. The change in SOFA score is defined as the difference between the SOFA score 4 8h post admission and baseline. Appropriate param etric and or non -parametric methods w ill be applied for the various endpoints based on SOFA score. 10.6 Sample Size Determination / Power Analysis for Primary Efficacy Endpoint (SSI within 14 days) Power simulations are based on using real patient data on the combined endpoint from the ALBIOS study , and underlying assumptions were re -evaluated using results from the AdrenOSS observational study. . • Details of the simulation: 1,000 simulations using real patient data from ALBIOS (n=539) • Simulated sample size: n=150 per group (sampling with replacement) • Simulated effect size: 10% average reduction in the treated group, irrespective of treatment dose • p-values, confidence intervals and point estimates [=pseudo -median] based on Wilc oxon rank test • Simulation includes interim futility stop • Patients may not have less than 1 day with organ support (as vasopressor is given at day 1 by definition) Power Analysis Assumptions"

The lower bound of the confidence interval will be deter mined based on the non -parametric Wilcoxon test. Interim Analysis with Futility Stop An interim analysis is planned after 50% of patients (n=150) completed study day 28 . The study will be stopped if the probability of a positive outcome is below 40% once 50% of patients (n=150) completed study day 28 . Power remains >80% if futility stop is included in simulation . “Positive outcome” of the study will be defined in the SAP. Power Considerations Summary Based on the described simulation, the probability of achieving our primary objective, i.e. that the delta SSI is > 0 with at least 80% probability, is 0.8 7 without interim analysis and 0.8 5 with the planned interim futility stop (discontinue if the probab ility of success is less than 40%). Details will be outlined in the SAP. 10.7 Statistical Methods for Pharmacokinetic Parameters The analysis plan for PK assessment for the study will be part of the SAP. PK of ADRECIZUMAB profile is studied after single administration of ADRECIZUMAB 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg in order to determine key PK parameters, including peak plasma concentrations (C max), systemic exposure (AUC), volume of distribution (V), systemic clearanc e (CL), and elimination half -life (t ½) (in 80 patients only). 10.8 Analysis of Observational Data and Exploratory Analysis Several post -hoc analyses using all patients included in the study are planned, such as analyzing the association between 28 day mortality rate/ vasopressor use/ ventilation and bio -ADM . Exploratory p ost-hoc analysis of efficacy endpoints in patient subgroups defined by severity, other biomarkers , concomitant medication or other clinical data will be performed, as well as interacti ons with other drugs, in order to identify subgroups which possibly benefit overproportionally from treatment with Adrecizumab."

DATA MANAGEMENT and DATA HANDLING 11.1 Data Management All data management activities will be done according to ICH-GCP as required by regulatory agencies. Responsibility for data management lies with the designated CRO following their internal standard operating procedures (SOPs). The designated CRO will be responsible for the activities associated with the data management of this study, including the production of an eCRF, setting up a relevant database, along with appropriate validation of data and resolution of queries. All data will be entered into an eCR F. Automated and manual checks will be made against the data to ensure completeness and consistency. AEs will be standardized for terminology and classification, using MedDRA dictionary. Concomitant medications will be classified by site of action , therap eutic and clinical characteristics using the WHO -DRUG dictionary. Clean data sets will be provided for statistical analysis and reporting. 11.2 Data Handling and Recording of Data All data collected during the study ha ve to be recorded in an electronic CRF (eCRF) which is provided in an internet portal. This eCRF will be designed by M.A.R.C.O. GmbH & Co. KG (M.A.R.C.O) in the Amedon system. The Amedon system has been validated by Amedon GmbH for use in clinical studies. V alidation checks will be implemented in the system or programmed with SAS®, Version 9.1 or higher according to the data validation plan set up by M.A.R.C.O. Personnel at the site will be trained on the use of the eCRF. All investigator site personnel seeking access must go through train ing process before they are granted access to the system. Training records are maintained. All access to the internet portal is password protected. All personnel with access to the system are supported by a Service Desk sta ffed with trained personnel to answer questions and ensure access is maintained such that data entry can proceed in a timely manner. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each eCRF are completed correctly, and that entries can be verified against source data. If certain data are not available or not applicable this will be indicated as such on the appropriate space on the eCRF. The study monitor will review the eCRFs and check them for completeness. In case of any missing data, inconsistencies, implausible values or other imperfections the data manager or the monitor will supply the site with queries, so that the investigator can correct this. It will also be done within the electronic system. The system contains a system -genera ted audit trail that captures any changes made to a data filed, including who made the change and the date and time the change was made. Addenda of the eCRF (i.e. clinical laboratory reports, ECG printouts) should bear the patient identification number, allocated randomization code , study day and time, and signature of the investigator."

The key responsibilities of the DSMB are to ensure patient safety by routine revi ew of overall safety data including all SAEs, SUSARs, all severe AEs, AESIs and AEs leading to drug or study discontinuation and, where applicable, literature cases and information from Competent Authorities (CAs) and by judging the relevance of the events for patients’ safety. The DSMB will operate independently of the Steering Committee and the sponsor. The specific composition and working procedures are described in the Charter of the DSMB. The DSMB will be comprised two clinical experts in the field of sepsis , a biostatistician and a Pharmacovigilance representative . The DSMB Chair and committee members will be selected by the sponsor and the Steering Committee. The DSMB will monitor a sub set of safety data on monthly intervals during the study. For these monitoring activities data on SAE & SUSAR (including fatal outcome) will be provided aggregated, stratified by treatment groups to the members of the DSMB. The data will be presented in se mi-blinded fashion (assignment into group A, B or C). In addition the DSMB will routinely review severe AEs, AESIs and AEs le ading to drug or study discontinuation . Based on the results of these monitoring activities, the DSMB is empowered to recommend to the Steering Committee any change in the design of the study required to ensure the safety of the enrolled patients and the scie ntific integrity of the study."
