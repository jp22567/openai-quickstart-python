5,page_5,"6 1. Background Cancer is the term of more than 200 different diseases caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of the body and spread to other organs and it is a leading cause of death worldwide, with approximately nearly one in six deaths being due to cancer globally (World Health Organization, 2017) . Cancer is rapidly becoming a global pandemic and it is estimated that by 2030 there will be 21.7 million cases and 13 million deaths worldw ide (American Cancer Society, 2017) . According to World Health Organization, the main purpose of cancer treatment is to cure or prolong the patient’s life as well as ensure the best possible quality of life for cancer survivors. Major treatme nts for cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy improve patient’s survival but also can exert a significant psychosocial and physical impact on patients by producing a variety of unpleasant symptoms. Among different kind of cancer treatments , chemotherapy is considered partially to cause insomnia (Dahiya, Ahluwalia, & Walia, 2013) . As a result , insom nia is a common symptom among patient undergoing chemotherapy treatment . However , insomnia often goes unrecognized and receives litter attention compared to other symptoms ( e.g., pain, fatigue, depression) by clinicians and researchers (Dahiya et al., 2013; J Savard & Morin, 2001) . Literature suggests that insomnia reduce patient’s quality of life significantly (Clevenger et al., 2013; Davidson et al., 2002; Romito et al., 2014; Vargas et al., 2010). Nevertheless, recent studies also indicated insomnia co -occurs with others symptoms to form a sleep -related symptom cluster . A symptom cluster has been firstly defined as three or more symptoms occurring together, related to each other and may not have the same etiology (Dodd, Miasko wski, & Paul, 2001) . Recently, other research has expanded the concept of symptom clusters and defined it as “two or more symptoms that are clinically mea ningful together, related to each other at a given time and share a significant variance in their cluster” (Molassiotis, Wengström, & Kearney, 2010) . Applying the concept of identification symptom cluster by the correlation between symptom, di fferent sleep -related symptom clusters among cancer patient have been identified across studies such as: fatigue, depression and insomnia (Ho, Rohan, Parent,"
6,page_6,"7 Tager, & McKinley, 2015; Roscoe et al., 2007) ; pain, fatigue and insomnia (Chen & Tseng, 2006; Cleeland et al., 2000; Ivanova et al., 2005; Romito et al., 2014) or pain, depression, and insomnia (J. Savard et al., 2005) . However, due to the limitation of previous studies, the correlation between insomnia and other symptoms was not fully explored. Therefore, t o identify current evidence of sleep -related symptom clus ter, we have conducted a cross -sectional survey among 213 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy in Vietnam. The results indicated that among participants, a symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety was evident. The result of our survey indic ates the needs to develop an intervention aimed at managing sleep -related symptom cluster. However, interventions to manage sleep - related symptom cluster are still infancy in the literature. To date, only eight studies have tested an intervention designed to manage a sleep -related symptom cluster. In those randomized control trials, non -pharmacological treatments (psycho -education, cognitive behavioral strategies, and acupressure) were used to managing the pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance symptom cluster with some initial evidence of success (Kwekkeboom, 2016) . Therefore, further development of sleep -related symptom cluster intervention is needed. Nevertheless, while most current treatment not only required the physical presence of healthcare provider to deliver and manage but also consume more time, money and effort for patient to administer, t here is sufficient evidence to support the development of a self -management intervention that can potentially improve insomnia . Based on the literature review, acupressure can potentially reduce insomnia as well as other symptoms in cancer patients . This is a safe and non -invasive treatment with minimal unpleasant for patients. However , the use of acupressure in specific self - acupressure in managing symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety is unknown but worthy for further research. Therefore, there is a need for conducting an intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of using self -acupressure to manage this cluster in cancer patients."
7,page_7,"8 2. Aim To assess the acceptability and make estimations about the effectiveness of the intervention using self -acupressure to manage the symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . 3. Objective of the study - To evaluate recruitment capability. - To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and study pr ocedures. - To identify potential adverse events associated with self -acupressure. - To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on the severity of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and severity of the symptom cluster of these symptoms. - To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on participants’ sleep parameter ( Total Sleep time (minute), total time in bed (minute) , the number of night awaken after sleep onset and sleep efficiency ) - To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on participants’ quality of life. - To determine the sample size for the future full-scaled randomized controlled trial. - To refine the study protocol for a future full-scaled randomized controlled trial. 4. Methodologies of the study 4.1. The theoretical framework of the intervention In this study, the Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms (TOUS) developed by Lenz et al . (1997) is used to explain how acupressure can help in reducing the severity of symptom cluster and model the outcome of the trial. There are thr ee components in the TOUS which are: experienced symptoms, influencing factors, and performance. The model"
8,page_8,"9 proposed that symptoms can occur alone or in association with others. Every symptoms four dimensions: timing (frequency, duration, and pattern of symptom’s occurrence) distress (degree the symptoms bother) intensity (severity of the symptoms) and q uality (nature of the symptoms). Influencing factors are determinants of symptoms. They are classified as: Psychology, physiologic and situat ional variables and they relate to each other and influence symptoms. The third component of TOUS is Performance. Performance is the results of the symptoms experience which includes functional and cognitive activities. The model assum es that more numerous or more severe symptom, the worse the performances manifested . These components of the model interact with each other. Influencing factor s determine symptoms, symptoms influence patient’s performance and the performance can also conversely impact on sympt oms and the influencing factors . The figure below depicts the TOUS Figure 1. The Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms (Lenz & Pugh, 2003, p. 170) According to the Traditional Chinese Medicine theory , the symptoms (insomnia, depression, and anxiety) are caused by pathogenic changes in Qi, the imbalance of Yin and Yang (Liu, 1998) and the insufficiency of blood circulation to the organs (Li, 2007, p. 1023) . As such, in this study, the “pathogenic changes in Qi,” “the imbalance of Yin and Yang ,” and “the insufficient of blood circulation” are categorized as “influence factors” in the model. This trial tackles the “influence factors” by using acupressure."
9,page_9,"10 Stimulating acupoints improves the sym ptom cluster by incresi ng the blood circulation resulting in enhancing Qi and balanc ing the Yin and Yang (Li, 2007, p. 1023) . Improving this symptom cluster will cause the effect on patient’s “performance ”. Therefore, the primary outcomes of the intervention are the “ symptoms ” the secondary outcome is “performance ” According to the TOUS, symptoms are measured in four dimen sions. However , founders of the model suggested measuring one, two, or three dimen sions of symptoms is “valid and informative for assessing the effectiveness of an intervention” (Lenz & Pugh, 2003, p. 174) . Therefore, in this study , we measure the intensity which refers to the severity of the symptoms. Several specific and standardi zed measurements will measure the severity of individual symptoms in the cluster . Since the symptoms in the cluster co-occurred together and correlate d to each other , the symptoms severity a t a cluster level will also be measured. The “ performa nce” in the TOUS model is defined as patient’s quality of life in this study. The theoretical framework of the trial is depicted in figure 3."

Aim of the study To assess the acceptability and make estimations about the effectiveness of the intervention using s elf-acupressure to manage the symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 4.2.2. Objectives of the study - To evaluate recruitment capability. - To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and study procedures. - To identify potential adverse events associated with self -acupressure. - To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on the severity of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and severity of the symptom cluster of these symptoms. - To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on participants’ sleep parameter ( Total Sleep time (minute), total time in bed (minute) , the number of night awaken after sleep onset and sleep efficiency ) - To preliminary evaluat e the effects of self -acupressure on participants’ quality of life. - To determine the sample size for the future full-scaled randomized controlled trial. - To refine the study protocol for a future full-scaled randomized controlled trial. 4.3. The application of the MRC framework for the development of the intervention. A complex intervention has been defined as an intervention which contain s several interacting components, and this kind of intervention has been used widely in healthcare research (Craig et al., 2008) . The framework provide s researcher an appropriate framework for developing and evaluating an intervention. The key elements of the"
12,page_12,"13 development and evaluation process include development phase, feasibility, and piloting ph ase, evaluation phase, and implementation phase. Figure 3 depicts the components of MRC framework. Figure 3. The MRC's framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Intervention In the first phase of the MRC framework is the d evelopment of the intervention. In this phase evident and the related theory of the intervention must be identified, and the process and outcomes should also be modeled . The second phase is the feasibility and piloting phase, the procedures of the interven tion are tested to make an important estimation of the future full -scale randomized control trial ( e.g., recruitment rate, sample size). In the third phase - evaluation phase, the effectiveness of the intervention is assessed by conducting a full -scale randomized control trial. In the implementation phase, the intervention is disseminated and also the long -term follow up, surveillance and monitoring of its effectiveness should be conducted . The four phase s are in a cycle in wh ich study can move backward and forward between the phases. If a problem is identified that make the study impossible to move to next stage, the study must be revised and can move back to the previous phase. In this doctoral research study, three research works are conducted to study the effects of self -acupressure in managing the cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The three research works are the cross -"
13,page_13,"14 sectional survey, literatural reviews , and the feasibility study. This study will cover the first two phases in the MRC framework. In the first phase of MRC framework, the cross -sectional survey was conducted to ascertain the magnitude of insomnia among Vietnamese cancer patients . Nevertheless, it also hepls to determine factors that influence the result of the intervention that need to be controlled (e.g. patient’s characteristics, treatment -related factors), to determine the correlation between insomnia and other symptoms, and to make the decision on choosing the outcome measurement for the future intervention study . In the second phase of the MRC framework, a feasibility study with three groups intervention will be implemented to assess the acceptability of the intervention and make estimations about the effectiveness of using self -administered acupressure for managing cancer -related symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Be fore testing the intervention protocol, evidence -based acupressure treatment protocol and sham acupressure protocol were being developed based on a vailable systematic reviews, TCM theories, and TCM textbook, and were evaluated by a group of TCM experts for the appropriateness of the protocol for use in cancer patients. Afterward, a feasibility study designed as a randomized placebo -control trial study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study’s procedures. The process of current study design following the MRC framework for Developing and Evaluating Complex Interventions is presented in Figure 4. The development of evidence -based acupressure treatment protocol and sham acupressure protocol is detailed in the next sections."

15,page_15,"16 4.4. The develop ment of the self -acupressure protocol s for managing insomnia, depression, and anxiety Self-acupressure treatment protocol for managing the symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in cancer patients was developed . To distinguish the specific treatment (true) effects of acupressure treatment from the nonspecific treatment (placebo) effects, a true self -acupressure protocol and a sham self -acupressure protocol were being developed accordingly. The true acupressure protocol was developed based on the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (Li, 2007; Young, 2001) , available sys tematic reviews are used for selecting acupoints and choosing treatment dose (Pilkington, 2010; Tan, Suen, Wang, & Molassiotis, 2015; Waits, Tang, Cheng, Tai, & Chien, 2016; Yang et al., 2013; Yeung et al., 2012b) , and WHO standard acupuncture point location guidelines were used to locate the acupoint and technique for self -acupressure (World Health Organization, 2009) . Meanwhile, the sham acupressure was developed based on available systematic review and recommendation from TCM experts. This section describes the de velopment of self -acupressure protocols based on systematic reviews and the validation of the acupressure protocols. 4.4.1. The development of the true self -acupressure protocol. 4.4.1.1. Justification of the selected acupoints From Traditional Chinese Med icine (TCM) theory, the frequently involved organs causing insomnia, depression, and anxiety are heart, liver, stomach, and spleen (Young, 2001) . Based on this point, Acupoints are selected based on their effect on the organs and their effect on the symptoms from the literature reviews. In a systematic review from 43 studies on the efficacy of acupressure for insomnia, Yeung et al. (2012a) indicated the commonly used acupoints were: Baihu i (GV20), Shenmen (HT7), Taiyang (EX -HN5), Fengchi (GB20), Yintang (EX -HN3) and Sanyinnjiao (SP6). Regarding depression and anxiety, Baihui (GV20), Yintang (EX - HN3). Taichong (LR3), Hegu (LI4) and Shenmen (HT7) were listed as commonly used acupoints from a review of 13 studies (Pilkington, 2010) . From this evidence, Baihui"
16,page_16,"17 (GV20), Yintang (EX -HN3), Shenmen (HT7), Fengchi (GB20) and Hegu (LI4), Taichong (LR3) are included in the acupressure protocol for this study. Baihui (GV20) linked with all Yang channels, this acupoints response for sufficiency of blood circulation in the Heart and Spleen resulting in enhancing the “the source of generation and transformation of Qi and Blood” to improve insomnia, depression, and anxiety. The combination of GV20 and HT7 supplies and boosts the Heart and Spleen (Li, 2007) . Shenmen (HT7) has been demonstrated to be effective in improving sleep across studies in both cancer and non -cancer population (Cerrone et al., 2008; Sok, Erlen, & Kim, 2003; Sun, Sung, Huang, Cheng, & Lin, 2010; Yeung et al ., 2012a) . Also , HT 7 proved to stimulate the release of Melatonin from the pineal gland (Spence et al., 2004) . HT 7 is selected to supplement, clear and settle the Heart also calm the Spirit to treat insomnia, depression, and anxiety by “depletion of Blood in the Heart and Spleen, Qi deficiency of the heart and Gall -bladder, effulgent Yin deficiency fire and disharmony of the stomach (Li, 2 007). Fengchi (GB20) has been demonstrated to be effective to clear the Brain and calm the sleep. It was commonly used to treat insomnia due to depletion of blood in the Heart and Spleen or lack of interaction between the Heart and the Kidneys or Qi deficiency in the body. Thi s acupoint is related to depression and anxiety (Li, 2007) . Yintang (EX -HN3) has been demonstrated to treat insomnia, depression, and anxiety by calming the mind (Marley, 2010) . Hegu (LI4): is effective in treating disorders of the spirit and mind and commonly use s in the treatment of disease pattern due to Qi deficiency (Li, 2007) . Taichong (LR3): has d emonstrated to treat the symptoms related to activities of Liver Qi such as depression, anger by enhancing and regulates the functions of the liver and eliminates pathological symptoms and sign caused by dysfunction of the liver (Li, 2007)"
17,page_17,"18 4.4.1.2. Justification for the dose of the self -acupressure treatment The dose of the treatment refers to the combination of frequency and duration of each treatment section and duration of the treatment period. This section will report the justification for choosing the durati on of the treatment, the frequency, and duration of each treatment section. Duration of the whole treatment and frequency of each treatment section An optimal acupressure treatment dose is a gap in the literature since a wide range of duration treatment was reported , and the guidelines for such dose of each symptom or disease have not been established (Deng et al., 2015) . Therefore, we reviewed previous systematic reviews to find an optimal acupressure treatment duration and frequency of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. In the systematic review on managing cancer -related insomnia, Choi, Kim, Lim, and Lee (2016) reported the duration of treatment was one week to ten weeks with the frequency was once a day. Among six studies included in this review, the duration of four or five weeks resulted in a significant improvement of sleep (Bokmand & Flyger, 2013; Williams, Kay, Rowe, & McCrae, 2013) while the shorter duration (one week) and longer duration (ten weeks) did not (Mao et al., 2015; Song, Zhao, Peng, & Hu, 2015) . In general population, a systematic review of 32 RCTs indicated most treatment protocol s involved a duration of three to four weeks with the frequency was once a day (Waits et al ., 2016) . Yeung et al. (2012a) reviewed 40 RCTs and indic ated the effect s of acupressure on improving insomnia were observed after four weeks of treatment . Therefore, an acupressure treatment duration of four weeks with the frequency of once a day seems to be optimal for improving insomnia (equal to 28 sections) . For the duration of clinical anxiety, a review from twelve studies conducted by Pilkington, Kirkwood, Rampes, Cummings, and Richardson (2007) reported that treatment d uration was six days to six weeks with the frequency was once a day. The finding of this review indicated the treatment group showed a significant improvement than the control with six days to ten days treatment duration (equal to six to ten treatment sections) but not with longer duration (six weeks, 30 treatment sections)."
18,page_18,"19 Regarding the duration of depression, a various duration of treatment from two weeks to sixteen weeks with the frequency ranged from once a week to twice a week (total sessions ranged from ten to 30) was reported in systematic reviews (Pilkington, 2010; Wang et al., 2008) . The r esult from this two reviews indicated the duration of six to eight weeks with a frequency of once to twice a week (equal to six to 16 treatment sections) brought significant improvement in the intervention group compared with control groups. To summarize, evident from available systematic reviews suggests that a frequency of once a day in fou r weeks (equal to 28 treatment sections) is optimal for improving insomnia, once a day in six to ten days (equal to six to ten treatment sections) and once to twice a week in six to eight weeks (equal to six to 16 treatment sections) are the appropriated d uration treatment for anxiety and depression respectively. Based on the findings a duration of four weeks with a frequency of once a day which equal to 28 treatment sections is applied to the acupressure protocol of this study since such dose of treatment covers the optimal doses for insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Duration of each treatment section The duration of each treatment section is calculated on the number of acupoint s and the stimulation time for each acupoint. Systematic reviews indicated the time to stimulate a acupoint rank from one to three minute which made the length of each treatment section ranged from 15 to 45 minutes (Choi et al., 2016; Pilkington, 2010; Pilkington et al., 2007; Waits et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2008; Yeung et al., 2012a) . Others recent studies also showed that practicing acupressure three minutes per acupoint significantly reduced the burden of the symptoms (Abedian, Eskandari, Abdi, & Ebrahimzadeh, 2015; Lu, Lin, Chen, Tsang, & Su, 2013; Tsay & Chen, 2003; Zheng, Chen, Chen, Zhang, & Wu, 2014) . Based on these finding , participants will perform self -acupressure with three -minute stimulation per acupoint. There are six acupoints with four of the acupoint located on both sides of the body giving a total of ten acupoint s to stimulate. Among the se acupoints that located on both sides of the body, Fengchi and Taichong can be pressed bilaterally at a time. Therefore, the duration of treatment time is 24 minutes."
19,page_19,"20 Intensity and technique for self -acupressure According to the TCM theory, acupressure only shows its effects on symptoms when patients experience deqi sensation (Yang et al., 2013) . The deqi sensation is described as the feeling of sore, numb, heavy, distended and warm at the acupoints and is felt by patients (Tsay & Chen, 2003; Yeung et al., 2017) . Therefore, the technique for acupressure using in this study will be using the thumb pad to massage the surrounding area of the specific acupoint firmly and the participant must feel the deqi sensation during performing self -acupressure. However, the pressure technique s for Baihua and Fengchi are different from other acupoints due to their specific locations (on the scalp). For Baihua , participants use four finger pads to tap gently the area o f this acupoint on the scalp . For Fengchi , participants using two thumbs, press in the acupoint bilaterally while the other four fingers should hold the back of the head naturally . The self - acupress ure protocol is depicted in Table 1. Time for practicing acupressure Participants will perform self -acupressure one hour before going to bed since stimulation of Shenmen has been proved to release Melatonin (Spence et al ., 2004) ."

23,page_23,"24 4.4.2. Devel opment of Protocol for the sham self -acupressure 4.4.2.1. Justification for choosing sham acupressure approach In a recent systematic review on the application of sham acupressure in 66 randomized controlled trials , Tan e t al. (2015) listed out two approach es of using sham acupressure: using irrelevant acupoints/ non-acupoint s and using the same acupoint s as true treatment with light touching. The approach of using the same acupoints as true treatment with light touchin g/no stimulation is believed not to create any therapeutic effect (Tan et al., 2015) , howeve r, Vietnamese people are familiar with acupressure technique so the light stimulation may not be adequate to maintain blinding participants. Using irrelevant acupoints refers to the use of acupoints to relief different symptom (Zhang, Bian, & Lin, 2010) . This approach is also not appropriated as the “holism concept” of acupuncture theory indicated that every stimulation on any acupoints could create responses of the body and generate specific or non -specific effects (as cited in Tan et al., 2015 ). As such, it should not be included in the research design to investiga te the specific effect of acupressure. Therefore, we decide to choose the using of non -acupoints approach for the protocol of sham -acupressure since pressing non -acupoints cannot produce any therapeutic effects and maintain blinding participants. 4.4.2.2. Sham self -acupressure protocol Non-acupoints are located 2 to 5 cm away from the true acupoints. Location of sham acupoints and technique of sham acupressure are described in table 2. The treatment dose in the sham acupressure protocol will be the same as in the true acupressure protocol."

27,page_27,"28 4.4.3. Validation of the true self-acupressure and sham self -acupressure protocol A panel of TCM experts was invited to validate the suitability of self -acupressure treatment and sham self -acupressure protocol before implementation of the feasibility study. To provide a sufficient level of control for chance agreement , a panel of at six experts was recommended by Lynn (1986) . Six TCM experts who specialized in TCM from Hong Kong and Vietnam were invited to validate treatment protocol. The six experts work in a university. All had at least ten years of working experience related to TCM and acupuncture. Among six experts, two was appointed as associate professor s, two held the positions of assistan t professor, one held the position of senior lec turer, and one held the position of clinical associate. The Characteristics of the six experts are presented in the table below. Table 3. Characteristics of experts in the panel for validating treatment protocols Characteristics of the Experts (n= 6) Number (%) TCM registration location Hong Kong 4 (67%) Vietnam 2 (33%) Highest academic qualifications Doctorate 5 (83.3%) Master’s degree 1 (16.7%) Academic and professional rank Associate Professor 2 (33.3%) Assistance Professor 2 (33.3%) Senior Lecturer 1 (16.7%) Clinical Associate 1 (16.7%) After identifying potential members of the panel, an invitation email was sent by the researcher to each member. The experts ha d one week to respond to the invitation (Rubio, Berg -Weger, Tebb, Lee, & Rauch, 2003 ). After receiving the invitation letter, all six experts agreed to participa te in the study. Afterward, a cover letter briefly introduce d the study purposes, the criteria for selecting experts, intervention protocol and scoring method (Rubio et al., 2003 ) was sent to experts . The acupressure protocol s were made to assessment form. Each expert rated each item on the acupressure protocol by using a 4 -point Likert scale, where four = very appr opriate, 3 = appropriate, 2 = inappropriate, and 1 = very inappropriate . Comment or suggestion fo r each item will be"
28,page_28,"29 encouraged (Please appendix 9). Experts were required to return their feedback by email within one week of receiving the assessment form. For expert who did not reply, a gently reminder was sent two days after the deadline for returning the validation form. The validity index for each component (C-VI) was calculate d based on the number of the expert rate the acupoints either “very appropriate” or “appropriate” divided by the total number of experts. The compone nts were rated as valid when at least five out of six experts agree as “very appropriate” or “appropriate ”. The C-VI should be at least 0.83; an item has C-VI less than 0. 83 were revised based on comments and suggestions of experts (Lynn, 1986 ). The va lidity index for the whole acupressure protocol ( P-VI) was calculated based on the average C-VI (Lynn, 1986 ; Rubio et al., 2003 ). An C -VI of 0.83 was considered as a satisfactory agreement level . Two round of validation was conducted in this doctoral research project. In the first round of validation study the majority of compon ents in the true and sham acupressure protocols reached the consen sus between experts. However, there were two components in the true acupressure protocol , and three in the sham acupressure protocol did not meet the agreement level (Table 4 ). In the proposed true acupressure protocol, Hegu was rated as inappropriate by two experts. One expert did not provide the reason for his decision but suggest to use Neig uan (PC6) instead because Neig uan (PC6) can support Shenmen to promote sleep better. Another expert indicated to trigger the effect of Hegu ; participant shou ld press until it is sore. Moreover, this is not pleasant , and the subject sure will not be pressing hard enough throughout the entire course of the treatment . The pressing technique of Baihua was also rated as inappropriate by two experts because they indicated the proposed pressing technique was wrong. In the proposed sham acupressure protocol, the location sham acupoint SA1, SA2 , and SA6 were rated inappropriate because their location s are in the same meridian with the true acupoints and touch another acupoint (3 experts). In addition , the pressing technique for SA1 was rated as inappropriate by three experts. Among them, two expert s indicated this p ressing technique is wrong and one expert indicated it is easy to stimulating Sishencong if using this technique . However, none of the experts who rated “inappropriate ” provide a reference for their decision s."
29,page_29,"30 Based on the result, Hegu was replaced by Neig uan (PC6). Neiguan regulates the circulation of chi, strengthens the spleen and stomach which resulted in calming the mind, restoring clarity to the brain, and improving anxiety, irritability, depression, and anxiety (Cross, 2010; Stein, 2009; Young, 2001) . The pressing technique for Baihui was revised (see table 2). SA1 was relocated to the b ase of metacarpal bone of the left index finger . As such the pressing technique for SA1 was also revised . The location of SA 2 was relocated to 2cm superior to the end of the right eyebrow. The location of SA 6 was relocated to medial malleolus. In the second round of the acupressure protocols validation , all the components of the true and sham acupressure protocols were determined to be valid, with the validity index for each component (C-VI) ranging from 0.83 to 1.00. The validity index for the true and sham acupressure protocol (P -VI) also met the satisfactory agreement level with P - VI was 0.92 and 0.89 respectively (see table 5 and table 6 for more detail). Although satisfactory agreement for the true acupressure was achieved among panel , one expert held different opinion in term of pressing technique for Baihui . However, the expert did not suggest any pressing technique for this acupoint. Four experts suggested to describe the pressing technique for Baihui as “using middle or index finger pad firmly massage the surrounding area of the acupoints with moderate pressure at rhythm of one second per cycle” and for other acupoint expec t for Fengchi as “using thumb pad firmly massage the surrounding area of the acupoints with rotation movements at rhythm of one second per cycle”. After discussing between the doctoral researcher and her supervisor and a TCM expert, who both work in acupun cture/acupressure resea rch area, the modification was made to revise the pressing technique for true acupressure protocol. The process of validation acupressure protocols was therefore complete d. The revised acupressure protocol is described in table 7"

34,page_34,"35 4.5. Methods of the feasibility study A Randomized Control Trial study is the golden standard for evaluating the efficacy of an intervention since this is the most rigorous method to examine the effectiveness of a treatment (Schulz, Altman, & Moher, 2010) . This method not only minimize s the treatment bias but also control confounding or prognostic factor amon g groups (Viera & Bangdiwala, 2007) . However, before running a large -scale tria l, there is a need to assess the feasibility of the study procedure. Feasibility study gener ally is used to identify possible issues and resolving problems related to the implementation of the trial (Hertzog, 2008) . A feasibility study is conducted to examine whether the study can be done . Therefore , it need s to be conducted to assess the research an inte rvention process. For this reason , a feasibility study designed as a randomized control trial was developed to assess the acceptability of the intervention and make estimations about the effectiveness of the intervention . 4.5.1. The study design A feasibi lity study with three -arms randomized sham -controlled trial will be set up . The three arms are the true acupressure group, the sham acupressure group, and the enhanced standard care group. Managing non -specific effect was found to improve the reliability of acupuncture/acupressure treatment (Hrobjartsson & Gotzsche, 2010) . The non -specific effect is referred to positive change in patient outcomes that are associated with patient’s desire for symptom relief (Tough, White, Richards, Lord, & Campbell, 2009) , or patient’s perceptions of the treatment (Dowrick & Bhandari, 2012) , or the commun ication between the therapists and participants (Paterson & Dieppe, 2005) . As such, the sham acupressure group must be included to serves as a control group to test the efficacy of the treatment . In the sham acupressure group, participants will practice the same treatment protocol with t hose in the true acupressure group except for the acupoint. In this study, participant s in the sham group will stimulat e a non-acupoint without eliciting deqi sensation. As such, the sham treatment is believed to create no therapeutic effect (Xiang, He, & Li, 2018) . Therefore, the sham treatment helps to distinguish between the s pecific thera peutic effect and non-specific effect of"
35,page_35,"36 acupressure which cannot be managed in the waiting -list control or standard care control group. The “enhanced standard care” control group must also be included . An enhanced standard care control group refer s to a g roup tha t receives no intervention but standard care provided by health professionals and leaflet with some tips to manage insomnia, depression, and anxiety provided by the researcher . The enhanced standard care control group (ESC) serves as a benchmark, a llowing researchers to compare the intervention group to the control group to see the changes in the outcomes of the study. It allows researchers to assess the effect of the intervention against not receiving treatment during that same period . Also , this g roup also helps to test the size of the non -specific effects of the acupressure treatment by comparing the effect of the intervention between sham acupressure group and “enhanced standard care” group (Tan et al., 2015) . For these above reasons , a three -arm trial will be adopted . Specific effects of self - acupressure will be measured by comparing the patient’s outcomes between the true self-acupressure group and sham self -acupressure group. The non -specific effect of the treatment will be measured by comparing the patient’s outcomes between the sham self - acupressure group and the enha nced standard care group. Information about each of the three study groups will be detailed in the section 5.3.5. 4.5.2. Study participants The participants are patients receiving chemotherapy at the chemotherapy unit. The results from our cross -sectional study indicate insomnia was not correlated with age, gende r, cancer diagnosis, cancer stage and treatment -related factors, therefore, there are no specific inclusion criteria regarding cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, number of chemo cycles, and gender. Inclusion criteria: To be included in the trial, patients have to be : - Undergoing chemotherapy currently. - Age 20 – 84 years’ old and legally independent with respect to signing the consent form."
36,page_36,"37 - Able to read and write Vietnamese ( to complete the questionnaires and provide informed consent). - Have Karnofsky score ≥ 80 ( to be able to practice self -acupressure ). - Have Insomnia Severity Index score ≥ 11 (as an optimal cutoff point to detect a majority of patients with insomnia and this score has obtained sensitivity of 97.2% and specificity of 100% (M. H. Savard et al., 2005 ) - Have Anxiety score measured by HADS ≥ 8 and Depression score measured by HADS ≥ 8 (as an optimal cutoff point to detect cases with sensitivity and specificity of 90% for both anxiety and depression as shown in the study by Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, and Neckelmann (2002) . Exclusion criteria: Patients are excluded from the trial if they: - Are unable to understand or cooperate with study procedures. - Are receiving other cancer treatments ( e.g., radiotherapy, hormonal therapy) at the same time as receiving chemotherapy and during the period of their invol vement in the trial. - Are participating in other research studies which may have interacted with the current trial or affect insomnia, depressio n, anxiety perception. - Have difficulties or are unable to practice self -acupressure by themselves. - Are receiv ing insomnia or depression/anxiety treatment currently. 4.5.3. Trial arms There are one group receiving the intervention and two control groups in this study. They are the true self -acupressure group, the sham self -acupressure group, and the enhanced standard care group. After being evaluated as eligible participants of the study, patients will be invited to the study. They will be given information sheet to provide more information about the study and the consent form to sign. After that, they will be asked to completed baseline assessment and be randomized into study groups. The following gives detail on how these three group will be operated (see table 4)."
37,page_37,"38 4.5.3.1. True self -acupressure group [ Enhanced standard care + True self - acupressure intervention protocol]: Participants in this group will practice the four -week acupressure protocol plus standard care. When participants admit hospital to receive chemotherapy treatment, they will receive a self -acupressure training section (Detail of training section will be described in section 4.5.8) . Participants will be requested to practice acupressure at home once a day at night time (before going to bed) for four weeks. During the four weeks treatment, participants will receive a weekly phone call follow up from researchers. Enhanced standard care for the participants is described in section 4.5.3.3. 4.5.3 .2. Sham self -acupressure group [ Enhanced s tandard care + Sham self - acupressure intervention protocol]: Patients in this group will practice the four weeks sham self-acupressure protocol plus standard care. When participants admit hospital to receive chemothe rapy treatment, they will receive a self -acupressure training section (Detail of training section will be described in section 4.5.8 ). Participants will be requested to practice sham acupressure at home once a day at night time (before going to bed) for four weeks. During the four weeks treatment, participants will receive a weekly follow up phone call from researchers . Enhanced standard care for the participants is described in section 4.5.3.3. 4.5.3 .3. Enhanced standard care group The standard care in p otential settings for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy includes health assessment, regular health advices regarding symptoms that patients report and nutrition advice during taking chemotherapy treatment. On the first day admitted to the hospital, the patients will receive a health assessment sections by doctor and nurses. If the result of the health assessment reflects patients are able to receive chemotherapy treatment, the patients will be scheduled to start their chemo -cycles in the following d ay. During receiving chemotherapy treatment patients will stay in the hospital, however with patients who already completed several chemo -cycles can choose to stay in the hospital or only come to the hospital to receive the treatment then come back home /guess house in the night time. The doctors and nurses also monitor"
38,page_38,"39 them during the treatment. After receiving chemotherapy treatment (from one to three days), patients will receive another health assessment section by doctor and nurses. In this section, heal th education regarding symptoms that patients report, nutrition advice, and schedule for the next chemo -cycle will be included . Afterward, patients are being discharged from the hospital and then come back for the next chemo -cycles which are delivered three or four weeks apart . There is no standard care for depression and anxiety since patients normally do not report these symptoms during the health assessment and also these symptom s are not assessed by a healthcare professional when the patients admit ted to the hospital. Unless the symptoms become so severe that patients give up on treatment or attempt suicide, the doctor will refer patients to counseling psychological services. The standard care for patients with insomnia in potential settings include given hypnotic s to patients (Diazepam 5mg) and some tips to help patient improve their sleep . However, based on the main researcher’s observation, in the potential settings, the health education regarding insomnia, depression, and anxiety is provided verb ally to the patient in a few minute by nurses. And a lot of participants do not received this education. This fact can be explained by the hospital overcrowding and shortages of nurses in cancer hospital. As such, in this study, apart from the standard car e which provided by the hospitals, we decide to provide participants a leaflet with 10 recommendations which help participants manage insomnia, depression, and anxiety. These tips includes some basic sleep hygiene rules (Posner, 2011) and tips to manage anxiety and depression adapted from Anxiety and Depression Association of American (ADAA) website (Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 2018). Below is the detail of these recommendations:  Take a time -out. Going out, listen to music, or do what eve r you like to helps clear your head.  Eat well -balanced meals. Avoid consuming coffee, alcohol, and nicotine.  Exercise daily to help you feel good and maintain your health.  When you feel anxiety, take deep breaths. Inhale and exhale slowly. Count to 10 slo wly. Repeat, and count to 20 if necessary."
39,page_39,"40  Accept that you cannot control everything. Put your stress in perspective: Is it really as bad as you think?  Welcome humor. A good laugh goes a long way.  Maintain a positive attitude. Make an effort to replace neg ative thoughts with positive ones.  Get involved. Volunteer or find another way to be active in your community, which creates a support network and gives you a break from everyday stress.  Talk to someone. Tell friends and family you’re feeling overwhelmed, and let them know how they can help you. Talk to a physician or therapist for professional help.  Try to get good sleep by applying the following rules: • Regular bedtime, arising time or both • Avoid naps if possible • Avoid frequent use of bed for non-sleep related activities (e.g. watching TV, reading, studying, snacking) • Avoid mental activities such as thinking, planning, reminiscing, etc. to occur in bed. • Curtail time in bed. If you cannot sleep, you are advised to leave the bed, do some othe r activities such as: reading a book, listening to soft music and only come back to bed when you feel sleepy. • Eliminate the noise from the bedroom. • Have a comfortable pre -bedtime routine (light snack before bedtime, comfortable bed mattress, appropriat ed temperature for bed room, comfortable sleep clothes)"
40,page_40,"41 By providing participants in the study this leaflet, we slightly enhance the standard care but do not contaminate the effective of the intervention since these tips are basic and participants can e asily read about them on the internet or newspaper. In addition, to minimize the bias cause by contacting between interventionist and participants, we also provide participants in the enhanced standard care group weekly follow up phone call in four week (s ame as participants in the true and sham acupressure group). It will be a neutral conversation between the main researcher and the participant in three to five minutes. The main research will ask some question such as how is the participant, does the parti cipant take any kind of medication to manage their symptom and remind participant to come back hospital for the next chemo -cycle on time. During the call, the main research will avoid to discuss any kind of management for insomnia, depression, and anxiety. To summarize, the enhanced standard care in this study refers to standard care provided by the hospital includes health assessment, nutrition advice during taking chemotherapy treatment, hypnotics (Prescribe only where necessary by a doctor) , and the enh anced care provided by the main researcher includes patient leaflet of tips on managing insomnia, depression, and anxiety; weekly follow -up phone call in four weeks.

41,page_41,"42 4.5.4 . Outcomes measurement The aim of this feasibility study is to assess the potential for success of implementation of an RCT to test the effectiveness of acupressure in improving a symptom cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. Therefore, it does not necessarily need to have a prima ry outcome and secondary outcomes (National Institutes of Health, 2012; Tickle - Degnen, 2013) . As such, the outcomes are regarding the objective of the studies. Objective 1: To evaluate recruitment capability . - The recruitment rate, the consent rate, and refusal rate will be calculated based on the number of screened patients, the eligible patients, the number of eligible patients who finally agree to participate in the study, the number of patients who sign the informed consent form, reason for ineligibility, refusal, and time to recruit enoung participant will be recorded. Objective 2: To evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and study procedures - The attrition rate will be calculated by the number of participants who decide to discontinue the study and the number of participants who are lost to contact during the study period. Reason for dropping out and lost to contact will be recorded . - The adherence rate will be calculated based on the number of participants correctly follows the treatment protocol which w ill be measured by the “Self - Acupressure Record Form ”. Reason for not following the treatment will be recorded. - The acceptability score of the intervention will be measured by The Intervention Rating Profile – 15 (Martens, Witt, Elliott, & Darveaux, 1985) . The Intervention Rating Profile – 15 (IRP -15) consists of 15 items, each item is rated on a six - point Likert scale ranging from one (S trongly disagree) to six (Strongly agree). The higher score indicated higher acceptability of the intervention . The scale had been validated, translated into Vietnamese with high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.89) (Nguyen, Alexander, & Yates, 2018)"
42,page_42,"43 Objective 3: To identify potential adverse events associated with self -acupress ure - Participants will be requested to report potential adverse events related to acupressure in the “Self -Acupressure Record Form ”. Objective 4: To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on the severity of insomnia, depression, anxiety, and severity of the symptom cluster of these symptoms. Insomnia As discussed in Chapter 2, subjective (questionnaire) and objective measurements (actigraph ) are required to measure sleep, but results of the cross -sectional survey in Chap ter 3 indicated particip ant’s insomnia severity is not associated with objective sleep measures and using objective measurement causes difficulty in subject recruit ment . Therefore, in this intervention , we use subjective measurement to measure sleep among participants. The Insom nia Severity Index (ISI) is used to measure insomnia severity among participants. This instrument had been validated translated into Vietnamese previously (Long, Thanasilp, & Thato, 2016) and was being used in the cross -sectional study with high reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.92). A sleep diary is used to measure sleep parameters . The participant will be requested to complete a one -week sleep diary befor e starting practice acupressure, after the treatment period ends , and after . The sleep diary is used to measure these sleep parameters: Total Sleep time (minute), total time in bed (minute) , the number of night awaken after sleep onset and sleep efficiency. Par ticipants will be requested to complete the sleep diary when they wake up in the next morning. Depression and Anxiety The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) to measure depression and anxiety among partic ipants. This instrument had been translated into Vietnamese previously (Long et al., 2016) and was used in the cross -sectional study with the Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was 0.87 and for anxiety , subscale was 0.86 and for depression , subscale was 0.76. The severity of the whole cluster"
43,page_43,"44 Separate numerical analog scales (NAS) for each symptom will be used to measure the severity of the whole cluster in the previous month. The symptom severity score of each of symptom in the cluster will be measured by an 11 -point scales with 0 means “not present” and 10 means “as bad as it could be”. Symptom severity at the cluster level will be evaluated by the averaging symptom severity score of each symptom in th e cluster. The symptom cluster severity is calculated by the following formula . 𝑺𝒚𝒎𝒕𝒐𝒎 𝒄𝒍𝒖𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒔𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒊𝒕𝒚 =Anxiety score +Depression score +Insomnia score (measured by NAS ) 3 This measuring approach combined multiple outcomes of the st udy. Such measurement is commonly used to detect the combination of intervention effects and assessing the symptoms of cancer patient using self -reported outcomes (Freemantle, Calvert, Wood, Eastaugh, & Griffin, 2003; Kwekkeboo m, 2016) . Objective 5: To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on participants’ sleep parameter A sleep diary is a useful tool tool for evaluating and tracking insomnia treatment effects (Buysse, Ancoli -Israel, Edinger, Lichstein, & Morin, 2006) . In this study, the sleep diary (SD) which has been developed, standarzied , and validated by 25 insomnia experts is used to measure participants’ sleep parameters (Carney et al., 2012) . The following sleep parameters will be measured: Sleep onset latency (SOL): the length of time that partici pant takes to accomplish the transition from full wakefulness to sleep, Total time spend in bed (TSB): is the length of time that participant spend in bed Wakefulness after initial sleep onset (WASO): the period of wakefulness occurring after sleep onset. The number of night awaken after sleep onset. Total sleep time (TST): is the length of time that participant spend actually sleeping."
44,page_44,"45 TST (min) = TSB (min) – SOL (min) – WASO (min) Sleep efficiency (SE): the ratio of total sleep time to total time spend in bed. 𝑆𝐸 (%)=TST (min ) x 100 TSB (min ) Objective 6: To preliminary evaluate the effects of self -acupressure on participants ‘quality of life. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -General (FACT -G) is used in this study to assess the quality of life in participants. This scale measure four domains of quality of life: Physical well -being (PWB) the severity of pain also being measured in this domain of the questionnaire; Social/family well -being (SWB); Emotional well -being (EWB) and Functional well -being (FWB). This instrument has been translated into Vietnamese by FACIT system and had been used in the previous study with the Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was 0.89 and for Emotional well-being , subscales were 0.78, FWB = 0.82, PWB = 0.81 and for SWB was 0.82.

45,page_45,"46 4.5.5 . Sample size Applying the rule of thumb , 30 subjects will be recruited for each study groups as the requirement for feasibility study involving between -groups comparisons and effect size estimation (Hertzog, 2008; L ancaster, Dodd, & Williamson, 2004) . The potential drop - out rate of 20% is used to calculate the total sample size for the feasibility study. This is the drop -out rate of previous similar RCTs using three group design to evaluate the efficacy of self -acupressure to reduce symptoms cancer patients (Chung et al., 2015; Zick et al., 2016 ). Therefore, the total sample size will be set at 114 patients with 38 patients per group. 4.5.6. Settings The study will be conducted in three large oncology hospitals in Vietnam which are the Vietnam National Cancer Institute and Hanoi Oncology Hospital. All of them are located in Hanoi , the capital of Vietnam. (1) Vietnam National Cancer Institute (Hospital A) : This is the largest cancer hospital in Vietnam, the hospital has 1500 beds and is in charge of providing cancer treatments for patients from North and Middle of Vietnam. On average, the hospital receives about 1100 patients every day. The hospital has three branches , the data will be collected in the largest branch of the hospital which has two chemotherapy units. The A1 chemotherapy unit provides chemotherapy treatment for patients diagnosed with breast cancer or gynecologic cancer. The A2 chemotherapy unit provides chemotherapy tr eatment for patients with various cancer diagnoses (such as lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, Non- Hopkin lymphoma). These units have 24 wards, 130 beds in total. There are 22 doctors and 40 nurses. Every day these units received about 160 patients. Adverse Events X X IRP-15 X Concomitant medication and Supplement X X X X"
46,page_46,"47 (2) Hanoi Oncology Hospital (Hospital C) is a public hospital that is in charge of providing cancer treatment for patients in Hanoi. The hospital has 500 beds and receives about 300 patients per day . There are two chemotherapy units in this hospital. The C1 unit provide s chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer patients and gynecologic cancer patients. The C2 unit provide s the treatment for patients with various cancer diagnoses (such as lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, Non- Hopkin lymphoma). There are 120 beds in these units with eight doctors and 24 nurses. The chemotherapy units provide treatment for appro ximately 80 patients per day. The average nurse to patient ratio is quite equal in these settings (approximately from 1:3 to 1 :4). These hospital s are public institu tions. Therefore, the standard care for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy ha s followed the standards of the Vietnam Ministry of Health. The quality of staff and health care services among those settings are equa l. So it can be said that the treatment enviro nment in potential settings is similar. 4.5.7. Randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding 4.5.7 .1. Randomization and allocation concealment . Randomization refers to a method based on chance only by whi ch participants are assigned to a trial group . Randomization also helps to ensure the allocation concealment which refers to preventing researcher, clinicians, and participants from being known the next group assignment and thus influencing group assigning process (Altman, Schulz, Moher, & et al., 2001) . Randomization is an importan t componen t of trial design to evaluate the true benefits of treatment since a trial with inadequate and unclear concealment of allocation sequence is believed to produce 40% larger estimation of the effectiveness of a treatment (Jüni, Altman, & Egger, 2001) . In this feasibility study, block randomization will be applied to keep the equal size of each trial arm . After being recruited in the trial, participants will be randomly assigned to three trial groups . 114 participants will be randomized into three study groups in a block of six participants. The block size must be the multiplier of the sum of the treatment ratio (1:1:1) . Therefore the block size must be 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. As such, six is"
47,page_47,"48 the size of the block since 114 is divisible by six. A randomization table will be computer generated by using the online randomizer at https://www.sealedenvelope.com/simple -randomiser/v1/lists . The randomization table will be prepared and kept by a researcher in Thanh Tay University who does not involve in any research process. After recruiting enough participants for a bloc k, the main researcher will send the list of participants’ name to the randomization table keeper. The randomization table keeper will then randomly assign participants into trial groups based on the prepared randomization table and email the group assignm ents to the main researcher. By using this randomized strategy, the trial meets the criteria to have adequate allocation concealment since researchers are unable to predict the group allocation until the participants are entered into the study and research ers also are unable to change the group allocation after participants are randomized (Vickers, 2006) . 4.5.7.2. Blinding Blinding refers to ensure that participants or personnel within a trial are unaware of treatment allocation. There are several levels of blinding include single -blind which refers to one party of the trial (participants or researchers) is blinded to the tr eatment allocation, double -blind refers to two parties (participants and researchers) are blinded to the treatment allocation, and triple -blind refers to three parties of the trial (participant, researchers and other staff involved in the trial) are blinde d to the treatment allocation (Friedman, Furberg, Demets, Rebous sin, & Granger, 2015) . Blinding design is applied to reduce detection bias and performance bias (Probst et al., 2016) . In this st udy, due to the nature of the intervention, a partial double -blinded design will be employed. Participants randomize in standard care group will know their group assignment, but participants randomize to true and sham self -acupressure group will not know w hether they receive true o r sham self -acupressure treatment. Nevertheless, the outcomes of the study are all self -reported instruments, therefore, to some extent, the participants themselves could be viewed as “outcome assessors ”. Therefore, participants a nd “outcome assessors” located in true or sham self -acupressure group will be blinded on the treatment allocation . To ensure the successful blinding design, healthcare provider working in the wards will not know the group allocation, the main"
48,page_48,"49 researcher wi ll also work with the head -nurse of the department to arrange patient in intervention group and control groups into different wards. 4.5.8. Study procedures The main researcher will meet with the representative of three potential hospitals (in Hanoi, Viet nam) 2 weeks before the commencement of the feasibility study to asking for permission to collect the data. Ethical approval memos, a study packet which contained study proposal, information sheet, invitation letter , and consent form will be given to the representatives of the hospitals. Participants from five chemotherapy units will be recruited to the study (two chemotherapy units in hospital A, one in hospital B, and two from hospital C). In each of the chemotherapy unit, one nurse will be sele cted to help in screening for eligible participants . A subject recruitment training section will be delivered to five nurse s who help in participant recruitment by the main researcher. On the first day patients admit to the hospital, during the health asse ssment, nurses will ask the patients to rate the severity of insomnia, depression and anxiety that they experience during the previous month. Each of the symptom will be measured by separate Numerical Analog Scales (NAS). NAS is an 11 -point scales with 0 m eans “not present” and 10 means “worst possible”. If the patients rate 4 or above for their insomnia, depression, and anxiety nurses will inform the main researcher and introduce the potential patient to the main researcher . The main researcher will introd uce the study in detail to potential participants and give them the information sheet. The information sheet provide s brief and clear information on the essential elem ents of the study: the aim of the study, the study procedure, the voluntary of involvemen t, participant rights, and potential risks, and contact information . The r esearcher will give participants time to read the information sheet and decide whether the study is of interest to them and whether they want to discuss it further. Participants can ask resear cher any questions related to the study. If the potential participants agree to participate in the study, they will be given the informed consent form to sign. After signing the consent form, researchers will collect the demographic data of parti cipants and instruct participants to complete the baseline assessment (ISI, HADS, FACT -G). After the participants complete the"
49,page_49,"50 baseline assessment, the main researcher will summarize the result and if the participants is eligible for the trial they will be instructed how to compl ete the seven days sleep diary after they discharge from the hospital. Afterward, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups: the true self -acupressure group (TSA), the sham self -acupressure group (SSA) an d enhanced standard care group (ESC). Subject recruitment, baseline assessment, and randomization will be completed on the first or second day participants admit to the hospital to receive chemotherapy treatment. Training participants section will be scheduled on the same day or one day after participants finish baseline assessment based on the availability of participants and interventionist. Sleep diary will be completed in the first week after participants discharge from the hospital. Participant in the true self -acupressure group or sham self -acupressure group Participants in th ese group will either receive a true self-acupressure or sham acupressure training section based on their group assignment . Participants will be requested to practice acupressure at home for four weeks after they complete the sleep diary baseline assessment (a telephone reminder will be made ). During the four weeks treatment, participants will receive a weekly phone call from researchers for encouraging to practice acupressure and answer inquiries may have . During this period, participant will be requested to complete Self -acupressure record form every day. After four weeks treatment, participants will be asked to complete and send back all the post- intervention assessing questionnaire to research by express service (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS], FACT -G, Sleep Diary [SD], Self -acupressure Record Form, and Inte rvention Rating Profile 15 [IRP -15]). A short -term follow up will be then carried out in four weeks to assess the persistence effect of acupressure on the symptoms outcome. During this time, the patient will not practice acupressure at home. By the end of follow up time, researchers will make a telephone reminder to participants and ask them to complete and send back all the follow -up assessment questionnaire to the main research by express service (ISI, HADS, FACT -G, sleep diary ). 200,000 vnd (equal to 60 HKD ) will be given to participants for the express service charge by the end of the follow -up time."
50,page_50,"51 Participants in the enhanced standard control group Participants in the enhanced standard control group will receive the leaflet with tips to manage insom nia, depression, and anxiety. Weekly telephone reminder will also be made in four week. By the end of week fourth, p articipants in this group will be requested to complete post -intervention assessment and send back to research by post (ISI, HADS, FACT -G, SD). A short -term follow up will be then carried out in 4 weeks . During the follow -up period, participants receive no weekly telephone reminder. By the end of follow up time, researchers will make a telephone reminder to participants and ask them to comple te and send back all the follow -up assessment questionnaire to research by express service (ISI, HADS, FACT -G, SD). 200,000 vnd (equal to 60 HKD ) will be given to participants for the express service charge by the end of the follow -up time.

52,page_52,"53 will be recruited . The main researcher will conduct a subject recruitment training section with these nurses. The main research will briefly explain the purpose of the study and study procedures to nurses then instruction them the screening questions and how to complete and score the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). 4.5.8.2. Training of the interventionists Six nurses will be trained to become interventionists for the study ( 2 nurses/hospital). Nurses who work in potential hospitals with at least two years experience in working with cancer patients will be recruited as interventionists of the study. A one hours training section (TOT section) will be delivered by the main resea rcher and a TCM professional. The TCM professional is a senior lecturer of Traditional Medicine Department, Hanoi Medical University with seven years of experience in teaching, practicing and conducting research on acupuncture/acupressure. The TOT section consists of two parts. In the first part of the TOT section, the main researcher will briefly introduce the main study proposal include the rationale for conducting this study, the study aim and objectives, study protocol and outcomes measurement. In the second part, the TCM professional will instruct the participants how to locate and stimulate acupoint following the acupressure protocols. By the end of the TOT sections, the TCM professional will check the mastery of participant’s acupressure technique by using Interventionist Skill Checklist for Acupressure and Sham Acupressure (See Appendix 6) . If wrong location or technique is given , further instructions will be made until all of the participants clearly know how to locate and stimulate acupoint as indicated in the acupressure protocol. By the end of TOT section, a copy of all slides and acupressure protocol s will be given to participants . 4.5.8.3. Training of the participants in the true self -acupressur e group and sham self - acupressure group: Participants locate in these groups will receive education section. The training will be conducted in a group of three to five patients in 45 minutes . The self -acupressure training section will take place in the con sultation room in the chemotherapy unit . In the education section, interventionists will instruct the participants how to locate and"
53,page_53,"54 stimulate acupoint following the acupressure protocols . After giving instruction and time for participants to practice, interventionists checks the patient’s mastery of self - acupressure technique by using the Acupressure Skill Check form for participants (Appendix 7) . If the participant fails to identify the acupoint or stimulate the acupoint wrongly, the interventionist will then correct them . By the end of education section , a patient booklet includes step by step guide line with images -illustrating acupressure protocol will be given to partic ipants . 4.5.9. Fidelity of the study Fidelity of the intervention referred to strate gies to ensure the intervention is implemented as planned (Bellg et al., 2004) . Basic aspects of treatment fidelity are intervention design, intervention training, and receipt of intervention (Murphy & Gutman, 2012) . Strategies to ens ure the fidelity of this study will be listed in each of the above aspects. 4.5.9.1. Intervention design For this aspect, a study protocol has been developed, the detail acupressure intervention was described in detail including the location of acupoints, acupressure technique, dose of the intervention. Potential setbacks and solutions are listed below: - Provider dropout: six nurses will be trained to be instructors to deliver acupressure training sections. Three of them will be the main instructors and others will be extra instructors. The main instructor will be in charge of delivering the training sections when they are not available the extra instructor will replace them. - Lost to follow up due to not available phone number: In order to keep contact with participants during the study period, at least two kind of phone number will be recorded : the participant’s mobile phone, the participant’s fixed line numbers and mobile phone of a member in participant’s family. Participants will also be given the name card of the main researcher. - To ensure the fidelity of outcome measurements, participants will be instructed how to complete the questionnaires and sleep diary. Telephone reminder will also be made to remind participants complete and send back the follow -up"
54,page_54,"55 questionnaire to the main researcher. Enveloped with the address of the main researcher will be provided to participants. If there is still no reply from participants after the first telephone reminder, the second ones will be made five days later. - To ensure equivalent dose across conditions: To ensure the equal number of contacts for each intervention arms to minimizer potential therapeutic effects of the sham acupressure method and placebo effect of the treatment, patients in control g roups will also receive the training in same length and enthusiasm as in the intervention group. 4.5.9 .2. Intervention training Training interventionists A training section will be conducted . Six nurses will be trained to become interventionists for the study (2 nurses/hospital). A one hours training section (TOT section) will be delivered by the main researcher and a TCM professional. The TOT section consists of two parts. In the first part of the TOT section, the main researcher will briefly introduce the main study proposal include the rationale for conducting this study, the study aim and objectives, study protocol and outcomes measurement. In the second part, the TCM professional will instr uct the participants how to locate and stimulate acupoint s following the acupressure protocols. Nurses will be given time to practice. By the end of the TOT sections, the TCM professional will check the mastery of participant’ s acupressure technique by using Interventionist Skill Checklist for Acupressure and Sham Acupressure . If wrong location or technique is given , further instructions will be made until all of the participants clearly know how to locate and stimulate acupoint as indicated in the acupress ure protocol . By the end of TOT section, a copy of all slides and an images -illustrating acupressure protocol will be given to participants for references . To ensure the TOT section run smoothly, the researcher will provide comfortable environment and fac ilities for the TOT section. The rooms will be convenient to reach, keep quiet and clean, equipped with necessary furnitures , such as comfortable chairs, table, air condition, refreshments."
55,page_55,"56 Maintaining consistency of delivering intervention among six inte rventionists To ensure consistency of delivering of intervention among interventionist, following plans will be implemented . A protocol for self -acupressure training section (for participants) is also developed and interventionists are request ed to follow this protocol when deliver ing the training to participants ( please see Appendix 5 and Appendix 8). To ensure the training sections are implemented in the same manner, the researcher will monitor at least 80% of training sections. If there are any problems occur, the researcher will discuss with the instructor. Participant training The self -acupressure/sham acupressure training will be conducted in a small group (three to five participants). Participants will be given training how to perform the acupressure specific to the protocol for their group assignment. To ensure the training section s run smoothly, the researcher will provide comfortable environment and facilities. The rooms will be convenient to reach, keep quiet and clean, e quipped with necessary furniture , such as comfortable chairs, table, air condition, refreshments . 4.5.9 .3. Receiving the interventions Maintaining treatment fidelity during self -administration of the intervention Participants are expected to perform self -acupressure daily following the treatment protocol. To enhance and monitor the participant’s adherence to the treatment as well as to answer any question during the study period, weekly telephone reminder will be made and contact information is also provided to participants. P articipants will be requested to record their acupressure section on the intervention log during the treatment period . Partic ipant also has a follow -up visit with interventionist when they admit to hospital for their next chemo -cycles (approximately 3 to 4 weeks after the training section). During the visit, the interventionist will check the patient’s mastery of self-acupressure technique by using the Acupressure Skill Check Form. The ability of participants to perform the interv ention will be evaluated with the goal of mainta ining at least 80% accuracy on the Acupressure Skill Check Form ."
56,page_56,"57 4.5.10 . Ethical consideration Before collecting data, the proposal of study will be submitted for ethical approval from Human Subjects Ethics Sub-committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Vietnamese Ministry of Health. Potential participants are invited to participate in the study by the main researcher. Information regarding study aims and objective, the study procedures, and potent ial risks of acupressure will be explained by the main researcher . The information sheet will be given to potential participants. The information sheet is designed to explain the purpose and procedure clearly and as a way to obtain participant’s consent in written form. The rights of participants, data privacy protection procedures and method of seeking assistance or further information and so on will be included . Potential participants will be given time to read the information sheet and ask any question regarding the study before deciding on taking part in the study or refuse. If the participant decide s to take part in the study, written informed consent forms will be obtained accordingly. This study has followed the ethical principles for research that involves human subjects which are: autonomy, beneficence, non -maleficence, and confidentiality (Beauchamp, 2009) . Autonomy The principle of autonomy refers to the right for participants to make their own choice of participating in the study (Beauchamp, 2009) . In this study, potentia l subjects will be informed the purpose, objectives, study procedures, and potential harms of acupressure. This such information is also written in the information sheet which is provided to potential participants. Voluntary participation will be assured, and participants will be assured the services that they receive will not be affected by their decision of participating or not participating as well as withdraw from the study. Participants will also be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any harm. Beneficence The principle of beneficence refers to a concept in research ethics which indicates that researcher should have the welfare of the subject as a goal of clinical trial (Beauchamp,"
57,page_57,"58 2009) . In this study , we use acupressure to manage symptom cluster in part icipants. This treatment is a non -pharmacological, non-invasive treatment with evident its safety and effectiveness in managing different symptoms (Lee, Frazier, Lee, & Frazier, 2011; H. J. Song et al., 2015; Waits et al., 2016; Yeung et al., 2012a) . Non-maleficence The non -maleficence principle indicate s the intervention should not put subjects in any harm (Beauchamp, 2009) . In this study, we use a sham acupress ure group as a control group. The purpose of having this sham group is to test the placebo effect of the intervention which is acceptable to determine the efficacy of an intervention (World Medical Association, 2018) . We decide to choose the using of non -acupoints approach for sham -acupressure. P ressing non -acupoints cannot produce any therapeutic effects . Therefore , this approach create s no harm for participants. Confidentiality To ensure subject confidentiality , the following steps will be taken : - Personal information of the participants is replaced with research identification code - Access to master code lists for key code is limited to only main researcher and research assistance . - Contact list, recruitme nt records or other documents that contain personal information of the participants are destroyed when no lo nger required for the research ( 3 years after finishing data collection) - Files containing electronic data are password -protected and encrypted (at leas t when data are transferred or transported). - Research data are stored securely in locked cabinets. - Electronic data are stored on password -protected computers or files. - Files containing electronic data are closed when computers will be left unattended. - Consent forms are stored securely in locked cabinets, separately from the research data."
58,page_58,"59 Ethical concern regarding paying participants Paying for human subjects for participating in scientific resea rch is a common practice that has been reported for over 100 years (Levine, 1979) . Several ethical concerns have been raised regardin g this issue, among which, coercion is considered as the most common concern (Grady, 2005) . However, in this study, the amount of 60 HKD given to participant cannot be considered as “paying for participation” since the purpose of the payment is for express mail service to return the outcomes assessment forms to the main resea rcher. As such, this payment does not a ttract or motive participant to the study. Therefore, it is accep table to give 60 HKD to participants in this study. Ethical concern regarding not informing participants about their group allocation In this study, we do not inform participant in the true a cupressure group and sham acupressure about their group allocation. They will be informed that the study is conducted to compare the effectiveness of two acupoint sets. One set is similar to the acupressure treatment of Chinese Traditional Medicine, and the other set does not follow the theory of TCM but has been associated with improvement of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. This explan ation helps to maintain the blinding design of the study. However, by informing participants in this way, the researche r does not tell the truth to participant which is unethical in some aspects. However, in qualitative research on participant’s views of not informing potential participant about their group allocation, Hughes et al. (2014) indicated t hat participants’ perceive this approach as being acceptable. Nevertheless, testing placebo effect is acceptable, and the sham acupressure method used in this study does not creat e any harm to participant’s health. As such, we believe it is acceptable to not informing participants in the true and sham acupressure group about their group allocation. 4.5.11. Data Analysis Data will be checked for normality, outliers, and missing dat a. Intention to treat principle is adapted for analyzing the result of the pilot study which use the “last value carried out forward” approach to replace missing data. This strategy has been widely used in analysis RCTs. Furthermore, it is proved that mea suring the effectiveness of"
59,page_59,"60 trial may be biased without performing an intention to treat analysis (Hollis & Campbell, 1999) . Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the sample characteristics , demographics, and data related to the intervention feasibility, acceptability and adverse event of acupressure. Baseline differences among the three groups will be compared by chi-square test and repeated measure ANOVA. In case the chi-square test is not appropriated because of low cell counts (≤ 5) , it will be repla ced by Fisher’s exact test . The effect size will be calculated by Cohen d based on the mean difference between baseline and end of the treatment period for each symptom and the cluster of insomnia, depression, and anxiety in the true self -acupressure group and sham acupressure group. The significance level is set ai 0.05, therefore if the p-value is less than 0.05 the result would be considered significant. IBM SPSS 20.0 will be used for data analysis. 4.6. Potential implication of the study Potential implication for nursing research As discussed before, th e clinical evidence for self -treatment for sleep -related symptom cluster is limited and not convincing due to methodological flaws in currently published studies. The finding of this study will provi de evidence on the effectiveness of self -treatment for managing symptom cluster in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Acupressure treatment obvious benefit to treating single cancer symptoms, however, limited studies with rigor design have been condu cted to test the effectiveness of this treatment in improving symptom cluster. As such, the finding of this study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of acupressure for managing symptom cluster in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The p otential implication for nursing practice The study offers an invasive treatment at low -cost and safety for patients to manage insomnia, depression, and anxiety at home. Nurses in hospital or community setting can teach patients about these treatments. Wi th self -acupressure patient s can practice at home without the need for frequent healthcare worker visit as well as paying money"
60,page_60,"61 which reduces patient’s burdens to a larger extent. Nevertheless, the study also prompts awakeness to oncologists to the potenti al of acupressure to relieve cancer - related symptom clusters."
