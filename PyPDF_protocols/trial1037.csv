Current treatment paradigms for AD suggest that there is a need for additional treatment options for patients. More selective JAK inhibitors may decrease the risk for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy that are observed with pan JAK inhibitors or less selective JAK inhibitors. AbbVie is developing a small molecule inhibitor of JAK, upadacitinib, that may address the current needs for subjects with AD. The second generation of JAK inhibitors, with different selectivity profiles against JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2, is in development. 1 Upadacitinib (ABT-494) is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor being developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and AD. In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 activity, but to a lesser degree, inhibits the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3. The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib against JAK1 may offer an improved benefit-risk profile in subjects with AD. In the upadacitinib Phase 2 AD study, a statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in EASI score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) and 30 mg (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo (–23.0%). Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment groups. There were no deaths reported during Period 1. Additionally, upadacitinib was studied in rheumatoid arthritis with the results of two Phase 2 studies and two Phase 3 studies available as peer-reviewed manuscripts. 2-5 Results from a Phase 2 study in AD showed that upadacitinib doses of 15 mg to 30 mg per day had efficacy and safety profiles that can benefit patients with moderate to severe AD. Clinical Hypothesis Upadacitinib is expected to provide better efficacy compared to placebo and be well tolerated in adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD. 2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects Treatment of AD in adolescent and adult subjects depends on the extent and severity of disease. Topical agents alone are commonly used for mild to moderate cases. The most commonly used topical agents are corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitor agents, and moisturizers. When topical therapies are insufficient for treating the signs and symptoms of AD, systemic therapy or phototherapy are generally added to topical agents. 6 Treatment guidelines developed by the American Academy of Dermatology recommend the use of systemic immunomodulatory agents for subjects in whom optimized topical regimens and/or Page 8 of 138"

These guidelines recognize that insufficient data exist to firmly recommend optimal dosing, duration of therapy, and precise monitoring protocols for any systemic immunomodulating medication.7 Importantly, in addition to the lack of well-controlled efficacy data supporting their use in moderate to severe AD, the duration of use of many traditional systemic immunomodulatory agents are limited due to cumulative toxicity. More recently, dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 signaling, has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema (AD) in adults. Although dupilumab addresses the needs of some patients with moderate to severe AD, a large unmet need still exists in this population since, in the dupilumab Phase 3 studies (even when combined with TCS), fewer than 40% of patients achieved 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale; therefore, 60% or more of patients continued to experience significant symptoms on dupilumab therapy. 8,9 Nearly 50% of dupilumab subjects who were IGA 0 or 1 responders at Week 16 became nonresponders by Week 52.10 At this time very few systemic agents are approved for AD and, of those, cyclosporin A and oral prednisone are not suitable for long-term use. Thus, there is a high unmet need for a significant number of patients with an inadequate response to topical agents. Upadacitinib is a novel selective orally available JAK1 inhibitor with the potential to decrease Th2 mediated skin inflammation and itch while having minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3. This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. 11,12 Events of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing potential. Based on the calculated safety margins for human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib. Primary results from the ongoing Phase 2 study demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected doses for Phase 3 (15 mg and 30 mg once daily [QD]) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD. Taken together, the efficacy and safety data from the Phase 2 AD study and cumulative safety data from ongoing Phase 2 and 3 programs in other disease indications support further development of upadacitinib in subjects with moderate to severe AD. For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in upadacitinib Investigator's Brochure. 13 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 3.1 Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy.

Using the data available from these subjects, a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of upadacitinib oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK analyses. 3.7 Biomarker Samples The analyses of optional biomarker samples may include but are not limited to genetic markers that will help to understand the subject's disease and response to upadacitinib. Genes of interest may include those associated pharmacokinetics (drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins), genes within the target pathway (JAK, Tyrosine kinase 2 [Tyk2], TNF), or other genes believed to be related AD, and other inflammatory diseases (filaggrin, Claudin-1, human leukocyte antigen). For any samples collected in Germany, the research will be restricted to upadacitinib and AD. 4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center study that will evaluate upadacitinib in adolescents (12 – 17 years of age) and adults (18 – 75 years of age) with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. Eligible subjects must have a documented history of inadequate response to treatment with topical AD treatments or documented use of systemic treatment for AD or for whom topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable. The study is comprised of a 35-day Screening Period, a 16 week DB Period, a Blinded Extension period of up to Week 136, and a 30-day Follow-up Visit. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria in the main study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of upadacitinib 15 mg (N = 270) or of upadacitinib 30 mg (N = 270) or matching placebo (N = 270). Upon completion of enrollment of 810 subjects in the main study, a supplemental study will continue to enroll adolescent subjects (adolescent sub-study) until a total of 180 adolescent subjects are enrolled in the overall study (main study + adolescent sub-study). Randomization for the main study will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe [vIGA-AD 4]), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, and Other), and by age (adolescent [ages 12 to 17] versus adult Page 14 of 138"
14,page_14,"STUDY M18-891 | Version 6.0 | EudraCT 2018-001383-28 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.[ages 18 to 75]). The separate randomization for the adolescent sub-study will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD 3] vs. severe [vIGA-AD 4]) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada and Other). At Week 16, subjects in the placebo group will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg during the Blinded Extension period. Subjects originally in the 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD upadacitinib group will continue their treatment into the Blinded Extension period up to the Week 136 visit. Starting at the Week 4 visit, rescue treatment for AD may be provided at the discretion of the investigator if medically necessary (further details are available in Section 5.4). Information on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) are described in Section 6.3. The Primary Analysis for the main study will be conducted after all ongoing subjects have completed Week 16. After the Primary Analysis, an additional analysis for the main study will be conducted when the required safety exposure target is reached. In addition, a Week 52 analysis of the main study will be performed after all ongoing subjects complete the Week 52 visit. Furthermore, a Primary Analysis for the adolescent population (including the adolescent subjects from the main study and the adolescent sub-study) will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have completed Week 16. An additional analysis for the adolescent population will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have provided at least 1 year of upadacitinib exposure. The study sites and subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignments for the duration of the study. The schematic of the overall study is shown in Figure 1 . Page 15 of 138"

Study Schematic DB = double-blind; QD = once daily Note: This schematic applies to both the main study and adolescent sub-study. 4.2 Discussion of Study Design Choice of Control Group Placebo has been selected as the appropriate control group since, as discussed in Section 2.2, there is no established standard for systemic therapy in moderate to severe AD. There is no anticipated medical risk for subjects randomized to placebo and if needed, rescue treatment will be available for these subjects. Appropriateness of Measurements Standard clinical and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with AD. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Care should be taken to minimize the pain and discomfort of laboratory procedures, especially in adolescent subjects. Use of a butterfly needle for venipuncture and/or a needle gauge appropriate for vein size may optimize the comfort for some individuals. Attempts at venipuncture should be limited to the subject's tolerance of the procedure; after more than 2 unsuccessful attempts for venipuncture, consider requesting the subject to return at a later time for the blood sample collection within the timeframe allowed by the protocol. Suitability of Subject Population The target study population for this study represents an adolescent and adult AD population with moderate to severe disease activity appropriate for systemic therapies. Subjects who are between ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age at the time of the Screening visit will be considered adolescents for the duration of the study. Page 16 of 138"

To confirm dose assumptions, PK evaluation will be performed for adolescents and adults in the study. Selection of Doses in the Study This study will evaluate two doses of upadacitinib (15 mg and 30 mg QD). The selection of these doses was informed by the analyses of the 16-week safety, efficacy, and exposure-response data from Period 1 of the Phase 2 AD Study M16-048, which evaluated 3 doses of upadacitinib (7.5 mg, 15 mg or 30 mg QD) versus placebo. In addition, available PK, pharmacodynamic, and safety data from upadacitinib studies in other disease indications were used to support the selection of these doses. The Phase 2 study results demonstrated superior efficacy of upadacitinib with an acceptable safety profile at the selected doses (15 mg and 30 mg QD) compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD. A statistically significant difference in the mean percent change from Baseline in EASI score at Week 16 (primary endpoint) was observed for 7.5 mg (–39.4%; P= 0.032 vs placebo), 15 mg (–61.7%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) and 30 mg (–74.4%; P< 0.001 vs placebo) groups compared with placebo (–23.0%). Through Week 16 (Period 1), the percentages of subjects with AEs, SAEs, severe AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment groups. There were no deaths reported during Period 1. Preliminary exposure-response analyses for Period 1 of the Phase 2 study show that the percentage of subjects achieving EASI 75, EASI 90, or IGA 0/1 increased with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures. Simulations using preliminary exposure-response models indicate that doses lower than 15 mg QD (e.g., 7.5 mg QD) are not predicted to provide adequate efficacy in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD. Bodyweight was not found to be correlated with upadacitinib apparent clearance within the evaluated range of 39 kg to 152 kg in the preliminary population-pharmacokinetic analysis across healthy volunteers and in subjects with RA, CD, and AD. Consistent with this finding, upadacitinib estimated apparent clearance was found to be similar between adult subjects with low body weight (< 50 kg) and rest of the subjects across Phase 1 and 2 studies (bodyweight greater than or equal to 50 kg). Adult subjects with CD have been evaluated with chronic dosing of upadacitinib up to 24 mg twice a day using the immediate release formulation (exposures equivalent to that of 60 mg QD regimen using the extended release tablet formulation) with acceptable safety profile. Therefore, there is no anticipated risk resulting from higher exposures for adult subjects weighing less than 40 kg receiving the 30 mg QD dose in the AD clinical trials. As for adolescents, given that no adolescents have been exposed to upadacitinib before, the 40 kg cutoff is implemented as an additional safety precaution for this population only. Among the cytochrome P450s (CYPs), upadacitinib is mainly eliminated via CYP3A mediated metabolism (approximately 24% and 38% of upadacitinib immediate-release dose is excreted as unchanged Page 17 of 138"

Literature suggests that maturation of the CYP3A activity in children 2 years and above is similar to that of adults.19 Therefore, upadacitinib clearance is not expected to be different between adolescents and adults because of age. Given the evidence in literature with regards to comparable maturation of the CYP3A activity in adolescents relative to adults and that upadacitinib clearance (the key pharmacokinetic parameter that drives the steady state exposures [area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve]) was shown not to be correlated with the bodyweight (within the range of 39 kg to 152 kg), it is estimated that upadacitinib exposures will be comparable within this body weight range in adolescents and adult subjects with atopic dermatitis. In summary, exposures associated with upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD using the once-daily formulation are predicted to be effective and have an acceptable safety profile across the proposed age range for the treatment of subjects with moderate to severe AD. Placebo Duration Rationale The 16-week DB Period is deemed to be a sufficient duration to be able to test the superiority of upadacitinib versus placebo for achieving the co primary endpoints (EASI 75 and vIGA-AD) at Week 16 and several secondary endpoints, while minimizing undue burden for subjects. The placebo-controlled period will allow for a 16-week assessment of efficacy and safety versus a control group. To ensure appropriate medical care for subjects, starting from Week 4, all subjects with an inadequate response may be rescued with escalating therapies ranging from higher potency topical agents to systemic agents of the investigator's choice (see Rescue Therapy in Section 5.4for further details). 5 STUDY ACTIVITIES 5.1 Eligibility Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.

If the female subject is ≤ 55 years of age, postmenarchal, and has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening. !If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential and protocol specified contraception is required. !If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with postmenopausal status, contraception is not required. !If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with premenopausal status, contraception is required, and pregnancy testing requirements for women of childbearing potential must be followed (see below). A female who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile, and who is postmenarchal or pubertal and has not yet had menses (premenarchal, Tanner stage 3 or higher), is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Baseline Visit (or earlier) through at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. !Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. !Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation. !Vasectomized partner(s) provided the vasectomized partner has received medical confirmation of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential trial participant. !Intrauterine device (IUD). !Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS). !True abstinence (if acceptable per local requirements): Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., using calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable.

It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended vaccines that are inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap). It is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine be considered for administration at least 4 weeks before the first dose of study drug in subjects greater than 50 years of age (per label). If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, pre-existing immunity should be confirmed through antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine. If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered. See Section 5.3for a list of commonly used live vaccines. If there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapies the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Scientific Director should be contacted who will then discuss with the AbbVie Medical Director and provide a recommendation. Prior Therapy Any systemic treatments for AD since initial diagnosis (as determined through medical history records or through subject or parent or legal representative interview) and any prescribed treatments for AD prior to study entry will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Required Concomitant Medications Beginning at the screening visit, twice daily use of an additive-free, bland emollient is required for at least 7 days prior to Baseline and during the study until Week 16. Starting at the Week 16 Visit or after premature discontinuation of study drug, the use of emollients can be administered per investigator discretion. Note: Until Week 16, the subject may use prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing ceramide, urea, filaggrin degradation products or hyaluronic acid if such moisturizers were initiated before the screening visit. Rescue Therapy Starting at the Week 4 visit, rescue treatment for AD may be provided, if medically necessary and the following parameters are met: !At Week 4 through Week 24: subjects with < 50% reduction in EASI (EASI 50) response at any two consecutive scheduled visits (e.g., at Week 2 and Week 4 with rescue at Week 4; or at Week 20 and Week 24 with rescue at Week 24), compared to the Baseline EASI score. !After Week 24: subjects with < EASI 50 response at any scheduled or unscheduled visit, compared to the Baseline EASI score. Investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topical medications, and escalate to systemic medications only for those subjects who do not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatment. Starting at the Week 16 Visit, the use of any concomitant topical medication for atopic dermatitis can be administered per investigator discretion and will no longer be considered as rescue therapy.

Subjects who receive topical rescue treatment or oral corticosteroids during the study treatment period can continue study drug. Oral corticosteroids are not allowed for routine treatment of AD (see Prohibited Medications and Therapy in Section 5.3). If oral corticosteroids must be used, rescue treatment will be limited to prednisone or prednisolone for up to 1 mg/kg for no more than 2 consecutive weeks. Any subject who receives oral corticosteroid for more than 2 consecutive weeks regardless of the dosage of corticosteroid should permanently discontinue study drug. If a subject needs rescue treatment with a non-corticosteroid systemic agent (including but not limited to cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, dupilumab) or with an injectable or parenteral corticosteroid, study drug should be permanently discontinued prior to the initiation of rescue systemic agent. If rescue treatment is medically necessary outside of the parameters described above (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms), study drug should be permanently discontinued. Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug are encouraged to continue to participate in the study (no study drug given) and complete the schedule of study visits and assessments. Investigators should conduct efficacy and safety assessments (e.g., disease severity scores, safety labs) before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose if necessary. 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time. Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced. Subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to participate in the study. Subjects can request to be discontinued from participating in the study at any time for any reason including, but not limited to, disease progression or lack of response to treatment. The investigator may discontinue any subject's participation at any time for any reason, including but not limited, to disease progression, lack of response to treatment, an AE, safety concerns, or failure to comply with the protocol. Refer to Section 6.2for additional discontinuation criteria relating to Toxicity Management of serious infections, gastrointestinal perforation, cardiovascular and thromboembolic events, malignancy, ECG abnormality and select laboratory abnormalities.

In addition, any data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies that negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment may cause discontinuation or termination of the study. AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator. For subjects to be considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the final status of the subject. At a minimum, 2 telephone calls must be made and 1 certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation. 5.6 Follow-Up for Subject Withdrawal from Study To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they prematurely discontinue treatment with study drug. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of study drug discontinuation. In addition, a 30-day follow-up visit should occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug, but continue study participation should complete a PD visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Appendix D , and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug and PK sample collection. Once the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue and efficacy driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply. If at any point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit is not required. The 30-Day Follow-Up visit is not applicable for subjects who discontinued study drug and continued study participation and completed at least one study visit at least 30 days after last dose of study drug.

The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped. When AbbVie is informed that samples are withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, no new biomarker analysis data will be collected, and the samples will be destroyed. Data generated for biomarker research before subject withdrawal of consent will remain part of the study results. 5.7 Treatment After End of Study For active subjects randomized to upadacitinib, subjects will continue on study treatment throughout the study for a period of up to 136 weeks or until premature discontinuation of study drug. At the subject's last study visit, the investigator will discuss the appropriate subsequent treatment with the subject. AbbVie will not provide drug or any other therapy once the subject's participation is concluded. 5.8 Study Drug The individual study drug information is presented in Table 2 . Table 2.

If the subject must undergo emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at the time of the surgery. After emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of study drug once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection. 2. Elective surgery, and interruption of study drug for such a surgery, will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed (Week 16). If the subject undergoes elective surgery, the study drug should be interrupted at least 1 week prior to the planned surgery. Allow reintroduction of study drug once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection. Packaging and Labeling Upadacitinib and matching placebo will be packaged in bottles with quantities sufficient to accommodate study design. Each bottle (kit) label will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via interactive response technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit. Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements. Labels must remain affixed to the bottles (kits). All blank spaces on the label will be completed by the site staff prior to dispensing to the subjects. Storage and Disposition of Study Drug Upadacitinib and matching placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F). The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed as appropriate. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject The study drug (upadacitinib or placebo) will be dispensed in the form of bottles with 15 mg, 30 mg, or matching placebo tablets at the visits listed in Appendix D . Subjects will be instructed to take study drug orally as 1 tablet once daily at approximately the same time each day with or without food. The study drug should be taken whole and should not be split, crushed, dissolved, etc. Randomization/Drug Assignment All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the screening visit. For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial screening visit should be used. The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie. Subjects in the main study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg (N = 270) !Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg (N = 270) !Group 3: Placebo (N = 270) Page 34 of 138"

Subjects in the adolescent sub-study will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups: !Group 1: Upadacitinib 15 mg !Group 2: Upadacitinib 30 mg !Group 3: Placebo For the main study, randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [Investigator's Global Assessment (vIGA-AD) = 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD = 4] AD), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, and Other), and age (adolescent [ages 12 - 17] versus adult [ages 18 - 75]). For the adolescent sub-study, randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [vIGA-AD = 3] versus severe [vIGA-AD = 4]) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, and Other). At Week 16 of the main study and of the adolescent sub-study, the subjects remaining in Group 3 will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: !Group 4: Upadacitinib 15 mg !Group 5: Upadacitinib 30 mg For the main study, the re-randomization will be stratified by EASI 50 responder (Yes/No), by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, and Other), and by age (adolescent [ages 12 to 17] versus adult [ages 18 to 75]). For the adolescent sub-study, the re-randomization will be stratified by EASI 50 responder (Yes/No) and by geographic region (US/Puerto Rico/Canada, and Other). IRT will provide the appropriate study drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject. Returned study drug must not be re-dispensed to any subject. All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the trial (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team), the investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the study. To maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency. Blinding Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study. To maintain integrity of the trial and avoid introduction of bias, the study team will only have access to unblinded subject level data for AEs of special interests and SAEs for regulatory submissions. In order to maintain the blind, the upadacitinib tablets and placebo tablets provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of medical emergency.

The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Treatment Compliance The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject dosing diary. Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at each clinic visit. The study site personnel will document compliance in the study source documents. 5.9 Protocol Deviations The investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations. Protocol deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable) and AbbVie. 5.10 Other Study Procedures Subject Information and Informed Consent The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject or any medications being discontinued by the subject in order to participate in this study, the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by the subject or their legally authorized representative, parent or legal guardian (for subject ≥ 12 years old and < 18 years old) the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the signed informed consent will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. An assent form may need to be signed and dated for adolescent subjects, according to the country requirements. If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, that subject will need to be consented using the approved informed consent form. Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.

Laboratory values can be re-tested once during the screening period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained. Subjects who initially screen-fail for the study are permitted to re-screen once following re-consent. For additional re-screening, AbbVie TA SD approval is required. As appropriate, sites are encouraged to contact the AbbVie TA SD to confirm if subjects should or should not be re-screened. All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during rescreening. The subject must meet all eligibility criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including the following assessments, these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening, provided the conditions noted in Section 5.1of the protocol are met, there are no changes in the subject's medical history that would warrant re-testing, and no more than 90 days have passed: !HBV, HCV and HIV serology !Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON TB Gold In Tube test or equivalent) and/or a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or both if required per local guidelines) !Chest x-ray !ECG Subjects who are between ≥ 12 and < 18 years of age at the time of the Screening visit will be considered adolescents for the duration of the study. The age at the time of Re-Screening Visit will be used for subjects who Re-Screen. Medical History A complete non-AD medical history, including demographics, history of tobacco, alcohol, and nicotine use, will be taken at Screening. Additionally, a list of each subject's specific AD related medical history should be recorded at Screening. History of clinical herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history. The subject's medical history will be updated prior to study drug administration at the Study Day 1 visit. This updated medical history will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment and to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment. A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factors will be documented in the study source documentation. This information will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic locations. Page 37 of 138"

Results are reported from the subject interview. Urine specimens will be tested at the screening visit for the presence of drugs of abuse. The panel for drugs of abuse will minimally include the drugs listed below. Any positive result must be assessed for clinical significance. These analyses will be performed by the certified central laboratory chosen for the study. This urine test is optional in Portugal. !Opiates !Barbiturates !Amphetamines !Cocaine !Benzodiazepines !Alcohol !Phencyclidine !Propoxyphene !Methadone Adverse Event Assessment The subjects will undergo physical examination for any active AEs and AEs that have occurred and resolved since the last visit as well as be interviewed for AEs that are not apparent in a physical examination. SAEs and protocol related non-serious AEs that occur after a subject signs the informed consent will be collected, prior to the first dose of study drug. Please refer to Section 6.1. Patient-Reported Outcomes Subjects will complete the self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument (when allowed per local regulatory guidelines). Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item. Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks. Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaire to them. Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. Subjects will complete the following questionnaires as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. Worst Pruritus NRS, ADerm-SS daily items, ADerm-IS daily items, ADerm-SS weekly items, ADerm-IS weekly items, SCORAD, POEM, PGIS, PGIC, PGIT, DLQI, CDLQI, EQ-5D-5L, and HADS should be administered before any study procedures in the order listed.

The PRO instrument should be completed prior to drug administration on Day 1 and prior to any discussion of AEs or any review of laboratory findings. Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) The Worst Pruritus NRS is an assessment tool that subjects used to report the intensity of their pruritus during a daily recall period. Subjects are asked the question: ""On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being 'no itch' and 10 being the 'worst imaginable itch,' how would you rate your itch at its worst during the past 24 hours?"" The Worst Pruritus NRS will be administered on electronic hand held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening. Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit. Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Atopic Dermatitis Symptom Scale (ADerm-SS) The ADerm-SS is an 11-item PRO questionnaire designed to assess signs and symptoms that subjects may experience due to AD using a 24-hour recall period. The ADerm-SS includes three items that subjects complete daily and 8 items that subjects completed each week. The daily items include: worst itch during sleep hours, worst itch during awake hours, and worst skin pain. The 8 weekly items are also assessed using a 24-hour recall period. These items include worst skin cracking, worst pain caused by skin cracking, worst dry skin, worst skin flaking, worst rash (i.e., redness, blisters, bumpy skin), worst skin thickening, worst bleeding, and worst skin oozing. All items of the ADerm-SS are scored on an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (no [sign/symptom concept]) to 10 (worst possible [sign/symptom concept]). The ADerm-SS will be administered on electronic hand held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening. Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit. Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily/weekly assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale (ADerm-IS) The ADerm-IS is a 10-item PRO questionnaire designed to assess a variety of impacts that subjects experience from their AD across both a 24-hour recall period (the daily items 1 to 3) and 7-day recall period (the weekly items 4 to 10). Daily items are related to sleep, and include difficulty falling asleep, impact on sleep, and waking at night. Weekly items include household activities (e.g., washing dishes, sweeping, doing laundry), physical activities (e.g., walking, exercising), social activities, concentration, self-consciousness, embarrassment, and sadness. All items of the ADerm-IS are scored on an 11-point NRS from 0 (no impact) to 10 (extreme impact). The ADerm-IS will be administered on electronic hand held devices from Screening through Week 16; devices will be given to subjects to take home at Screening. Hand-held device usage ends at the Week 16 visit. Starting at the Week 20 visit, the frequency of administration will be reduced from daily/weekly assessments to assessments only at scheduled site visits using a tablet at the site. Page 39 of 138"

It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of subject's QoL over the prior week. The DLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships and the side effects of treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. For general inflammatory skin conditions, a change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). The DLQI will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Throughout this study, the DLQI will be administered to subjects who are ≥ 16 (16 to 75) years old at the time of the Screening visit. Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) The CDLQI is a 10-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QoL. The CDLQI has been validated for use in subjects 4 - 16 years old. It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of patient's QoL over the prior week. The CDLQI items include symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, school, relationships, sleep, and treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all; 1 = only a little; 2 = quite a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30; higher scores indicate greater impairment of QoL. In this study, the CDLQI will be administered to subjects who are < 16 years old at the time of the Screening visit, and will continue to be administered to these subjects for the duration of this study. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in both children and adults. Subjects respond to 7 items, including dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping, each scored on a 5-point scale based on frequency: 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days. Item scores (0 to 4) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. A change in POEM score of 3.4 points is considered the MCID. The POEM will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Hospital Anxiety and Depress Scale (HADS) The HADS is a 14-item questionnaire, with seven items related to anxiety (HADS-A) and seven items related to depression (HADS-D). Each item is scored from 0 to 3; scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21 and scores for the entire scale (emotional distress) range from 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more distress. For each domain, scores 7 or lower are considered normal, 8 to 10 are borderline, and 11 or higher indicate clinical anxiety or depression. HADS will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. EuroQoL Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive Page 40 of 138"

Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: ""no problem"" (level 1), ""some problems"" (level 2), ""extreme problems"" (level 3). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement (i.e., no problems, some problems, or severe problems) in each of the 5 dimensions; this results in a 1-digit number expressing the level for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent's health state. The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled ""best imaginable health state (100)"" and ""worst imaginable health state (0)."" This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. The EQ-5D-5L will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study.Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS) The PGIS asks subjects to describe the severity of their AD symptoms right now. Subjects rate their AD symptoms on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 = Absent (no symptoms) to 6 = Very Severe (cannot be ignored and markedly limits my daily activities). The PGIS will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) The PGIC asks subjects to rate the overall change in their AD symptoms by comparing the severity of their AD symptoms right now with the severity of their AD symptoms before they began study treatment. Subjects are asked: ""Compared to before your study treatment began, how would you rate the overall change in your atopic dermatitis symptoms?"" Responses range from 1 = ""Very much improved"" to 7 = ""Very much worse."" The PGIC will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. The PGIC will not be collected at Baseline. Patient Global Impression of Treatment (PGIT) The PGIT asks subjects to rate their level of satisfaction/dissatisfaction with their current treatment for AD. Subjects are asked: ""Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with your current treatment for atopic dermatitis?"" Responses range from 1 = ""Extremely dissatisfied"" to 7 = ""Extremely satisfied."" The PGIT will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD. There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected body surface area, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as ""A"" in the overall SCORAD calculation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of Page 41 of 138"

Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the subject or relative on a VAS on the tablet, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as ""C"" in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. The SCORAD subjective symptoms (component C) will be administered on the tablet at site visits throughout the study. SCORAD components A and B will not be on the tablet and performed on paper worksheets and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF). The rule of 9's method should be used to assess the percentage of each defined body area on the paper worksheets for component A. Investigator Assessments The investigator assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets and entered into the eCRF and conducted at the study visits specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. If possible, the investigator assessments should be performed by an independent and blinded assessor who should not perform any other study related procedures. In order to minimize variability, the same independent assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the study. A back-up independent assessor should be identified. The independent assessor must be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, or physician). Any assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented. If the independent assessor is not available, the pre-identified back-up assessor should perform such assessments. Validated Investigator's Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) The vIGA-AD is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of ""0""(absent) through ""3"" (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis (BSA, %) A qualified investigator or designee should select the subject's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1%. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the investigator is aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimating the total area involved. The site should make every attempt to have the same qualified investigator or designee perform all BSA assessments on a given subject throughout the study. Page 42 of 138"

Hand Eczema Severity Index (HECSI) Each hand is divided into five areas [fingertips, fingers (except the tips), palms, back of hands and wrists]. For each of these areas the intensity of the six following clinical signs: erythema, induration/papulation, vesicles, fissuring, scaling and edema is graded on the following scale: 0, no skin changes; 1, mild disease; 2, moderate and 3, severe. For each location (total of both hands) the affected area is given a score from 0 to 4 (0, 0%; 1, 1 – 25%; 2, 26 – 50%; 3, 51 – 75% and 4, 76 – 100%) for the extent of clinical symptoms. Finally, the score given for the extent at each location is multiplied by the total sum of the intensity of each clinical feature, and the total sum called the HECSI score is calculated, varying from 0 to a maximum severity score of 360 points. Vaccines Vaccines recommended by local guidelines should be considered. If the investigator chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval. It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended inactivated, toxoid, or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis). If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of primary varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine. If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered. See Section 5.3(Prohibited Medications and Therapy) for a list of commonly used live vaccines that are prohibited during study participation. Tuberculosis Testing The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB. At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form (Operations Manual Section 3.16) and tested for TB infection (QuantiFERON TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT test] and/or local PPD skin test, if required). The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. The TB test and latent TB risk factor questionnaire will be done at Week 52 and annually after Week 52, regardless of TB test results. If a subject had a negative PPD test within 90 days prior to Screening and a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent such as T-SPOT test) cannot be performed at Screening and source documentation is available, TB testing by PPD skin test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TA SD. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. Page 43 of 138"

Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR. Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below). Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or the most recent evaluation, an annual TB follow-up test will be performed. In cases where the annual QuantiFERON-TB Gold test by the central laboratory is positive and the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB (i.e., no risk factors identified using the TB risk assessment form) and has no clinical suspicion of TB, the investigator may perform a QuantiFERON TB gold test at a local lab (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result: if repeat testing result is negative, then the investigator may consider the subject to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if repeat testing result is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive. If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a CXR needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB, and subsequent annual TB follow-up tests are not required. Any positive TB test after the subject has started the study, should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB re-test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the AbbVie TA SD. TB Test !Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) and/or PPD are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive. !For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test), both will be performed. If either PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is positive, the TB test is considered positive. !The PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). !If only a PPD is placed at Screening, then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject is the PPD. Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) alone, then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test). !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent, such as T-SPOT TB test) and the PPD are required per local guidelines) the PPD will be performed.

A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm"" not ""negative."" Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to the PPD in the past should not be re-exposed and the PPD should be considered positive. !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a QuantiFERON TB gold test at a local lab (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result. If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study. If the testing result is negative, then the subject is considered to be negative. TB Prophylaxis At Screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer); at least 6 months of prophylaxis need to be completed, however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug. Of note: Rifampicin or rifapentine is not allowed for TB prophylaxis.Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant repeat treatment. For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy, but insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the AbbVie TA SD. During the study, subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophylactic treatment immediately per local guidelines and complete at least 6 months of prophylaxis. Study drug(s) should not be withheld. Two to 4 weeks later, the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis. Newly initiated prophylactic treatment and prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF. Chest X-Ray A CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views) is required: !For all subjects at Screening to rule out the presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings.

A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform and document an assessment of the CXR. The Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the report. In the assessment of the CXR, the Principal Investigator or their delegate must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB. If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator should contact the AbbVie TA SD before enrolling the subject. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram A 12-lead ECG will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection. The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site (""local reader""). The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories: !Normal ECG !Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant !Abnormal ECG – clinically significant Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source folder. The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected. Height and Body Weight Height and body weight will be measured without shoes at visits specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. Weight will be performed throughout the study for all subjects (both adults and adolescents). For adults, collection of height will be at the Baseline Visit only. For adolescent subjects (subjects who were 12 to 17 years of age at Screening Visit), collection of height will be at the Screening and Baseline Visits and designated visits thereafter. All measurements will be recorded in imperial or metric units where applicable. Vital Signs Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature will be obtained at visits as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes. Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. The physical examination at the Baseline Visit will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study. Physical examination abnormalities noted by the investigator at baseline prior to the first dose of study drug will be recorded in the subject's medical history; abnormalities noted after the first dose of study drug will be evaluated and documented by the Page 46 of 138"

All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page. At any time, a symptom-directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by the investigator. Tanner Staging The Tanner Scale (also known as the Tanner Stages) is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess physical development (Operations Manual Section 3.17). The Scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitals, testicular volume and development of pubic hair. Throughout this study, Tanner Staging will be assessed at Baseline for subjects who are < 18 (12 to 17) years old at the time of the Screening Visit, and will continue to be assessed for these subjects for the duration of this study. Once a subject reaches stage 5 in both categories, Tanner Staging will no longer need to be assessed for that subject. Dispense Study Drug Study drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and as specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other screening procedures are completed. Each site will be responsible for maintaining drug accountability records including product description, manufacturer, and lot numbers for all non-investigational products dispensed by the site. Subjects will be instructed to take study drug orally as 1 tablet once daily at approximately the same time each day with or without food. Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood and urine samples will be collected following a minimum 8-hour fast. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary (except during Screening visit), due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation. A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests. Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study. Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be provided by the central laboratory. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits. A microscopic analysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal.

A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate active Hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti HCV Ab). Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Subjects with HIV infection (positive HIV test) are excluded from study participation. HIV testing will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by local regulations. The investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. This testing is to be done at the central lab. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result. Discontinuation of Study Drug and Subject Withdrawal from the Study All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation During the study, subjects may discontinue study drug treatment but may choose to continue to participate in the study. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Operations Manual Section 2.1 and Protocol Appendix D , and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug and PK sample collection, and blood sample collection for optional exploratory research and validation studies. As the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue and efficacy driven discontinuation criteria may no longer apply. If at any point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit is not required. Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) Subjects may withdraw from the study completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for any reason at any time.

Pharmacokinetic Sampling Collection of Samples for Analysis Blood samples for analysis of upadacitinib plasma concentrations will be collected from subjects at select sites throughout the treatment period on the study days and time points specified in Operations Manual Section 2.1. At Week 2 and Week 8 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample will be collected at any time during the visit. For all PK samples, the date and accurate time of the PK sample collection will be recorded on the lab requisition form. The date and accurate time the last two study drug doses will be recorded on the eCRF to the nearest minute.

Samples will be retained while research on upadacitinib (or drugs of this class) or AD and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement. Based on the value of different technologies, samples may also be used to assess other biomarker signatures, including but not limited to epigenetic, metabolomics, lipidomics, and other applications. The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the clinical study report. 6 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Complaints and Adverse Events Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device. Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to AbbVie. Product Complaint A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s). For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues. Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event. Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion. Page 55 of 138"

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study drug, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. Elective surgery will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. If any of the following events are reported, then the following supplemental form must be completed. Page 56 of 138"

Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. In addition, SAEs and protocol-specified nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the study-specific informed consent. AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product in accordance with global and local requirements. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend or risk to subjects. Adverse Events of Special Interest The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study: !Serious infections !Opportunistic infections !Herpes zoster !Active Tuberculosis !Malignancy (all types) !Adjudicated Gastrointestinal perforations Page 58 of 138"

If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be graded as follows: Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Moderate (Grade 2) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental ADL Severe (Grade 3 - 5) Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL (Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden) Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death related to AE The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug: Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated.""

Product complaints associated with AEs will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. For subjects who discontinued study drug but continued study participation and are on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab) and any intolerability to standard of care therapies should be managed by the prescribing physician. Management of Serious Infections Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or a serious opportunistic infection. A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated. Subjects who develop active TB must be permanently discontinued from study drug. Management of Herpes Zoster If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the episode resolves. Management of Serious Gastrointestinal Events Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment. If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug. Management of Thrombosis Events Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug. Management of Malignancy Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix must be discontinued from the study drug. Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Periodic skin examination is recommended for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Management of ECG Abnormality Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug, OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec, OR > 450 msec in adolescents, OR a change of QTc interval > 60 msec from the baseline.

Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Section 6.2, and may require a supplemental eCRF to be completed (see Section 6.1[Complaints and Adverse Events]). All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution. If a repeat test is required per Table 3 , the repeat testing must occur as soon as possible. Table 3. Specific Toxicity Management Guidelines for Abnormal Laboratory Values Laboratory Parameter Toxicity Management Guideline Hemoglobin ! If hemoglobin < 8 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new sample ! If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline, without an alternative etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by repeat testing with new sample. ! If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from baseline and an alternative etiology is known, the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion. ! If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to normal reference range or its baseline value. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)! If confirmed < 1000/μ L by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its baseline value. ! Discontinue study drug if confirmed < 500/ μL by repeat testing with new sample. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC)! If confirmed < 500/μ L by repeat testing with new sample, interrupt study drug dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its baseline value. Total white blood cell count !

Interrupt study drug immediately if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat testing with new sample and either a total bilirubin > 2 × ULN or an international normalized ratio > 1.5. ! A separate blood sample for INR testing will be needed to measure INR at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST. A repeat test of INR is not needed for determination if above toxicity management criteria are met. ! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 3 × ULN by repeat testing with new sample along with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5% increase from baseline). ! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 8 × ULN by repeat testing with new sample. ! Interrupt study drug if confirmed ALT or AST > 5 × ULN by repeat testing with new sample for more than 2 weeks. ! For subjects with HBc Ab+ (irrespective of HBs Ab status) and negative HBV DNA at screening who develop the following should have HBV DNA by PCR testing performed within 1 week: ! ALT > 5 × ULN OR; ! ALT or AST > 3 × ULN if an alternate cause is not readily identified ! A separate blood sample for HBV DNA PCR testing will be needed at the time of repeat testing for ALT or AST. As with INR, a separate tube is needed. A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study drug (unless not acceptable by local practices) and a hepatologist consultation should occur within 1 week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment. Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate. The investigator should contact the AbbVie TA SD to discuss the management of a subject when an alternative etiology has been determined. The alternative etiology should be documented appropriately in the eCRF; study drug should be discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found. For any confirmed ALT or AST elevations > 3 ULN, complete the appropriate supplemental hepatic eCRF(s). Serum Creatinine ! If serum creatinine is > 1.5 × the baseline value and > ULN, repeat the test for serum creatinine (with subject in an euvolemic state) to confirm the results. If the results of the repeat testing still meet this criterion then interrupt study drug and re-start study drug once serum creatinine returns to ≤ 1.5 × baseline value and ≤ ULN. ! If confirmed serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dL, interrupt study drug and re- start study drug once serum creatinine returns to normal reference range or its baseline value.

The DMC members consist of two clinicians and one biostatistician with one clinician being an expert in the management of subjects with AD. The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safety of the subjects participating in this study. A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. An independent committee of physician experts in cardiovascular adjudication will be utilized to assess potential cardiovascular and thromboembolic AEs in a blinded manner as defined by the CAC charter. 6.4 Other Safety Data Collection Specific manifestations of AD (i.e., itching, excoriations, oozing, crusting, erythema, etc.) should not be reported as individual AEs if they are considered to be a worsening of the underlying disease; instead, worsening of atopic dermatitis should be reported as the AE. 6.5 SUSAR Reporting AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines and Appendix A of the Investigator Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI).

For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness. 7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans The objective of the statistical analyses is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib for the treatment of adolescent and adult subjects with moderate to severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. For ease of description, the DB Period refers to Week 0 – 16, and the Blinded Extension Period refers to the rest of the study. The Primary Analysis of the main study for all efficacy endpoints pertaining to the DB Period (including the primary efficacy endpoints) will be conducted after all continuing subjects in the main study have completed the study activities up to Week 16 and all data pertaining to the DB Period are cleaned. This is the one and final efficacy analysis for the DB Period of the main study. After the Primary Analysis of the main study, an additional analysis of the main study will be conducted when the required safety exposure target is reached. In addition, a Week 52 analysis of the main study will be performed after all ongoing subjects complete the Week 52 visit. Furthermore, the Primary Analysis for the adolescent population (including the adolescent subjects from the main study and the adolescent sub-study) will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have completed Week 16, and all data pertaining to the DB Period are cleaned. An additional analysis of the adolescent population will be conducted after all ongoing adolescent subjects have provided at least 1 year of upadacitinib exposure. The Type-I error control will be applied to the Primary Analysis of the main study. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the entire study. The statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized prior to the blind break and database lock for the Primary Analysis. The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). 7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populations: !The ITT Population (ITT) consists of all subjects who are randomized in the overall study. !The ITT Population for the main study (ITT_M) consists of all subjects who are randomized in the main study. !The ITT Population for adolescents (ITT_A) consists of all adolescent subjects who are randomized in the main study or the adolescent sub-study. Subjects who are randomized to placebo in the DB Period and do not continue into the Blinded Extension Period will be excluded from the analysis in the Blinded Extension Period. Page 67 of 138"

Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment as randomized. Per Protocol Population:A Per-Protocol Population for the main study (PP_M) will be defined to exclude subjects with major protocol violations. The criteria to define the Per-protocol Population will be detailed in the SAP. Subjects to be excluded from the Per-Protocol Population will be finalized before database lock and blind break. The PP_M Population will be used to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint. Safety Populations: !The Safety Population in the DB Period (Safety_DB) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the overall study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the overall study during the Blinded Extension Period. !The Safety Population for the main study in the DB Period (Safety_DB_M) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population for the main study in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE_M) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study during the Blinded Extension Period. !The Safety Population for adolescents in the DB Period (Safety_DB_A) consists of all randomized adolescent subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study or the adolescent sub-study during the DB Period. !The Safety Population for adolescents in the Blinded Extension Period (Safety_BE_A) consists of all randomized adolescent subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the main study or the adolescent sub-study during the Blinded Extension Period. In all safety analyses, subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received regardless of randomization. Cross-period summaries will be provided for subjects initially randomized to the two upadacitinib groups. In addition, the following populations will provide comprehensive summaries: !The All Upadacitinib Treated Population (ALL_UPA) consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib in the overall study. !The All Upadacitinib Treated Population for the main study (ALL_UPA_M) consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib in the main study. !The All Upadacitinib Treated Population for adolescents (ALL_UPA_A) consists of all adolescent subjects who received at least 1 dose of upadacitinib in the main study or the adolescent sub-study.

The efficacy analysis for adolescents will be conducted in the ITT_A Population. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the PP_M Population. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. In the DB Period, categorical variables will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by vIGA-AD categories and age (adolescent vs. adult) in the ITT_M Population, and stratified by vIGA-AD categories and study portion (main study vs. adolescent sub-study) in ITT_A Population.Continuous variables will be analyzed using mixed effect model with repeated measures (MMRM). In the DB Period, missing values and visits after the rescue will be handled by non-responder imputation (NRI) for categorical variables or MMRM for continuous variables. Assessments of long-term efficacy (across the DB and Blinded Extension Periods) for subjects who stay on treatment will be summarized by Observed Case approach at each visit. No missing data imputation will be applied, and all assessments prior to premature discontinuation from study drug will be used. Primary Analysis of Efficacy The co-primary endpoints for the efficacy are: !Proportion of subjects achieving at least an EASI 75 from Baseline at Week 16; !Proportion of subjects achieving vIGA-AD of 0 or 1 with at least two grades of reduction from baseline at Week 16. Comparison of the primary endpoints will be made between each upadacitinib group and the placebo group In ITT_M Population using the CMH test, adjusting for vIGA-AD categories and age (adolescent vs. adult; main study). NRI will be the primary approach, with MI and tipping point analysis as the sensitivity approach to handle missing values. The primary endpoints will also be evaluated in the PP_M Population. Sample Size Estimation Approximately 810 adolescent and adult subjects will be randomized to upadacitinib 30 mg, upadacitinib15 mg, or placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1 in the main study (270 subjects per treatment group). The sample size is determined by the regulatory requirement to adequately characterize the safety profile. Assuming an EASI 75 response rate of 15%, and vIGA-AD 0 or 1 with at least a 2-point reduction response rate of 10% in the placebo arm, this sample size will also provide more than 90% power to detect the treatment differences of 32% and 21%, respectively, for the above two endpoints simultaneously using two-sided test at a 0.05 significant level. The assumptions of placebo response rates for EASI 75 and IGA-AD 0/1 were based on the maximum placebo rate in upadacitinib AD Phase 2b study and dupilumab Phase 3 monotherapy studies (SOLO 1 and SOLO 2). The graphic approach for controlling multiplicity will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Page 69 of 138"

This sample size was determined to ensure a total of 225 subjects per dose across 3 pivotal studies will provide 1 year of data. 7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety The safety analyses will be carried out using the safety populations in the DB Period, the Blinded Extension period, and across both periods, and will be based on treatments the subjects actually received. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. Note that missing safety data will not be imputed. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP. AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). TEAEs are defined as those that began or worsened in severity after the first dose of study drug but within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the investigator. Summaries (including percentages and events per 100 patient-years) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation and AESIs will be provided as well. Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately. For laboratory and vital signs, mean change from Baseline and percentage of subjects with evaluations meeting criteria for pre-defined Potentially Clinically Significant values will be summarized. 7.5 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and summarized with appropriate statistical methods. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses (using the available PK data from the subjects from whom the PK samples will be collected) will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with non-linear mixed effects modeling software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK analysis of data from previous studies. The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models. 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s). Page 70 of 138"

The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error. Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated by the posterior conditional estimation technique using non-linear mixed effects modeling. The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P < 0.005, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non-linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will be explored. For the same subjects from whom the PK samples will be collected, relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy variable) will be explored. Exposure-response relationships for secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored. The relationship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model-predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored. Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, E max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be evaluated to characterize the exposure-response relationship based on observed data. Results of the pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of AD, rather than in the Clinical Study Report. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 7.6 Interim Analysis There will be no efficacy or futility interim analyses. Safety data will be reviewed by an external DMC as described in Section 6.3. 8 ETHICS 8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all subject materials will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval.

The documentation related to the system validation of the ePRO system is available through the vendor, CRF Health; while the user acceptance testing of the study-specific patient reported outcome design will be conducted and maintained at AbbVie. The subject will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded to a server. The data on the server will be considered source, and maintained and managed by CRF Health. Daily Worst Pruritus NRS, daily and weekly ADerm-SS, and daily and weekly ADerm-IS ePROs will be collected from subjects electronically every evening via a handheld device provided to the subject at Screening. Handheld device usage stops at the Week 16 visit. The handheld electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry once per day. Starting at the Week 16 visit, Daily Worst Pruritus NRS, ADerm-SS, and ADerm-IS ePROs will be collected electronically via an onsite tablet device into which the subject will directly enter the required pieces of information at visits specified in the Operations Manual Section 2.1 (Individual Treatment Period Visit Activities). The ePRO data of CDLQI, DLQI, HADS, POEM, PGIS, PGIT, PGIC, EQ-5D-5L, and patient-reported items from SCORAD will be collected electronically via an onsite Page 72 of 138"

The electronic tablet device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for subjects to complete more than one of the same assessments at any one visit. All data entered on the devices will be immediately stored to the devices itself and automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by CRF Health. The investigator and delegated staff will be able to access all uploaded subject entered data via a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the study archive. Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by CRF Health for the duration of the study. This access will be available for the duration of the study to the site investigator, as well as delegated personnel. Such access will be removed from investigator sites following the receipt of the study archive. Data from the ePRO system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data. It will be possible for the investigator to make paper print-outs from that media. Photography Photography data will be collected from subjects at select sites who consent to participate in the Photography sub-study and are considered eligible to be enrolled in this study. Subjects that consent to participate will be asked to have photographs taken of their disease response during the study. The photographs will be taken as outlined in Appendix D , Activity Schedule and in the Operations Manual Section 2.1. The cameras for the photographs will be standardized and supplied to the sites by a central photography service. The photography data on the server will be considered source; and maintained and managed by the vendor. Training and detailed instructions will be provided by the central photography service. 10 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE AbbVie will ensure that the clinical trial is conducted with a quality management system that will define quality tolerance limits in order to ensure human subject protection and reliability of study results. Data will be generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 11 COMPLETION OF THE STUDY The end-of-study is defined as the date of the last subject's last visit. 12 REFERENCES 1.

EASI score does not include a grade for dryness or scaling. Assignments for the following body regions are as follows: !Head and Neck !Trunk: (including the genital area) !Upper Extremities !Lower Extremities (including the buttocks) Area Score Area score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The area score is the percentage of skin affected by eczema. Area score Percentage of skin affected by eczema in each region: !0 = no eczema in this region !1 = 1% – 9% !2 = 10% – 29% !3 = 30% – 49% !4 = 50% – 69% !5 = 70% – 89% !6 = 90% – 100%: the entire region is affected by eczema Severity Score Severity score is recorded for each of the four regions of the body. The severity score is the sum of the intensity scores for four signs. The four signs are: 1. Redness (erythema, inflammation) 2. Thickness (induration, papulation, swelling – acute eczema) 3. Scratching (excoriation) Page 132 of 138"

Lichenification (lined skin, prurigo nodules – chronic eczema) The average intensity of each sign in each body region is assessed as: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) and severe (3). Score Intensity of redness, thickness/swelling, scratching, lichenification: 0 = None, absent 1 = Mild 2 = Moderate 3 = Severe For each region, record the intensity for each of four signs and calculate the severity score.Severity score = redness intensity + thickness intensity + scratching intensity + lichenification intensityFor each region, multiply the severity score by the area score and by a multiplier. !Head and neck: severity score × area score × 0.1 !Trunk: severity score × area score × 0.3 !Upper limbs: severity score × area score × 0.2 !Lower limbs: severity score × area score × 0.4 Add up the total scores for each region to determine the final EASI score. The minimum EASI score is 0 and the maximum EASI score is 72. Page 133 of 138"
