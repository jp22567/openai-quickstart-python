Rationale for use of etrasimod in Treatment of Pyoderma Gangrenosum Histopathol ogy of ulcerative Pyoderma Gangrenosum (PG) is characterized by a dense dermal infiltrate composed mainly of neutrophils in biopsy from the central area of ulceration, and a mainly lymphocytic infiltrate with thrombosis of vessels and extravasated erythroc ytes in biopsy from the border of the ulcer2. In patients with ulcerative PG the number of T -lymphocytes are significantly higher at the wound edg e compared to the wound bed. In contrast, neutrophils are significantly more numerous in the wound bed than the wound edge3. This suggests that activated T-lymphocytes at the wound edge could promote ulcer formation. Further support for T-cell involvement in the disease comes from observations in PG patients tha t are characterized by an over-expression in the blood of the CD4+CCR5+ and CD4+CCR6+ and a down-regulati on of CD4+CCR4+ counts with respect to healthy subjects4. In addition, a differentiated profile for etrasimod compared to other S1P modulators for the treatment of PG could arise from the hypothesis that S1P 4as well as S1P 1receptor agonis mcould aid in neutrophil trafficking5. Together, this evidence suggests that T -lymphocytes can play a role in PG and that reduction of lymphocytes by S1P 1modulators like etrasimod may represent a novel therapeutic approach in PG. Objectives: Efficacy •To evaluate the efficacy of etrasimod in patients with PG over a 12- week treatment period. Safety •To assess the safety and tolerability of etrasimod in patients with PG over a 12- week treatment period. Study DesignThis is aPhase 2a, open label, proof -of-concept clinical study to assess the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with PG. The trial will include adult patients 18-80 years of age with active PG ulcers."

Clinical Trial Pro tocol: APD334 -011 08 Februar y 2017 Confidential Page 17of 671INTRODUCTION Etrasimod (APD 334) is an orally available, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist. S1P is a signaling sphingolipid required by lymphocytes to exit the lymphoid tissue and enter the bloodstream via a chemotactic gradient. The S1P 1receptor is a physiological mediator which has been shown to regulate lymphocyte recirculation between lymphoid tissue and blood. Binding and internalization of the S1P 1receptor may result in lymphocyte retention within lymphoid tissue, with subsequent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count and lymphocyte availability for recruitment to sites of inflammation. S1P1receptor surface expression is required for S1P gradient -mediated lymphocyte migration out of lymphoid tissue into the circulatio n1. PG is considered to be a rare disorder associated with inflammation, mainly characterized by large skin ulcers2, 3. The ulcers are known to break down at a rapid rate and are painful ,often turning necro tic6. Other inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disorder (IBD) , ulcerative colitis (UC) and Bechet’s disease are indicated to share the same clinicopathophysiology7. PG was considered to have a parallel relationship with other underlying disease s (e.g.,UC, IBD) with PG being the cutaneous manifestatio n 8, however this was refuted by Driesch9and published data support consideration of PG as an independent disease , irrespective of underlying disorders . Based upon U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health's Office of Rare Disease Research, the incidence of PG has been estimated that each year in the United States, 1 person per 100,000 people is affected10.The incidence peak occurs between the ages of 20 to 50 years, with women being more often affected than men11. Diagnosis of PG is reliant on clinical signs, exclusion principle and supported by histopathology of the biopsy11, 12. The histopathology can differ dependent on the timing (early stage -mild to moderate perivascular lymphocyti c infiltrate; late-stage necrosis with dense lymphocytic infiltration along with involvement of blood vessels) and site of biopsy6. The diagnosis using clinical signs alone has been shown historically to lead to misdiagnoses as PG for at least 6 categories including vascular occlusive or venous disease, vasculitis, cancer, infectious disease, exogenous tissue injury and drug reactions 12, and support of exclusion and histopathology is recommended for diagnosis . Treatment options The best documented treatments are systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporin A. Combinations of steroids with cytotoxic drugs are used in resistant cases. The combination of steroids with sulfa drugs or immunosuppressants has been used as steroid - sparing modalities. In some cases ,anti-TNF therapy was reported to be beneficial which suggests that inhibition of TNF may help. Gevokizumab is a potent IL-1 beta monoclonal antibody with unique allosteric modulating properties and has the potential to treat patients with a wide variety of inflammatory and other diseases. Gevokizumab binds strongly to interleukin- 1 beta (IL -1 beta), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and modulates the cellular signaling events that produce inflammation. This agent was being developed as a potential treatment for PG but development was discontinu ed in 2016."

Lymphocyte trafficking agents such as natalizumab and vedolizumab, both injectable or infused therapies, have demonstrated efficacy in IBD indications. More recently, ozanimod, an S1P 1oral receptor modulator ,showed promising results in a Phase 2 study for UC14. The availability of lymphocyte trafficking agents such as etrasimod would offer patients an additional, oraltreatment for PG. 1.1 Background Information 1.1.1 Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study Agonists of the S1P 1receptor block lymphocyte migration out of the lymph tissue through internalization of the receptor, resulting in a sequestration of lymphocytes15. Recen t clinical development of S1P 1receptor agonists and the resulting lymphocyte sequestration have potential for treating multiple autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis, IBD and psoriasis. Fingolimod was the first drug in this class to be approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis16.More recently the S1P 1 receptor agonist ponesimod was observed to reduce the severity of chronic plaque psoriasis after chronic oral administration in a Phase 2 randomized clinical trial17.In this study, ponesimod was associated with dyspnea, elevated liver enzymes, bradycardia, headache and dizziness. Furthermore, S1P 1agonists (F TY720, SEW2871) have been observed to have an anti-inflammatory impact on the production of IL-12 family cytokines, indicating therapeutic potential for S1P treatment of several inflammatory diseases like psoriasis18.Importantly, a recent report demonstrating S1P 4agonists inhibit ion ofplasmacytoid dendritic cell activation and interferon -alpha production suggest a potential therapeutic role for S1P 1/S1P 4agonists like etrasimod in paradoxical psoriasis19. In addition to the potential anti-inflammatory benefits of systemic lymphocyte immunomodulation, S1P is known to exert anti-proliferative effects in human keratinocytes20,and inhibits dendritic cell migration21.Thus, the potential role of S1P receptor modulation in skin EIMs of IBD might involve both systemic and local epidermal mechanisms. Histopathology of ulcerative PG is characterized by a dense dermal infiltrate composed mainly of neutrophils in biopsy from the central area of ulceration, and a mainly lymphocytic infiltrate with thrombosis of vessels and extravasated erythrocytes in biopsy from the border of the ulcer2. In patients with ulcerative PG the number of T-lymphocytes are significantly higher at the wound edge compared to the wound bed. In contrast, neutrophils were significantly more numerous in the wound bed than the wound edge3. This suggests that activated T-lymphocytes at the wound edge could promote ulcer formation. Further support for T-cell involvement in the disease comes from observations in PG patients that are characterized by an over-expression in the blood of"

In addition, a differentiated profile for etrasimod compared to other S1P modulators for the treatment of PG could arise from the hypothesis that S1P 4as well as S1P 1receptor modulation could aid in neutrophil trafficking 5. Together, this evidence suggests that T-lymphocy tes can play a role in PG and that reduction of lymphocytes by S1P 1receptor modulators like etrasimod may represent a novel therapeutic approach in PG. The aim of the proposed clinical studyis to evaluate the role of S1P modulation in the setting of active cutaneous PG. Next generation S1Pmodulators such as etrasimod with improved side effect profiles may represent a novel therapy for PG patients. 1.1.2 Summary of Preclinical Data 1.1.2.1 Pharmacology 1.1.2.2 Nonclinical Safety"

The definitions of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be as given in the ICH Topic E2A, ICH Guideline “Note for Guidance on Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting.” The outcome of an AE will be defined according to ICH Topic E2B, ICH Guideline “Note for Guidance on Clinical Safety Data Management: Data Elements for Transmission of Individual Case Safety Reports.” The relationship to investigational product will be classified using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. 6.12.1 Adverse Event Reporting Patien ts will be instructed to report all AEs, which can be reported at any time. AEs that occur from ICF signature until the time of administration of the first dose of etrasimod will be regarded as ‘pre-treatment’ and recorded as anAE.All events reported following study medication administration up to 30 days after the last medication intake will be presented as treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) . Monitoring ofongoing AEs will be continued up to 2 weeks after study medication administration. For this study, an AE is defined as: “Any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient administ ered etrasimod which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with thistreatment.” An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the product.

Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and symptoms should be recorded as a unifying diagnosis (e.g., self-limited fever, runny nose, cough, and scratchy throat should be captured as an upper respiratory infection rather than by the individual signs and symptoms). AEs may also be reported at any time. The type and duration of follow -up of patient s after AEs will be documented. 6.12.1.1 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) A patient with multiple sclerosis developed PML after nearly 8 months of treatment with another S1P 1agonist31, and enablement of the John Cunningham (JC) virus is therefore a potential adverse effect of this therapeutic class. Patients in this trial shou ld therefore be monitored for any new onset or worsening of neurologi cal signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. The progression of deficits usually leads to death or severe disability over weeks or months. If PML is suspected, withhold dosing and refer to a neurologist; if confirmed, discontinue dosing permanently. The investigator or sub-investigator will administer the subjective PML checklist during screening to exclude patients with positive responses from enrolling into the study. The subjecti ve PML checklist will be administered at each site visit (except D-1) to probe for symptoms suggestive of PML. Any patients reporting signs and/or symptoms of PML will undergo objective testing and must be referred to a neurologist for a full evaluation. A copy of the PML checklist is provided in Appendix 1 . 6.12.2 Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events AnSAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in the following outcomes: •Death •Is Life -Threatening •Requi red/Prolonged Hospitalization •Disability/Incapacity •Congenital Anomaly/Birth Defect •Important Medical Event SAEs will be captured from the time of ICF signature to 30 days after the last dose of study drug, and will be monitored until resolution or stabili zation. An important medical event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at"

Elective hospitalization and/or surgery for clearly pre-existing conditions (for example a surgery that has been scheduled prior to the patient’s entry into the study) will not be reported as a SAE. All other hospitalizations, including elective hospitalizations for any condition that was not pre -existing, will be reported as a SAE. Any AE considered serious by the investigator or which meets SAE criteria must be reported to PPD Pharmacovigilance (PVG) within 24hours from the time study site personnel first learn about the event. The following contact information is to be used for SAE reporting: EMEA ASIA Safety Central Mailbox : Or alternatively: PPD Medical Affairs/Pharmacovigilance PPD PVG Hotline: (United Kingdom number) PPD PVG Fax line: (United Kingdom number) A full description of every SAE will need to be provided to PPD PVG (this may be supported by source documentation such as laboratory reports or a discharge summary should the patient be hospitalized). Other safety issues as defined in ICH Topic E2A, 21 code of federal regulations (CFR) §312.32, and EU Eudralex Volume 10 also qualify for expedited reporting. In these situations , the process will be as detailed for SAEs above: •SAEs which could be associated with the trial procedures; •SAEs and AEs of special interest that could materially influence the benefit-risk assessment of a medicinal product, such as: a clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the investigator brochure. 6.12.2.1 Patient and Patient- partner Pregnancy Patients who become pregnant during the study will be discontinued immediately. Although not considered a nSAE or AE, pregnancies occurring during the period of study drug administration (Day 1 to Week 12) until 30 days after the last dose of study drug should be reported to the sponsor contact andIECin the same manner as a nSAE. Pregnancies will be followed every trimester thro ugh the first well baby visit.

When recording the outcome of the AE the maximum severity of the AE experienced will also be recorded. The severity of the AE will be graded according to the CTCAE v4. 0332 definitions, listed below: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.

Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL**. Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to AE. Activities of Daily Living: *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. 6.12.4 Assessment of Adverse Event Relationship to Study Medicati on The relationship of an AE to investigational product(s) will be classified using modified WHO criteria (Edwards and Biriell, WHOCollaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring 1994) as follows : Related : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal. Re-challenge information is not required to fulfill this definition; or an event that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals where information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not related : a c linical event, including laboratory test abnorm ality, with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to drug administration (e.g., no temporal relationship to drug administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigati on shows that the drug was not administered; proof of other cause; etc.); or an event with a temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide plausi ble explanations."
