SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A Phase IV, 12 week, randomised , double-blind, double dummy study to compare single inhaler triple therap y, fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) ,with tiotropium monotherapy based on lung function and sy mptoms in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Short Title:A randomisedstudy, comparing FF/UMEC/VI single inhaler triple therap y versus tiotropium monotherap y in participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)guidelines advocate the use of long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA)added to the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a long-acting β 2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABA) as second line therap y for the most advanced patients with significant s ymptoms and a high risk of exacerbations. Regular treatment with ICS -containing regimens has been reported to improve respiratory symptoms, lung function, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduce the frequency ofCOPD exacerbations in patients with a forced expiratory flow in 1 second ( FEV1) <60% predicted . Population based studies of COPD treatment patterns demonstrate that ‘open’triple therapy (use of ICS/LAMA/L ABA delivered via multiple inhalers) is already widely used in the real -life management of COPD. In 2011, 26 % of patients in the United States ( US) who were taking controller medicines for the treatment of COPD were taking an ‘open’ triple therap y, typically by adding fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (ICS/LABA) to tiotropium (L AMA) or vice versa A s tudy in the United Kingdom ( UK)Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) revealed that over a two -year period of time, 35 % of COPD patients initially prescribed a LAMA and 39 % initially prescribed an ICS/LABA stepped up to an ‘open’triple therapy regimen. In the four -year long-term safet y study conducted with tiotropium, 46 % of patients were receiving a concurrent fixed combination of ICS/LABA in addition to tiotropium. A number of studies have assessed the use of an ‘open’triple therapy of fluticas one propionate/salmeterol or budesonide/formoterol (ICS/L ABA) with tiotropium in moderate-severe COPD patients. These studies have reported greater improvements in lung function, HRQoL, hospitalization rates and rescue medication use, compared to dual (ICS/LABA) or LAMA alone, thus supporting the use of triple therapy in COPD .These studies have also shown that the number and t ype of reported adverse events (AE) were generally similar with administration of dual or monotherap y doses for periods of up to one year, and were mostly related to their pharmacological mode of action. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is currentl y developing a once -daily ‘closed’triple therapy of a ICS/LAMA/LABA combination [ fluticasone furoate (FF)/ umeclidinium (UMEC)/ vilanterol (VI) (100/62.5/25 mcg)] in a single inhaler, with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of s ymptomatic COPD patients at risk for exacerbations which will reduce the exacerbation frequency , allow for a reduced burden of polypharmacy , convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in lung function, HRQoL and s ymptom control over established dual/monotherapies. 2019N398531_00"
10,page_10,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 11GSK conducted a Phase III study comparing once -daily FF/UMEC/VI to twice -daily budesonide/formoterol (400/12 mcg) in COPD participants that were s ymptomatic and at risk of an exacerbation despite receiving maintenance therapy (CTT116853). FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV 1, a statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, and a statistically significant reduction of COPD sy mptoms (using Exacerbations and Chronic Pulmonary Disease –Respiratory Symptoms [ EXACT-RS]) when compared to budesonide/formoterol. Additionally , clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ)total score were observed, with a statistically significant improvement compared to budesonide/formoterol. This Phase III study provided compelling efficacy data compared with an establ ished ICS/LABA and demonstrated the clinical value of single inhaler triple-therapy compared to I CS/LABA therapy in patients with COPD. As fixed dose combinations of LAMA/LABA therap y remain relativel y new, and ICS monotherap y is not indicated for the tre atment of COPD, the two most frequent treatment pathways that lead to ‘open’ triple therapy are the escalation of therap y from either an ICS/LABA fixed dose combination or from LAMA monotherap y.A prior study demonstrated that participants with COPD may remain symptomatic despite the use of LAMA or LABA monotherap y.Participants that remain edsymptomatic despite treatment with LAMA monotherapy , steppedup to ‘open’ triple therap y by the addition of ICS/LABA therap y, which resulted in greater improvements inlung function and HRQoL, compared LAMA monotherapy . The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate lung function and HRQoLafter 84 day s of treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of FF/ UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg) once daily via the E LLIPTA™compared with tiotropium (18mcg) once daily, in a patient population appropriate for triple therapy .

12,page_12,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 13Study design schema Eligible participants at Screening (Visit 1) will be current or former smoke rs, with an established clinical history of COPD, receiving daily maintenance therap y with tiotropium alone for at least 3 months (no I CS or LABA maintenance therapy is allowed during the 3 months prior to screening), with a post- bronchodilator FEV 1of <50% predicted (or <80 % predicted with a documented history of at least 2 moderate or 1 severe [hospitalized] exacerbation in the last 12 months) and a CAT score of 10. Participants will be requested to participate in the study for approximately 17 weeks, consisting of a 4 -week run-in period, 12-week treatment period and a 1- week follow -up period. Pre-screening: Details about the study and procedures will be explained through the informed consent process. The Pre-screening Visit (Visit 0 ), including the in formed consent process, must be completed prior to an y protocol-required changes to a participant’s usual COPD treatment and the initiation of any Visit 1 procedures. Participants will continue treatment with their regular (i.e. pre -study) tiotropium monot herapy during the pre -screening period. Screening/run- in: Eligible participants will be allowed to continue their usual tiotropium monotherapy COPD medication until the day before Screening, Visit 1. On the morning of the Screening Visit participants will refrain from taking their morning dose of tiotropium . Participants who meet all of the eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening), will enter the 4 -week run-in period. Participants will discontinue existing tiotropium medication and will take open- labeltiotropium 18 mcgvia the HandiHaler once daily plus placebo via the ELLIPTA. Participants will not use any other COPD medications (except for those allowed per protocol). 2019N398531_00"
13,page_13,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 14During the run-in period participants will also take placebo via the ELLIPTA in addition to open -label tiotropium. This will familiarise participants with the use of the ELLIPTA device and will help ensure participants are compliant and use both devices as instructed. Participants will be provided with short -acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on an as-needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study . At Screening, each participant will be instructed on the proper use of the ELLIPTA and HandiHaler and will self -administer their first doses of their run -in treatment during the Scr eening Visit. On the morning of the other study visits (Visit 2 onwards), participants will refrain from taking their morning dose of stud y treatment until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. Randomi sation/treatment: On the morning of the day before the Randomisation Visit(Visit 2), participants will take their last dose of run-in treatment and will not use an y other COPD medications (except for those allowed per protocol. Rescue albuterol/salbutamol can be used throughout the study as-needed but mu st be withheld for at least 4 hours prior to conducting spirometry . At Visit 2 (the Randomisation Visit), participants who meet all of the randomisation criteriawill be randomised 1:1 to receive one the following double-blind study treatments for 84 day s: FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA once dail y in the morning + placebo to match tiotropium via HandiHaler once daily in the morning Tiotropium 18 mcg via HandiHaler once dail y in the morning + placebo via the ELLIPTA once dail y in the morning Participants may continue their study -supplied rescue albuterol/salbutamol. On the morning of Visits 3 and4, participants will refrain from taking their morning dose of study treatment until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. At Visits 2, 3,and4 participants will self -administer study treatment whilst at the clinic. Participants will take their last dose of stud y treatment in the clinic on Day 84 and then return to the clinic on Day 85 (Visit 5) for their final clinical assessments. Participants are expected on non -clinic visit day s to take their study treatment at home in the morning at approximately the same time each day, as directed b y the clinic. Safety/follow -up: A safety follow-up telephone contact or clinic studyvisit (Visit 6) will be condu cted approximately 7 days after the participant completes all of the protocol -defined procedures for V isit 5/End of Study (EOS)or, if applicable, the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit. A participant will be considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the study including screening, run -in, the randomised treatment phase, and safety follow-up. 2019N398531_00"

The primary analysis is the comparison of this endpoint between FF/UMEC/VI and tiotropium. The null hy pothesis is that there is no difference between treatment groups. H0: T1 – T2 = 0 The alternative hy pothesis is there is a diffe rence between treatment groups. H1: T1 – T2 0 where T 1and T2are the treatment means for FF/UMEC/VI and TIO, respectively .

INTRODUCTION 3.1. Study Rationale Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) guidelines advocate the use of long- acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (LAMA) added to the combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a long-acting β 2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABA) as second line therap y for the most advanced patients with sign ificant symptoms and a high risk of exacerbations. Regular treatment with I CS-containing regimens has been reported to improve respiratory symptoms, lung function, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and reduce the frequency COPD exacerbation sin patients with a forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1) <60% predicted [Aaron, 2007;Cazzola, 2007; Hanania, 2012; Jung, 2012;Siler, 2015;Welte, 2009]. Population based studies of COPD treatment patterns demonstrate that ‘open’triple therapy (use of ICS/LAMA/L ABA delivered via multiple inhalers) is already widely used in the real -life management of COPD. In 2011, 26 % of patients in the United States ( US) who were taking controller medicines for the treatment of COPD were taking an ‘open’ triple therap y, typically by adding fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (ICS/LABA) to 2019N398531_00"
19,page_19,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 20tiotropium (L AMA) or vice versa [ Wolters, 2012]. A study in the United Kingdom ( UK) Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) revealed that over a two year period of time, 35% of COPD patients initially prescribed a LAMA and 39 % initially prescribed an ICS/LABA stepped up to an ‘open’triple therapy regimen [ Wurst, 2013]. In the four year long-term safet y study conducted with tiotropium, 46 % of patients were receiving a concurrent fixed combination of I CS/LABA in addition to tiotropium [ Tashkin, 2008]. A number of studies have assessed the use of an ‘open’triple therapy of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol or budesonide/formoterol (ICS/L ABA) with tiotropium in moderate-severe COPD patients. These studies have reported greater improvement s in lung function, HRQoL, hospitalization rates and rescue medication use, compared to dual (ICS/LABA) or LAMA alone, thus supporting the use of triple therapy in COPD [ Aaron, 2007;Cazzola, 2007; Hanania, 2012; Jung, 2012;Siler, 2015;Welte, 2009]. These studies have also shown that the number and t ype of reported adverse events (AE) were generally similar with administra tion of dual or monotherap y doses for periods of up to one year, and were mostly related to their pharmacological mode of action. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is currentl y developing a once -daily ‘closed’triple therapy of a ICS/LAMA/LABA combination [ fluticasone furoate (FF)/ umeclidinium (UMEC)/ vilanterol (VI) (100/62.5/25 mcg)] in a single inhaler, with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of s ymptomatic COPD patients at risk for exacerbations which will reduce the exacerbation frequenc y, allow for a reduced burden of polypharmacy , convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in lung function, HRQoL and s ymptom control over established dual/monotherapies. GSK conducted a Phase III study comparing once -daily FF/UMEC/VI to twic e-daily budesonide/formoterol (400/12 mcg) in COPD participants that were s ymptomatic and at risk of an exacerbation despite receiving maintenance therapy (CTT116853). FF/UMEC/VI demonstrated statistically significant improvements in trough FEV 1, a statistically significant reduction in the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations, and a statistically significant reduction of COPD sy mptoms (using Exacerbations and Chronic Pulmonary Disease –Respiratory Symptoms [ EXACT-RS]) when compared to bude sonide/formoterol. Additionally , clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ)total score were observed, with a statistically significant improvement compared to budesonide/formoterol [Lipson, 2017].This Phase III stud y provided compelling efficacy data compared with an established I CS/LABA and demonstrated the clinical value of single inhaler triple-therapy compared to ICS/LABA therapy in patients with COPD. As fixed dose combinations of LAMA/LABA therap y remain relativel y new, and ICS monotherap y is not indicated for the treatment of COPD, the two most frequent treatment pathways that lead to ‘open’ triple therapy are the escalation of therap y from either an ICS/LABA fixed dose c ombination or from LAMA monotherap y. A prior study demonstrated that patient swith COPD may remain sy mptomatic despite the use of LAMA or LABA monotherap y [Dransfield, 2011 ]. Patients that remained sy mptomatic despite treatment with LAMA monotherap y, stepped up to ‘open’ triple therap y by the addition of I CS/LABA therapy , which resulted in greater improvements in lung function 2019N398531_00"
20,page_20,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 21and HRQoL, compared LAMA monotherap y [Aaron, 2007; Cazzola , 2007; Hanania , 2012; Jung, 2012; Siler , 2015; Welte, 2009]. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate lung function and HRQoLafter 84 day s of treatment with a single inhaler triple therapy combination of FF/ UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg) once daily via the ELLIPTA compared withtiotropium (18mcg) once daily, in a patient population appropriate for triple therapy . 3.2. Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a progressive disease characterised by increasing obstruction to airflow and the progressive development of respiratory symptoms including ch ronic cough, increased sputum production, dy spnoea and wheezing. In 2011, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD, 2011] issued a guideline that outlined a new classification sy stem for COPD , using the ABCD assessment tool, which aimed to more comprehensively assess disease severity and guide therapychoice, ultimately improving COPD management .A 2013 update to the 2011 strategy included an additional criterion to characterise patients that have had a hospitalised exacerbation as high risk, regardless of GOLD status [ GOLD, 2013 ]. GOLD released a revised guideline in 2017 that separates spirometric grad ingfrom the determination of overall disease severity and choice of pharmacologic therap y (Table 1) [GOLD, 2017]. 2019N398531_00"

For milder patients (GOLD Group A), the guidelines encourage active risk reduction (e.g., smoking cessation and influenza vaccination) with the addition of bronchodilators. However, as disease severity increases, the guid elines recommend an incremental approach to pharmacological treatment, involving the use of combinations of drug classes with different or complementary mechanisms of action [ Celli, 2004; GOLD, 2017]. Long-actingbronchodilators (LAMAsor LABAs) have been shown to relieve sy mptoms, increase exercise capacity, improve health -related quality of life and reduce COPD exacerbations to a greater extent than short acting 2adrenergic receptor agonists . For advanced cas es, or those with repeated exacerbations, the incorporation of ICS or triple therapy, is recommended. 2019N398531_00"

In a study (CTT116853) in 1 810 randomised COPD participants treated with FF/UMEC/VI or budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) for up to 24 weeks ( Intent-To- Treat [ITT]Population), or up to 52 weeks (subset of 430 participants; EXT Population), the incidence of events in the pneumonia AEs of special interest (AESI) group was 2.2 % and 0.8 % for FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR, respectivel y in the ITT Population, and 1.9 % and 1.8 % for FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR, respectivel y, in the EXT Population. There was one fatal case of pneumonia in a participan t who received FF/UMEC/VI. The incidence of pneumonia with FF/UMEC/VI in this study was in line with the incidence of pneumonia seen in 24 week studies with F/VI (<1 -2% with FF/VI 100/25) and less than that observed in 52 week exacerbations studies with F F/VI (6% -Participants will be informed of the risk in the informed consent. -Investigators are informed of the risk in the IB -Investigators will be instructed to remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in participants with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the sy mptoms of COPD exacerbations.

Similarly, the incidence of pneumonia with FF/UMEC/VI was less than that observed in a 12 month exacerbation trial with BUD/FOR (6.4 %) [Sharafkhaneh, 2012]. Prior studies with FF/VI have demonstrated risk factors associated with a higher risk of pneumonia in participants with COPD (e.g., advanced age, poor lung function, low body mass index ( BMI), current smoking, and a prior history of pneumonia) [ Crim, 2009]. These risk factors were present in some participants with pneumonia in study CTT116853 with FF/UMEC/VI ; however, the low number of pneumonia events reported in this study precludes drawing any definite conclusions about risk factors. Theseriskfactors should be taken into consideration when using an I CS in participant s with COPD. Pneumonia risk will be important in the benefit -risk assessment for FF/UMEC/VI in COPD participant s, hence a robust risk mitigation strategy is being proposed. Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC)recently conducted an Article 31 review to evaluate the risk of pneumonia with use of ICS in participants 2019N398531_00"
25,page_25,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 26Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy with COPD. The PRAC review confirmed that COPD participants treated with ICS are at increased risk of pneumonia; however, the Committee’s view was that the benefits of ICS continue to outweigh their risks. The PRAC also looked whether there were an y differences in the risk of pneumonia between these produces, and did not find conclusive e vidence of such difference. Decreased bone mineral density and associated fractures Reduction in bone density, and the subsequent risk of fractures, is a known potential risk with corticosteroids. There may be a modest increase in risk of fracture among participants with COPD treated with ICS, but the results are not consistent across individual studies [ Christensson, 2008; Lehouck, 2011; Weldon , 2009]. In study CTT116853, the incidence of events in the decreased bone mineral densit y and associated fracture AESI group was low, with an incidence of 0.4 % and 0.7 % in the FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR treatment groups, respectively in the ITT Population up to 24 weeks and 0.5 % in both treatment groups in the EXT Population up to 52 weeks.

Adrenalsuppression Oral corticosteroids are known to have an effect on the h ypothalamic -pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis leading to reduction in cortisol production. Due to the low dose and low systemic exposure with ICS, this potential effect is not clear, nor is the possible impact of any change in cortisol. The effect of FF/UMEC/VI on cortisol levels has not been studie d. In study CTT116853, no events were reported in the adrenal suppression AESI group for FF/UMEC/VI and BUD/FOR. With respect to the FF/VI clinical development program me, a formal HPA study, using 24 -hour serum cortisol measurements, was performed. In addition, multiple studies with COPD (and asthma) participants monitored urinary cortisol. These studies did not show a clinicall y relevant effect of FF/VI 100/25 on the HPA axis.

In the ITT Population up to 24 weeks, one participant reported an event in the athma/bronchospasm AESI (PT ofwheezing in a participant on BUD/FOR; non -serious). There were no events reported in the EXT Population up to 52 weeks.-Participants will be informed about the risk in the informed consent. -Investigators are informed of the risk in the IB. -Instreamreview of blinded AE/SAE reports. 2019N398531_00"
34,page_34,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 353.3.2. Risk Assessment for Tiotropium Bromide 18mcg Tiotropium is a marketed drug that contains tiotropium bromide (18 mcg). A similar profile of undesirable effects as reported for anticholinergics (umeclidinium) may occur with tiotropium bromide. The most common drug related adverse reactions are pharmacologically predictable side effects for anti -cholinergic therap y, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, dizziness, headache and cough. Please refer to the authorised product label for further information on the risks of using Spiriva Handihaler. In this study, tiotropium will be used in line with the recommendations provided in the product label. Tiotropium is an anticholinergic, therefore the risk mitigation strategy for UMEC component of GSK2834425 will be applicable for tiotropium . 3.3.3. Benefit A ssessment GlaxoSmithKline is developing FF/UMEC/VI in a single inhaler, with the aim of providing a new treatment option for the management of sy mptomatic COP Dparticipants at risk for exacerbations which will reduce the exacerbation frequency , allow for a reduced burden of poly pharmacy , convenience, and increase the potential for improvement in lung function, HRQoL , and symptom control over established dual/monotherapies. Current risks have been identified for the FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg) combination based on the known pharmacology of the individual components, FF, UMEC, and VI , alone or in combination . These include key risks of pneumonia and bone disorders/fractures from ICS -containing combinations, and the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects from L AMAand/or LABA-containing combinations. In the US, the FF/VI combination is approved for the maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction and for reduction of exacerbations in COPD. The UMEC/VI combination is approved for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD. UMEC is indicated for the long -term, once -daily, maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in participant s with COPD. In the EU, the FF/VI combination is app roved for the sy mptomatic treatment of adults with COPD with an FEV 1<70% predicted normal (post- bronchodilaotr) with an exacerbation history despite regular bronchodilator therapy. The UMEC/VI combination is approved as a maintenance bronchodilator to r elieve symptoms in adult participants with COPD. UMEC is approved as a maintenance bronchodilator treatment to relieve symptoms in adult participant s with COPD. An appropriate safety monitoring strategy is being proposed for all risks associated with the FF/UMEC/VI combination, including the key risks (Section 3.3.1). Given the clinical experience with FF, UMEC, and VI, and that the associated risks with these compounds are anticipated from their known pharmacology , the potentia l benefit of a new therap y option in participants with moderate to severe COPD supports the further development of the closed triple combination. 2019N398531_00"

Overall Design This is a Phase IV, 12-week, randomised, double -blind,double-dummy, parallel group , multicent restudy evaluating once-dailysingle inhaler triple therapy (FF/UMEC/VI ) delivered via the ELLIPTA , compared to once daily tiotropium, in participants with COPD. Study design schema Eligible participants at Screening (Visit 1) will be current or former smokers, with an established clinical history of COPD, receiving daily maintenance therap y with tiotropium alone for at least 3 months (no I CS or LABA maintenance therapy is allowed during the 3 months prior to screening), with a post- bronchodilator FEV 1of <50% predicted (or <80 % predicted with a documented history of at least 2 moderate or 1 severe [hospitalized] exacerbation in the last 12 months) and a CAT score of 10. Participants will be requested to participate in the study for approximately 17weeks, consisting of a 4 -week run-in period, 12-week treatment period and a 1- week follow -up period. Pre-screening: Details about the study and procedures will be explained through the in formed consent process. The Pre-screening Visit (Visit 0 ), including the informed consent process, must be completed prior to an y protocol-required changes to a participant’s usual COPD treatment and the initiation of any Visit 1 procedures. Participants will continue treatment with their regular (i.e. pre -study) tiotropium monotherapy during the pre -screening period. 2019N398531_00"
38,page_38,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 39Screening/run- in: Eligible participants will be allowed to continue their usual tiotropium monotherapy COPD medication until the day before Screening(Visit 1). On the morning of the Screening Visit participants will refrain from taking their morning dose of tiotropium . Participants who meet all of the eligibility criteria at Visit 1, will enter the 4 -week run-in period. Participants will discontinue existing tiotropium medication and will take open- label tiotropium 18 mcg once dail yvia the HandiHaler plus placebo via the ELLIPTA. Participants will not use any other COPD medications (except for those allowed per protocol). During the run- in period participants will also take placebo via the ELLIPTA in addition to open -label tiotropium. This will familiarise participants with the use of the ELLIPTA device and will help ensure participants are compliant and use both devices as instructed. Participants will be provided with short-acting albuterol/salbutamol to be used on an as-needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study . At Screening, each participant will be instructed on the proper use of the ELLIPTA and HandiHaler and will self-administer their first dose sof their run -in treatment during the Screening Visit. On the morning of the other study visits (Visit 2 onwards), participants will refrain from taking their morning dose of stud y treatment until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. Randomi sation/treatment: On the morning of the day before the Randomisation Visit(Visit 2), participants will take their last dose of run-in treatment and will not use an y other COPD medications (except for those allowed per protocol) until the end of the study . Rescue albuterol/salbutamol can be used throughout the study as-needed but must be withheld for at least 4 hours prior to conducting spirometry . At Visit 2 (the Randomisation Visit), participants who meet all of the randomisation criteria(see Section 6.3)will be randomised 1:1 to receive one the following double -blind study treatments for 84 day s: FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA once dail y in the morning + placebo to match tiotropium via HandiHaler once daily in the morning Tiotropium 18 mcg via HandiHaler once dail y in the morning + placebo via the ELLIPTA once dail y in the morning Participants may continue their study -supplied rescue albuterol/salbutamol. On the morning of Visits 3 and4, participa nts will refrain from taking their morning dose of study treatment until instructed to do so by clinic personnel. At Visits 2, 3, and 4 participants will self -administer study treatment whilst at the clinic. Participants will take their last dose of stud y treatment in the clinic on Day 84 and then return to the clinic on Day 85 (Visit 5) for their final clinical assessments. Participants are expected on non -clinic visit day s to take their study 2019N398531_00"
39,page_39,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 40treatment at home in the morning at approximately the same time each day, as directed b y the clinic. Safety/follow -up: A safety follow-up telephone contact or clinic visit (V isit 6) will be conducted approximately 7 days after the participant completes all of the protocol-defined procedures for V isit 5/End of Study (EOS)or, if applicable, the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit. A participant will be considered to have completed the study when they have completed all phases of the stud y including screening, run -in, the randomised treatment phase, and safety follow-up. Participants who permanently discontinue double -blind study treatment are not required to withdraw from the study . Participants who have permanently discontinued study treatment and have not withdrawn consent are encouraged to continue in the study and complete all remaining protocol specified clinic visits (see Section 8.1). 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 848participants with advanced COPD will enter the run- in,in order to randomise approximately 780 participants, i n order to achieve an estimated 702 evaluble participants. See Section 10for further details. Approximately 100 centres globally will be required to recruit the study. 5.3. Participant and Study Completion A participantis considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed al l phases of the stud y including pre-screening, screening, run -in, the randomised treatment phase and the safet y follow-up. The end of the study is defined as the date of the lastscheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA)table (seeSection 2) forthe last participant in the trial globally. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multi center, randomised, double -blind,double-dummy, parallel - groupdesign. A placebo arm is not included because the primary comparison of interest is FF/UMEC/VI vs. tiotropium and it is not c onsidered appropriate to include a placebo arm in a study in patients with advanced COPD. Eligible participants must have been on daily maintenance tiotropium for at least 3 months, and those randomi sed to tiotropium will be essentially continuing their therapy prior to enrollment .Although LAMA monotherap y in severe patients is not designated a preferred treatment option, it continues to be listed as a treatment option for these patients (GOLD B or D) in the 2017 GOLD strategy document, and is commonly used in clinical practice .The 4-week run- in period is necessary in order to assess participant compliance with and ability to use all of the medications together and allow sufficient time for the results of screening assessments to be returned to the site, in order to establish participant eligibility . 2019N398531_00"
40,page_40,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 415.5. Dose Justification The FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg) dose was selected based on the doses that have beenlicensedfor COPD for the FF/VI (100/25 mcg) and UMEC/VI (62.5/25mcg) dual combinations through extensive studies in the mono and dual therap y programmes. It is the dose which is currently under regulatory review based on the Phase IIIa FF/UMEC/VI registration programme. The dose selected for tiotropium (18mcg, once daily ) is the dose licensed in the US for use in COPD . 6. STUDY POPULA TION Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollm ent criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 6.1.

41,page_41,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 42cigarettes per day / 20) x number of y ears smoked (e.g., 20 cigarettes per day for10 years, or 10 cigarettes per day for 20 years)]. Previous smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months p rior to Visit 1. Note : Pipeand/or cigar use cannot be used to calculate pack -year history . 7.Severity of COPD symptoms: A score of ≥10 on the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) at Screening (Visit 1). 8.Severity of Disease: Participants must demonstrate at Screening: oa post-bronchodilator FEV 1<50% predicted normal OR oa post-bronchodilator FEV 1<80% predicted normal and a documen ted historyof ≥2 moderate exacerbations or one severe (hospitalized) exacerbation in the previous 12 months Participants must also have a measured post albuterol/salbutamol FEV 1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of <0.70 at screening. Note: Percent predicted will be calculated using the European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations [ Quanjer, 2012]. Note: A documented history of a COPD exacerbation (e.g., medical record verification) is a medical re cord of worsening COPD symptoms that required systemic/oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (for a moderate exacerbation) or hospitalization (for a severe exacerbation). Prior use of antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history unless t he use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD, such as increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence (colour). Participant verbal reports are not acceptable. 9.Existing COPD maintenance treatment: participant must have beenreceiving dailymaintenance treatment with tiotropium alone (via the Handihaler or Respimat ) for their COPD for at least 3 months prior to Screening. Note: Participants takingonly as-neededtiotropium are not eligible. 6.2. Exclusion Criteria Participants are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply : 1.Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning on becoming pregnant during the study. 2.Asthma: Participants with a current diagnosis of asthma.

Participant s at potentially high risk for pneumonia (e.g. very low body mass index [BMI], severely malnourished, or very low FEV 1) will only be included at the discretion of the Investigator . 7.Pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbation that has not resolved at least 14 day s prior to Screening and at least 30 day s following the last dose of oral/systemic corticosteroids (if applicable). 8.Respiratory tract infect ion that has not resolved at least 7 day s prior to Screening. 9.Abnormal Chest x -ray: Chest x-ray (posteroanterior and lateral) reveals evidence of pneumonia or a clinically significant abnormality not believed to be due to the presence of COPD, or another c ondition that would hinder the ability to detect an infiltrate on chest x-ray(e.g. significant cardiomegal y, pleural effusion or scarring). All participants will have a chest x -ray at Screening Visit 1 (or historical radiograph or computerized tomography [CT]scan obtained within 3 months prior to screening). Note: Participants who have experienced pneumonia and/or moderate or severe COPD exacerbations within 3 months of screening must provide a post pneumonia/exacerbation chest X -ray or have a chest X -ray conducted at Screening. For sites in Germany: If a chest x -ray (or CT scan) within 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1) is not available, approval to conduct a diagnostic chest x -ray willneed to be obtained from the Federal Office for Radiation Prote ction (BfS). 10.Other diseases/abnormalities : Participants with historical or current evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psy chiatric, renal, hepatic, immunological, gastrointestinal, urogenital, nervous sy stem, musculoskeletal, skin, sensory, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thy roid disease) or haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the Investigator , would put the safet y of the participant atrisk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if thedisease/condition exacerbated during the stud y. 2019N398531_00"

Medical Devices The GSK ELLIPTA medical devic e will beprovided for use in this study . The other medical device (not manufactured b y or for GSK provided )for use in this study is the Handihaler . GSK medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be detected, documented, and reported by the investigator throughout the study. (see Section 9.2.10). 7.2. Dose Modification No dose modifications are planned for this study . 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomisation schedule. The randomisation code will be generated by using a validated computerised system. Participants will be randomised using an Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IWRS). The stud y will use central -based randomisation to allocate treatments. Once a randomisation number is assigned to a participant it cannot be reassigned to any other participantin the study . 7.4. Blinding This will be a double- blindstudy and the following will appl y. The Investigator or treating phy sician may unblind a participant ’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious medical c ondition when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant as judged b y the Investigator . Investigator s have direct access to the participant ’s individual study treatment. It is prefe rred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the participant ’s treatment assignment. If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the Investigator must notify GSK within 24 hours after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant , unless that information is important for the safety of participant s currentl y in the stud y. The date and event or c ondition which led to the unblinding (i.e. the primary reason)will be recorded in source documentation and in the eCRF. Should a participant’s treatment assignment be unblinded then the participant may continue the assigned study treatment and be followe d-up as per protocol until the completion of the Safety Follow-up assessments . 2019N398531_00"
51,page_51,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 52GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regul atory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant ’s treatment assignment, may be sent to Investigator s in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. Participants will not be withdrawn from the study. Masking of tiotropium and placebo to tiotropium capsules This study will usea double-dummy design for dosing, whereby participant s will be given twoinhalers (ELLIPTA and Handihaler) . All participants andsite personnel involved in efficacy andsafety assessments will be blinded to assigned treatment during the study. Tiotropium capsules have trademarkings that arenot present on the placebo capsules. This study has aparallel-group design which ensures the capsuletype will be consistent for e ach participantfor the duration of the study.In addition, tiotropium and placebo capsules will be closely matched in colour. Both the tiotropium and placebo blisterpackages w ill becovered with opaque over -labels with theintent of hiding the informatio n on the tiotropium packaging. The HandiHaler dry powder inhalers w ill be covered with labels to mask identify ing marks on the inhaler. Investigator and site personnel involved in efficacy and safet y assessments will be instructed not be present when a par ticipant administers his/her study medication at clinic visits, to guard against the possibility of personnel involved in the collection of efficacy and safety data, identifying thecapsules removed from the blisters . Sites are required to have study treatment dose d, dispensed and accounted for by site personnel that are not involved in any efficacy or safety assessments. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or adminis ter study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized site staff. The Investigator , institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Further guidanc e and information for the final disposition of unused stud y treatment are provided in the Study Reference Manual ( SRM). Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff. Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. I n the case of unintentional occupations exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. 2019N398531_00"

Treatment Compliance When participant sare dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the eCRF . The dose of study treatment and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the study site staff. When participant s self-administer study treatment(s) at home , compliance with study treatment will be assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and recording the number of doses remaining in the ELLIPTA and the number of capsules of tiotropium bromide (or matching placebo) dispensed and taken b y each participant, in the eCRF (see SRM for details). Participants who are non -compliant should be re -educated on the importance of treatment compliance. Every effort will be made to keep participants in the study and to re-educate those participants who continue to be non- compliant. Participants who continue to be non-compliant after multiple visit assessments may be permanently discontinued from study treatment afterconsultation with the GSK clinical team. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy All COPD medications used within 3 months prior to screening and during the run-in and study treatment periods (including the post -treatment period) should be recorded in the eCRF. All non-COPD medications taken during the study (after randomisation including post - treatment) and an y changes to concomitant medications will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that thedrug name , reason for use , dose(including unit) , frequency , route and the dates of administration are to be recorded. Note: Study provided albuterol/salbutamol should not be recorded in the eCRF however non-study supplied albuterol/salbutamol will be recorded in the eCRF. Medications initiated after completion of the randomi sed treatment phase of the study (Visit 4) or started after discontinuation of study treatment must be recorded in the eCRF up to the safet y follow-up (Visit6). 7.7.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies 7.7.1.1. Permitted COPD Medications The following COPD medications are permitted during the run-in and study treatment periods: 2019N398531_00"

Intra-articular injections are allowed . Note: Topical and ophthalmic corticosteroids, and localized corticosteroid injections (intra-articular and epidural) are allowed. NOTE:All COPD medications (except for rescue albuterol/salbutamol, mucolytics and oxygen) are prohibited during the run-in and randomi sed treatment period s of the study except during the treatment of a moderate/severe COPD exacerbation or pneumonia. In the event of a n exacerbation or pneumonia, sites should attempt to follow protocol treatment guidelines, however, treatment with any medication that the health care provider deems necessary is allowed. Caution is advised in using a LABA or LAMA to treat a participant currently taking study treatment as these additional medications may increase the risk o f overdose. If necessary the Investigator or other health care personnel may stop the participant’s study treatment temporarily (≤14 days) in order to treat the COPD ex acerbation or pneumonia. Participants who require more than two consecutive 14 day courses of treatment (i.e. antibiotics or corticosteroids) should be evaluated for their continuation on study treatment by the Investigator in consultation with the GSK medical monitor. The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . 2019N398531_00"
56,page_56,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 577.8. Treatment after the End of the Study Participants will not receive an y additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study because other treatment options are available. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant ’s medical condition. At the end of the treatment period ( Visit 5), or after study treatment Discontinuation Visit, or withdrawal from study , participants can resume conventional COPD therap y as prescribed b y the Investigator . Post-treatment concomitant medication should be entered into the eCRF until the safet y follow-up visit for participants that successfully complete Visit 5 on study treatment and for participants that withdraw from the stud y. For participants that discontinue study treatment, post -treatment concomitant medication should be entered into the eCRF until they complete the visit/telephon e contact at the planned Visit 6 date. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants that permanently stop study treatment should return to the clinic as soon as possible, in order to complete the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit. The evaluations and procedures to be completed are outlined in the SoA (Section 2). Participants that discontinue study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study and every effort should b e made by the Investigator/staff to keep the participant in the study , to collect important efficacyand safety data by telephone contact. Ideally, participants should return to the clinic to complete Visit 5, to collect important spirometry data, however, if this isn’t possible, this visit should also be completed by telephone. A safety follow-up phone call (Visit 6) should also be conducted 7 day s after Visit 5. The Investigator/site staff should contact the participant by telephone at the protocol designated visit time intervals to collect the following: SAEs AEs assessed as related to study participation AEs resulting in withdrawal from the stud y COPD exacerbations Concomitant medication Spirometry (Visit 5 only , if participant consents) Participant s have the right to discontinue study treatment before the end of the study . A participant may also be asked to discontinue study treatment at the Investigator ’s discretion. 2019N398531_00"
57,page_57,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 58A participant may be withdrawn from study treatment at any time. A reason for premature discontinuation of study treatment (e.g., AE, lack of efficacy , protocol deviation, Investigator discretion, consent withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF.Protocol defined criteriafor discontinuation of study treatment A participant must be permanently discontinued from study treatment if any of the following stopping criteria are met: Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology(in alignment wit h the FDA premarketing clinical liver safet y guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safet y guidance: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ Guidances/UCM174090.pdf. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the Investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm or if the Investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. Liver Safet y Algorithms and Required Actions and Follow up Assessments can be found inAppendix 4. Pregnancy: Positive urine pregnancy test. QTc Stopping Criteria: Details on performing ECG assessments can be found in Section 9.4.3 The sameQT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QT interval corrected for heart rate b y Bazett’s formula (QTcB), then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this in dividual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant ’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . The QTc should be based on averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5-10 minute) recording period. For this study , the following QTc stopping criteria will apply andlead to withdrawal from study treatment : an increase in QTc b y > 60 msec from baseline or development of a QTc > 530 msec (based on an average of triplicate ECGs) 2019N398531_00"
58,page_58,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 59NOTE: These criteria should be based on the average QTc value of triplicate ECGs. For example, if an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, two more ECGs will be obtained over a brief period and then the averaged QTc value of the three ECGs will be used to determine whether the participant should be discontinued from the study . See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow - up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.1. Rechallenge 8.1.1.1. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws co nsent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use an y data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, an d the Investigator must document this in the site study records. In the event of earl y withdrawal from the study, every effort should be made to have the participant to return to the clinic for a Study Treatment Discontinuation Visitand Safety Follow-up,and to return all study related materials. Assessments to be performed during the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit and the Safet y Follow-up contact are described in the Schedule of Activities table (Section 2). Participants that have previously discontinued study treatment (and have already completed the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visi t) but then decide they no longer wish to participate in the study , may withdraw from the study by contacting the site b y telephone. If the participant withdraws from the study at least 7 day s after the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit was completed, the safety follow-up contact (Visit 6) can be conducted at the time the participant notifies the site of their intentio n to withdraw from the study. Alternativel y, the safet y follow-up contact should be conducted 7 day s after the Study Treatment Discontinuation Visit, if the participants consents to be contacted. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: 2019N398531_00"
59,page_59,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 60The site must attempt t o contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the stud y. Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailingaddress or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant ’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of l ost to follow -up. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with th e sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for sc reening failure, as applicable. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form has been signed by the participant. A Pre-Screening visit (Visit 0) is required in order to administer the informed consent befor e any changes are made to the participant’s current medical regimen. Selection and modification of the participant’s medications prior to study participation is based on the physician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each pa rticipant’s needs. A participant’s treatment must not be changed merel y for the purpose of enabling the participant’s participation in the study. During the P re-Screening visit (V isit 0) the following information will be captured in the eCRF for each part icipant: Demographic information including race, age and gender Participant number Register visit in IWRS The additional following critical baseline assessments will be conducted at Screening (Visit 1): 2019N398531_00"

Spirometry Spirometry measurements will be obtained using spirometry equipment that meets or exceeds the minimal performance recommendations of the American Thoracic Societ y (ATS)[Miller, 2005]. All sites will use standardise d spirometry equipment provided by an external vendor. All participant s will have spirometry performed at screening and each scheduled clinic visit during the treatment period. For FEV 1and FVC determinations, at lea st 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. Acceptable spirometry efforts should have a satisfactory start of test and end of test (e.g. a plateau in the volume -time curve) and be free from artifacts due to cough, 2019N398531_00"

The largest FEV 1and FVC from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Spirometry must be performed as follows: Started approximately between 6:00AM and 11:00AM. If applicable, after completing the health outcomes assessments ( CATshould be administered first followed by SGRQ-C) After withholding albuterol/salbutamol for 4 hours. At Screening(Visit 1), before the morning dose of their usual COPD medication . At Randomisation (Visit 2) and all treatment visits, before the morning dose of study treatment . Participant s should refrain from smoking for 1 hour prior to each pulmonary function test. Participant s should abstain from drinking beverages with high levels of caffeine such as tea and coffee for 2 hours prior to each pulmonary function test . A full description of the timing and conduct of spirometry procedures is provided in t he SRM. 9.1.1.1. Reversibility At Visit 1, both pre -and post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry will be obtained. Post - albuterol/salbutamol FEV 1and FEV 1/FVC findings will be used to determine participant eligibility . Reversibility testing will be completed as fol lows: Following pre -albuterol/salbutamol spirometry (three acceptable spirometry efforts), the participant will self-administer 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol MDI using a spacer/valved -holding chamber. Three acceptable spirometry efforts will be obtaine d approximately 10 to 30 minutes after albuterol/salbutamol administration. 9.1.2. SGRQ-C The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire -Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease specific (SGRQ -C) will be completed by participants at Randomisation (Visit 2), Day 28 (Visit3),and Day 84 (Visit 4) . When the SGRQ -C and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) are collected at the same visit, the CAT should be collected prior to the SGRQ -C. The SGRQ- C [Meguro, 2007] is a disease -specific questionnaire designed t o measure the impact of respiratory disease and its treatment on a COPD participant ’s HRQoL. As well as producing an overall summary score, scores for the individual domains of sy mptoms, activity and impacts are also produced . It has been used in studies of COPD participants and has been translated and validated for use in most major languages. The SGRQ -C is 2019N398531_00"
62,page_62,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 63derived from the original SGRQ, and produces scores equivalent to the SGRQ instrument [Meguro, 2007]. 9.1.3. COPD A ssessment Test (CAT) The CAT will be completed by participants at Screening (Visit 1), Randomisation (Visit 2), Day 28 (Visit 3), and Day 84 (Visit 4). CAT should be collected prior to SGRQ -C when collected at the same visit. The COPD Assessment Test [Jones, 2009; Jones, 2012] is a validated, short and simple patient completed questionnaire which has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status of patients with COPD. The CAT is an 8- item questionnaire suitable for completion by all patients diagnosed with COPD. When completing the questionnaire, participants rate their experience on a 6 -point scale, ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (maximum impairment) with a scoring range of 0 - 40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. 9.1.4. COPD Exacerbations COPD exacerbation data will be collected from the start of the randomised double blind treatment period (Visit 2) until the safety follow up contact at Visit 6. Participants will complete a paper M edical Problems worksheet to record medical problems experienced during the stud y. This paper worksheet must be reviewed b y the Investigator (or designee) at each visit to the study site to assist in the identification of new COPD exacerbations. Every effort should be made to conduct a chest x- ray within 48 hours of identification of a moderate or severe exacerbation. All COPD exacerbations will be recorded on theexacerbation page of the eCRF. Details on COPD Exacerbation I dentification, Categorizatio n and Treatment Guidelines are provided in Appendix 5 . 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 6 The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment or withdraw f rom the study(see Section 8). 2019N398531_00"

However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, includi ng a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptl y notify the sponsor or designee . The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 6. 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias wh en detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AEoccurrence. Participants will be issued with a paper Medical Problems worksheet to record an y medical problems experie nced during the stud y. This paper worksheet will be used to assist participant recall in discussions with the Investigator (or designee), for site staff to then enter as appropriate in the eCRF. 9.2.3. Follow-up of AEs and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, t he Investigatoris required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwiseexplained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 6. 2019N398531_00"
64,page_64,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 659.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the Investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obli gations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participant s and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics C ommittees (I EC), and Investigator s. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigator s as necessary . An Investigatorwho receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator ’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appr opriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For any cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 6and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV e CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms.The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.6. Disease -Related Outcomes –COPD exacerbations COPD exacerbations are an expected disease- related outcome. 2019N398531_00"
65,page_65,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 669.2.7. COPD exacerbations should not be recorded as an adverse event, unless they meet the definition of an SA E (Appendix 6).Pneumonia All suspected pneumonias will require confirmation as defined b y the presence of new infiltrate(s) on chest x -ray AND at least 2 of the following signs and s ymptoms: Increased cough Increased sputum purulence (colour) or production Auscultatory findings of adventitious sounds ( e.g.egophony, bronchial breath sounds, rales, etc.) Dyspnoea or tach ypnea Fever (oral temperature >37.5 °C) Elevated white blood cel ls (WBC)(>10,000/mm3or >15% immature forms) Hypoxemia (HbO 2saturation <88 % or at least 2 % lower than baseline value) All pneumonias must be captured on the AE/SAE page of the eCRF and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF. The Investigator s and site sta ff should remain vigilant for the possible development of pneumonia in participants with COPD as the clinical features of such infections overlap with the sy mptoms of COPD exacerbations. Risk factors for pneumonia in participants with COPD receiving FF/VIincludedcurrent smokers, participants with a history of prior pneumonia, participant s with a body mass index <25kg/m2and participants with an FEV 1 <50% predicted. For all suspected cases of pneumonia, Investigator s are strongly encouraged to confirm th e diagnosis (this includes obtaining a chest x -ray) and to initiate appropriate therap y as promptly as possible. All diagnoses of pneumonia (radiographicall y confirmed or unconfirmed) must be reported as an AE or SAE (if applicable). Note: Pulse oximetry should be measured at any time a moderate or severe exacerbation is reported or pneumonia is suspected and recorded in the source documents and on the pneumonia page of the eCRF if applicable. 9.2.8. Sentinel Events A Sentinel Event is a GSK- defined SAE that is not necessaril y drug-related but has been associated historicall y with adverse reactions for other drugs and is therefo re worthy of heightened pharmacovigilance. Medical monitor review of all SAEs for possible Sentinel Events is mandated at GSK. The medica l monitor may request additional clinical information on an urgent basis if a possible Sentinel Event is identified on SAE review. The current GSK -defined Sentinel Events are listed below: Acquired Long QT Sy ndrome Agranulocy tosis/Severe Neutropenia 2019N398531_00"

Pharmacokinetic s Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacod ynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.7. Genetics Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogenetic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 9.The IEC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency must approve the PGx and genetic assessments before these can be conducted. The approval(s) must be in writing and will clearl y specify approval of the PGx and genetic assessments (i.e., approval of Appendix 9). In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is being deferred and the study , except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated. When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be conducted. 9.8.

The specific information to be discussed with each participant is provided in the SRM. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypotheses The primary objective of this study is to compare single inhaler triple therapy (FF/UMEC/VI) withtiotropium in participants with COPD who have received tiotropium and continue to have s ymptomsas measured b y CAT 10.The primary endpoint is trough FEV ₁at Week 24 (Day 85). The primary analysis is the comparison of this endpoint between FF/UMEC/VI and tiotropium. The null hy pothesis is that there is no difference between treatment groups. H0: T1 – T2 = 0 The alternative hy pothesis is there is a diffe rence between treatment groups. H1: T1 – T2 0 Where T 1and T2are the treatment means for FF/UMEC/VI and tiotropium , respectivel y. 10.2. Sample Size Determination Sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint of trough FEV 1 at Week 12 (Day 85)and assumes 90 % power, a two- sided 1% significance level, an estimate of residual standard deviation of 240 mL (based on mixed model repeated measures [MMRM] analyses of closed triple Phase IIb study CTT116853 in COPD participant s) and a treatment difference of 70mL.Under these assumptions, in total 702 evaluable participant s(351 pertreatment group) will be required. It is estimated that approximately 10% of participants will withdraw during the treatment period without providing a Day 85 trough assessme ntand approximately 8% of participants will drop out from the4 week run-in (including those not meeting randomisation criteria). Therefore approximately 848 participants will be enrolled to 4 - week run-in in order to have 780 participants randomised. 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: 2019N398531_00"
71,page_71,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 72Population Description All Subject Enrolled (ASE)All participants for whom a record exists in the study database, including screen failures and any participant who wa s not screened but experienced an SAE between the date of informed consent and the planned date of the Screening visit. Intent -toTreat (ITT)All randomised participants, excluding those who were randomised in error. A participant who is recorded as a scr een or run -in failure and also randomised will be considered to be randomised in error. Any other participant who receives a randomisation number will be considered to have been randomised . Displays will be based on the treatment to which the participant was randomised . 10.4. Statistical A nalyses 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Efficacy analyses will be based on the ITT Population using only data collected on - treatment, unless otherwise specified. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryThe primary endpoint of trough FEV 1 onDay 85 will be analysed for the ITT Population using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis, including trough FEV 1 recorded at each of visits, Day 28, Day 84 and Day 85. The model will include covariates of baseline FEV 1, visit, geographic al region , treatment and visit by baseline interaction. A visit by treatment interaction term will also be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separately. The variance -covariance matrix will be assumed unstructured. Estimated differences between FF/UMEC/VI and tiotropium will be presented together with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference and p- values. A “tipping point” sensitivity analysis of trough FEV1 on Day 8 5 will be conducted for the ITTPopulation. This wi ll explore the impact of missing data by using differing assumptions regarding the mean treatment effect in participant s who discontinue study treatment . Assumptions will include scenarios where participant s who discontinue FF/UMEC/VI have a lower treatmen t effect than those who discontinue TIO. The analysis results will be used to explore the conditions under which the conclusion of superiority no longer holds. SecondarySecondary endpoint change from baseline in trough FEV 1on Day 28 and Day 84will b e part of the primary endpoint analysis (MMRM). 2019N398531_00"

A visit by treatment interaction term will also be included to allow treatment effects to be estimated at each visit separately. The variance - covariance matrix will be assumed unstructured. Estimated differences between FF/UMEC/VI and tiotropium will be presented together with 95% CI for the difference and p -value. OtherWill be described in the reporting and analysis plan . 10.4.2. Safety Analyses All safety analyses will be performed on the ITTPopulation. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryThere is no primary safety analysis. SecondaryThe following safety endpoints will be analysed descriptively by treatment group: Incidence of adverse events Incidence of adverse events of special interest (AE SI) Vital signs Details will be described in the reporting and analysis plan Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of participants experiencing at least one AE of any type, AEs within each body system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non-fatal SAEs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and AEs leading to withdrawal. Deaths and SAEs, if applicable, will be documented in case narrative format. 10.4.3.

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HR T and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopaus al status before study enrollment.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.) Sexual ab stinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the Participants.) NOTES: a. Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for Participantss in clinical studies. b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contr aception should be utilized during the treatment period .

Guidelines for Identifying COPD Exacerbations The following are s ymptoms used to ascertain an exacerbation of COPD: Worsening of two or more of the following major sy mptoms for at least two consecutive days: Dyspnoea Sputum volume Sputum purulence (color) OR Worsening of an y one major symptom together with any one of the following minor symptoms for at least two consecutive day s: Sore throat Colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) Fever (oral temperature >37.5 °C) without other cause Increased cough Increased wheeze Participants who experience worsening COPD symptoms for greater than 24 hours should: Contact their study Investigator and/or research coordinator immediately , and report to the study clinic as required If the participant is unable to contact their stud y Investigator and/or research coordinator, they should contact their primary care physician (or other health care practitioner as required) and contact their study site as soon as possible If the participant seeks emergency /acute care for worsening respiratory symptoms, he/she should requestthe caring Health Care Provider (HCP) to contact the Investigator as soon as possible. Participant s with worsening respiratory symptoms will be classified as having: A mild/moderate/severe exacerbation and/or pneumonia OR A Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (L RTI) Background variability of COPD A non-respiratory related disease Other respiratory related disease 2019N398531_00"
91,page_91,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 9212.5.2. COPD E xacerbation Severity Each COPD exacerbation will be categorized based on severit y as follows: Mild: Worsening sy mptoms of COPD that are self -managed b y theparticipant . Mild exacerbations are not associated with the use of corticosteroids or antibiotics. Moderate : Worsening sy mptoms of COPD that require treatment with oral/systemiccorticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Severe: Worsening s ymptoms of COPD that require treatment with in -patient hospitalization. Every effort should be made to conduct a chest x-ray within 48 hours of identification of a moderate or severe exacerbation . Details of an exacerbation should be recorded in the exacerbation page of the eCRF. However, exacerbations should not be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF unless they meet the definition of an SAE. (Pneumonia must be recorded in the AE or SAE section of the eCRF a nd on the Pneumonia page of the eCRF.) Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections will not be considered a COPD exacerbation unless the participant experiences worsening symptoms of COPD which match the definition of an exacerbation as given above. 12.5.3. Treatment of COPD Exacerbations All medications used for the treatment of exacerbations must be recorded in the source documents a nd the exacerbation page of the eCRF. All sites should follow the protocol treatment guidelines (as outline dbelow), but an y medications deemed medically necessary may be used to treat a COPD exacerbation. However, caution is advised in using a LABA or LA MA to treat a participant currently taking IP as these additional medications may increase the risk of overdose. If necessary the PI or other health care personnel may stop the participant’ s study treatment temporarily in order to treat the COPD exacerbat ion. 12.5.4. Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids If in the opinion of the Investigator/treating ph ysician the exacerbation is severe enough to warrant the need for oralor systemic corticosteroids (with or without antibiotics) the following guidelines sh ould be used. The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should be 14 days (dose and type according to local practice) The duration of treatment with oral/sy stemic corticosteroids should not exceed 14 days unless approval is given by the sponsor or representative Any course of oral/s ystemic corticosteroids started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation 2019N398531_00"
92,page_92,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 9312.5.5. Guidelines for Treatment with A ntibiotics If there is evidence of respira tory infection that in the opinion of the Investigator or treating ph ysician warrants the need for antibiotics the following guidelines should be followed: The duration of treatment with antibiotics should be 7 to 14 day s (dose and ty pe according to local practice). If first line antibiotic treatment fails and additional antibiotics are used, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days unless approval for participants to continue on study treatment is given by the sponsor or represe ntative Any course of antibiotics started within 7 day s of finishing a previous course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD ex acerbation unless the participant experiences worsening of symptoms of COPD 12.5.6. Onsetand Resoluti on of COPD Exacerbations For each mild, moderate and severe exacerbation, the date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the study source docum ents and eCRF. The date of onset is the first day (of at least 2 consecutive day s) of worsening s ymptoms. The date of resolution should be based on when the Investigator and/or participant determines that the COPD sy mptoms have returned to pre -exacerbation levels or to a new baseline. In determining this resolution date, consideration should be given to diary recorded s ymptoms and/or study participant evaluation. 12.5.7. Guideline for assessing multiple mild exacerbations Two mild exacerbations can be combined int o one, per the Investigator’s judgement, if a participant’s diary reveals that the two mild COPD exacerbations are separated by no more than three exacerbation free day s. 12.5.8. Guideline for assessing exacerbations that increase in severity If an exacerbation st arts off as mild, but becomes moderate or severe or starts off as moderate and becomes severe, the exacerbation should be captured as one exacerbation and classified b y its highest level of severity. 2019N398531_00"

94,page_94,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 95Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associat ed with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it c annot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life-threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypotheticall y might have caused death, if it were more se vere. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observat ion and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Resultsin persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 2019N398531_00"

These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, int ensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigator s will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrhythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascul ar events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 2019N398531_00"
96,page_96,"2017N323364_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207626 97Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, i t is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. It is notacceptable for the Investigator to send photocopie s of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAEe CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. Severe: An event tha t prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine t he relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 2019N398531_00"

Follow -up of AE and SAE The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the natu re and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in t he study or during a recognized follow - up period, the Investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of any post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. The Investigator will submitany updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. TheInvestigator or medically -qualified sub -Investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE 2019N398531_00"

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participants /user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel. It is sufficient that: An incidentassociated with a device happened and The incidentwas such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following: Life-threatening illness Permanent impairment of body function or permanent damag e to body structure Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects 2019N398531_00"

Appendix9: Genetics USE/ANALYSIS OF DNA Genetic variation may impact a participant ’s response to therap y, susceptibility , severity and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the dru g; disease etiology ; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a 6 mL bloodsample will be collected for DNA anal ysis. DNA samples maybe used for research related to study treatment orCOPDand related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests) related to study treatment or study treatments of this drug class and indication. Genetic research may consist of the analy sis of one or more candidate genes (including but not limited to: PIK3CD, PIK3CA, IL10, CHRNA3 , CHRNA5 , DNAH5, SUMF1, and CELSR1) or the anal ysis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or analysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate) The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi- studyassessment of genetic factors involved in the response to study treatment or study treatments of this class. The results of genetic anal yses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . In the event of DNA extraction failur e, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested from the participant. Signed informed consent will be required to obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original consent. The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality . The samples will be retained while research on study treatment (or study treatments of this class) or indication continues but no longer than 15 y ears after the last participant last visit or other period as per local requirements. Withdraw Process : If a participant withdraws consent, the Investigator must complete the Genetic Sample Destruction Request Form, which will be provided to the site in the I nvestigator Site File. Destruction Process : After the specified storage period of 15 years or on withdrawal of consent, samples will be destroy ed by incineration. Samples that are sent for testing to vendors are returned or destro yed as part of the formal agreement and a full record of chain of custod y is maintained. A laboratory information management s ystem (LIMS) is used to track and identify samples for destruction. 2019N398531_00"
