Background RVT 1401 is a fully human anti- neonatal F c receptor (FcRn) monoc lonal antibody. FcRn is critical to the regulation of immu noglobulin G (IgG) [ Roopenian, 2007]. In addition to its central r ole in mediating the tr ansport of IgG within and a cross cells of diverse orig in, it also ser ves to rescue IgG from deg radation, ther eby prolonging its circulating h alf-life [Roopen ian, 2007]. T argeting the FcRn pathway has been shown to dramat ically red uce circulating IgG , including auto -antibodies (Ab) of the IgG subclass, thus supporting its use in the treatment of auto -Ab mediated au toimmune dis eases. RVT -1401 functions by inhibiting the binding of IgG to FcRn, resulting in the rapid catabolism of IgG via lysosomal degr adation. 3.2. Warm A utoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Autoimmune hemolyt ic anemia (AIHA ) is caused by increased red blood cell (R BC) destruct ion triggered by autoantibodies that react again st RBC antigens with or without complement. Antibodies in wa rm autoi mmune hemolytic an emia ( WAIHA) react optimally at 37 degrees Celsius a nd is the most common type of AIHA, comprising approximat ely 7 0-80% o f all adult cases [ Sokol , 1981]. The most common antibody isotype in volved in W AIHA is IgG, wit h a greater prevalence of IgG1 a nd IgG3 [Kalfa, 2016]. Intravascular destructi on of RB Cs th rough complemen t mediated mechanisms contributes in only a minor percentage of WAIHA patien ts. In most patients , erythrocytes coated by warm reacting IgG are b ound by spleen macropha ges via FcR, w hich causes them to be either phagocytosed or h ave part of their membrane removed in the spleen. In the latter case they fo rm microsp herocytes that ar e then subject to furthe r destruc tion during t heir next passage thro ugh the sple en [Kalfa, 2016]. CD8+ T cells, and natural killer (NK cells) may also contribute to RBC lysis through antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC ). RVT -1401, by reducing the levels of anti -RBC IgG, is hypothe sized to be effective for th e treatment of patien ts with W AIHA . The clinical presentation of W AIHA is characterized by f atigue, ex ertional dyspne a, pallor, and splenomeg aly. C ommon laboratory findings include: decr eased hemoglobin (Hb), reticulocytosis, elevat ed unco njugated bilirubin and lactate dehydr ogenase, seru m aspartate aminotransferas e disproportionately higher than s erum al anine aminotran sferase, and decreased h aptoglo bin [Kalfa, 2016]. Based on a paucity of phase 3 trials , the treatment of WAI HA is primarily guided by retrospective reviews, case seri es, expert opinions and a fe w small phase 2 trials. Nevertheless, Kal fa, et al, conclude that available evidence demonstrates that WAIH A can be fatal due to an acute presentation or due to refractory disease in spite of multiple lines of therapy. [Kalfa, 20 16]. Experts recommend initial treatmen t with high dose steroids (60-100mg/day) and note t hat most patients will respond to these doses. Experts also recommend steroid taper after patien ts respond, due to toxicity of steroids at this high dose. Patients with worsening dise ase as steroids are ta pered are candidates for further lines of therapy with immunosuppressants. Finally, a lthough transfusions are generally reserved for stabil izing patients in the acute phase of WAIHA , some patients"

[Jaeger , 2019] 3.3. Rationale 3.3.1. Stud y Rationale The purpose of the current study is to assess the efficacy and safety of RVT-1401 in the treatment of WAIHA that is worsening or refractory in spite of therapy with steroids and or immunosuppressants or worsening with steroid or immunosuppressant taper. Res ults from this study will be used to inform dosing and to support progression into a Pha se 3 study. 3.3.2. Dose ratio nale Two d osing reg imens o f RVT -1401 wil l be as sessed in this non-randomized open l abel study. Both will in volve once wee kly subcutaneous ( SC) injecti ons: • Dosi ng Regimen A -680 mg weekly for 12 w eeks, and • Dosing Regim en B - 340 mg weekl y for 12 w eeks Given that there is a practi cal limit on the volume that can be admi nistered v ia SC injection, these two doses r epresent what can be ad minis tered as a si ngle SC inject ion (340 mg) and two SC injections (680 mg ) per week with the current fo rmulation. Expect ed Treatment Effect The propos ed dosing re gimens a re expected to prov ide a s ustained total I gG re duction of approxim ately 75 -80% and 65-70% for Re gimen A and B r espectively . It is expected that the nadir IgG reduction wi ll be achieved by the 3rd-5th dose (depending on dose studied) and main tained fo llowing t he remaining doses bef ore rising back to ba seline over th e next 6 t o 8 week s after stopping treatmen t. These assum ptions are s upported by preliminary pharmacodynamic ( PD) resu lts, shown in Figure 1, from the Pha se 1 clin ical st udy RVT-1401-1001 (Secti on 3.3.3 ). Dosing regimen A (weekly 680 mg) represents th e dose tha t is expected to achieve the maxi mal effect in IgG reduction. In healthy participant s, 4 week ly SC injections of 680 m g of RVT -1401 produc ed the maximum PD response with an aver age total IgG pe rcent reducti on from baseline of 78%. This effect occurred prior to the 4th dose and no further reduction was observed af ter dosi ng, indicati ng max imal reduction and steady state response had been ach ieved. In the 340 mg repeat dose cohort, th ere wer e some individuals who did not achieve nad ir IgG con centration until a fter the last dose, indica ting they may have not reached steady state. D ata from this study w ill be used to support dose select ion in future studies."

The study design is illus trated in Section 5.2. Two co horts of participants will be enrolled in a n on-randomized se quent ial approach . Participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 (680 mg /weekl y) first followed by Cohort 2 (340 mg/weekly). In the Phase I healthy volunteer study, both dosing regimens were well tolerated (Section 3.3.3). Since 680 mg/weekly has the greater likelihood of demonstrating clinical efficacy , this dosing regimen will be studied in Cohort 1. Following the ini tial dose at the Baseli ne Visit ( Week 1 , Day 1 ), study visit s will occur week ly throughout the t reatment period.

Scr eening/Baseline Failures Screen failures are defined as participant s who cons ent to participate in the clini cal trial but are never subseque ntly enrolled . A minimal s et of screen failure information is required including date o f informed consent, demography, s creen f ailure detai ls, eligibility criteria, and any SA Es. Screen fail ure data will be recorde d within the electronic Case R eport Form (eC RF). 6.6. Lifestyle Rest rictions 6.6.1. Contr aception Femal e participants o f childbearing pote ntial must no t become pregnant and so must be sexually inactive by abstinence or agree t o use a high ly effective method of contra cepti on (i.e., pregnancy rate of le ss than 1% per year). Abst inence Sexual in activity by abs tinence must be consistent with the preferred an d usual lifestyle of the part icipant. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, s ympt othermal, postovulations metho ds) an d with drawal are no t acce ptable metho ds of contracep tion. Contracep tive Methods w ith a Failure Ra te of <1% Hormonal • Femal e participants and female partners o f male study participants stable for at least 4 weeks prior to screening on a combined hormonal cont raception associated with inhibition of ovula tion (oral, intrava ginal, tran sdermal) PLUS a barr ier method (i.e., condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or c ervical/va ult caps]) . • Femal e participants and female partners o f male study participants stable for at least 4 weeks prior to sc reening on a P rogestogen -only hormon al con tracep tion associated with inh ibition of ovul ation (oral, inject able, implanta ble) PLUS a barrier meth od (i.e., condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or c ervical/vault c aps]) . • Female participants and female partners of ma le study participants using a hormona l con traceptive must also use a bar rier meth od (i.e., condom or occlusive"

Long- Acting Reversible • Femal e participants and femal e partners o f male study participants with an Intrauter ine device (IUD) or intrauteri ne sy stem (IUS) th at meets the <1% failure rate a s stat ed in th e product label . Male Contraception • Male partne r sterilization (vasectomy with do cumentat ion of azoospermia) prior to the fem ale parti cipant's en try into the study, and this male is t he sole partner for that par ticipa nt. For this definition, “documented” refe rs to th e outcom e of the investigat or's/designee ’s medical examination of the pa rticip ant or review of t he participan t's medical hi story for study eligibility, as o btained via a v erbal interview with the part icipan t or from the participant ’s medical record s. • Sterilized male participan ts who have had vas ectomy with documented azoosperm ia post procedure can b e included . Additional C onside rations for Male Particip ants • Non-steriliz ed male participant s who are sexually active with a fema le partner of childbe aring po tential must use effective method of double barrier cont raception. Male partic ipants practicing t rue sexual abstin ence (when this is in line with the preferr ed and usual li festyle of the participant) c an be included. In addit ion, male participant s mu st be ad vised not to donate sperm during th is period from signing of Inform ed Consent Form (ICF), throughout the duratio n of the stud y, and for 90 days after the l ast administra tion of study dr ug. These allowed m ethods of contracep tion are only effective when us ed consistently, correctly and in a ccordance with the pr oduct label. The invest igato r is responsi ble for ensuring p articipa nts und erstand how to properly use these methods of contraceptio n. Participant s mus t be complete ly inf ormed of the unknown ri sks of pre gnancy and agree not to become pr egnant during the time they are parti cipati ng in this study. If there is any question th at a pa rticipant will not be reliable in the use of appropriate contraceptive metho ds, they should not be entered into the st udy. 6.7. Withdrawal Criteria 6.7.1. Reasons f or Withdra wal A Principal In vestigator may discontinue/withdraw a par ticipa nt from the study if any of the following criter ia apply :"
26,page_26,"Immunovant Sciences Gm bH RVT-1401- 2003 , Amendment 2 Version 3.0 Confidentia l 27 • Any cl inical AE, lab orato ry abnormalit y, or other medical condition or situ ation occurs such that cont inued parti cipation in the study w ould not be in th e best interest of th e particip ant. • Participa nt pre gnancy • Signif icant pro tocol violation (e.g., non- compliance with concomitant medications ) • Beha vioral or administrative issue • Participant requ est to d iscontinue /withdraw c onsent for any reason. It is impor tant to doc umen t whether the withdrawal of consent i s primarily du e to an AE, lack of efficacy, or o ther reason . • Discontinuation of th e study at the request of the Sponsor , regula tory agency o r an Institutional R eview Boa rd (IRB) / Independent E thics Committee (IEC) • Stopping cri teria, as noted in Section 6.8 If a partic ipant meets a withdrawal criterio n during treat ment, an Early T ermination visit will be requ ired (Section 6.7.2). 6.7.2. Participant Withdrawal Procedures If a pa rticipant is prem aturely discontin ued from the study, t he Pr incipal Investigator must make every effort to perform an E arly Termination Visit per Section 8.1, Tim e and Events Tabl e and document the primary reason fo r withdrawal. Should a participant fail to attend the cl inic for a req uired study visit, the site sh ould attempt to contact the participant and re-schedule the missed visit as soon as possi ble. The site should also coun sel th e participant on the i mportance of maintain ing the assign ed visit schedule and as certain whe ther or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. In cases where the partici pant does not return for the rescheduled visit or c annot be re ached to re schedule the m issed visit, the s ite should make ev ery ef fort to regain contact wi th the participan t (3 documented telephone calls and if necessar y a certified letter to th e participan t’s last known mailing addr ess) so that they can ap propriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost t o Follow-up”. 6.8. Safety M anagemen t Criteria for Individual Parti cipant s 6.8.1.

Func tional Assessm ent of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT-F) S cale The F ACIT-F scale is a validated scale w hich measures the physical , emoti onal and social implications of fatigue, o ne of the key cl inical manifestations o f warm autoimmune hemolyt ic anem ia [Acaster , 2015; Webster , 2003]. Scores ra nge fr om 0-52, wit h a higher score indicating a h igher quality of life. A score of less than 30 would indi cate severe fatigue. The scale tak es approximatel y 5-10 minutes t o comple te. 8.4.2. M edical Research Council (MRC) Breathlessness Scale The MRC Breathl essness sc ale is a questionnaire that consists of five statements about perceived breathlessness . The focus of the scale is to quantify the di sability associated with breathlessnes s and not the severity of the breathlessness [ Stenton, 2008]. This scale has undergone iterations with the current Modified MRC Subject Version , ranging from Grade 0 (limited to no disabil ity) to Grade 4 (severe d isability). This sc ale has been used in patien ts wi th chroni c obstructive pulmonary disea se (CO PD), where the researchers further stratified on patients with low hemoglobin levels. Their data demonstrate that anaemic COPD patients had significantly higher MRC [Ferrari , 2015]. Th e scale can be self-administered by asking subjects to choose a p hrase that best describes their condition . The score is the number that best fits the patient’s lev el of a ctivity. A score can usually be obta ined in less than a minute. 8.4.3. EQ-5D- 3L Scale The EQ-5D- 3L is a vali dated measurement of health -related quality of life [Devlin , 2018; Hernandez , 2018]. The scale cons ists of 2 components, the EQ -5D descr iptive sy stem and the EQ visual analogue scale . The descriptive system evaluates mobility, self -care, usual activities, pa in/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The s cale can be self - adminis tered by su bjects who select the m ost appropriate s tatement within each cate gory. A lower score co rrespond s to better quality of life . The EQ VAS reco rds the patient’s self-rated health on a ver tical visual analogue scale where the endpoints ar e labelled ‘Best imagin able health state’ (100) and ‘Worst imag inable heal th state’ (0). The patient can select an y number from 0-100. Completion of both components of the s cale can be performed in und er 5 minutes. 8.4.4.

All AEs and SA Es sh ould be prompt ly recorded in the eCRF , compl eting all fields for which data is avail able. When known , the diagnos is should be entered as the ev ent term in the eCR F, rather than individual s ymptoms. When the di agnosis is unclear, key symptoms may be entered, and the investi gator should obtain appropri ate tes ts to establi sh a diagn osis, if possible. A fter th e dia gnosis is determined, individual s ymptoms of that diagnosis may be removed from the databas e. All relevant seriousness crite ria should be entered for eac h SAE.

Assessi ng Causal ity of AEs and SAEs Regulat ory authorities r equire that both investigator and sponsor asses s whether there is a reaso nable possibility t hat the stud y treatmen t caused each AE. This assessment requ ires careful medical consid eration of each event in relatio nship to t he timin g of drug administration, t he presence of other fa ctors which may ha ve caused the event (underlying illne ss, concomitant m edicatio n, complic ations, exposure t o other toxins or allergens, environmental facto rs, etc.), and the effe cts of st opping an d/or rest arting th e study t reatment . The following definitions are to be use d for the relat ionship of the AE to Study Treatm ent: The inve stigator will as sess the cau sality of each report ed AE as foll ows: • Probably re lated: an AE occurri ng at a reasonab le time following ad ministration of a drug, where other causes are unlikely , there is evidence to sugg est that the d rug caused t he event, and/or where the event re curs after re introduction of t he drug (without other explanation for the recurrence). • Possi bly related : an AE occur ring at a reaso nable time follo wing adm inistration of a drug a nd for whi ch there is a reasonab le possibilit y that the d rug caused the event, e.g. t here is some evi dence to suggest a causal relati onship. • Not related: a n AE with poor or no relati onship to the timing of dru g administratio n, or wh ere another cause such as underly ing d isease, complic ations, or othe r medication s reasonab ly explains the ev ent, or wh ere the event does not r ecur aft er continued admi nistration o r reintro ducti on of the dru g for an adeq uate period. 11.7.
