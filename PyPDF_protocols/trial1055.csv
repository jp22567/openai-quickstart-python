5,page_5,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 6 of 132 Confidential Directed Hypnotherapy (GDH) for the Treatment of Adult Subjects with Symptomatic Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Study Design: EASITx is a pivotal study of digital GDH (Regulora), a novel digital therapeutic which delivers the North Carolina GDH treatment protocol to IBS subjects. EASITx tests the hypothesis that the digital version of the North Carolina GDH treatment protocol is safe and, relative to a comparator treatment platform, enables a clinically significant reduction in abdominal pain intensity and other symptoms of IBS. EASITx is a pivotal medical device study, and digital GDH is classified as Software as a Medical Device (SaaMD). The North Carolina GDH treatment protocol consists of 7 unique GDH scripts, each approximately 30 minutes in length and a single practice session, approximately 13 minutes in length. Each script has been converted to a video/audio recording allo wing for administration via a mobile device, tablet or personal computer, mimicking the frequency and duration of therapist -administered GDH. The EASITx study will apply state -of-the-art IBS and behavioral research methodology including use of a fully di gital treatment platform, a comparator that allows subjects to be blinded to the treatment hypothesis, and a data collection (ePRO) system which creates a double blind, eliminating the potential for investigator bias. The comparator treatment platform will be identical to the GDH treatment platform except that muscle relaxation (MR) video/a udio recordings equal in treatment duration and frequency of administration will be substituted for the GDH video/audio recordings. MR was chosen as the control after con sultation with the FDA. The EASITx study is 68 weeks in duration and is composed of 4 distinct phases. ● Phase 1: A 4 -week pre -treatment run -in assessment period (weeks minus 4 through minus 1) ● Phase 2: A 12 -week treatment period (weeks 1 through 12) ● Phas e 3: A 4 -week post -treatment assessment period (weeks 13 through 16) ● Phase 4: A 52 -week post -treatment long -term extension (LTE) during which time subjects will be required to complete two 4 -week"

Participation begins with the completion of an online prescreening eligibility survey via Curebase, a clinical research software platform. Subjects who pass prescreening will be consent ed online and scheduled for a baseline visit with a study physician. At this visit, their IBS diagnosis will be confirmed, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied, and subject - facing surveys administered. Subjects will be trained on the use of the electronic patient reported outcomes tool (ePRO) and daily collection of IBS pain and stool symptoms. The Phase 1 period will begin the day after the baseline visit. The Phase 1 4-week run -in period is a baseline symptom assessment period during which time subjects will enter their IBS symptoms daily and record them digitally via the Curebase ePRO on their mobile phone, tablet, or personal computer. This run -in period will provide baseline symptom data for comparison to post -treatment data collected in Phases 3 and 4. The Phase 1 run-in symptom data is also used to determine whether subjects are committed t o participation by assessing their ability to consistently and accurately input data into the ePRO, and also establishes that subjects have the minimally required level of IBS symptom severity. Once the run -in is completed, ineligible subjects will be inf ormed , and eligible subjects will receive an “Onboarding Call” from a member of the Curebase study staff. The Onboarding Call will occur as soon as possible after the Phase 1 run -in period (at least 1 day but not more than 14 days). This call will be used to inform subjects of eligibility, confirm participation, create a user account, confirm access to the platform, and provide training on the use of the metaMe treatment platform. During the Onboarding call, subjects will select a treatment day and time tha t is maintained throughout treatment (Phase 2). Phase 2 will start on the next occurrence of the chosen weekday. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into the 2 treatment groups by a firewalled Curebase staff member who will enter the treatment group assignment on the metaMe platform. A software switch will directly initiate the assigned treatment allocation. The study is double -blinded, which in the context of EASITx means that subjects will not be aware of which treatment (GDH or the comparator) is"

Subjects will complete treatment, per their group assignment and all subsequent data collection will be done without human int ervention via the Curebase platform. The Phase 2 treatment period will initiate within 7 days of the onboarding call. Phase 2 will be initiated with the first treatment session followed by 6 additional treatment sessions occurring every 2 weeks for a tot al of 7 sessions over 12 weeks. Subjects will receive prompts to complete a short practice sessions on the 5th, 8th, and 11th day between treatments. Practice sessions are recommended but not required. Phase 3 begins immediately after completion of Phase 2 treatment period. Subjects will provide 4 weeks of post -treatment symptom data via the ePRO and the Curebase platform. Sym ptoms reported in this run -out period will be used to determine the primary outcome and responder definition and secondary outcomes. Phase 4 begins immediately after completion of Phase 3. Subjects will complete two post -treatment assessment periods and p rovide daily symptom assessments and additional instances of outcomes surveys via the ePRO and the Curebase platform. The LTE 4 -week assessment periods are weeks 35 through 38 and weeks 61 through 64. Compliance with treatment and data entry will be faci litated by email and text message reminders and prompts. Each subject will be compensated for participation and data collection based on a pre -defined schedule with a maximal milestone determined compensation of $525 ( Section 5.5). ePRO symptom data and outcomes surveys will be collected according to a pre-defined schedule ( Table 1 ). Objectives: Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that in adults with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), an all -digital Gut -Directed Hypnotherapy (GDH) treatment program (Regulora) is superior in reducing abdominal pain intensity relative to an all -digita l modified Jacobsonian Muscle Relaxation (MR) treatment program."
8,page_8,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 9 of 132 Confidential Secondary Objectives ● To demonstrate that Regulora has a positive impact on relief of IBS symptoms, quality of life, workplace performance (presenteeism and absenteeism), and psychological distress relative to MR therapy. ● To determine the durability of Regulora in relief of IBS symptoms, quality of life, workplace performance (presenteeism and absenteeism), and psychological distress relative to MR therapy. Exploratory Objective The exploratory objective of this study is to investigate predictors of treatment success using the PHQ -4 and Thought Impact Scale (TIS). Endpoints: Primary Endpoint : The primary endpoint of this study is abdominal pain intensity. The Instrument is a 0 -10 numeric rating scale (NRS, 0= no pain, 10= worst pain). The subject is asked to record their “ worst abdominal pain over the past 24 -hours” . An Abdominal Pain Intensity Responder is defined as a subject whose daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of Phase 3 (weeks 13 through 16) is 30% reduced compared to the daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of Phase 1 (weeks -4 through -1). Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study include: ● Overall mean change from Phase 1 to Phase 3 and Phase 1 to Phase 4 (LTE) in: o Abdominal pain intensity o Abdominal pain frequency o Irritable Bowel Syndrome -Quality of Life questionnaire (IBS -QOL) o Daily stool consistency (IBS -D and IBS -M) o Daily stool frequency (IBS -C) o Workplace Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) ● 12-week trends during Phase 2 in: o Abdominal pain intensity o Abdominal pain frequency o Daily stool consistency"
9,page_9,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 10 of 132 Confidential o Daily stool frequency Secondary Safety Endpoints: Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by comparing adverse events in the treatment arm versus comparator arm. Exploratory Endpoints: ● Prediction of treatment success using the North Carolina Thought Impact Scale (TIS) ● Predi ction of treatment success using the PHQ -4 ● Treatment adherence (number of sessions completed) ● Concomitant IBS Medication ● Blinding Assessment ● Satisfaction questions ● IBS-Adequate relief (IBS -AR) Study Population: Subjects will include men and women of all ethnic and racial groups between 18 and 70 years of age. They must meet Rome IV Diagnostic Criteria (3) for IBS as established by a licensed physician. Number of Subjects: To meet the goal of 380 randomized subjects and 300 evaluable subjects (estimated maximum 20% study dropout rate) we will recruit patients from study physician clinic populations (physicians will be authorized to screen their own subject population for eli gibility) and subjects who have been recruited and prescreened via online, digital channels. We estimate needing to pre -screen several thousand subjects to recruit 760 for enrollment in Phase 1 (baseline assessment and eligibility screening). We expect ~50 % will fail eligibility screening (see Sec. 6.2 Inclusion Criteria ) providing a minimum of 380 subjects for phase 2 (treatment). Inclusion Criteria: To be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria, which are assessed at the Baseline Screening event: 1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form 2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedur es and availability for the duration of the study 3. Male or female, aged 18 -70 4.

In the case of treatment with rifaximin or neomycin, eligibility will be suspended for 12 weeks from the initial date of use. 10. Any condition that an investigator feels may interfere with the conduct of the study Description of Facilities Enrolling Subjects: The EASITx study intends to recruit a highly diverse subject population. To reach these subjects, geographically diverse clinics across no fewer than 10 U.S. states will be enlisted as well as the option for remote virtual study participation. Study physic ians will include office -based primary care physicians (PCPs) and community -based gastroenterologists. All study staff will be trained in Good Clinical Practice, the EASITx study protocol and the use of Curebase (clinical research software). Description of Study Intervention: The metaMe Health digital GDH treatment (Regulora) is an IBS -specific treatment for use on a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer. The GDH treatment module was adapted from a standardized scripted therapist - administered GDH proto col referred to as the North Carolina Protocol. The North Carolina protocol was developed by Dr. Olafur Palsson at the University of North Carolina and has been used for over 20 years as a therapist administered treatment. metaMe health has licensed the pr otocol from the inventor for exclusive use through any electronic means. Duration of Treatment: 12 weeks Period of Evaluation: Total of 28 weeks of active evaluation: Phase 1 (4 weeks of run -in assessment), Phase 2 (12 weeks of treatment and assessment), Phase 3 (4 weeks of run -out assessment), Phase 4 (two 4 -week follow -up assessments at weeks 35 -38 and weeks 61 -64). Subject Duration: 68 weeks"
12,page_12,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 13 of 132 Confidential Statistical Analyses: Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint, proportion of overall pain intensity responders, will be compared between the GDH and MR treatment groups using a Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for IBS subtype and gender. Safety will be summarized using descriptive statistics . Secondary Endpoints Average abdominal pain frequency and average abdominal pain intensity at Week 13 -16 will be statistically compared between GDH and MR using an ANOVA model adjusted for gender and IBS subtype. The least squares (LS) mean estimate of average abdominal pain i ntensity and LS mean difference and associated 95% CIs will be presented with corresponding p - value. Additionally, change from baseline and at -assessment values of average abdominal pain frequency and average abdominal pain intensity will be analyzed at a ll 4-week assessment time periods with a mixed effects repeated measures model (MMRM). Average abdominal pain frequency and average abdominal pain intensity will be summarized descriptively by treatment and time period. Stool consistency response will be analyzed with methods similar to those used to assess the primary endpoint, as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. IBS-QOL, WPAI, PHQ -4 will be analyzed with MMRM and summarized descriptively by treatment and week. See the Statistical Analysis Plan for details regarding all analyses. Sample Size Justification In this study, a total of approximately 380 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to GDH or comparator to ensure that at least 300 subjects complete their Week 13 -16 assessment (Pha se 3) for analysis. Three hundred (300) Phase 3 completers will provide at least 90% power to detect an 18 percentage point difference in response rates between the GDH and comparator treatment groups at the 5% significance level. The study was powered ass uming that the comparator treatment group is expected to"
13,page_13,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 14 of 132 Confidential demonstrate at most a 26% response rate. To determine the expected response rate in the comparator treatment group, two studies of GDH reporting data that utilized dichotomous outcome measures were e xamined. The first ( 9) used an endpoint of % treatment responders (defined as a >50% reduction in IBS -SSS). In this study, 52% of subjects in the GDH group and 26% of subjects in the control group (usual care) were responders . In a more recent study by Flik et al ( 11) these authors reported an adequate relief response rate of 40% in the GDH group compared to 17% in the education -control group. We therefore have assumed that the response rate in t he comparator treatment group in this study is likely to be between 17 -26%."

23,page_23,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 24 of 132 Confidential 3 INTRODUCTION 3.1 Background Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID), affecting approximately 10% of the US adult population ( 1). IBS is characterized by abdominal pain that is often severe and with an onset that is unpredictable. Episodes of pain are associated with altered bowel habits, which define the three main subtypes: IBS -constipation (IBS -C), IBS - diarrhea (IBS -D), and IBS -mixed (IBS -M). A fourth subtype, IBS-undefined (IBS -U), occurs in <5% of IBS patients and defines a group of subjects who do not fall into the 3 diagnostic subtypes but are still considered to have IBS (2). IBS has significa nt effects on quality of life, work performance (presenteeism), and work attendance (absenteeism) ( 3,4,5). IBS is often referred to as a functional disease becaus e X-ray studies, blood tests, and intestinal endoscopy exams are normal. However, upon careful analysis, IBS patients have an increased likelihood of hypersensitive visceral sensory nerve function, abnormalities in the gut microbiome, and central pain proc essing. These are important components of the bidirectional brain -gut control pathway referred to as the brain -gut axis, which is dysfunctional in IBS patients (6). IBS is associated with a number of co -morbid psychological d isorders (somatization, catastrophization, depression, stress, and anxiety) that place an additional strain on subjects and further affect the function of the brain -gut axis ( 7). The treatment of IBS has traditionally includ ed recommendations for dietary changes and over - the-counter medicines, which have modest to no effect on symptoms and do not change the course of the disease. Pharmaceutical drug development has tended to focus on druggable molecular targets that for the m ost part are not implicated in the pathophysiology of the syndrome but that allow for pharmacologic manipulation of intestinal symptoms. The current class of IBS medicines all work locally within the gut and fail to address the psychological drivers of IBS and the alterations in the brain -gut axis. Moreover, in clinical studies and medical practice these drugs have significant side -effects and are marginally effective at best for the treatment of the full constellation of IBS symptoms, particularly abdomina l pain ( 8). In contrast to the modest efficacy observed with pharmaceuticals, non -pharmacologic behavioral treatments that target the psycho -social co -morbidities and brain -gut axis dysfunction have shown high rates of treatm ent response (discussed below). 3.2 Study Rationale Gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) is a form of hypnotherapy that is tailored to address the symptoms of IBS. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the usefulness of hypnotherapy for a wide range of conditions ( 9). Recent large randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that therapist -administered GDH is effective for the treatment of IBS with enduring effects on both abdominal pain and gut symptoms ( 10,11,12). Nevertheless, widespread"
24,page_24,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 25 of 132 Confidential use of GDH has been limited despite strong support from gastroenterology professional organizations ( 13). The reasons for the limited use stem largely from a lack of physician training in hypnother apy, a limited number of trained hypnotherapists and a limited number of hypnotherapy training programs ( 14). There is also the issue of therapist fatigue which occurs after repeated administration of the scripted protocol. The body of scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of GDH in IBS is derived from over 20 studies of therapist -administered GDH, with a reported 50% reduction in gastrointestinal symptom severity and abdominal pain severity (reviewed in 10). The efficacy of GDH in the treatment of IBS has been recently confirmed in a large multicenter randomized controlled trial that examined a standardized GDH protocol, administered either in individual sessions or in group sessions, and c ompared to an IBS education control ( 12). At one -year post treatment, 41% of subjects in the individual therapy and 50% of subjects in the group therapy met the primary endpoint of adequate relief of symptoms compared to 23% of subjects in the control group. GDH was statistically superior to control in both the individual and group hypnotherapy groups demonstrating the flexibility of GDH treatment across treatment environments. In long -term follow -up studies, GDH has shown s ustained effectiveness for up to 5 years after a single course of treatment ( 15). Recent advances in neuroscience and neuroimaging have provided tools needed to unravel the complex central nervous system effects of hypnosis ( 9). It has been suggested that the mechanisms responsible for hypnotherapy -induced improvements in chronic pain, anxiety and mood arise from hypnotic induction and a re -focusing of attention away from the immediate environmen t towards an imaginative involvement. The use of metaphor, parable and story is used to communicate imagery, direct messages, and indirect messages that facilitate the reprograming of the subliminal function of the unconscious mind. In other words, since m ost people with IBS are vigilant and focused on their symptoms, communicating with the unconscious brain entails getting the conscious brain to allow direct dialogue with the subconscious brain, the critical manager of automatic functions such as pain perception. Hypnotherapy provides a hypothetical mechanism for linking the conscious with the unconscious, which in turn facilitates cognitive restructuring, changes in automatic functions involved in gut function and amelioration of associated psychosocial di sorders. Data from a controlled study measuring fMRI signals in IBS patients pre and post -GDH supports this theory and demonstrates that GDH results in normalization of brain activation and fMRI signals, supporting a role for GDH above and beyond improveme nts in mood ( 16). 3.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment 3.3.1 Known Potential Risks Hypnotherapy is generally considered to be safe and low risk. Safety concerns have been proposed based on the observation that subjects with dissociative diso rders (i.e., multiple"
25,page_25,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 26 of 132 Confidential personality disorder) have an enhanced hypnotizability and under hypnosis may adopt an alternate identity or personality state ( 17-19). Elicitation of an alternate personality state and/or repressed memories, which are often past traumatic events, can be a painful experience for subjects. At the same time, it is important to note that hypnosis is used to treat dissociative disorder and the closely related syndrome of post -traumatic stress disorder ( 20). Therefore, the standard approach to minimizing the risk in hypnotherapy studies requires exclusion of subjects with these psychiatric conditions. In a revie w examining data from 7 hypnotherapy trials on ClinicalTrials.gov, it was found that studies that use these exclusion criteria had low rates of treatment -related adverse events (AEs) (<1% non -serious AEs) and no serious adverse events (SAEs) ( 20). Of the treatment -related AEs, there were 2 cases of disturbing images and thoughts and 2 cases of nightmares. A recent large European study confirmed these results: in 300 subjects allocated to therapist -administered GDH there were n o SAEs or AEs that were deemed related to treatment ( 12). It is also believed that the hypnotizability of subjects with active co -morbid psychiatric/mood disorders may be diminished and available literature indicates that s ubjects with these conditions should generally be excluded from clinical trials. Finally, there are anecdotal therapist reports of mild headache, lightheadedness and disorientation that tend to spontaneously resolve within a short period after post -hypnotherapy arousal. As a precaution, subjects will be told to find a quiet place to vi ew the treatment sessions and not to undergo treatment while driving or performing other tasks. 3.3.2 Known Potential Benefits Digital GDH and MR have not been studied and the potential benefits can only be derived from studies and subject reports after thera pist-administration. 3.3.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits The risks of this study are minimal. The primary risks include: ● Possible temporary discomfort from answering personal questions regarding subject health. ● The possibility that subjects may not experience substantial reduction of symptoms or those symptoms may worsen. ● The possibility that subjects may feel sleepy or drowsy for a short while after treatment ● The possibility that subject muscles may feel tight o r ache for a short while after treatment."
26,page_26,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 27 of 132 Confidential If subject IBS symptoms were to change or worsen, subjects may call Curebase or seek advice from the study physician. The staff of Curebase and study physicians will be closely supervised by the Principal Investig ator, Dr. Lucy Pun. The secondary risks include answering symptom survey questions on a daily basis for 7 total months, which may seem burdensome. On the other hand, some volunteers find recording daily symptoms useful and informative. Potential benefits include: ● Free evaluation of IBS from health care professionals. ● Free treatment for IBS. ● Possibility of reduction in the frequency, duration, and severity of IBS and related problems. ● Relaxation and a sense of well -being"

The Instrument is a 11 -point numeric rating scale (0= no pain, 10= worst pain). The subject is asked to record their “ worst abdominal pain over the past 24 -hours” . An Abdominal Pain Int ensity Responder is defined as a subject whose daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of Phase 3 (weeks 13 through 16) is 30% reduced compared to the daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of the Phase 1 (weeks -4 throug h -1). 4.2.2 Secondary Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints of this study include: ● Overall mean change from Phase 1 to Phase 3 and Phase 1 to Phase 4 (LTE) in:"

29,page_29,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 30 of 132 Confidential 5 STUDY DESIGN 5.1 Overall Design EASITx is a pivotal study of digital GDH (Regulora), a novel digital therapeutic that delivers the North Carolina GDH treatment protocol to IBS subjects. EASITx tests the hypothesis that the digital version of the North Carolina GDH treatment protocol is s afe and, relative to a comparator treatment platform, enables a clinically significant reduction in abdominal pain intensity and other symptoms of IBS. EASITx is a pivotal medical device study, and digital GDH is classified as Software as a Medical Device (SaaMD). The North Carolina GDH treatment protocol consists of 7 unique GDH scripts, each approximately 30 minutes in length and a single practice session, approximately 13 minutes in length. Each script has been converted to a video/audio recording allo wing for administration via a mobile device, tablet, or personal computer, mimicking the frequency and duration of administration of therapist -administered GDH. The EASITx study will apply state -of-the-art IBS and behavioral research methodology including use of a fully digital treatment platform, a comparator allowing for subject -blinding to treatment hypothesis, and a data collection (ePRO) system that allows fo r a double blind, eliminating the potential for investigator bias. The comparator -treatment platform will be identical to the GDH treatment platform, except that muscle relaxation (MR) audio recordings equal in treatment duration and frequency of administr ation will be substituted for the GDH video/audio recordings. MR was chosen as the control after consultation with the FDA. Participation in the EASITx study will last 68 weeks and is divided into 4 phases: ● Phase 1: A 4 -week pre -treatment run -in assessm ent period (weeks -4 through -1) ● Phase 2: A 12 -week treatment period (weeks 1 through 12) ● Phase 3: A 4 -week post -treatment assessment period (weeks 13 through 16) ● Phase 4: A 52 -week post -treatment long term extension (LTE) during which time subjects will be required to complete two 4 -week assessment periods starting 5 months post-treatment (weeks 35 through 38) and 11 months post -treatment (weeks 61 through 64). Participation begins with the completion of an online prescreening eligibility survey via Cure base, a clinical research software platform, followed by an online informed consent. Subjects who pass prescreening and sign the informed consent will attend a baseline visit with a study physician. At this visit, their IBS diagnosis will be confirmed, inc lusion and exclusion criteria will be applied, and experimental baseline endpoints will be collected in the form of subject -facing surveys."
30,page_30,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 31 of 132 Confidential After the baseline visit, subjects will enter Phase 1 a 4 -week run -in period. During Phase 1, subjects will assess their IBS symptoms daily and record them digitally via the Curebase ePRO from their mobile phone, tablet device, or personal computer. This run -in period will establish that subjects are committed to participation (by assessing their ability to consistentl y and accurately input data into Curebase), and also establish that they have the minimally required level of IBS symptom severity. Once the run -in is completed, ineligible subjects will be informed. Eligible subjects will receive an “Onboarding Call” fro m a member of the Curebase study staff. This call will be used to inform subjects of eligibility, create a user account on the EASITx treatment website. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups in a double -blind scheme, in which only the Curebase Staf f member is aware of the group assignment. This staff member will enter the treatment group assignment on the metaMe platform and ensures that the correct treatment allocation is initiated. In the EASITx randomization scheme, subjects will either receive the digital GDH intervention or the muscle relaxation therapy delivered through the same digital delivery platform (comparator treatment arm). As described in Section 7.2, the study is double -blinded such that subjects, metaMe staff, and investigators will have no knowledge of group assignments (see designated firewalled exceptions in Section 7.2). Participants will complete treatment per their group assignment over the course of 12 weeks and track their symptoms daily via Curebase. All study activities may be fully remote and can be completed from home. The baseline visit may be conducted in -person per the participant’s preference. The Phase 2 treatment period will include 7 unique sessions (GDH or MR) of ~30 minutes each, every other week over the 12 -week treatment period. During treatment, a practice session (GDH or MR) will be made available to the subjects, with an email encouraging completion of practice on the 5th, 8th, and 11th day between treatment sessions. Subjects will be required to complete assessments according to the schedule in Table 1 . Data collected in the Phase 3 post -treatment assessment period (run -out period) and the Phase 4 LTE will be compared to data collected in the Phase 1 pre -treatment assessment period (run -in period). Subjects will complete daily symptom assessments and addi tional instances of the concomitant medication check list, PHQ -4, IBS -QOL and WPAI outcomes surveys according to the schedule in Table 1 . The EASITx study seeks to enroll subjects from no fewer than 10 medical clinics across several U.S. states to capture a geographically diverse IBS population. Subjects will be recruited from existing practices and via online recruitment."
31,page_31,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 32 of 132 Confidential 5.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 5.2.1 Rationale for Treatment Frequency The 7 digital GDH treatments that compose the North Carolina GDH protocol are administered every other week. The frequency of treatment administration in this study was chosen to mirror the protocol used in studies of the North Carolina protocol when admin istered by therapists in face-to-face treatment sessions ( 9, 27). The practice sessions are designed to be administered as needed to support engagement, however, there is no evidence that practi ce sessions modulate treatment outcome. The treatment frequency of the comparator control will exactly mirror the frequency of GDH treatments and practice sessions. 5.2.2 Rationale for Comparator Control The Jacobsonian Muscle Relaxation (JMR) ( 9) protocol leverages a fully digital platform, which allows delivery in a video or audio format. This configuration allows for the blinding of subjects to the randomized treatment since muscle relaxation is a credible behavioral treatment. Currently in the US, there are no approved digital behavioral therapeutics for the treatment of IBS. 5.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints The primary and key secondary endpoints were derived from the FDA guidance on the development of pharmaceuticals for the treatme nt of IBS ( 28). The WPAI and IBS -QOL are validated measures for IBS. The PHQ -4 is a validated four -item questionnaire for anxiety and depression ( 24). 5.3 Premature Termination or Suspension of Stu dy 5.3.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study The study will be completed as planned unless either of the following criteria are satisfied that require temporary suspension or early termination of the study. a) Evidence of a serious clinical problem that would put subjects exposed to treatment (either GDH or MR) at risk b) Significant violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to achieve the primary study objectives 6 STUDY POPULATION 6.1 Screening Events Study eligibility is determined at 3 distinct events for the study. These events are:"
32,page_32,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 33 of 132 Confidential 1. Online pre -screening assessment includes a brief inclusion and exclusion criteria and technology assessment (subjects are eligible if they use an iOS or Android smartphone or iOS (iPad) tablet released in 2015 or later). 2. Baseline Screening/Study Physician Visit. The subject’s IBS diagno sis and general medical history is confirmed, and complete inclusion/exclusion criteria are applied to assess preliminary eligibility. 3. Day 0 Screening. After the 4 week symptom tracking (Phase 1) the subject’s full eligibility for the study is confirmed us ing data from symptom tracking completed over those 4 weeks. Subjects that fail to screen -in will be notified that they are ineligible. Subjects that screen -in will be scheduled for a Day 0 phone call and informed of their eligibility. The relationship be tween the 3 screening events and Phase 1 symptom tracking is shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2 Study Screening Abbreviations: IBS=irritable bowel syndrome. Only subjects who meet the screening criteria for both screening events will be permitted to initiate treatment in the study. 6.2 Inclusion Criteria To be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria, which are assessed at the Baseline Screening event (see previous section): 1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form 2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the duration of the study 3. Male or female, aged 18 -70 4. Confirmation of the IBS and IBS subtype diagnosis by a study physician using Rome IV diagnostic criteria (see Appendix A ) 5. Possess an iOS or Android smartphone or an iOS tablet (iPad) released in 2015 or later. 6. Agreement to input information about their abd ominal pain and bowel movements on a daily basis into Curebase software 7. Agreement to have their anonymized data stored in the cloud for up to 2 years after the conclusion of the study, and to have the data used for research purposes. On-line preliminary Eligibility Device Eligibility Schedule Baseline Screening Study Physician Baseline Screening Confirm IBS diagnosis by Rome IV criteria Assess inclusion and exclusion criteria Phase 1: Symptom Tracking Subjects contribute daily IBS symptom data for 4 weeks via Curebase.

33,page_33,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 34 of 132 Confidential 8. Agreement to maintain stable dosage of IBS medications during the course of treatment and not to add new IBS medication or stop current IBS medications unless directed to do so by the subjects treating physician. Changes in treatment will be captured using a concomitant medicat ion assessment. At the Day 0 Screening event, subjects must also meet the following criteria: 1. Average “Worst Daily Pain Severity” of >3 on an 11 -point NRS over the full 28 -day symptom tracking period 2. Consistent submission of Pain Severity scores via the Curebase app (data submitted on 70% or more of days in the symptom tracking window) This study attempts to achieve excellent representa tion of women and minorities in the enrolled population, and there are no restrictions on eligibility based on the subject’s sex, gender, or race. Please see Section 5.5 for information about how women and minorities will be recruited into the study. 6.3 Exclusion Criteria An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: 1. Evidence of current structural intestinal abnormalities that better explain the subject’s IBS symptoms (e.g., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis, prior abdominal surgeries such as weight loss surgery or bowe l resection). 2. Medication use, other illnesses or conditions that can explain their gastrointestinal symptoms e.g., regular narcotic use or dependency, OTC stimulant laxative dependence (e.g., progressively larger doses of senna or bisacodyl containing com pounds are needed to produce a bowel movement), radiation to the abdomen. 3. Diagnosed and/or treated for a malignancy within the past 5 years (other than localized basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin). 4. Current psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, or cognit ive behavioral therapy (CBT) for IBS 5. Inability to commit to completing all treatment sessions. 6. Have an unstable extraintestinal condition whose immediate or foreseeable treatment needs would realistic ally interfere with study demands, e.g., ability to part icipate in online treatment sessions or follow daily diary. 7. Active: post -traumatic stress disorder, depression associated with high risk of suicidal behavior, psychotic or delusional disorders, dissociative disorders, or gross cognitive impairment. This exclusion does not apply to anxiety or bipolar disorder . 8. Subje cts that report a current gastrointestinal infection or an infection within the 4 weeks prior to the evaluation that would otherwise obscure IBS symptoms. In cases of gastrointestinal infection baseline eva luation will be delayed a minimum of 4 weeks until after complete recovery."
34,page_34,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 35 of 132 Confidential 9. Current or recent use of a gut -targeted antibiotic such as Neomycin or Rifaximin during the 12 weeks prior to baseline assessment. In the case of treatment with rifaximin or neomycin, eligibility will be suspended for 12 weeks fr om the initial date of use. 10. Any condition that an investigator feels may interfere with the conduct of the study These exclusion criteria do not present meaningful exclusion of minority populations and do not present a threat to population diversity with respect to race, gender, or age. 6.4 Screen Failures Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participa te in the clinical study but are not subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects, to meet the Consolida ted Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. The primary reason for screen failure, demographics and other minimal information is recorded in the eCRF using the following categor ies: ● AE ● Did not meet inclusion criteria or did meet exclusion criteria (specify reason) ● Significant protocol deviation ● Lost to follow -up during baseline screening ● Voluntary withdrawal (specify reason) ● Study termination Subject ID numbers assigned to subje cts who fail screening will not be reused for a different subject. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) because of a conflicting psychological treatment for IBS, either for IBS or another condition refer enced in the exclusion criteria (e.g. gastrointestinal infection) may be rescreened after the period of time indicated in the exclusion criteria (See Section 5.3 ). Rescreened subjects should be assigned the same subject number as for the initial screening. 6.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention The study seeks to enroll adult subjects, ages 18 to 70 years of age, who have a confirmed diagnosis of IBS via the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. To meet the enrollment goal of approximately 380 randomized subjects and 300 evaluable subjects (estimated maximum 20% study dropout rate) patients will be recruited from participating clinic populations (study physicians will be authorized to screen their own subject population for eligibility) and subjects who have been recruited and prescreened via online, digital channels."
35,page_35,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 36 of 132 Confidential Planned traditional recruitment channels include: ● Distribution of flyers to our clinics ● Distribution of flyers to university health centers ● Informational outbound phone calls to subjects from study staff ● Referrals by family members of subjects to the study Planned digital recruitment channels include: ● Social media community groups ● Facebook ● Craigslist ● Instagram It is desirable to enroll many minorities and women and create a diverse population. 60 -65% of IBS subjects are female. No special action will be employed to ensure adequate female enrollment. Subjects will be compensated for participation in the study. Participants will receive their compensation payments via Curebase so long as they continue to contribute data consistently. Payments will be withheld for subjects that fail to complete >5 out of 7 of the weekly abdominal pain score surveys. Participants will be provided a warning after they miss 1 of the weekly data collection points. 7 STUDY INTERVENTION 7.1 Study Intervention Administration 7.1.1 Study Intervention Description The metaMe Health digital GDH product for IBS is named Regulora. Regulora is an IBS - specific treatment platform delivered via a smartphone, tablet, or personal computer. The delivery platform for EASITx is a mobile app available in the Apple and Android ap p stores under the name of EAGLEFISH. The GDH treatment module was adapted from a standardized scripted therapist -administered GDH protocol referred to as the North Carolina Protocol ( 10,27). The North Carolina protocol has been licensed by metaMe Health from the inventor (Dr. Olafur Palsson) for exclusive use through any electronic means."
36,page_36,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 37 of 132 Confidential The North Carolina protocol differs from standard hypnotherapy through the use of intensive relaxation metho dology, IBS -specific use of metaphor, symptom imagery, and direct and indirect suggestion ( 27). The North Carolina protocol consists of 7 unique treatment sessions each lasting ~30 minutes provided every -other week over 12 we eks. The first half of the 30 -minute treatment session is spent producing deep physical and autonomic relaxation, along with a mental state of narrowed focus of attention and heightened receptivity to suggestions, commonly referred to as the trance state. This is followed by the use of metaphorical storytelling, and a combination of direct and indirect suggestions targeted at somatic control and perception mechanisms that influence IBS symptoms. The treatment sessions are iterative and progressively build r elaxation skills, which are required to maximally incorporate the disease -specific aspects of treatment. Subjects become familiar with the use of hypnotherapy tools such as counting and the use of imagery focused on the senses, i.e., touch, smell, sight an d hearing (see Appendix B for scripts of the 7 sessions). As treatment sessions progress, direct suggestion and metaphor are used to overcome the exaggerated response to pain signals imparted by the anticipatory response to IBS symptoms. The comparator c ontrol group will listen to digital video/audio recordings of 7 guided muscle relaxation (MR) sessions of approximately equivalent length to the GDH sessions (see Appendix D for session scripts), as well as a daily practice session approximately equivalent in length to the GDH practice sessions (see Appendix E for script) ( 9). Guided MR was chosen as the comparator control treatment after consultation with the FDA because of (a) the ease with which it can be adapted to a digita l format and support the creation of a comparator treatment and (b) credibility as a treatment for IBS albeit with limited demonstrated efficacy ( 9). The GDH and MR treatment modules consist of seven ~30 -minute digital video and audio recordings of a female therapist. The video component of the treatment sessions occurs at the beginning of the treatment session and is used to simulate the face -to-face interaction of the therapist encounter. The video component is short and typ ically lasts less than 5 minutes before the screen goes black and subjects are taken through the audio component of treatment. The digital production of the GDH and MR scripts was a verbatim reading. In the case of the GDH scripts the therapist reader prov ided hypnotherapy -appropriate speech patterns (inflection, pause, and tone). Once therapy is initiated, subjects receive all 7 treatment sessions, every other week for a total treatment period of 12 weeks. During the 13 days between treatment sessions, a s hort audio session referred to as a “practice session” is made available to subjects. There is a single practice session script for each of the two treatment arms lasting 15 minutes. Subjects receive text message and email reminders with a recommendation t o complete a minimum of three practice sessions during the 13 days between treatments. Practice sessions are recommended but not required (see Appendix C and Appendix E: Daily Practice Sessions)."
37,page_37,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 38 of 132 Confidential The metaMe treatment platform also tracks subject use and progress with treatment modules. For example, the exact time that a subject starts and stops a treatment or practice module is captured by the treatment platform. The software also tracks treatment sessions and only allows subjects to access treatments in sequence. The metaMe treatment platform on the EAGLEFISH app contains these major functional elements: 1. Treatment videos/audios 2. A secure cloud -based data repository. 3. A simple user interface (UI) with an arrow play button that starts the treatment session. (see Figure 3) In addition to the EAGLEFISH app, subjects enrolled in the EASITx study will be required to enter study data i n a second platform. The Curebase platform is for data collection and administers the daily ePRO and provides access to periodic surveys. Subjects will be introduced to the Curebase platform at the baseline screening clinic visit by the research study staf f. Study staff will explain the use of the app and the process by which subjects will enter data in the ePRO. After completion of the 4 -week run -in period (Phase 1), subjects will be informed of eligibility, and eligible subjects will be scheduled for a d ay 0 phone call (scheduled as soon as possible but no more than 14 days from completion of the run -in period). On the day 0 phone call, after a subject is randomized, the Curebase staff will confirm the subject’s preferred day of the week, time of day and start date for treatment. Curebase staff will enter the treatment schedule and randomization code (blinded treatment allocation) into a secure metaMe portal that automatically triggers the assigned treatment and the subject -specific treatment reminder and scheduling system. Curebase staff will assist subjects in accessing the metaMe digital platform by guiding them through the process of creating a metaMe login username and password and reviewing the process for accessing the treatment app. Subjects will be guided through the login process and directed to the navigation menu. The navigation menu contains the following items: 1. The home button 2. Account information 3. Treatment schedule 4. Logout 5. Help section. Contains a link to watch or read a transcript to the intro video (see below), FAQ and contact information for technical support and problems with treatment. The treatment process will commence within 7 days of the day 0 call and will be init iated by system -generated text and email reminders of upcoming treatment sessions. Subjects will be sent an email reminder 24 hours and 1 hour before each session, and a text message reminder 5 minutes before each session. Subjects will be able to access t he treatment app via a hyperlink in these messages or directly by opening the app on their device. Once in the app, subjects will"
38,page_38,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 39 of 132 Confidential initiate treatment by pressing the large arrow start button on the home screen (see User Guide and Figure 3) . The first thing subjects will see is a short 3 -minute intro video that explains the following details of treatment: 1. Treatment session length 2. The treatment reminder system, which uses emails and text messages to alert subjects of upcoming treatment sessions and to remind subjects to complete treatment. 3. The process for rescheduling and managing missed treatment sessions (subjects have 3 additiona l days to complete the treatment before they are considered a missed treatment) 4. Rules on interrupted treatment sessions (subjects must start over from the beginning and have 3 opportunities to finish the treatment before they are considered a missed treatm ent) 5. The recommended minimum number of practice sessions is 3 over the 13 days between treatments. There are two intro videos customized to each of the two treatments. They differ in the treatment -specific instructions; in the case of the GDH treatment, the video has specific instructions on how to manage re -alerting after hypnotherapy (see Appendix F ). In the case of the MR treatment, subjects are given guidance on how to manage muscle -specific complaints (see Appendix G ) After the completion of the treatment session, subjects will be instructed to click a button indicating they have completed the session. This button appears upon completion of 100% of the length of the treatment session. A sess ion is also considered completed if greater than 95% of the video is played and no button is pressed by midnight of that day local time. Subjects who miss their scheduled treatment will have 3 additional days in which to complete the treatment. They will r eceive daily text and email reminders to complete treatment. If after 3 days the subject has not completed the treatment session they will be locked out of that treatment and it will be scored as a missed treatment session. Similarly, subjects will receive a one -time reminder about Practice sessions on the 5th, 8th, and 11th day after each treatment. Subjects will be allowed to access one practice session per day for as many non -treatment days as they like but they will only receive 3 reminders at the indic ated days. The subject experience with the EAGLEFISH app is illustrated in the User Guide and briefly in Figure 3 ."
39,page_39,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 40 of 132 Confidential Figure 3 metaMe Treatment Visual Narrative EAGLEFISH User Interface (UI) When subjects open the EAGLEFISH app, the main screen appears. The large arrow button, when clicked, is used to access treatment and practice sessions. The first time the button is pressed, the patient will view the introduction video, which is required vi ewing before the first treatment session and optional thereafter. The app is programmed so that the appropriate content (a treatment or practice session) is displayed each day. Subjects are prevented from re -taking treatment sessions, and subjects cannot a ccess practice sessions on days they have a treatment available (the assigned treatment day plus 3 days in the case that subjects miss treatment on their assigned treatment day). Subjects will be required to complete the treatment/practice session in a single sitting. If the subject is interrupted during treatment, the subject may press the “begin again” button, which starts the session over from the beginning. In this case, subjects will be required to re -start the treatment/practice session from the begin ning. Subjects will have 3 days after the initial treatment day to complete treatment sessions. After the treatment/practice session video has played to 100% of its length, subjects may indicate that they have completed the session by clicking on the “Comp lete Session” button. A session is also considered completed if greater than 95% of the video is played and no button is pressed by midnight of that day local time. 7.2 Measures to Minimize Bias: Blinding and Randomization 7.2.1 Blinding Blinding of participants to treatment in a psychological or behavioral intervention is generally not possible. By the nature of the intervention, subjects are aware of the type of intervention they are receiving. Instead, in studies involving a psychological or behavioral intervention, blinding the participants to the hypothesis being evaluated in the study is considered the best and most practical strategy for preventing study bias. The EASITx study incorporates this blinding strategy coupled with state -of-the-art IBS and behavioral research methodology. The comparator -treatment platform will be identical to the GDH treatment platform, except that muscle relaxation (MR) audio recordings equal in treatment duration and frequency of"
40,page_40,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 41 of 132 Confidential administration will be substituted for the GDH video/audio recordings. The comparator control group will listen to digital audio recordings of 7 guided muscle relaxation (MR) sessions of approximately equivalent lengt h to the GDH sessions (see Appendix D for session scripts), as well as a daily practice session approximately equivalent in length to the GDH practice sessions (see Appendix E for script) (9). Guided MR was chosen as the comparator control treatment after consultation with the FDA because of (a) the ease with which it can be adapted to a digital format and support the creation of a comparator treatment and (b) credibility as a treatment for IBS albeit with limited demonstrated efficacy (9). The goal of this blinding strategy is to present two treatments that are credible to the study participants, who are themselves unaware of what the other study arm is, whether their assigned treatment (GDH or MR) is the one under study being compared to the other arm, or indeed whether both are active treatments being compared to each other. The data collection (ePRO) system creates a double blind and eliminates the potential for investigator bias. metaMe staff and investigators will not have knowledge of group assignmen ts, with the following exceptions: ● An independent statistician who will formulate the randomization tables. ● A firewalled Curebase staff member who will enter the treatment group assignment on the metaMe platform. ● A firewalled metaMe staff member (the CTO ) who will monitor technical aspects of the study to ensure technical compliance to the protocol and in this capacity may have access to participant randomization assignments. 7.2.2 Randomization Code Creation and Procedure Following successful completion of the run -in period, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either GDH or comparator MR treatment. Randomization will be stratified by gender and IBS subtype. Eight separate randomization schedules will be generated to account for the stratification (Male/IBS IBS -C, Male/IBS -D, Male/IBS -M, Male/IBS -U, Female/IBS -C, Female/IBS -D, Female/IBS -M, Female/IBS -U). Additionally, continuous monitoring of enrollment will occur to ensure that at least approximately 20% of the randomized po pulation is male and at least approximately 25% of the randomized population includes each of the three major IBS subtypes (IBS -C, IBS -D, and IBS -M). Screening of female subjects will be discontinued if approximately 270 female subjects are randomized. If randomization into a particular IBS subtype reaches approximately 144 subjects, then screening of subjects with that particular IBS subtype will be temporarily discontinued until the IBS subtypes lacking enrollment have randomized approximately 90 subjects . Finally, if randomization into the rare IBS -U subtype reaches 20 total subjects, enrollment will be discontinued for that subtype."
41,page_41,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 42 of 132 Confidential The randomization schedule will be prepared by an unblinded statistician before the start of the study. As this is a doubl e-blind study, only unblinded personnel (unblinded statistician, Curebase randomization staff) will have access to the randomization schedule before official unblinding of treatment assignment post database lock. Randomization will occur during the “Onbo arding Call” when a member of the Curebase randomization staff will enter the treatment group allocation on the metaMe platform. No subject will be randomized into this study more than once. All randomization information will be stored in a secured area, a ccessible only by authorized personnel. 7.2.3 Unblinding and Decoding Procedure The study treatment blind shall not be broken unless i nformation concerning the study treatment is necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. In the event of a medical emergency, if possible, the medical monitor should be contacted before the study treatment blind is broken to discuss the need for un blinding. The sponsor must be notified as soon as possible if the study treatment blind is broken and record the date and time. The study treatment can be unblinded by the designated unblinded Curebase staff member. The reason, time and date the blind is broken must be recorded in the eCRF. 7.3 Participant compliance to Study Intervention Curebase will store all study subject -reported data generated through the Curebase web application on a secure and HIPAA -compliant database. However, subject adherence dat a, defined as completion of required treatment sessions and numbers of practice sessions will be generated by our video server, Wistia. Wistia is a video hosting service that is able to securely keep and record detailed information about when and how long videos are accessed by a given user. Wistia -generated usage data is anonymously generated and stored and is transferred to metaMe through an API and matched to a subject ID (email address) on metaMe servers. Linking usage data to email address is a necessa ry part of the metaMe notification and treatment tracking system. Usage data is used to generate adherence information that is in turn used to send reminders and prompts for a missed treatment session. Note that most other subject notifications like appoin tment reminders are generated based on the treatment schedule, not real -time adherence data. The adherence data is also used to ensure that the proper treatment content is available at the correct time and in the correct sequence. For example, the app may use the data from Wistia to determine if a session has been completed on the scheduled day; if it is not, the session remains available to the subject throughout the treatment window. If the session is completed, a practice session is made available the fo llowing day. Each day, all adherence data is transferred to the Curebase platform and stored. Curebase will provide long -term, HIPAA"
42,page_42,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 43 of 132 Confidential compliant storage of adherence data for use in later analysis. Intervention compliance will be calculated by determining th e number of completed treatment sessions and the number of completed practice sessions for each subject. We also will collect related contextual data, such as how much of the video was watched per attempt, whether the session was restarted at any point, whether the session was rescheduled, and whether the session was viewed late (after the scheduled day). 7.4 Concomitant Therapy Requirements and proscriptions on concomitant therapy are outlined in the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria ( Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 ). Concomitant medication is any drug given in addition to the study treatment. These may be prescribed by a physician or obtained by the subject over the counter and are not provided by the sponsor. Subjects will be allowed to continue use of any concomit ant IBS medications including probiotic supplements as permitted by the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects are required to maintain a stable dose during the treatment period unless otherwise advised by a physician. Changes to concomitant medi cations shall be evaluated at the predetermined timepoints. Dosage and frequency of treatment will be collected at the beginning of the study and again at week 8, 16, 38 and 64. Concomitant medication therapy will be coded using the WHO - DDE Medical Coding Dictionary."
43,page_43,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 44 of 132 Confidential 8 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL 8.1 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject GDH is a non -significant risk behavioral intervention. Given this, there are no foreseeable safety -related reasons to discontinue the study. Subjects may freely withdraw their individual participation in the study at any time. However, in case there is a r eason for discontinuation or withdrawal of the subject from the study this should be recorded in the eCRF using the following categories (for screen failure subjects, refer to Section 5.4 ): 1. Treatment discontinuation due to an AE. The subject has experience d an AE that in the opinion of the investigator may expose them to undue risk or could interfere with his/her continued participation in the study. 2. Important protocol deviation. The discovery post randomization that the subject failed to meet protocol entr y criteria or did not adhere to protocol requirements, and continued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health, following consultation with the sponsor or designee. 3. Lost to follow -up. The subject stops responding to requests and rem inders for data collection or treatment and attempts to contact the subject were unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented in the subject’s electronic source documents. 4. Voluntary withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally accepta ble representative) wishes to withdraw from the study. The reason for withdrawal, if provided, must be recorded in the eCRF. Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and where possible, the primary underlying reason should be recorded (i.e., withdrawal due to an AE should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category. Similarly, lack of efficacy should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category). 5. Study termination. The sponsor, IRB, or regu latory agency terminates the study. 6. Subject is found to have a life -threatening medical illness or serious mental health disorder 7. Any other clinical event or finding that, in the opinion of the study team, jeopardizes subject safety, privacy, or the scient ific validity of the study. 8.2 Procedures for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject The investigator may discontinue a subject’s study participation at any time during the study when the subject meets the study termination criteria described in Section 8.1. In addition, a subject may discontinue his or her participation without giving a r eason at any time during the study. Should a subject’s participation be discontinued, the primary criterion for termination must be recorded by the investigator. Subjects withdrawn by the sponsor due to investigator error in applying protocol inclusion/exc lusion criteria or technical issues in the Curebase software that"
44,page_44,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 45 of 132 Confidential prevent appropriate execution of the trial will be replaced. Otherwise, subjects will not be replaced . 8.3 Lost to Follow -Up When a subject misses a required treatment session, there is a 3 -day grace period during which subjects can access treatment from the app. During this time, subject will receive email and text message reminders to complete treatment. Similarly, subjects th at miss a data collection point will be contacted by Curebase via email and phone and in the case of surveys, Curebase will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed data collection as soon as possible. The study physician staff and Curebase will counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. Subjects that do not respond to contact attempts and do not complete the minimum number of surveys in phase 3 will be classified as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan ."
45,page_45,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 46 of 132 Confidential Study Assessments and Procedures 8.4 Efficacy Assessments The efficacy of GDH will be established using a set of patient -reported outcomes (PROs). These include PROs to capture: ● Abdominal Pain ● Stool Consistency The primary endpoint of EASITx is abdominal pain, and as such the most important PRO instrument in the study is the Abdominal Pain Daily Survey. Stool frequency and consistency are secondary endpoints of EASITx, so the second -most important PRO instrument in the study is the Daily Stool Consistency Diary, which uses the Bristol Stool Scale Form. Other PROs are assessed at baseline (Week -4), the final week of Phase 3 (week 16), and via the LTE questionnaires at 6 -months post -treatment (week 38) and 12 -months post -treatment (week 64). These include: ● IBS Quality of Life ● TIS (measured at baseline only) ● WPAI (also at week 8) ● PHQ -4 ● Adequate Relief The Satisfaction Questions will be asked only during the last week of Phase 3 (week 16). Certain endpoints will b e calculated based on the data input via the PROs. These include: ● Stool frequency ● Pain frequency During the baseline visit, physicians will obtain questions regarding the subject’s medical history; for example, physicians will inquire about prior treatments for IBS and history of taking medications that may conflict with the eligibility criteria for t he study. However, no medical records or EMR -originating source documentation will be collected. The IBS diagnosis is established at the baseline visit via Rome IV criteria. There is no imaging or laboratory testing required in the study and all endpoints are obtained via PROs via the Curebase software. All subjects who enroll in EASITx will electronically sign a HIPAA Authorization Form, which permits the use of a pseudonymized form of their data to be used for research purposes."
46,page_46,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 47 of 132 Confidential 8.4.1 Daily Abdominal Pain Int ensity The daily pain intensity measurement is recorded at approximately the same time each day and is the worst abdominal pain score for the previous 24 -hour period using the 11 -point NRS of pain intensity. 8.4.2 Daily Abdominal Pain Frequency The daily pain frequency measurement is derived from the daily pain intensity measurement. Days where severity is >0 are considered a day with pain and are recorded as positive. Days with a score of 0 are days without pain. 8.4.3 Daily Stool Consistency The daily stool cons istency measurement is based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS). The BSFS is a scale with pictures and associated descriptions of stools with different consistency. The stool consistency is designated on the scale as 1 (separate hard lumps) to 7 (water y, no solid pieces) and is recorded at approximately the same time each day by referring to pictures and verbal descriptors in the Curebase ePRO ( 29). Subjects will be asked for the number of bowel movements in the previous 24 hours. For days where subjects report >1 bowel movement they will use the BSFS to score the worst stool in the preceding 24 h period. 8.4.4 Daily Stool Frequency All subjects will record the daily number of bowel movements for the previous 24 -hour period. 8.4.5 IBS-QOL The IBS -QOL is a 34 -item questionnaire ( 21). The items are summed and transformed to a 0 - 100-point scale. Higher scores in dicate better IBS quality of life. The mean IBS -QOL score measured at weeks 16, 38, and 64 will be used for comparison. 8.4.6 WPAI The WPAI is a 6 -question survey of presenteeism and absenteeism ( 22). Because it has a recall period of 7 days, it will be measured at the baseline screening visit, week 8, week 16, and again during the LTE at weeks 38 and 64. 8.4.7 TIS The TIS is a 17 -item questionnaire of personal characteristics thought to be related to therapeutic response to clinical hypnosis ( 23). TIS will be measured at baseline in the pre -treatment run -in period and used to model outc omes at treatment completion."
47,page_47,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 48 of 132 Confidential 8.4.8 PHQ -4 The PHQ -4 is a simple 4 item measure of anxiety (2 items) and depression (2 items) ( 24). Each item is scored on a 4 -point (0 -3) NRS and the items are summed to give a total score ranging from 0 -12. The total score provides an assessment of psychological distress. The 2 -item anxiety and depression scales can also be scored and scores of 3 or greater are considered positive for screening purposes. The PHQ -4 will be measured at baseline in the Phase 1 pre -treatment run -in period, week 16 (Phase 3), week 38, and at week 64 in the LTE. 8.4.9 Adequate Relief Question The following question will be asked during week 16, 38, and 64 via the Curebase data collection (ePRO) system: ● On average, over the past 2 weeks have you had adequate relief of your IBS symptoms? (Y/N) 8.4.10 Satisfaction Questions The following questions will be asked during the last week of Phase 3 (week 16) via the Curebase data collection (ePRO) system: ● Overall, how satisfied were you with the therapy you received? (1 -5 scale) ● Would you recommend the therapy you received to someone with IBS? (Y/N) ● Would you recommend using the therapy you received before trying a prescription drug? (Y/N) 8.5 Safety and Other Assessments Safety will be assessed using AE reporting (see Section 9.3 ). 8.5.1 Concomitant Medication/Therapy Concomitant medications and treatment will be collected at the baseline screening visit, week 8 and week 16. Concomitant medications and treatment us e will also be collected at week at 38 and 64 in the LTE. The following information will be collected: 1. Concomitant Medications a. Medication name b. Indication c. Medication form (e.g., tablet, capsule, etc.) d. Medication dose units (e.g., gram, IU, etc.) e. Medication schedule (e.g., QD, BID, etc.) f. Start date g. End date 2.

Start date e. End date 8.5.2 Blinding Assessment Subject blinding will be assessed in the last week of Phase 3 using the following question: Even if you do not feel you received benefit from your treatment program, do you believe the program you received could be beneficial to others with IBS? Answers will be on a 7 -point NRS, with the following guidelines: 1 – Definitely could not help others with IBS 4 – May or may not help others with IBS 7 – Definitely could help others with IBS Given that this study is hypothesis blinded, the blinding assessment is designed to assess the credibility of the treatment and the credibility of the comparator as a treatment for IBS. 8.6 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 8.6.1 Definition of Adverse Event s Adverse event1 means any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs in subjects, whether or not related to the investigational medical device (21 CFR 312.32 (a)). In the context of the investigational device, an AE constitutes: ● any unintentional, unfavorable clinical sign or symptom, including complications of IBS (but not IBS itself). ● any new illness or disease or the deterioration of existing IBS 1 ISO14155 and 21 CFR 812"
49,page_49,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 50 of 132 Confidential ● any clinically si gnificant deterioration in any clinical assessment or outcome measure ● Any adverse event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use, the deployment, the installation, the operation or any malfunction of the investigational me dical device. This includes any event that is a result of a use error or intentional abnormal use of the investigational medical device Pre-existing conditions (unless worsened significantly during treatment) or routine diagnostic and therapeutic procedures normally administered in the treatment of IBS do not constitute AEs. AEs will be collected from the time a subject signs the informed consent until study withdrawal, screen failure, or study completion. If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after ongoing treatment, the worsening or complication should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators should ensure that t he AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of…”). In this study, it is possible that some subjects may experience a worsening of IBS symptoms. As the primary endpoint of this study, worsening of IBS symptoms is captured as part of the efficacy parameter. Worsening of IBS symptoms should not be considered an AE unless the worsening of the symptoms is associated with a cause other than the subject’s IBS. All AEs that occur in study subjects during the AE reporting period spec ified in the protocol must be reported, WHETHER OR NOT THE EVENT IS CONSIDERED RELATED TO THE STUDY TREATMENT. NONSERIOUS AEs are to be documented on the AE CRFs. 8.6.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events An AE that meets one or more of the following criteria /outcomes is classified as serious (term definitions follow): ● Death ● Is deemed life -threatening ● Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization ● Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, ● Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect ● Important medical event Term definitions: Life-threatening – Any AE that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. A life -threatening event does not include an event that might have"
50,page_50,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 51 of 132 Confidential caused death had it occurred in a more severe form but that did not create an immediate risk of death as it actually occurred. Hospitalization – Hospitalization is defined as an overnight admission with observation of a minimum of 24 hours. A hospitalization planned before the start of the study for a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute an SAE (e.g. elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the course of t he study). Disability – Defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Congenital Anomaly/birth defect : Congenital anomaly/birth defect in offspring, or led to fetal distress, or fetal death Important Medic al Event – is an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment of the study physicians, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require m edical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include suicidality, psychosis, behavioral upset, or emergent medical condition requiring emergency hospitalization or intervention. 8.6.3 Classification of an Adverse Event 8.6.3.1 Severity of Event For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity: ● Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities or safety. ● Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning or safety. ● Severe – Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require active medical treatment or intervention to ameliorate. Severe events are usually potentially life - threatening or incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”. 8.6.3.2 Device related AEs Device -related adverse events are events directly attributable to the device itself. ● Adverse Device Effect (ADE): Non -serious adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device"
51,page_51,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 52 of 132 Confidential ● Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE): Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse even t. 8.6.3.3 Serious Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Serious Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (SUADEs) are any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, probl em, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan. 8.6.3.4 Relationship to Study Intervention All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by a clinician who examines and eval uates the subject based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical study, the study treatment must always be suspect. ● Reasonable Possibility – A clinical event, including an abnormal clinical test result, whose temporal relationship to study treatment makes a causal relationship possible. (There is reasonable evidence to suggest a partial or direct causal relationship e.g ., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the study treatment). Other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). ● No Reasonable Possibility – A clinical even t, including an abnormal clinical test result, whose temporal relationship to study treatment makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study treatment) and in which other the rapies or underlying disease provides more plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 8.6.3.5 Anticipated AEs: The following are anticipated AEs that one or more scientific publications have previously ident ified as possibly related to GDH or MR therapies: ● Headache ● Drowsiness ● Fatigue ● GI discomfort ● Muscle tightness ● Muscle soreness The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is device -related or not."
52,page_52,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 53 of 132 Confidential 8.6.3.6 Device malfunction Device malfunction denotes a failure of one or more of the components of digital app that could potentially result in lack of patient access to the digital app, inconvenience. The manufacturer must confirm device failure. 8.6.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs including not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be c aptured on the appropriate eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, date of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessm ent of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. The study team will record all events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained through the end of Phase 4 (LTE) or until the end of study participation. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stab ilization. 8.6.5 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting The occurrence of AEs, SAEs, and Protocol Deviations (PDs) shall be reported through a unidirectional, HIPAA -compliant, web -based communication channel. Event reports may be initiated at any ti me by the subject or the investigator. All logging of event reports shall be retained for the duration of the study to provide proper documentation in accordance with FDA and ICH GCP requirements. The adverse event will be triaged based on subject content and urgency. In the event of an AE, SAE, or PD, the message will be immediately sent to the Curebase team for determination of severity and relatedness to the investigational treatment. The study team will"
53,page_53,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 54 of 132 Confidential collect information from the subject as necessar y and create a final event report for logging within a specified timeframe. Reports containing AEs will be processed and documented. Reports containing SAEs shall be completed and filed per regulatory requirements. The information in a SAE report should be completed as fully as possible and contain at a minimum: ● Subject ID number ● Start date of the event ● Description of the event ● Study physician’s name ● Investigator causality assessment ● Investigator seriousness assessment If safety information not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the study team member should submit follow -up safety information to Curebase. All SAEs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event. The timelines and procedure for follow -up reports are the same as those for the initial report. Detailed study reporting procedures shall be standardized as documented in a formal Safety Monitoring Plan."
54,page_54,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 55 of 132 Confidential 9 Statistical Considerations A Statistical Ana lysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized before unblinding of subjects’ treatment assignment. This document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives. A blind ed data review will be conducted before unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject evaluability, and appropriateness of the planned statistical methods. 9.1 Statistical Hypotheses The primary endpoint for this study will be the proportion of overall pain intensity responders to GDH and comparator following 12 weeks of treatment. An abdominal pain intensity responder is defined as a subject whose daily abdomina l pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of Phase 3 (weeks 13 through 16) is 30% reduced compared to the daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of the Phase 1 run -in (weeks -4 through -1). The proportion of responders in each treatmen t group in the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will be estimated along with corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For this study the null and alternative hypotheses that will be tested are: ● H0: P1 = P2 ● H1: P1 ≠ P2 Where P1 and P2 are the proportion of responders in GDH and Comparator treatment groups, respectively. 9.2 Sample Size Determination In this study, 380 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to GDH or comparator to ensure that at least 300 subjects comple te their Week 13 -16 assessment for analysis. Three hundred (300) subjects completing Phase 3 will provide at least 90% power to detect an 18 percentage point difference in response rates between the GDH and comparator treatment groups at the 5% significanc e level. The study was powered assuming that the comparator treatment group is expected to demonstrate a 26% response rate. To determine the expected response rate in the comparator treatment group, two studies of GDH reporting data that utilized dichotomo us outcome measures were examined. The first ( 9) used an endpoint of % treatment responders (defined as a >50% reduction in IBS -SSS). In this study, 52% of subjects in the GDH group and 26% of subjects in the control group (u sual care) were responders. A more recent study by Flik et al (12) reported an “adequate relief” response rate of 40% in the GDH group compared to 17% in the Edu control group. It is believed the response rate in the comparat or treatment group in this study is likely to be ~26%."
55,page_55,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 56 of 132 Confidential 9.3 Populations for Analyses Enrolled Population : The enrolled population will include all subjects who sign informed consent and meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. This population will be used for evaluation of demographics and baseline characteristics. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : The ITT population will include all subjects who are randomized to treatment. Subjects that are replaced due to failed inclusion/exclusion criteria or technical issues in the Curebase software will be excluded. This population will be used for the evalua tion of efficacy and all safety analyses. Per Protocol (PP) Population : The PP population will consist of all subjects in the ITT population with no major protocol deviations that may affect efficacy. This population will be used as a supportive analysis o f the primary endpoint. 9.4 Statistical Analyses 9.4.1 General Approach The SAS System, Version 9.4 (or higher), will be used for all analyses, unless otherwise specified. Continuous variables (e.g., age) will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categ orical variables (e.g., sex, race) will be summarized using the number of observations (n) and percentage in each category. All data used in analyses and/or collected during the study will be provided in listings. Subjects withdrawn prior to end of Phase 3 (Weeks 13 -16) assessment period will be considered as prematurely withdrawn. All available data for subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will be included in all analyses. All 4 -week assessment periods in MMRM and GEE models will include: Pha se 1 (weeks minus 4 through minus 1), Phase 2 weeks 1 -4, Phase 2 weeks 5 -8, Phase 2 weeks 9 -12, Phase 3 (weeks 13 -16), LTE Period 1 (weeks 35 through 38), and LTE period 2 (weeks 61 through 64). At timepoints during the study that require 4 weeks of daily IBS symptom and pain assessment, at least 50% of the required assessments must be collected to be able to derive the average daily abdominal pain intensity and like endpoints. Study withdrawals, reasons for withdrawal, and missing assessment collections wi ll be summarized. Analyses of treatment will be performed using two different approaches to account for missing data during the treatment phase:"

At-assessment Analysis: Missing values at post -baseline assessments will not be replaced and will be regarded as missing in analyses. 2. Multiple Imputation: Missing values at post -baseline assessments will be imputed using the multiple imputation method. Additional details of the statistical methods are provided in the SAP. 9.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) The primary endpoint, proportion of overall pain intensity responders is defined as a subject whose daily abdominal pain intensity average d over the 4 weeks of Phase 3 (weeks 13 through 16) is 30% reduced compared to the daily abdominal pain intensity averaged over the 4 weeks of Phase 1 (weeks -4 through -1) (27). Responders will be compared between the GDH and comparator treatment groups using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted for IBS subtype and gender. If the resulting p -value is less than 0.05 and the magnitude of the difference in pooled proportions is at least 10 percentage points, then it will be co ncluded that the primary endpoint has been met. 9.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 9.4.3.1 Abdominal Pain Intensity Average abdominal pain intensity will be calculated as the average of the daily abdominal pain intensity scores recorded by each participant. Averages will be calculated for each week and for each 4 -week assessment period (i.e., Phase 1 [Week -4 to -1,], P hase 3 [Week 13 – 16], etc.). Average abdominal pain intensity at Week 13 -16 will be statistically compared between GDH and MR using an ANOVA model adjusted for gender and IBS subtype. The least squares (LS) mean estimate of average abdominal pain intensi ty and LS mean difference and associated 95% CIs will be presented with corresponding p -value. Additionally, change from baseline and at -assessment values of average abdominal pain intensity will be analyzed at all 4 -week assessment time periods with a mix ed effects repeated measures model (MMRM). The model will include treatment, time period, IBS subtype, gender, and treatment by time period interaction as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. The unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -participant correlation. Using the ESTIMATE and LSMEANS statements within PROC MIXED, the model -based LS means and LS mean differences (GDH minus comparator) and associated 95% CIs for each time period and overall will be estimated."

58,page_58,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 59 of 132 Confidential 24 hours. Subj ects will use the BSFS to score the worst stool in the preceding 24 hour period. Extreme stool consistency is defined as 1, 2, 6, or 7 on the BSFS, while BSFS scores of 3,4 and 5 are considered within the normal range. The BSFS scores will be grouped as 1, 2 (Group 1), 3,4,5 (Group 2) and 6,7 (Group 3). For participants in the IBS -D and IBS -M subtypes, a stool consistency response is defined as having a greater than or equal to 50% reduction from baseline (Phase 1) in the number of days with a BSFS score of 6 or 7. Stool consistency response for the IBS-D and IBS -M subtypes will be analyzed with methods similar to those used to assess the primary endpoint described in Section 10.4.2 . Additionally, change from baseline in the percentage of days with a BSFS s core in Group 2 will will be analyzed at all 4 -week assessment time periods with a mixed effects repeated measures model (MMRM). The model will include treatment, time period, IBS subtype, gender, and treatment by time period interaction as fixed effects and subject as a random effect.

The percentage of the number of days with a BSFS score in each BSFS group will be summarized descriptively by treatment, IBS subtype and time period. 9.4.3.4 Stool Frequency Analyses of daily stool frequency will only include participants with IBS -C. Daily stool frequency will be calculated as the average number of stools per day during each 4 - week assessment period. Only days during which an assessment is recorded will be i ncluded in the calculation of average stool frequency. For participants in IBS -C subtype, a stool frequency response is defined as an increase from baseline (Phase 1) of >1 bowel movement per day. Stool frequency response for IBS -C participants will be an alyzed with methods similar to those used to assess the primary endpoint described in Section 10.4.2 . Change from baseline and at -assessment values of daily stool frequency will be analyzed at all 4 - week assessment time periods with a mixed effects repeate d measures model (MMRM).

Written consent documents will embody the elements of info rmed consent described in the Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form describes the planned and permitted uses, transfers, and disclosures of the s ubject’s personal and personal health information for purposes of conducting the study. The informed consent form further explains the nature of the study, its objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed consent are given. Th e informed consent form will detail the requirements of the subject and the fact that he or she is free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical care. The PI/Sponsor is responsible for the prepara tion, content, and IRB approval of the informed consent form. The informed consent form must be approved by the IRB. The informed consent must be written in a language fully comprehensible to the prospective subject. It is the responsibility of the investi gator or delegated staff to explain the detailed elements of the informed consent form to the subject. Curebase will use an electronic consent platform (eConsent) to facilitate the consent process. The eConsent will be introduced to subjects as part of an on-line pre -screening interview. The pre - screening process requires subjects to create an account and login that allows ongoing access to their secure Curebase platform account. Once subjects pass their pre -screening they will be able to review the eConse nt, HIPAA Authorization, and the Experimental Subjects’ Bill of Rights using their own personal electronic devices, like a phone, tablet, or computer. During the subject’s review they will be provided an opportunity to discuss the content of the eConsent w ith study personnel via email or telephone. Subjects will have the option to delay document signing and proceed to the study visit where they can further discuss the consent with the study physician prior to signing. Each subject will be required to electronically sign the study informed consent, HI PAA Authorization, and the Experimental Subjects’ Bill of Rights before they are allowed to participate in the study. After signing each document, subjects will be sent digital PDFs of their documents for their personal records. The original informed conse nt form will be stored in the eCRF. In the case of revisions to the informed consent form, subjects will be contacted and revised eConsent forms must be reviewed and signed by subjects. The date the revised consent was obtained will be recorded with the eC onsent."

Find a relaxed position so that you can sit comfortably and with minimum effort and without having to move around. Just try to make yourself as comfortable as you can and sit in a relaxed po sition. I would like to ask you to look up at the ceiling and find a spot there to look at. It doesn't matter what spot it is. Just find one spot or place in the ceiling to look at. And keep your eyes on that spot for a little while, as we start this relax ation exercise. In a moment I am going to start counting to three, and I would like to ask you to keep looking up at the spot while I count. With each number of the count, your eyelids may become heavier and start to push down and close. However, some peop le's eyes do not close as quickly as those of others - and it is possible that it might not happen in your case. And that is all right. There is no need to be concerned if that does"
72,page_72,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 73 of 132 Confidential not happen to you. It does not matter. Different people respond differentl y. Should your eyelids not begin to push down more and more and close as I count to three, then you can just close them a little later when I tell you to do so. The important thing is that just allow whatever is going to happen to take place. Keep yourself open to experiencing whatever you can without resisting it. You do not really have to help it along, either. All you have to do is simply to concentrate on the things that I talk about and to allow things to happen. But as I said, your eyelids will probab ly quickly become very heavy and start closing by themselves as I count to three. And when you feel that heaviness come into your eyelids - when they feel ready to close, just allow it to happen by itself. As I begin the count, just let go and relax, allow ing yourself to experience whatever is going to happen. That is the best way to enjoy hypnosis. Keep looking at the spot in the ceiling ... that's right ... ... and keep your eyes still like that ... keep them up there, focused on the spot. Good. Focus you r attention on the spot and pay close attention to what I am going to say: As you keep looking at the spot, allow your whole body to begin to relax - just by thinking about it, relaxing. Relax your body and keep looking at the spot, concentrate on it. Rela x your whole body, allow it to be limp and heavy and relaxed, ... limp ... and heavy ... and relaxed. Notice if you can feel the tension leave your muscles ... and notice how your body becomes more limp and heavy. Just relax and keep focusing on the spot a nd listening to my voice. And as you relax your body, as you let go more and more... you will soon notice that your eyelids also begin to feel heavy ... heavier... and heavier... Just concentrate on the spot in the ceiling and on my voice. One. Heavier ... and heavier. Your eyelids may already be pushing down, sinking down under their own heavy weight, sinking down ... as heavy as large shields made of lead, heavy as lead ... as you let go ... as you let go and relax, your eyelids become heavier ... perhaps they are already beginning to push down ... feel the heaviness in your eyelids as you allow yourself to relax more and more ... relax more and more ... becoming heavy and relaxed, comfortably heavy and relaxed ... two ... you can try to keep staring at th e spot a little bit longer, but it may be getting very difficult, as your eyelids are becoming sooo heavy, too heavy for that, and your eyes may be beginning to close already. For some people this happens quickly, for others it happens more slowly ... but the eyelids become heavier and heavier. Pay attention to your eyelids ... and as you concentrate on them you probably become more aware of them than you usually are, ... you may even be more aware of the feeling in your eyelids than you have ever been befo re ... feel how heavy and tired your eyelids are ... and as you do, you probably notice that they are getting still heavier, still heavier ... they sink down and close all by themselves, under their own heavy weight ... three, your eyes want to close as yo u just let go and relax, heavier ... closing ... heavier and heavier, feel them getting heavier, ... closing all by themselves ... closing all by themselves ... closing ... closing now. Allow your eyes to close now ... just let them close."

You can close your eyes now and relax. Close your eyes now and let go and relax. That's good ... Eyes completely closed. You can just keep your eyes closed until I tell you to open them. It is easier to relax now that your eyes are closed. Just continue to listen to my voice and relax ... Relax and focus on what I am saying to you ... Relax your right hand ... allow all the muscles in your right hand to become com pletely limp and relaxed ... completely limp and relaxed ... Your right hand becomes completely relaxed as you think about the muscles in the hand relaxing... your right hand becomes completely relaxed ... and let that relaxation spread up your arm ... rel ax your left hand, too ... relax your left hand also ... concentrate on each part of your body as I talk about it.

All the way down your body. Your whole body relaxes more and more ... more and more ... allow your whole body to become limp and loose and relaxed. Relax your left foot even more ... y our left foot is limp and heavy and comfortably relaxed ... and your left leg ...relaxed ... and now your right foot ... and your right leg ... Relax your whole body. You are breathing more and more freely and deeply now as your body relaxes, you breathe f reely and deeply. Allow your whole body to relax. Relax your whole body. As we continue, your body will perhaps begin to feel a little numb ... and it may also feel heavier and heavier ... But this will be a comfortable feeling of heaviness and numbness .. . On the other hand, your body may begin to feel lighter, as if it were weightless, and you might experience a sensation of floating. No matter what happens, whether you become heavy or light, whether you feel like you are floating or gently sinking, it wi ll be an enjoyable and pleasant feeling that goes along with a state of deep, comfortable relaxation. In this relaxed state, your mind and your thoughts also become more relaxed and quiet. While you are in this state, there is no need to care about what is going on around you ... it is easier just to withdraw and turn your attention inside ... nothing is i mportant now except enjoying relaxing and listening to what my voice is saying to you. Nothing else matters right now ... not a care or concern in the world ... this is an opportunity to just let go and enjoy a deep, carefree and"
74,page_74,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 75 of 132 Confidential comfortable state of relax ation. Allow yourself to turn inside, to just drift completely away from all the cares and concerns of the world. You can perhaps become like an island ... undisturbed and beautiful and far away from the world. All you have to do is to relax and listen to my voice ... Even my voice may soon begin to feel like it is coming to you from a distance ... and that's fine. But no matter how deeply hypnotized or relaxed you will feel yourself become, you will always continue to hear me, and my words will continue to affect you like in an automatic way. You are going to become even more relaxed ... still more relaxed, as we continue. I would like you to realize however, that you will be able to shift in your seat or to put your head in a more comfortable position if y ou need to, and this will not disturb your concentration or relaxation at all, and you will continue to be in the hypnotic state until I tell you to wake up. As you may know, people are better able to imagine things and picture things in their minds when t hey are in a relaxed state ... like you are now. I would like you now to picture something in your mind. Picture a staircase ... see yourself standing at the top of a grand staircase that goes down in front of you ... a grand staircase covered with a thick and luxurious red carpet... Concentrate on this and see it clearly in your mind. This is a strong marble staircase with twenty steps, covered with a luxurious, thick, soft, red carpet. Imagine yourself standing barefoot at the top of this staircase ... an d feel the softness and the warmth of the carpet under your feet ... it is so thick that your feet sink deeply into it. Feel it now under your feet, so soft and thick ... At the right side of the staircase there is an old, strong wooden banister going all the way down. You might want to reach out in your mind and touch the banister with your fingers. Feel how hard and solid the wood is, polished smooth by many hands ... You also notice, as you stand there at the top of the staircase, that next to the banist er, the marble steps are not covered by the carpet. Just out of curiosity, you might want to put your foot out to the right for a moment, in your mind, and touch the marble there at the top of the staircase. Touch the marble on the side of the staircase wi th your foot. Feel how cool and hard and smooth it is ... so cool and hard and smooth under your foot... and notice how this feeling contrasts with the softness and the warmth of the carpet as you put your foot back on it. Now you will start to go down thi s staircase as I count each step. And as you go down the stairs, your body can automatically relax more and more all over with every number. And at the same time, you will probably find your mind quieting down into a comfortable focused and relaxed hypnoti c state more and more with every step you take down.... One, take the first step down, and feel the wonderful softness of the carpet under your feet as you stand there on the first step below ... As I continue to count, you will go down one step further wi th each number, and at the same time going deeper and deeper into the hypnotic state effortlessly and automatically. Deeper and deeper with every number. Not everyone sees things as clearly in their mind. And it is all right if you do not see the staircase very clearly, you will still continue to go deeper and deeper into the hypnotic state with each number I count up to twenty. Whatever you experience is fine. But most likely, you can see the steps clearly in front of you going down, covered by the rich,"
75,page_75,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 76 of 132 Confidential velvety carpet, and you can probably see how the color of the carpet on the steps in front of you becomes deeper and deeper with each step down. A deeper and more restful color with each step you take. Two, now you take another step down ... three, deeper d own, further down into a relaxed and comfortable state of hypnosis ... four ... five, further down, deeper down ... six, just let go more and more, more and more at ease ... seven ... eight, your feet sink into the soft and comfortable carpet with each ste p down, as you sink deeper into a deep and restful hypnotic state ... nine ... ten, always more and more down, further down, as you relax more and more deeply ... eleven ...your body more at ease and your mind more at peace, twelve ... thirteen ... fourtee n ... fifteen ... you go on deeper down, still deeper down into a safe and comfortable state of hypnosis ... sixteen ... seventeen ... you can see the bottom of the stairs now if you look down ... the floor below is covered by the same soft and comfortable carpet ... this is a place deep in your mind ... a place of rest, relaxation, and comfort ... eighteen, ... nineteen, only one more step and you will be there, in a place of deep comfort and relaxation ... twenty! You take the last step down, down onto th e carpeted floor. Let your whole body relax. Just allow your whole body to let go and relax completely ... Relax completely, and listen to my words. As you sit and relax and allow your whole body to be at ease, something positive and healthy and powerful i s beginning to happen inside you. Your intestines are becoming much less sensitive to pain and discomfort, as a healthy, soothing wave of change spreads deep inside your body. Perhaps you can picture this in your mind now ... maybe you can picture these ch anges in your mind like a wave of medication that spreads down from your stomach and all the way down through your intestines, coating your intestines with a strong protective coating ... a coating that protects you from discomfort inside. Maybe you can fe el a sense of healthy soothing comfort that spreads all through your intestines, making them less and less sensitive to irritation and pain. Or perhaps you picture this wave of healthy soothing change as a wave of light inside you... or maybe you even feel it inside you like a wave of comfortable warmth spreading down from your stomach all through your intestines. But regardless of the way you experience it, the effect of it is like your intestines are being coated ... coated completely inside with a health y and strong protective coating ... a strong protective coating that makes them immune to irritation, and protects you from being upset inside. This strong protective coating lets only the pleasant sensations get through. These pleasant and healthy changes are beginning to happen inside your body right now - and they will continue steadily after you wake up from this hypnotic state in a little while - these changes will improve your health and well -being more and more from this day, more and more every day. You may - or you may not - notice these changes immediately, but they will come even when you do not pay any attention to them. Your stomach and intestines will feel less and less sensitive to discomfort, always less and less sensitive, and more and more comfortable, from one day to the next, beginning right now, today, until you are able to enjoy healthy comfort inside all the time. It will probably feel like this strong protective coating inside your intestines is"

Of course, you would still be able to feel discomfort if your body really needed to warn you to protect you from serious harm. But you will become much less sensitive to irri tation and discomfort in your intestines and stomach from now on. You will most likely be surprised to discover that things that would have irritated your stomach and intestines before do not feel uncomfortable to you anymore from now on ... and you will p robably find that in situations where you would have felt pain in your bowels before, you now experience pleasant sensations. In a moment, I am going to start counting slowly down from twenty to one, and when I get down to the count of one, you will be ful ly awake and in a normal wakeful state. You will feel rested and refreshed and will not have any negative or uncomfortable aftereffects. But each time from now on that I ask you to look up into the ceiling in the beginning of each hypnosis session, your eyelids will immediately begin to feel very heavy, and your eyes will quickly close by themselves and you will fall into a deep hypnotic state. All right, now please picture yourself again in your mind at the bottom of the staircase with the thick, velvety c arpet, standing again on the soft and comfortable carpeted floor. I am now going to begin to count down from twenty, and with each number you take a step up the staircase. When you reach the top, that is, when I have counted down to one, you will be fully awake, alert and feeling fine, with your eyes open.

But first, take a deep breath, a very deep breath, inhale ... and hold your breath ... hold it ... and exhale very slowly, and as you do, relax your body ... That's right. Now we are ready to begin. All right, now look at the spot in the ceiling ... ke ep looking at it, concentrate on it and listen to my words ... and at the same time relax your whole body ... let your body become limp and heavy ... and soon, as I count from one to three, your eyelids will become heavier and heavier, one ... they become heavier and heavier ... feel the heaviness in your eyelids, they become heavy as if they are made of lead as I continue the count ... keep relaxing your body, making it limp and heavy, and keep staring at the spot if you can ... but your eyelids may just b e getting too heavy for that ... sooo heavy ... and they may already be pushing down, pushing down and closing as I count to three, heavier and heavier with each number ... two ... relax your whole body, allowing"

Now I would like to ask you to concentrate your thoughts on your hands and listen to my words. Focus your attention on your hands. As you concentrate your attention on your hands, you become more aware of them than you ordinarily are ... you can feel them more ... As your hands rest there on your lap, notice any sensations that you have in your hands ... are they warm or cold? ... are they light or heavy? ... are they tense or relax ed? ... and while you are paying such close attention to your hands ... allow all the muscles in your hands to relax ... feel all the muscles in your hands becoming softer and more relaxed... softer and more relaxed ... more and more relaxed ... soft and l oose and relaxed ... and also relax all the muscles in your forearms, allow all the muscles in your forearms to become soft and relaxed... relax every muscle in your forearms ... and upper arms, too, let all the tension leave your arms and hands completely , allow them to be limp, and heavy and loose, limp and loose ... heavy and limp.

Now focus your attention on your shoulders ... let the relaxation spread from your arms into your shoulders, making the muscles of your shoulders loose and soft and relaxed. Your shoulders relax more and more ... And let the relaxation spread on further now, down your body from the shoulders. It may feel as if waves of relaxation are washing down your body ... wave after wave ... with each breath you take you relax more and more ... wave after wave ... breath after breath ... you breathe freely ... and deeply ... freely and deeply ... let the waves of relaxation sweep down your whole body with each breath you take, all the way down your body, relaxing your whole body more and more ... more and more ... relax your chest ... relax your stomach ... relax your buttocks and thighs ... allow the relaxation to spread all over your body ... down into your legs ... your legs become heavy and limp ... heavy and limp ... and your feet relax also ... relax your feet more and more ... your right foot completely relaxed ... relax your right foot completely ... and now allow your left foot to also become totally relaxed ... the left foot also comfo rtably relaxed.

You are now in a deep and comfortable state of hypnosis. I would like you now to picture something in your mind. Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a large room, a large room with w hite-painted walls and a hardwood floor, imagine yourself standing barefoot on the wooden floor ... see it and feel it clearly in your mind, feel the hard wooden boards under your feet. Look at the wall in front of you in this room, there is a door there i n the wall, see the door in front of you in the wall if you concentrate. Now I would like you to walk up to the door but do not open it yet. Just walk across the floor and stand in front of the door. Notice the door, pay close attention to it now... notice what it is made of ... and notice the door handle, what kind of door handle it is. In a moment, when you open the door and step outside, you will step out onto a beach. A beautiful, sunny beach. Now in your mind, open the door and step outside. Step outsi de. You are now on the beach. You can see it and feel it now clearly. See the intense beautiful blue of the sky ... and the bright yellowish white sun shining high above you. There is not a single cloud in the sky ... Notice the shimmering of the sunlight on the water. You can feel the heat of the sun on your face and on your clothes. The sand is hot under your feet. Feel the hot dry sand under your feet and between your toes as you walk along the beach. And smell the air. Notice if you can smell anything? Perhaps it is a salty smell ... maybe you can smell seaweed? This is a pleasant place where everything looks so relaxed and happy. Look around you there on the beach. Maybe there are people there in the distance, further down the beach, playing happily wit h a ball or a Frisbee. This is a carefree and relaxed place. And listen now, you can probably hear the sounds of the beach if you concentrate. Notice what the sounds are. Maybe you can hear seagulls,... or maybe you can faintly hear the laughter of people playing in the distance ... or perhaps you can even hear the little sounds of the water lapping against the shore. Now walk down to the edge of the water. Walk on the hot beach sand down to the water. As you come down to the edge of the water ... you can f eel the sharp change from hot dry sand to wet, cool sand that sticks to your feet. Now step into the water just a little bit, until it reaches your ankles ... Feel the comfortable coolness of the clear water as tiny waves wash around your ankles ... Feel t he refreshing coolness of the water. And see how wonderfully clear and beautifully blue the water is. Look out over the water ... as far as you can see. There are fishing boats out there in the distance ... sitting lazily on the horizon ... See the boats o ut there in"
79,page_79,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 80 of 132 Confidential the distance, just sitting there out on the ocean so carefree and calm ... Now you can step out of the water again. You can once more feel the hot, dry sand under your feet and between your toes as you walk up the beach, the sand feels even hot ter now because you are coming out of the cool water ... Walk up the beach ... There is a large beach towel lying on the sand there in front of you ... See the towel there on the sand in front of you. Walk up to it. Walk up to the towel, sit down on it and just relax. Sit down on the towel. Feel the sand shaping itself beneath the towel conforming to the weight of your body ... and now you can just lie down on the towel and relax completely. Just relax your body completely ... and enjoy the carefree comfort of the warm beach. Allow the relaxed and healthy feeling of the beach to fill your body as you continue to relax. Out on the beach on a beautiful day you are far away from all your troubles and cares. So far away from all discomfort. You may feel inside l ike nothing can disturb your deep comfort, like nothing can upset you inside or cause you discomfort or pain, that no troubles can get to you and that all discomfort disappears from your life. After you wake up from this state in a little while, you will m ost likely notice that you are carrying that deep sense of calm and comfort with you inside of you. In the next few days, you may notice that bowel sensations that would have been uncomfortable before do not bother you any longer ... they bother you no mor e than the little sounds of small waves washing ashore with a steady rhythm like when you are relaxing perfectly comfortable on the sunny beach. Bowel sensations that would have been uncomfortable before do not seem to make you uncomfortable in the same wa y anymore, as you continue to become less and less sensitive to pain and discomfort inside your body from this moment on. You will notice more and more from day to day that in many situations where you might have experienced bowel discomfort or pain before , you only feel pleasant sensations inside. Gradually it feels more and more like nothing can upset your stomach or cause pain in your intestines anymore. You will probably be pleasantly surprised to find that your bowels are beginning to function in all s ituations with a healthy, quiet, natural rhythm that is comfortable and soothing and hardly noticeable at all, --just like the gentle sounds of small waves in the background on a calm and sunny day at the beach. And even if you feel discomfort inside, you will most likely notice more and more that it is surprisingly weak, much weaker than before, as your sensitivity to pain in your stomach and intestines is gradually and steadily fading away more and more, leaving you more comfortable and healthy every day) . And now you can just let the whole beach scene dissolve gradually in your mind as I count slowly back from twenty to one. At the count of one you will open your eyes and you will be wide awake, in your normal state of wakefulness. You will be relaxed and refreshed and not have any uncomfortable or unpleasant aftereffects. Twenty ...

I would like you now to concentrate your thoughts on your hands ... and to listen closely to my words. As you focus your attention on your hands, y ou become more aware of them than you usually are. You can feel every little sensation in your hands as they just lie there resting on your lap ... notice how they feel ... notice whether they are warm or cool ... light or heavy ... are they tense or relax ed?... And as you pay such close attention to your hands, let all the little muscles in the hands relax ... feel all the muscles in your hands becoming softer and more relaxed ... softer and more relaxed ... feel your fingers relaxing ... and your hands be coming heavy and more and more relaxed ... and now let that relaxation spread up into your forearms ... relax all the muscles in your forearms ... the forearms heavy and relaxed, and the upper arms, too, let all the tension leave your arms and hands and al low them to become limp ... limp and heavy ... heavy and limp.

And now let the relaxation spread down from your shoulders and begin to flow down your bac k. Wave after wave of relaxation flowing down your back... relaxing your upper back... and also your lower back... your whole back letting go of any tension and becoming more comfortable. And let these waves of relaxation continue to wash down your body, down into your thighs, loosening and softening the muscles of your thighs ... making every muscle in your thighs soft ... so soft and limp and loose .... comfortably relaxed ... and allow y our legs to share in this limp and loose relaxation all the way down .... All the muscles of your legs becoming limp and loose, and your legs heavy ... heavy and limp, all the way down into your feet, relaxing every body part on the way down, making every part of your body heavier and more relaxed.

Your whole body gradually becomes more and more comfortably relaxed. Your entire body from head to toe becomes more and more relaxed as we continue. I am now going to count slowly from one to twenty ... and with each number in the count, you will find yourself going down sinking deeper and deeper into a deep, comfortable and relaxing hypnotic state. One, you go deeper into the hypnotic state as you relax even further. Two... deeper and deeper ... three...deeper down i nto a carefree state of comfort and ease, four... more and more relaxed, deeper into the hypnotic state... five... there is nothing to worry about now, not a care or concern in the world, six... you continue to go deeper... seven.... eight... nine... ten.. .

You are now in a deep and comfortable state of hypnotic relaxation. Just let your body relax completely. Relax completely. I would now like to ask you to once again to picture something in your mind. Picture yourself again in a large, white -painted room with a wood floor. Imagine yourself standing in this room ... see it and feel it clearly, ... see it clearly now. And look at the wall in front of you. There is a door there. See the door in front of you. I would like you now to walk up to the door but do not open it yet. Just stand in front of the door and pay close attention to this door. Notice what it is made of, and pay especially close attention to the door handle, what kind of door handle this is."
82,page_82,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 83 of 132 Confidential See this clearly in your mind. In a moment, when you open the door and walk out of the room, you will find yourself walking into another room. Now open the door and walk into this other room. See it now. You are now inside an old and spacious log cabin up in the mountains. You can see it clearly now. You ar e standing on the hard wood floor in the middle of this log cabin room. It is dimly lit, it is evening and the only light is the warm light from the fire burning in the fireplace to your right. Look at the fireplace and see the fire burning brightly yellow and red. It is comfortably warm in this cabin. The air smells a little bit of wood smoke. It is a strong smell but not uncomfortable. Look at the walls around you. See the big, strong logs that the cabin is made of. They are so thick and heavy and strong that it seems that nothing could affect them. No matter what happens outside, no matter how strong the winter storms are, the mountain cabin is a safe and comfortable place. You can walk over the wall nearest to you and touch the log wall. Touch the wall n ow. You can touch the wall now. Notice how rough and hard the logs feel. They are almost as hard as rock. And feel the smoother material between the logs -- the material that provides insulation. Notice also, as you touch the wall, whether the wall feels w arm or cool to the touch ... And see also how the shadows play on the wall in the light from the fire. Look at the shadows playing on the wall ... and listen now. You can probably hear the crackling sound from the fireplace. It is a soothing sound, a sound that means warmth and rest and comfort ... There is a little window there a little further along the wall. Now walk over to it. And as you walk over there, you can perhaps hear the creaking sounds of the wood floor under your feet. The floor is strong and solid, these are just the sounds that old wood floors make. Now you can see the little window in front of you. It is dark outside, but you can see the delicate lace pattern that the frost has made on the window. Reach out with your hand and touch the wind owpane. It is so smooth and so ice -cold. And feel how it is wet as your fingers melt the thin film of ice on the window. And while you are so close to the window you can perhaps hear the faint high -pitched howling in the winter storm outside. It is so nice to be inside when it is so cold and so windy outside. Now turn around and look around you in this room. Over to the side, closer to the fireplace, there is large and comfortable -looking bed in the corner. See the big bed there in the corner? You can see it clearly now if you concentrate. Notice in particular the comforter on the bed. Notice the color and the old -fashioned pattern. Now walk over to this comfortable -looking bed. Walk up to the bed and stand in front of it. And as you do, you can probably fee l the warmth from the fire on your face -- because you are closer to the fireplace now. And you can just lie down on this comfortable bed now. Just lie down on this wonderfully soft bed and relax. Relax completely there in the warmth and comfort of the log cabin, far up in the mountains, far away from all cares and concerns. Relax your whole body completely. Relax completely. Relaxing inside a warm, safe comfortable mountain cabin like this, nothing can disturb your comfort. The thick walls protect you from all discomfort. Even though the storm is howling outside, you can barely notice it in the safe comfort of the log cabin. In the same way, you are protected more and more every day from pain and discomfort in your stomach and bowels. You are becoming less and less sensitive to discomfort or pain until nothing"
83,page_83,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 84 of 132 Confidential can upset or irritate your intestines anymore. More and more it feels like your intestines are protected from all discomfort, like nothing can upset them, just like you are protected from the winter st orms when you are resting inside the mountain cabin. No matter how strong they blow outside the thick protective walls that keep you warm, comfortable and safe, you can feel comfortable and relaxed inside. Perfectly comfortable and relaxed inside. You may find more and more that you hardly notice the sensations that before would have caused you pain or discomfort in your intestines. Sensations that used to be uncomfortable now increasingly feel just mild and soothing and do not bother you anymore. And even if you feel discomfort inside, you will most likely notice that it is surprisingly weak, much milder than before, as your sensitivity to pain in your stomach and intestines is gradually and steadily fading away more and more, leaving you more comfortable a nd healthy every day. Your sensitivity to pain is decreasing steadily from one day to the next, and one week to the next, allowing you to enjoy your everyday life more and more without being disturbed or bothered. You pay less and less attention to unpleas ant feelings inside you every day, as your sensitivity to bowel pain and discomfort steadily fades away and disappears. In a moment, I am going to start counting slowly backward from twenty to one. For most of the count you will still be in the deeply rela xed state that you are in now, but at the count of one, you will be fully awake, in your normal state of wakefulness.

Relax your bod y. I will now begin the count from one to three, and with each number your eyelids will most likely become heavier and heavier until they close. Listen to my words and keep looking at the spot. But as I count, just allow the heaviness to come into your eye lids, and when they feel like closing, just allow it to happen. One - relax your body, relax your muscles, allow your body to become heavy and limp, heavy and limp ... and as you do that, your eyelids also become heavier and heavier, heavier and heavier, and soon they will start pushing down, pushing down with more and more force as the heaviness in your eyelids grows and grows. Let your body become more and more relaxed and limp and heavy. Relaxed and limp and heavy. Simply allow this to begin to happen to you in an automatic way. You do not have to help it along, and there is no need to resist it, either, all you have to do is to let go - let go and allow your body to become limp like a rag doll, heavy and limp and relaxed.

Now I would like you to imagine something and see it clearly in your mind. Picture an open elevator in your mind, imagine yourself standing in front of an open elevator door. As you stand there, you can see the inside of the elevator. This is a large and luxurious elevator. See the beautiful wood­ paneled walls. This is an elevator like they have in the most expensive and luxurious hotels. There is a comfortable -looking padded bench in the elevator. A bench to sit on. In your mind, go inside the elevator and sit down on the bench. Go inside and sit down on the bench. I f you look around you, as you sit there in this luxurious elevator you can see the light panel on the wall with the numbers from one to twenty. Notice that the number one is lit up at the moment. I am now going to begin to count slowly from one to twenty i n a moment. Concentrate your attention on the number panel. I will count slowly from one to twenty in a moment, and with each number in the count from two to twenty the corresponding number will light up on the elevator wall panel and you will find yoursel f going down, down deeper and deeper, automatically and effortlessly, going down into a deep and comfortable and relaxing hypnotic state. Not everybody pictures things as clearly in their mind, and even if you do not see this very clearly, that is all righ t. You will still go deeper and deeper with every number in the count. But most likely, you can see the light panel in front of you now. Notice the color, what it is made of, and so on. Concentrate on this. One... the elevator door is closing, it closes an d you are now ready to sink safely and comfortably down into a deep hypnotic sleep. . . two, you can feel yourself beginning to move gently down in the elevator, down deeper into the hypnotic state as you relax more and more... your body relaxes even more. .. and will become even more relaxed with every number in the count... three ... see the lights changing on the elevator light board ... lighting up one number after another as you go down, sink gently deeper and deeper down into the hypnotic state... four ... five... you go deeper into the hypnotic state with each number and relax more and more in an automatic way... six... see the numbered lights changing as you go"

You are now in a deep and comfortable state of hypn osis. Look at the elevator door now, picture the elevator door opening in front of you. Outside is a wonderful garden, you can see a beautiful sunny garden with lush plants. Step out into the garden. If you turn your head in your mind and look back at the elevator, you can still see the open elevator door there set in an old brick wall. The wall is tall and strong, and there is moss growing on the old bricks. Walk up to the wall beside the elevator and touch the wall. The wall is warm in the sunshine. Feel the roughness of the old bricks and how this contrasts with the feel of the very soft and cool and slightly moist moss growing between the bricks. Feel it. The moss is so soft, and cool and velvety, and the bricks so hard and rough. You can turn around now and enjoy the relaxed comfort of nature in bloom in this quiet and secluded garden. The air smells so fresh and wonderful in this garden, blended with the fragrance of exotic flowers. Smell the fresh and fragrant air... And look in front of you. There is a path in front of you, made of smooth, gray stone slabs that curves across the soft green grass of the lawn, weaving between the trees and bushes. See the path there in front of you. Now walk down the path; you can feel the hard and smooth stone slabs und er your feet. As you walk lazily down the path between the bushes and trees, you can see a variety of colorful plants on both sides... red, white, blue, and yellow plants. The colors are so bright and vivid, set against the bright green of the grass, and t he slightly darker green leaves of the bushes. If you stop for a moment there on the path, you can perhaps reach out and touch the leaves of the bush there right next to you to your left. Reach out in your mind with your hand and touch the leaves. Feel the leaves. Feel how the leaves have a slightly rubbery texture, and how they are smoother on the upper surface and rougher on the underside ... Now you can just let go of the leaves again, and continue down the path. Continue on, wandering further down the p ath. You may not have noticed it, but now when you pay attention to it, you can feel the warmth of the sun on your face. Feel how comfortably warm your face is from the rays of the sun high in the sky. And notice how, as you walk on further along the path, your face is sometimes a little cooler for a moment"
87,page_87,"EASITx Clinical Research Protocol V 6.0 Page 88 of 132 Confidential as you walk into the shadow of one of the large trees. As you continue on the curving path weaving through the garden, listen to the cheerful and carefree natural sounds of the garden. You can probably h ear birds singing, and you may even hear the sounds of squirrels scurrying in the trees. Everything is so carefree and easy in this garden, it seems like nothing can disturb the natural beauty and harmony in this secluded place. Allow the tranquility and h ealthy comfort of the garden to fill your mind and your body ...

It will be with you even when you do not pay any attention to it, making sure that you are always continuing to become less and less sensit ive to pain and discomfort inside your body. In situations where you might have experienced bowel discomfort or pain before, you will probably be surprised to realize that you only feel pleasant warm, soothing sensations. Gradually it will begin to feel mo re and more like nothing can upset or irritate your intestines anymore. As you carry this peaceful warm feeling with you deep inside your body, you become more comfortable and healthy every day. More comfortable and healthy every day, undisturbed and peace ful inside like this beautiful secluded garden. Now continue walking through the garden, down the path, between the trees and the bushes, enjoying the colorful plants... <LONGER PAUSE>... As you go on further, and come around a bend in the path, you can su ddenly see the brick wall and the open elevator there further up the path in front of you again. You have gone a whole circle on the path, the path weaves through the garden in a big circle. Just stand there for a moment on the path, relax and absorb the tranquility of this beautiful garden. In a moment, when you step into the elevator again, and I begin to count back from twenty to one, you can carry this peaceful feeling of relaxation with you.... allowing the body to keep that comfortable healthy feeling even after you are fully awake."

You are now in a deep and comfortable state of h ypnosis. I would like to ask you now to picture something in your mind. Imagine yourself standing outside, on a grassy hill out in the open country. Just imagine yourself standing there, picture it clearly, as if you had just opened your eyes and found you rself there. The grass around you is tall and yellowish green. It reaches up to your knees. If you look around you, you can see low, rolling hills in all directions, covered with the same yellowish grass. Further in the distance, you can see bluish mountai ns. These are magnificent and majestic mountains. There is a slight breeze blowing, you can feel the breeze on your face. It is refreshing, this feeling of clean and fresh air on your face, and you can see the gentle breeze moving the grass around you in a wave -like motion. Look at the sky. The sky is such a bright color of blue, with only a few small puffy clouds. And notice how quiet everything is, as you stand there on the hill. There is no sound at all, except the quiet whisper of the wind in the grass ... If you look down the hill to your right, you can see a pond down there, below the hill, not far away. And look closely, see this clearly now, there is a small boat down there by the bank of the pond. From where you are standing now, it seems to be just the right size for one person. Start walking down the hill. Walk down the side of the hill toward the pond. And as you do that, hear the swishing sound that is made when your legs move through the tall grass, and the little cracking sounds that come when you step down and break the straws. Walk all the way down the side of the hill and down to the boat that is rocking there gently by the side of the pond. This is a beautiful pond. The water reflects the intense blue color of the sky. Look at the boat. It i s indeed a boat made for one person. It has a very comfortable -looking seat in the middle with a large cushion on it. There is also a pair of oars there lying in the bottom of the boat. The boat is so close to the bank that you can easily step into it. Ste p into the boat, it is perfectly safe. Step into the boat, and sit down in it. Feel the comfort of the thick and soft cushion under your body. And notice the slight rocking of the boat, it is almost imperceptible, because the surface of the pond is so calm , but you can feel it if you pay close attention. Now reach out in your mind with your hand and push the boat gently away"

As you drift away from the bank, you can feel the boat rock ing a little bit more for a minute and you can hear tiny waves lapping against the bow, but then it calms down, and as it does you also calm down even more and just relax completely, sitting comfortably in a boat far out in nature, drifting comfortably and safely on a calm and beautiful pond, far removed away from all your concerns and everyday worries. Your body is totally relaxed and your mind is completely calm. Allow the relaxed and healthy feeling of unspoiled nature all around you to fill you as you continue to relax. Out there, so far away from all your troubles and cares, you can let your body relax completely. You can let the soothing tiny rocking motion relax you more deeply inside also - allow it to soothe your stomach and intestines, making them comfortably relaxed - enjoy this profound relaxation... resting out there surrounded by beautiful undisturbed nature, hundreds of miles from all problems... So far away from all disturbance and discomfort that it probably feels like nothing at all can get to you and that all discomfort is hundreds of miles away. Your intestines can keep this healthy and comfortable feeling even after you wake up in a little while and go about your business: Your intestines can continue to stay calm and comfortable, far removed from all discomfort and immune to all pain ... as distant from any discomfort and disturbance as you feel when you are far away out in nature: Healthy and undisturbed. After you wake up from this state in a little while, it will probably feel more and more like no troubles can get to you inside, and that all discomfort is disappearing from your life more and more, day by day. Bowel sensations that would have been painful before are no longer uncomfortable at all, you will hardly notice them, and they w ill not bother you any more than you are bothered by the gentle soothing rocking motion of the boat when you are floating on this beautiful still pond. In a moment, I am going to start counting backward from twenty to one. For most of the count you will be in the deeply relaxed state you are in now. As I begin to count down, you can just let the feeling of being in the boat gradually dissolve from your mind, and when I get down to one in the count, you will be wide awake with your eyes open, in your normal state of wakefulness. You will feel relaxed and refreshed, and you will not have any negative or uncomfortable aftereffects.

You are standing in a small forest clearing on a grassy bank by a beautiful pond, on a wonderful sunny day. You are far out in nature, far away from everything and everybody. You are standing bare foot on the soft grassy bank. The grass feels a little ticklish against your feet, but in a comfortable way. The temperature is just right to be perfectly comfortable.

Lie down in the soft grass on your back, on the bank of the pond, and look up into the bright blue sky. You can see small puffy clouds drifting slowly overhead, and below them, but still far up in the sky, you can see a bird, a falcon or an eagle, soaring high in the sky above you. For a moment, perhaps you can follow this graceful bird with your eyes ... as it soars effortle ssly ... floating on the gentle breeze high above you, circling lazily ... until it drifts out of sight ...
