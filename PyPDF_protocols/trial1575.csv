This study will enroll approximately 480 patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: Arm A (experimental a rm): Atezolizumab 1200 mg IV infusion ever y 3 weeks ( Q3W ; dosed in 3-week cy cles) andbevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q3W(dosed in 3- week cy cles) Arm B (control arm): Sorafenib 400 mg by mouth , twice a day (BID) , continuously Randomization will be stratified according to the following stratification factors : Geographic region (Asia excl uding Japan vs. rest of world ) Macro vascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence ) Baseline -fetoprotein (400 vs. 400 ng/m L)"
15,page_15,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 16/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (0 vs .1) Patients randomized to the atezolizumab andbevacizumab arm (Arm A) who transiently withhold or permanently discontinue either atezolizumab or bevacizumab may continue on single -agent therapy as long as the patients are experiencing clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator and after discussion with the Medical Monitor (i.e., patients transiently withheld or permanently discontinue dfrom bevacizumab treatment for adverse effects may continue atezoli zumab monotherapy and vice versa). Patients will receive atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab or sorafenib until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical d ata, and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease). In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for disease progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 while receiving atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab or sorafenib will be permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet allof the following criteria: Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of all available data Absence of sy mptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease Absence of decline in E astern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status that can be attributed to disease progression Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and at regular intervals during study treatment . Additional scans will be performed as clinically indicated. Tumor assessments will continue until disease progression, regardless of whether treatment has been discontinued (e.g., for toxicity). Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 crit eria for progression will undergo tumor assessments until disease progression (per immune -modified RECIST [imRECIST]) or loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurs later . In the absence of disease progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start new anti -cancer therapy, until consent is withdrawn, death, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Following disease progression, patients will be followed for survival and subsequent anti -cancer thera pies until death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Sites will provide imaging used for tumor assessments to an IRFto enable centralized, independent review of response and progression endpo ints. These reviews will be performed prior to the pre -specified efficacy analyses. Independent Review Facility memb ership and procedures will be detailed in an IR FCharter. Safety assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse e vents and laborator y abnormalities graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Laboratory safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry . Serum samples will be collected to monitor the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab when administered in combination with bevacizumab . Patient samples, including archival tumor tissues as well as serum andplasma, will be collected for future explorator y biom arker assessments. Number of Patients The study will enroll approximately 4 80 patients at approximately 1 20study sites. After completion of the global enrollment phase, additional patients may be enrolled in China in an extended China enrollment phase to ensur e a total of approximately 135patients from mainland China in a China subpopulation. The Sponsor is targeting a total enrollment of approximately 1 35patients from mainland China. After completion of the global enrollment phase, in theevent that less than 135patients from mainland China are enrolled, additional patients in China may be subsequently randomiz ed into the two treatment arms in a 2:1ratio in an extended China enrollment phase to ensure a total of approximately 13 5patient s from mainland China in a China subpopulation.

Statistical Methods Primary A nalysis The primary efficacy objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab compared with sorafenib on the basis of the co -primary efficacy endpoints of OS and IRF-assessed PFS according to RECIST v1.1. Overall survival and PFS will be tested initially in parallel with the overall type I error controlled at a2-sided significance level of 0.05, where OS will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.048 and PFS will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.002. Overall Survival Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. Patients who are alive at the time of the analysis data cutoff will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive. Patients with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of randomization. The 2-sided log -rank test , stratified by geogra phic region (Asia excluding Japan vs. rest of world), macrovascular invasion and/or extrahepatic spread (presence vs. absence), and baseline -fetoprtein ( AFP; 400 vs.  400 ng/mL), will be used as the primary analysis to compare OS between the two treatment arms. Theresults from the unstratified log -rank test will also be provided as a sensitivity analysis to check the robustness of the results of the stratified log -rank test . The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate media n OSfor each treatment arm. Brookmeyer -Crowley methodology will be used to calculate the 95% CI for the median OSfor each treatment arm. Stratified Cox proportional -hazards models will be used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and its 95% CIs . The str atification factors will be the same as those used for the primary stratified log -rank test. The unstratified HR will also be provided. A group sequential design will be used for testing the co- primary efficacy endpoint OS to account for the conduct of 2interim analyses. An -spending with use of the Lan -DeMets method approximating O'Brien -Fleming boundaries will be utilized to control the overall type I error rate of 0.048 for the OS co -primary efficacy endpoint. The firstinterim OS analysis will be conducted at time of the co -primary analysis of IRF -assessed PFS . The second interim OS analysis is planned to be conducted when approximately 243 OS events have been observed. The final analysis of OS is expected to occur af terapproximately 312 deaths have occurred. Ifstatistical significance is reached at one of the pre -planned interim analyses of OS, then that interim OS analysis will be regarded as the definitive analysis of OS and subsequent analyses of OS, including t he final OS analysis, will be descriptive and considered as optional. IRF-Assessed Progression -Free Survival Independent Review Facility -assessed PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression as determined by the IRF according to RECIST v1.1, or"
23,page_23,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 24/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not experienced disease progression or death at the time of the clinical cutoff date will be censored at the time of the last tumor assessment on or prior to th e clinical cutoff date. Patients with no post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the date of randomization. Methods for PFS analy ses are similar to those described for the OS endpoint. Determination of Sample Size A total of approximately 480patients will be randomized in the global enrollment phase of this study, with use of a 2:1 randomization ratio toallocate patients to either the atezolizumab and bevacizumab arm (Arm A) or the sorafenib arm (Arm B). The final OS analysis will be conduc ted at approximately 33 months after the first patient is randomized (first patient in [FPI]). The final OS analysis will be descriptive and considered as optional if statistical significance is achieved at one of the pre -planned interim analyses of OS. The co -primary efficacy endpoints for this study are as follows: OS, defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause IRF-assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death fr om any cause, whichever occurs first. The overall type I error rate for this study will be controlled at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 by a graphical approach (i.e., -splitting and rec ycling). The overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 will be split into a 2-sided significance level of 0.048 for the testing of OS and a 2-sided significance level of 0.002 for the testing of PFS as a first step . The sample size of the study was determined based on the number of deaths required to demonstr ate efficacy in terms of OS. To detect an improvement in OS using a log -rank test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.04 8, approximately 312deaths will be required to achieve 80% overall power assuming a target HR of 0.71 ( median OS improvement vs. controlis 4.9months). The minimum detectable difference (MDD) of OS is an HR of 0.783(median OS improvement is 3.3months). Three -hundred and twelve deaths areexpected to occur approximately 33months after FPI. The calculation of sample size and estimates of the OS analysis timelines are based on the following assumptions: Patients will be randomized to the atezolizumab bevacizumab and sorafenib arms in a 2:1ratio. OS follows a one -piece exponential distribution. The median OS in the control ar m is 12 months. The stopping boundaries of the interim and final analyses of OS use the O'Brien-Fleming boundaries approximated using the Lan -DeMets method. The dropout rate is 5% for the atezolizumab bevacizumab arm and 10% for the sorafenib arm over 12months for OS. The recruitment of approximately 480 patients will take place over approximately 10months Interim A nalysis No interim analysis is planned for PFS in this study. Two interim analyses of OS are planned to beperformed. The first interim analy sis will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis, estimated to occur at approximately 16months after FPI. It is anticipated that at this time approximately 172deaths will have been observed. The respecti ve MDD OS HR is 0. 633(median OS improvement is 6.9months). Thesecond OS interim analysis is planned to be conducted when approximately 243 deaths are accumulated, estimated to occur at approximately 24 months after FPI. The respective MDD OS HR is 0.7 28 (median OS improvement is 4.6 months). To control the 2-sided significance level at 0.048 for the interim and final OS analyses, the Lan-DeMets method will be used to approximate the O'Brien- Fleming boundaries. The planned interim analys es for OS will b e conducted by the Sponsor."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON HEPA TOCELLULA R CA RCINOMA Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer globally and is the second most deadly cancer ( International Agency for Research on Cancer 2012 ). There are over 700,000 new cases diagnosed each year worldwide with large geographic variation in both risk factors and incidence ( Ferlay et al. 2010 ; El-Serag 2011 ). The majority ( 80%) of cases occur in sub -Saharan Africa and eastern Asia, and China alone accounts for 55% of cases worldwide. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the main risk factor for HCC in Asia and Africa , while i n Western countries and Japan, the main risk factor is hepatitis C vi rus (HCV )infection and excessive alcohol intake, along with other causes of cirrhosis . Hepatocellular carcinoma is a highly lethal disease with t he highest mortality -to-incidence rate ratio of 0.98 of any solid tumor (Kamangar et al. 2006 ). Up to 80% of patients first presenting with HCC have advanced unresectable or metastatic disease because of the late appearance of symptoms. It is a medically complex and difficult to treat disease because the majority of patients with HCC have underlying cirrhosis re quiring managem ent of both the malignancy and the cirrhosis. In the United States , at 5 years,the overall survival (OS) rate of patients with HCC is 17% and falls substantially to only 3% if present with distant metastasis ( Siegel et al. 2016 ). InChina , at5years,the OS rate of patients with HCC is 10.1% (Chen etal.2016 ). 1.2 CURRENT SYSTEMIC TRE ATMENT FOR ADVANCED HEPA TOCELLULA R CA RCINOMA Prior to the approval of sorafenib (Nexavar), there was no globally approved systemic treatment for patients presenting with unresectable advanced or metastatic HCC. Doxorubicin was the most widely used cytotoxic agent , and is reported to have an 11%15% response rate (Mok et al. 1999 ; Zhu 2006 ; Lind et al. 2007 ).More aggressive combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been shown to increase OSrates and have been associated with considerable toxicity (Yeo et al. 2005 ). Sorafenib, an oral multi -kinase inhibitor, was first approved in 2007 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)and is currently co nsidered the global standard of care for the first-linetreatment of patients with advanced HCC. The efficacy of sorafenib has been demonstrated in 2large multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase III trials: the Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial and a trial conducted in the Asia-Pacific region. Both studies demonstrated a survival benefit of sorafenib versus placebo. In the SHARP trial, median OS was 10.7 months with sorafenib versus 7.9months with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69 [95% CI: 0.55, 0.87]); in the Asia- Pacific trial, median OS was 6.5 months versus 4.2 months (HR 0.68 [95% CI:0.50, 0.93]). Benefit in median time to radiographic progression was also demonstrated: 5.5 months versus 2.8 months in the SHARP trial (HR 0.58 [95% CI:0.5, 0.7]) and 2.8 months versus 1.4 months in the Asia- Pacific trial"
29,page_29,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 30/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6(HR0.6[95% CI: 0.4, 0.8]). The objective response rate ( ORR; per RECIST v1.0) was 2.3% (7 of 299 patients) in the SHARP trial and 3.3% (5 of 150 patients) in the Asia-Pacific trial. The numerically shorter OS and duration of benefit in the Asia -Pacific trial may be largely attributed to the fact that patients had more advanced disease at the time of recruitment , and po tentially also to the regional difference in etiology and supportive care (Llovet etal.2008 ; Cheng etal.2009 ). Despite the survival benefit reported from these 2Phase III studies, the overall benefit -risk ratio of sorafenib is modest given the known toxicity . Adverse events commonly reported across both sorafenib studies included hand foot skin reaction, diarrhea, hypertension, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, nause a, and rash/desquamation. Drug -related adverse events reported were predomin antly Grade 1or2 in severity. The d rug discontinuation rate in patients receiving sorafenib was 38% in the SHARP trial compared with 20% intheAsia-Pacific tria l. The frequency of dose reductions due to adverse events wassimilar between the 2studies (26% inSHARP and 30.9% in the Asia- Pacific trial ; Llovet etal.2008 ; Cheng etal.2009 ). Despite additional clinical experience with theuse ofsorafenib, the GIDEON study, which evaluated sorafenib in the real -world setting, showed the drug discontinu ation rates due to a dverse events in patients starting at the label -recommended dose of 800mg was 27%, indicating that tolerability has not improved. Moreover, GIDEON showed that in real -life practice, the starting dose of 800 mg daily (400 mg twice a da y [BID]) is halved to 400 mg daily in over 22% of patients ( Lencioni et al. 2014 ). Since the approval of sorafenib, there have been a number of Phase III trial failures in first-line HCC in head -to-head compari sons with sorafenib, including sunitinib, brivanib, and linifanib ( Cheng et al. 2013 ; Johnson et al. 2013 ; Cainap et al. 2015). Recently, front-linetreatment with lenvatinib, a multi -targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , was shown to be non- inferior to sorafenib in terms of OS (l envatinib vs. sorafenib: median OS 13.6 months vs. 12.3 months ; HR0.92 [95% CI: 0.79, 1.06] ; Cheng etal.2017 ) though a clinically meaningful difference in OS from the accepted standard of care remains elusive. Therefore, there remains an ongoing high unmet medical need for patients with advanced unresectable HCC, requiring further evaluation of treatment withnovel, more efficacious, and less toxic agents . 1.3 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOLIZUMA B Atezolizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets PD -L1 and inhibits the interaction between PD -L1 and its receptors, PD -1 and B7 -1 (also known as CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Therapeutic blockade of PD -L1binding by atezolizumab has been shown to enhance the magnitude and quality of tumor -specific T -cell responses, resulting in improved anti -tumor activity (Fehrenbacher et al. 2016 ; Rosenberg et al. 2016 ). Atezolizumab has minimal binding to Fc receptors, thus eliminating detectable Fc -effector function and associated antibody -mediated clearance of activated effector Tcells."

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 31/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Atezolizumab shows anti -tumor activity in both nonclinical models and patients with cancer and is being investigated as a potential therapy in a wide variety of malignancies. Atezolizumab is being studied as a single agent in the advanced cancer and adjuvant therapy settings, as well as in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and cancer immunotherapy. Atezolizumab is appro vedfor the treatment of urothelial carcinoma (UC) ,nonsmall -cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , small -cell lung cancer, and triple- negative breast cancer .

Bevacizumab contains human framework regions and the complementarity -determining regions of a murine antibody that bind sto VEGF, and has an approximate molecular weight of 149 kD. Bevacizumab is produced in a mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cell line. Bevacizumab was first g ranted marketing approval in the United States on 26February 2004 (international birth date) in combination with IV 5 -fluorouracil (5-FU)based chemotherapy for the first -line treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum (CRC). As of November 2016, bevacizumab has been approved for use in over 100 countries worldwide in a variety of indications, including locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer ;advanced, metastatic, or recurrent NSCLC ; advanced and/or metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) ;newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and GBM after relapse or disease progression ;persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer; front-line treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) , primary peritoneal cancer (PPC), or fallopian tube cancer (FTC); and treatment of platinum -sensitive and platinum -resistant recurrent EOC, PPC, or FTC. 1.5 OVERVIEW OF CLINICA LDEVELOPMENT PROGRA M IN HEPA TOCELLULA R CA RCINOMA 1.5.1 Atezolizumab Monotherapy A comprehensive overview of atezolizumab efficac y across all indications is provided in the Atezolizumab Investigator 's Brochure. This section provides an overview of the available efficacy data in patients with HCC treated with atezolizumab as a monotherapy. To date , atezolizumab used as a single agent has shown minimal activity in the treatment of patients with HCC with similar characteristics as those that would be included in this study.

Thelargest cohorts enrolled into this trial consisted of patients with NSCLC, RCC, and UC. Expansion cohorts have included patients with CRC, melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, UC, breast cancer, esophageal cancer, prostate cancer, smal l-cell lung cancer, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, HCC, and other less common tumor types . In the analysis of Study PCD4989g ( clinical cutoff date of 31 Decemb er2016 ) conducted in 15patients with first-and later -line HCC , the median duration of treatment was 2.0months (range: 0.76.3months) . At the time of the clinical cutoff date , 1patient remained on treatment, 12 patients had discontinued treatment due to disease progression, 1 patient discontinued because of an adverse event, and 1 patient was discontinued as per the physician 's decision . Of the 15 response -evaluable patients, none had an objective response (confirmed complete response [CR] or parti al response [PR] as assessed by the investigator per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1). Four patients (33.3%) had stable disease (SD) 24 weeks. No patients had SD 24 weeks. Median progression -free survival (PFS) per theinvestigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 was 2.3months (95% CI: 1.3, 3.4) and median OS was 5.3 months (95% CI: 2.4, NE).

Of the 21 efficacy -evaluable patients (first -line and second -line or greater), 2 patients (9.5% [95% CI: 1.17%, 30.38%]) had a confirmed objective response and 11 patients (52.4% [95% CI: 29.78%, 74.29%]) had thebest response of SD. Median PFS was2.8months (95% CI: 1.4, 7.8) and median OS was 11.1 months (95% CI:4.7months, NE). 1.5.2 Bevacizumab Monotherapy A comprehensive overview of bevacizumab efficacy across all indications is provided in the Bevacizumab Investigator 's Brochure . This section prov idesan overview of the available efficacy data in patients with HCC treated with bevacizumab as a monotherapy. Overall, bevacizumab as a single agent demonstrated minimal activity in HCC, and is unlikely to demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit over the current stand ardof care (sorafenib) based on the survival data observed . Bevacizumab monotherapy was generally safe and well -tolerated in the HCC population , and saf ety findings were consistent with the HCC population and the established safety profi le of bevacizumab. Nonew safety signals related to bevacizumab monotherapy were observed in this patient population. Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma This study was a Phase II, single -center, single- armtrial designed to evaluate the clinical and biological effects of bevacizumab in unresectable HCC ( Siegel etal.2008 ). Adult patients with organ -confined HCC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG )Performance Status of 0 2, and compensated liver function (Child-Pugh ClassA or B7), received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) until disease progression or treatment -limiting toxicity. Of note, patients with extrahepatic disease ortumor invasion of the main portal vein or inferior vena cava were excluded. Given the known prognostic value of these factors, the study likely enrolled a population with a more favorable prognosis and treatment outcome compared witha population that would typically be enrolled in a first-lineHCC study. The pri mary objective was to determine whether bevacizumab improved the 6 -month PFS rate from 40% to at least 60%. Overall, 46patients were enrolled , including 12 patients who received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and 34 patients who received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W. Clinical activity of bevacizumab was observed in patients with non -metastatic HCC. Ofthe 46 patients, 6 patients (13%) had objective responses (95% CI: 3%, 23%), and 65% (95% CI: 51 %, 79%)of patients were progression -freeat 6months. Median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI: 6.5, 9.1) and median OSwas 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.4, 19.9). Nosignificant changes were seen with respect to dose and outcome. The response rates for the 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups were 8.3% and 14.7%, respectively"
33,page_33,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 34/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6(p0.99 by Fisher 's exact test). Median OS times for patients receiving 5 mg/kg and 10mg/kg were 15.1 months and 12.2 months, respectively (p 0.64 by the log-rank test ; Siegel etal.2008 ). Phase II Study of Bevacizumab in A dvanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma This study was a Phase II, single -center, single- armtrial designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and potential biomarkers of the activity of bevacizumab in patients with advanced HCC ( Boige etal.2012 ). Patients with histologically -confirmed advanced HCC that wa s not amenable to curative -intent therapies (e.g., resection, liver transplantation, or percutaneous ablation) received bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q2W until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was to determine the disease -control rate at 16 weeks (16W -DCR) defined as the proportion of patients with a CR, PR, or SD at 16 weeks after study entry, according to RECIST v1.0. Overall, 48patients were enrolled , of which 25 patients were planned to receive bevacizumab 5 mg/kg and 23patients were planned to receive bevacizumab 10 mg/kg , Q2W.Of the 48 patients enrolled , 43patients received at least 1dose of bevacizumab . Among the 38 response -evaluable patients , 6patients achieved a PR (intent -to-treat [ITT] ORR, 14% [95% CI : 4%, 24% ]);the median duration of response (DOR) was 148days (range, 55 362days) ;18patients had SD (DCR, 56%), including 12 patients who experienced SD for 16weeks. The 16W -DCR was 42% (95% CI: 27%, 57%) in the overall population, 39% (95% CI: 19 %, 59%) in patients treated with 5 mg/kg bevacizumab, and 45% (95% CI: 23%, 67%) in those treated at the 10 mg/kg dose. Inthe overall population ( N43), median PFS was 3months (95% CI:2, 4); median OS was 8 months (95% CI: 4, 9; Boige etal.2012 ). 1.6 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSM ENT 1.6.1 Rationale for the Combination of A nti-PD-L1 and A nti-VEGF Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Strong scientific rationale and e merging clinical data suggest that the combined VEGF/PD -L1 blockade may be clinically beneficial in a number of tumor types , including HCC. It is known that HCC is a highly vascularized tumor , and that several pro -angiogenic factors play a role in HCC pathogenesis. For example, in HCC, increased VEGF correlates with vascular density, tumor invasiveness and metastasis, and poor prognosis (Boige etal.2012 ; Frenette 2012 ). The VEGF pathway also plays a crucial role in exerting and maintaining an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through several mechanisms. For ins tance, VEGF -A has been shown to induce FasL expression on endothelial cells, which have the ability to kill effector CD8 T cells, but not T -reg cells. Administration of anti -VEGF -A attenuated tumor endothelial FasL expression and produced a significant increase in the influx of tumor -rejecting CD8 over FoxP3 Tcells, which was FasL -dependent, and led to CD8 -dependent tumor growth"
34,page_34,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 35/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6suppression ( Motz etal.2014 ). Furthermore, bevacizumab can restore and/or maintain the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells, leading to enhanced T -cell infiltration in tumors ( Oelkrug and Ramage 2014 ; Wallinetal.2016 ). In addition to increased trafficking of Tcells into tumors ( Manning etal.2007 ), several publications have illustrated that anti -VEGF ther apies can also reduce the frequency of myeloid- derived suppressor cells, decrease production of suppressive cytokines, and lower the expression of inhibitory checkpoints on CD8 T cells in tumors ( Roland etal.2009 ; Voron etal.2015 ). Therefore, the im munomodulatory effect of bevacizumab is expected to increase CD8 T-cell recruitment and relieve intra -tumoral immunosuppression, thereby boosting the effects of atezolizumab. 1.6.2 Clinical Data of A tezolizumab in Combination w ith Bevacizumab in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Preliminary data from Study GO30140 indicates substantial numerical improvement in ORR for the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab compared withsorafenib, the current global standard of care, in patients with locally advanced or metasta tic HCC , support ingthe hypothesis of a synergistic /complementary effect of atezolizumab and bevacizumab . Efficacy : Study GO30140 Study GO30140 is a Phase Ib, multicenter study of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab and/or first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic cancer. Arm A is designed to test the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy . Patients received 1200 mg of ate zolizumab and 15 mg/kg of bevacizumab on Day 1 of every 21-day cycle (Q3W ). Based on a clinical cutoff date of 26 July 2018, 103patients (recruited from the United States and South Korea) with HCC received atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination therapy. All patients received atezolizumab and bevacizumab as first-line therapy. Atthe time of the clinical cutoff date, 70patients remained on treatment, 18patients had discontinued treatment due to disease progression, 2 patients discontinued treatment due to symptomatic deterioration, 6 patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, 4 patients discontinued treatment due to death, and 3patients discontinued treatment due to patient decision or for other reasons. Efficacy analyses were performed in the efficacy -evaluable population, defined as all patients who received any amount of the combination treatment and have been followed in the study for at least 16 weeks . Based on a clinical cutoff date of 26 July 2018, 73patients enrolled into Arm A were efficacy -evaluable with a median duration of survival follow -up of 7.2 months . Based on IRF -assessment per RECIST v1.1, the confirmed ORR was 27.4% (95% CI:17.6, 39.1). Among the 20 responders, 4 patients (20%) achieved a CR and"
35,page_35,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 36/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6the remaining 16 patients (80%) achieved a PR. The ORR based on the investigator ’s assess ment per RECIST v1.1 was numerically similar to the ORR based on the IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1. According to the investigator assess ment per RECIST v1.1, 23 of 73 efficacy -evaluable patients (31.5% [95% CI: 21.1, 43.4]) achieved confirmed objective responses, with 1 patient (1.4%) achieving a CR . When tumor scans were assessed by the IRF according to HCC modified RECIST ( mRECIST ) criteria, 25 of 73 efficacy -evaluable patients ( 34.2% [ 95% CI: 23.5, 46.3]) achieved a confirmed objective response, 8 of those 25 responders (32%) achieved a best overall response of CR, and 17 of 25 responders (68%) achieved a best overall response of PR . Importantly, responses were observed in all assessed patient subgroups, including etiology, region, baseline -fetoprotein ( AFP),and tumor burden. At the time of the clinical cutoff date, 80% (16 of 20 patients ) of the IRF -assessed responses per RECIST v1.1 were ongoing, with durations ranging from 1.6to 22.0months ( denotes censored data). Nine patients had responses of 6 months or longer per IRF -assessment by RECIST v1.1. The median DOR has not been reached by IRF -assessment (per RECIST v.1.1 or HCC mRECIST) or investigator assessment (per RECIST v1.1), nor has the median OS been reached. The median PFS by IRF- assessment per RECIST v1.1 and per HCC mRECIST was 7.5 months (95% CI: 5.4 14.9) and the median PFS by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 was 14.9 months (95% CI: 7.4 NE). The 6 -month PFS rate was 56% by IRF -assessment per RECIST v1.1, 65% by investigator assessment perRECIST v1.1 ,and 58% by IRF -assessment per HCC mRECIST. These estimates ofmedian PFS are considered to be unstable and expected to change with longer follow -up. Safety : Study GO30140 In the analysis of safety data from Study GO30140 (clinical cutoff date 26 July 2018) in 103 patients with HCC (median treatment duration with atezolizumab was 3.5months [range: 024months]; median treatment duration with bevaciz umab was 3.5months [range: 023months]), the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was generally safe and well -tolerated; no new safety signals related to the combination therapy were identified beyond the established safety profile for each individual agent. Furthermore, no unexpected adverse events were observed. Overall, 95patients ( 92.2%) experienced at least 1adverse event. The most common adverse events ( 20%) were decreased appetite ( 28.2%) and fatigue , pyrexia, and rash (20.4% each ). Forty -onepatients ( 39.8%) experienced a Grade 3 4 adverse event, with the most common Grade 3 4 adverse events ( 4%) being hypertension ( 11.7%) and increased AST ( 4.9%). Treatment -related Grade 34 adverse events were reported in 28 patients (27. 2%), the most common being hypertension (9.7%) and neutrophil count decreased (2.9%)."
36,page_36,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 37/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6A total of 36 patients (35%) experienced serious adverse events . Treatment -related serious adverse events occurred in 19patients (18.4%), most of which were a single occurrence except colitis, esophageal varices hemorrhage and pneumonitis (1.9% each) . Five patients (4.9%) experienced Grade 5 adverse events, of which 2 patients (1.9%) experienced Grade 5 t reatment -related adverse events . Six patient s(5.8%) discontinued both atezolizumab and bevacizumab treatment due to adverse events. Eight patients (7.8%) discontinued atezolizumab and 10 patients (9.7%) discontinued bevacizumab due to adverse events . All adverse events leading to any atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab discontinuation were single occurrence sexcept for esophageal varices hemorrhage in 2patients ( 1.9%), which led to discontinuation of bevacizumab only. 1.6.3 COVID -19 Considerations In the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic, patients with comorbidities, including those with cancer, are considered a more vulnerable population with the potential for more severe clinical outcomes from COVID -19. However, it is unclear whether or how systemic cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy impact the incidence or severity of COVID -19. A possible consequence of inhibiting the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway may be the modulation of the host immune response to acute infection, which may result in immunopathology or dysregulated immune system defenses. In nonclinical models, PD -1/PD -L1 blockade appears to be associated with serious exacerbation of inflammation in the setting of acute (as opposed to chronic) viral infection with lympho cytic choriomeningitis virus (Clone 13; Frebel et al. 2012). However, there are insufficient and inconsistent clinical data to assess if outcome from COVID -19 is altered by cancer immunotherapy. Severe COVID -19 appears to be associated with a cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) involving the inflammatory cytokines IL -6, IL -10, IL- 2, and interferon - (Merad and Martin 2020). While it is not known ,there may be a potential for an increased risk of an enhanced inflammatory response if a patient develops acut e SARS -CoV -2 infection while receiving atezolizumab. At this time, there is insufficient evidence for causal association between atezolizumab and an increased risk of severe outcomes from COVID -19. There may be potential synergy or overlap in clinical and radiologic features for immune -mediated pulmonary toxicity with atezolizumab and clinical and radiologic features for COVID 19-related interstitial pneumonia. Thus, investigators should use their clinical judgment when evaluating and managing patients with pulmonary symptoms."

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY 3.1.1 Overview of Study Design This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, open -label , two -armstudy designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab andbevacizumab versus sorafenib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC who have received no prior systemic treatment . This study will enroll approximately 480 patients randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: Arm A (experimental arm): Atezolizumab 1200 mg IV infusion Q3W (dosed in 3-week cycles) andbevacizumab 15 mg/kg Q3W(dosed in 3-week cycles) Arm B (control arm): Soraf enib 400 mg by mouth , BID, continuously Randomization will be stratified according to the following stratification factors : Geographic region (Asia excl uding Japan vs. rest of world) Macro vascular invasion and/or extrahepa tic spread (presence vs. absence ) Baseline AFP ( 400 vs. 400 ng/m L) ECOG Performance Status (0 vs .1) The study schema is shown in Figure 1. Patients randomized to the atezolizumab andbevacizumab arm (Arm A) who transiently withhold or permanently discontinue either atezolizumab or bevacizumab may continue on single -agent therapy as long as the patients are experiencing clinical benefit in the opinion of the investigator and after discussion with the Medical Monitor (i.e., patients transiently withheld or permanently discontinued from bevacizumab treatment for adverse effects may continue atezolizumab monotherapy and vice versa). Patients will receive atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab or sorafenib until unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, and clinical status (e.g., symptomatic deterioration such as pain secondary to disease). In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving atezolizumab and/or bevacizumab or sorafenib will be permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet allof the following criteria: Evidence of clinical benefit , as determined by the investigator following a review of all available data Absence of symptoms and signs (i ncluding laboratory values, such as new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease"
42,page_42,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status that can be attributed to disease progression Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline and at regular intervals during study treatment (see Section 4.5.5 and Appendix 1). Additional scans will be performed as clinically indicated. Tumor assessments will continue until disease progression, regardless of whether treatment has been discontinued (e.g. ,for toxicity). Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 criteria for progression will undergo tumor assessments until disea se progression (per immune -modified RECIST [imRECIST]) or loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurs later . In the absence of disease progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start new anti -cancer therapy, until consent is withdrawn, death, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Following disease progression, patients will be followed for survival and subsequent anti -cancer therapies until death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Sites will provide imaging used for tumor assessment sto an IRFto enable centralized, independent review of response and progression endpoints. These reviews will be performed prior to the pre- specifi ed efficacy analyses. Independent Review Facility membership and procedures will be detailed in an IRF Charter. Safety assessments will include the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities graded per the National Canc er Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Laboratory safety assessments will include the regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry. Serum samples will be collected to monitor the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab when administered in combination with bevacizumab . Patient samples, including archival tumor tissues as well as serum andplasma, will be collected for future exploratory biomarker assessments. This study will initially enroll approximately 480 patients across all sites in a global enrollment phase. The Sponsor is targeting a total enrollment of approximately 135 patients from mainland China. After completion of the global enrollment phase, in theevent that less than 135patients from mainland China are enrolled, additional patients in China may be subsequently randomized into the two treatment arms in a 2:1ratio in an extended China enrollment phase to ensure a total of approximately 13 5patients from mainland China in aChina subpopulation. TheChina subpopulation will include all patients enrolled in China (i.e., during both the global enrollment phase and the extended China enrollment phase). The patients enrolled in the China extension phase will undergo the same sc hedule of activities and will receive atezolizumab andbevacizumab, or sorafenib"

44,page_44,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 45/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Following the data review, the iDMC will provide a recommendation to the Sponsor whether to continue the study, amend the protocol, or stop the study. The final decision will rest with the Sponsor. Any outcomes of these safety reviews that affect study conduct will be communicated in a timely manner to the investigators for notification of the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) /Ethics Committees (ECs). Members of the iDMC will be external to the Sponsor. An iDMC charter will outline roles and responsibilities of the iDMC members as well as the policies and procedures to be followed by the iDMC. 3.2 END OF STUDY The end of this study is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs (i.e., last patient in the global and extended China enrollment phases combined) or safety follow -up is received from the last patient (global and extended China enrollment phases combined), whichever occurs later. In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time. 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for A tezolizumab Dose and Schedule Atezolizumab will be administered at a fi xed dose of 1200 mg Q3 W (1200 mg on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle), which is the approved dosage for atezolizumab (Tecentriq). Anti-tumor activity has been observed across doses ranging from 1 20mg/kg Q3 W. InStudy PCD4989g , the maximum tolerated dose of atezolizumab was not reached and no dose- limiting toxicities were observed at any dose. The fixed dose of 1200 mg Q3 W (equivalent to an average body weight based dose of 15 mg/kg Q3 W) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies ( Deng etal.2016 ) and available clinical PK, e fficacy, and safety data (refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator 's Brochure for details). 3.3.2 Rationale for Bevacizumab Dose and Schedule Bevacizumab will be administered at a fixed dose of 15 mg /kgQ3Won Day 1 of each 21-day cycle ,which is the approved dosage for bevacizumab. This dose schedule aligns with the atezolizumab dose schedule highlighted above and is the dose used in combination with atezolizumab in Study GO30140. In this study, the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab was generally safe and well -tolerated and no new safety signals related to the combination therapy were identified beyond the established safety profile for each individual agent. 3.3.3 Rationale for Patient Population This study will enroll patients with untreated locally advanced or metastatic HCC, regardless of PD -L1 expression or HCC etiology. The broad patient population selected is similar to th e population enrolled in Study GO30140 , the initial study testing this combination first-line in patients with HCC."
45,page_45,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 46/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Although sorafenib is approved for the first-linetreatment of patients with advanced HCC, the prognosis of these patients remains poor with a median OSreported of 6.510.7 months. Treatment with sorafenib is also associated with significant toxicity including hand -foot skin reaction, diarrhea, hypertension, weight loss, fatigue, anorexia, alopecia, nausea, and rash/desquamation , all of which negatively impact the quality -of- life. Therefore, there is a continuing need for more efficacious, better tolerated treatments for the first -line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic HCC. Patients accrued on the study are also required to have adequate liver functio n,defined as Child- Pugh Class A. Patients with a Child -Pugh Class B or C rating have an increased risk of death due to underlying cirrhosis , which could potentially confound the appropriate evaluation of treatment -related anti -tumor efficacy; these patients are thus , excluded from the study. The proposed study population is the recommended patient population in the initial study of a new agent or combination of agents for HCC , as noted by an expert panel convened by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD ; Llovet etal.2008 ). 3.3.4 Rationale for Control Arm Patients in the control arm will receive sorafenib. Sorafenib is the only globally approved targeted therapy for patients with unresectable HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy and is considered theacceptable standard of care globally. Thesurvival benefit of sorafenib was demonstrated in 2randomized Phase III trials versus placebo, one in a W estern population and one in an Asian -Pacif icpopulation as discussed in Section 1.2. Sorafenib is the standard of care and the NCCN- , European Association for the Study of the Liver ( EASL )-, and Asian -Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver ( APASL )-recommended initial therapy regimen for patients with HCC (Omata et al. 2010; EASL -EORTC 2012 ; NCCN 2017 ). As such, this study will utilize sorafenib 400 mg BID continuously, the approved dose and schedule. While lenvatinib recently demonstrated non -inferiority versus sorafenib in terms of OS in patients with advanced HCC (13.6 months for lenvatinib versus 12.3 months for sorafenib) in a randomized Phase III trial ( Cheng et al. 2017), it h as not been approved globally for this indication. Therefore, the Sponsor believes that the choice of using sorafenib as control treatment is appropriate. 3.3.5 Rationale for Open -Label Study An open -label study design was chosen for this Phase III study given the unique toxicity profile sof the treatments in ea chstudy arm ; patients as well as physicians may be capable of iden tifying treatment assignment if the treatment was assigned blinded. Furthermore, a blinded study would require patients randomized to so rafenib to receive placebo infusions of atezolizumab and bevacizumab which the Sponsor believes would impose unnecessary burden and excessive risk to patients."
46,page_46,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 47/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6As part of the study design, adequate steps have been taken to ensure the validity of the data i n this open -label study (i.e., IRF-assessed PFS co -primary objective and IRF-assessed ORR as secondary endpoints). 3.3.6 Rationale for Overall Survival and Progression -Free Survival as Co -Primary Endpoints In this study, the co -primary efficacy endpoints will be OS and IRF-assessed PFS. Overall survival was chosen as one of the co -primary endpoints for this study because the measurement of this endpoint is clearly defined, and patients can be evaluated objectively. Progression- free survival was chosen as a co -primary endpoint for this study because PFS is an important, clinically meaningful metric to demonstrate the efficacy of anti-cancer regimens in many first -line disease settings, particularly where additional lines of therapy are common. In addition, data from several tumor types have suggested a strong correlation between PFS and OS, thus supporting PFS as a robust surrogate predictor of OS and clinical benefit (Adunlin et al. 2015; Dabbous et al. 2017). 3.3.7 Rationale for Strati fication To balance the disease -related prognostic factors across treatment arms, randomization of patients into the study will be stratified. The proposed stratification factors are the following : Geographic region (Asia excl uding Japan vs. rest of world) Macro vascular invasion and/or extrahepa tic spread (presence vs. absence ) Baseline AFP ( 400 vs. 400 ng/m L) ECOG Performance Status (0 vs .1) 3.3.7.1 Geographic Region Although HCC is a global disease, there is significant geographic heterogeneity in terms of efficacy outcomes. In the SHARP trial, which recruited patients from Europe, Australia, and the Americas, median OS in the sorafenib and placebo treated arm was 10.7 and 7.9 months , respectively (Llovet et al.2008 ). In the Asia -Pacific trial, which recruited patients from China, South Korea, and Hong Kong, the median OS in the sorafenib and placebo treated arm was 6.5 and 4.2 month s, respectively (Cheng et al.2009 ). In a subgroup analys es of Phase III trial sevaluating sorafenib versus other multi -kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, brivanib, and linifanib) , similar trends of difference sin median OS were observed consistently between the 2regions (sunitinib study: median OS 7.9 months [Asia] vs. 15.3 months [non-Asia]; brivanib study: median OS 8.7 months [Asia] vs. 10.9 months [non-Asia]; linifanib study :median OS 8.2months [Asia] vs. 11.3 months [non-Asia] ; Cheng etal.2013 ; Johnson etal.2013 ; Cainap etal.2015 )."
47,page_47,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 48/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6These differences in outcome may be attributed to several potential causes that include regional differences in etiology and clinical practice patterns . Hepatitis B virus infection is the main risk factor for HCC in Asia (70%), while i n Western countries and Japan, the main risk factor is HCV infection (50%70%) and excessive alcohol intake (20%) , along with other causes of cirrhosis (10%), and l iterature has long cited that clinicopathologic features and prognoses differ among the different etio logies of HCC (Llovet etal.2003 ;Sanyal etal.2010 ; Nault 2014 ). Furthermore, even with the same etiology ,the OSof patients differ s, which can be attribut edtothe difference in clinical practice between the 2regions ( Cheng etal.2013 ). Patients r ecruited from Asian regions, who may be considered ineligible for surgery or other localized treatments because of extent of disease, may have been treated more aggressively, with more transarterial chemoembolization and surgical treatment than patients re cruited from other regions. Therefore, Asian- region patients recruited into clinical trials for first -line treatment may have more advanced disease and thus ,worse outcomes than patients from other regions (Cheng et al.2009 ). Given this geographic heterogene ity,randomization into the study will be stratified by geographic region (Asia excl uding Japan vs. rest of world) . The median OS of advanced HCC for patients inJapan more closely resemble sthose of Western countries, and ; therefore ,Japan will not be included in the Asia region subgroup (Kudo etal.2016 ). 3.3.7.2 Macrovascular Invasion and/or Extrahepatic Spread (Presence vs. A bsence) Randomization of patients will be stratified by presence or absence of extrahepatic spread or macrovascular invasion b ecause these 2factors have been shown to be strong independent prognostic factors associated with shorter OS. Patients with extra hepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion have a worse prognosis than patients without either of these 2factors, and stratification by these 2variables has been recommended by an expert panel convened by the AASLD ( Llovet etal.2008 ; Bruix etal.2012 ; Cheng etal.2012 ; Bruix et al. 2017). 3.3.7.3 Baseline -Fetoprotein (400ng/mL vs.400ng/mL) Very high serum AFP level ( 400ng/mL ) isastrong prognostic factor of shorter OS time for patients with HCC, including those receiving sorafenib (Bronowicki etal.2015 ; Bruix etal.2017 ). Though serum AFP level may be an indirect measure of tumor burden, multivariate analysis has shown that even when tumor morphology is accounted for,AFP levels greater than 400ng/mL still have independent prognostic value , suggesting that itcould be a marker of a biologically more aggressive phenotype (Cancer of the L iver Italian Program Investigators 1998 ). Therefore, given the prognostic impact of serum AFP level, randomization of patients in this s tudy will be stratif iedby their baseline serum AFP level ( 400ng/mL vs.400ng/mL) ."
48,page_48,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol YO40245 , Version 63.3.7.4 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (0vs. 1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status is regarded as an acceptable andcomprehensive parameter to determine the degree of health status in patients with cancer. In patients with HCC, a poor performance st atus isassociated with larger tumor burden and more severe cirrhosis and is an indispensable surrogate to reflect the general condition of patients. Deterioration of performance status was identified as an independent predictor of decreased survival, and patients with a performance status of 1 had a 34% increased risk of mortality compared with patients with a performance status of 0(Hsuet al. 2013 ). In the Phase IIItrials evaluating linifanib, brivanib, and most recently levatinib, patients with a performance status of 1 had a decreased medial OS compared withpatients with a performance status of0 in both the experimental and control arms ( Johnson et al. 2013 ;Cainap et al. 201 5; Cheng et al. 2017 ). Stratification by ECOG Performance Status has a lso been recommended by an expert panel convened by the AASLD ( Llovet et al. 2008). 3.3.8 Rationale for Study Treatment bey ond Initial Radiographic Progression In studies of immunotherapeutic agents, CR, PR , and SDhave each been shown to occur after radiographi c evidence of an apparent increase in tumor burden. This initial increase in tumor burden caused by immune -cellinfiltration in the setting of a T -cell response has been termed pseudoprogression ( Hales et al. 2010 ). In Study PCD4989g, evidence of tumor g rowth followed by a response was observed in several tumor types. In addition, in some responding patients with radiographic evidence of progression, biopsies of new lesions or areas of new growth in existing lesions revealed immune cells and no viable ca ncer cells. For sorafenib treatment, as noted in the prescribing information, it can be continue duntil the patient is no longer clinically benefitting from therapy or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. Therefore , this study will allow all patients to continue their assigned treatment after apparent radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1, provided the benefit -risk ratio is judged to be favorable by the investigator (see criteria in Section 3.1). Patients should be discontinued for unacceptable toxicity or loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic and biochemical data, and clinical st atus (see Section 3.1for details). 3.3.9 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments Several exploratory biomarkers may correlate with clinical response of atezol izumab in combination with bevacizumab. Since the VEGF pathway plays a crucial role in exerting and maintaining an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment through several mechanisms, the abundance of pre existing CD8T-cell infiltrates, the expression of PD-L1 in tumors, or gene signatures related to the tumor stromal environment may be important determinants of clinical responses. In the current study, archival or baseline tumor specimens will be collected from patients and tested retrospectively with protein or genomic/transcriptomic platforms to explore the potential relationship to clinical"
49,page_49,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 50/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6responses. In addition to the assessment of PD -L1 expression and CD8 T -cell status, other exploratory biomarkers, such as potential predictive and prognostic bi omarkers related to the clinical benefit of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab, tumor immunobiology, mechanisms of resistance, or tumor type, may be analyzed. Archival tumor tissue will be collected at baseline if available . These baseline tissu es will enable exploratory analysis of tumor tissue biomarkers related to clinical response, resistance, or disease progression. Plasma and serum samples will be collected at baseline and during the study to evaluate changes in peripheral biomarkers such a s immune -related biomarkers (e.g., interleukin -2 [IL-2], interferon- ). Changes in biomarkers may provide evidence of biologic activity of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab in humans. Correlations between these biomarkers and safety and efficacy endpoints will be explored to identify blood -based biomarkers that might predict which patients are more likely to benefit from atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination therapy . Tumor tissue and blood samples will be analyzed through use of next -generat ion sequencing (NGS), and/or additi onal protein detection methods to identify signatures and/or other biomarkers that are predictive of response to the combination, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state, are associated with acquire d resistance to the combination, are associated with susceptibility to developing adverse events, or can increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology. 3.3.10 Rationale for Patient -Reported Outcome sAssessments Both cancer -and treatment -related symptoms and the associated impact on health- related quality -of-life (HRQoL) in patients with HCC are complex. Historically, hepatobiliary cancers have been associated with poor prognosis and HRQoL (Heffernan et al. 2002 ). Patients with HCC have reported worse nedphysical, psychological, functional well -being, and hepatobiliary symptoms (pain, fatigue, anorexia/weight loss, obstructive jaundice/ascites) compared with the general population. Similarly, patients with HCC have reported worse nedphysical wel l-being and overall HRQoL compared with patients who have chronic liver disease (Fanetal.2010 ). W hile there have been many advances in HCC treatment, and survival data and information about side effects of treatment are becoming more readily available, much less is known about the impact HCC treatments have on the patients’ HRQoL. Patient -reported information regarding treatment -related symptoms and other aspects of quality -of-life are valuable for both patients and clinicians in decision -making and may also predict survival. Common patient -reported symptoms of disease in this patient population include abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, poor appetite, and jaundice (Sunet al. 2008). The concepts of symptom burden and HRQoL are best documented"
50,page_50,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 51/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6throu gh standardized patient -reported outcomes (PROs), and validated measures will be used to assess these aspects at pre -specified timepoints in the study (see Appendix 1). TheEuropean Organi sation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality -of-Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -C30; see Section 4.5.8.1 )and its HCC disease specific module ( EORTC QLQ -HCC18; see Section 4.5.8.2 )have been selected on the basis of their content validity ,performance , and breadth of concepts measured .

Premedication with anti histamines , anti- pyretics, and/or analgesics may be administered for the second and subsequent atezoliz umab infusions only, at the discretion of the investigator. In general, investigators should manage a patient's care (including preexisting conditions) with supportive therapies other than those defined as cautionary or prohibited therapies (see Sections 4.4.2 and 4.4.2.2 )as clinically indicated, p er local standard practice. Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or H 2-receptor antagonists (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), or equivalent medications per lo cal standard practice. Serious infusion- associated events manifested by dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g. ,supplemental oxygen and 2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix 9). 4.4.2 Cautionary Therapy 4.4.2.1 Herbal Therapies Concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their pharmacokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug- drug interactions are generall y unknown. However, herbal therapies not intended for the treatment of cancer (see Section 4.4.3 ) may be used during the study at the discretion of the investigator. 4.4.2.2 Cautionary Therapy for A tezolizumab -Treated Patients 4.4.2.3 Corticosteroids , Immunosuppressive Medications, and TNF - Inhibitors Systemic corticosteroids, immunosuppressive medications, and TNF -inhibitors may attenuate potent ial beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab. Therefore, in situations in which systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications, or TNF- inhibitors would be routinely administered, alternatives, including antihistamines, shou ld be considered. If the alternatives are not feasible, systemic corticosteroids , immunosuppressive medications, and TNF -inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. Systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications are recommended, at the discretion of the investigator, for the treatment of specific adverse events when"

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 67/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6associated with atezolizumab therapy ( seeAppendix 12and the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for details). 4.4.2.4 Cautionary Therapy for Sorafenib -Treated Patients Medications Given w ith Precaution due to Effects Related to Cytochrome P450 E nzymes In vitro data suggest that sorafenib inhibits CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Systemic exposure to substrates of CYP2B6 and CYP2C8 is expected to increase when co -administered with sorafenib. Therefore, the medications listed below should be avoided. If use of one of these medications is necessary, the risks and benefits should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to concomitant administration with sorafenib. CYP2B6 substrates, including, but not limited to, bupropion and efavirenz CYP2C8 substrates, including , but not limited to ,repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone The above lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive. The investigator should consult the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medicatio n can be safely administered with study treatment. In addition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above. UGT1A 1 and UGT1A 9 Sub strates Caution is recommended when administering sorafenib with compounds that are metabolized/eliminated predominantly by the UGT1A1 pathway ( e.g., irinotecan). Sorafenib inhibits glucuronidation by the UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 pathways. Systemic exposure to substrates of UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 may increase when co -admini stered with sorafenib. For additional detail, see local prescribing information. Anti-Arrhythmic Medications or Other Medications that Lead to QT Prolongation Sorafenib has been shown to prolong the QT/QTc interval, which may lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia. Caution is recommended when administering sorafenib with certain anti -arrhythmic medicines or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation. Strong CYP3A 4 Inducers Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase metabolism of sorafenib and thus decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib. Caution is recommended for concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers (including, but not limited to, phenytoin, St. John's Wort, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, and phenobarbital) with sorafenib. For additional details, see local prescribing information."

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 68/Protocol YO40245 , Version 64.4.3 Prohibited Therapy Use of the following concomitant therapies is prohibited as described below: Concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer (including, but not limited to, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and herbal therapy), whether health authority approved or experimental, is prohibited for various time periods prior to starting study treatment, depending on the agent (see Section 4.1.2 ), and during study treatment, until disease progression is documented and the patient has discontinued study treatment , with the exception of palliative radi otherapy and local therapy under certain circumstances (see Section 4.4.1 for details) Investigational therapy is prohibited within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment Live, attenuated vaccines (e.g., FluMist) are prohibited within 4 weeks prior to initiation of study treatment, during atezolizumab treatment, and for 5 months after the last dose of atezolizumab Systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to, interferons and IL-2) are prohibited within 4 weeks or 5 drug -elimination half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to initiation of study treatment and during study treatment because these agent s could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions when given in combination with atezolizumab Systemic immunosuppressive medications (including, but not limited to, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide) are prohibited during study treatment because these agents could potentially alter the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab Current use of full -dose anti -coagulants , thrombolytic therapy at therapeutic doses, or anti -platelet therapy are prohibited Local label -recommende d doses for prophylactic use of anti -coagulants or thrombolytic therapies is allowed. Low-dose aspirin ( 325 mg/day) is permitted. Co administration of proton pump inhibitors is strongly recommended to reduce potential GI damage. If a patient experiences a venous thromboembolism (VTE) event while still receiving study drug treatment, it may still be possible for the patient to remain on study medication despite anticoagulation treatment (see Section 4.1.2). Use of warfarin or Coumadin -like products (includes for prophylactic use) is prohibited Prophylactic use of low -dose anticoagulation, unfractionated heparin or LMW H is permitted. The preferred choice for anticoagulation treatment should be LM WH as per ASCO guidelines ( Lyman et al. 2015). Concomitant chronic use of NSAIDs while receiving study drugs is prohibited , with the exception of chronic low -dose aspirin ( 325 mg/day).

The schedule of biomarker, PK, and immunogenicity sampling is provided in Appendix 2. All activities must be performed and documented for each patient. If scheduled dosing and study assessments are precluded because of a holiday, weekend, or other event, then dosing may be postponed to the soonest following date, with subsequent dosing continuing on a 21- day schedule. If treatment was postponed for fewer than 3 days, the patient can resume the original schedu le. After 6complete cycles, 1of 3cycles may be delayed by 1 week (28 days instead of 21days for 1cycle) to allow for vacations/holidays. Following the delay, the next cycle visit must be 21 days from the previous Day 1 visit: 2consecutive 28 cycles are not permitted. Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable. 4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -related procedures (including screening evaluations). Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrollment. The investigator will maintain a screen ing log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Patients who fail their first screening for study eligibility may qualify for 1re-screening opportunity (for a total of 2 screenings per patient) at the investigator’s discretion. All re- screening requests will require approval by the Medical Monitor or designee. 4.5.2 Medical History , Concomitant Medication, and Demographic Data Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, will be recorded at baseline. In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to initiation of study treatment will be recorded. At the time of each follow -up physical"
69,page_69,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 70/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6examination, an interval medical histo ry should be obtained and any changes in medications and allergies should be recorded. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity. 4.5.3 Physical Examinations A complete physical examination, performed at screening, should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, GI, genitourinary, and neurologic systems. Anyabnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be performed at specified post-baseline visits and as clinically indicated. Changes from baselin e abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. As part of the tumor assessment, physical examinations should include the evaluation of the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. 4.5.4 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic BP, and temperature. Vital signs are to be measured before, during , and after infusions for Arm A as outlined in Table 5 , and at other specified timepoints as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1).

70,page_70,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 71/Protocol YO40245 , Version 64.5.5 Tumor and Response Evaluations Patients will undergo tumor assessments at baseline, then every 6 weeks (1 week) for the first 54 weeks following treatment initiation, and every 9 weeks (1 week) thereafter, regardless of dose delays, until radiographic disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or (for patients who continue treatment after radiographic disease progression) loss of clinical benefit as determined by the investigator (see Section 3.1for details). Patients who meet RECIST v1.1 criteria for progression will undergo tumor assessments until disease progression per imRECIST or loss of clinical benefit, whichever occurs later. Inthe absence of disease progression, tumor assessments should continue regardless of whether patients start new anti -cancer therapy, until consent is withdrawn, death, or the study is terminated by t he Sponsor, whichever occurs first. At the investigator 's discretion, tumor assessments may be repeated at any time if progressive disease is suspected. All measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at screening. Tumor assessment s performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment do not have to be repeated at screening. Screening assessments must include CTscans (with oral or IV contrast) or magnetic resona nce imaging ( MRI)scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A spiral CT scan of the chest may be obtained but is not a requirement. If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (e.g., in patients with impaired renal clearance), a non -contrast CT scan of the chest and MRI scans of the abdomen and pelvis should be performed. If a CT scan with contrast is not contraindicated, i t is mandatory to obtain a multi -phase imaging of the liver , and e very effort should be made to time the contrast administration so that high-quality arterial -phase imaging is obtained throughout the liver on the first run, and high-quality portal venous -phase imaging is obtained throughout the liver on the second run. A CT scan with contrast or MRI scan of the head must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastasis in all patients (MRI scan must be performed if CT scan is contraindicated). An MRI scan of the head is required to confirm or refute the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal CT scan. Patients with a history of irradiated brain metastases and without measurable brain lesion at screening are not required to undergo brain scans at subsequent tumor evaluations, unless scans are clinically indicated per local standard of care. Bone scans or PET scans and CT scans of the neck should also be performed if clinically indicated. At the investigator's discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 may be used. If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed in a positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full-contrast diagnostic CT scan."
71,page_71,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 72/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6All measurable and evaluable lesions should be re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at screening should be used for subsequent tumor assessments (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans). Response will be assessed by the inves tigator with use of RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3) and imRECIST (see Appendix 4). Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits. Results must be reviewed by the investigator before dosing at the next cycle. Scans will be submitted to an I RF for central review for evaluation of secondary progression and response efficacy endpoints. 4.5.6 Laboratory , Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for analysis: Hematology: WBC count, RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells) Chemistry panel (serum or plasma): bicarbonate or total carbon dioxide (ifconsidered standard of care for the region), sodium, potassium, magnesium, chloride, glucose, BUN or urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, LDH Coagulation: INR, aPTT Thyroid function testing: thyroid- stimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine (T3) (ortotal T3 for sites where free T3 is not performed), free thyroxine (also known asT4) AFP testing in blood HIV serology HBV serology: Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ), hepatitis B surface an tibody, total hepatitis B core antibody ( HBcAb ) If a patient has a positive HBsAg test and/or a positive total HBcAb test at screening, an HBV DNA test should be performed at screening. HCV serology: HCV antibody and (if HCV antibody test is positive) HCV RNA If a patient has a positive HCV antibody test at screening, an HCV RNA test must also be performed to determine if the patient has an active HCV infection . Pregnancy test All women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at screenin g. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at specified subsequent visits. If aurine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test."

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 73/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not reach ed a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Urinalysis (pH, specific gravity, glucose, protein, ketones, andblood); dipstick permitted The following samples will be sent to one or several central laboratories or to the Sponsor or a designee for analysis: Pharmacokinetic assays Serum samples will be assayed for atezolizumab concentration with use of validated immunoassays. Anti-drug antibody ( ADA)assays Serum samples will be assayed for the presence of ADAs to atezolizumab with use of validated immunoassays. Quantitative HBsAg Serum and plasma samples for exploratory research on biomarkers Exploratory biomarker research may include, but not be limited to, analysis of genes or gene signatures associated with tumor immunobiology, PD -L1, or cytokines associated with T -cell activation and may involve extraction of circulating tumor DNA, or RNA, analysis of somatic mutations by NGS. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for optional exploratory research (see Section4.5.10 ), biological samples will be destroyed when the final CSR has been completed, with the following exceptions: Serum samples collected fo r PK or immunogenicity analysis may be needed for additional immunogenicity characterization and PK and immunogenicity assay development and validation; therefore, these samples will be destroyed no later than 5years after the final CSR has been completed Serum, plasma, andtumor tissue samples collected for biomarker research will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the final CSR has been completed For enrolled patients, remaining archival tissue blocks will be returned to the site upon request or 18months after final closure of the study database, whichever occurs first. For patients who are not enrolled, remaining archival tissue blocks will be returned to the site no later than 6 weeks after eligibility determination. When a patient withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the samples be destroyed or local laws require destruction of the samples. However, if"
73,page_73,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 74/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data. Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4. 4.5.7 Electrocardiograms An ECG is required at screening and when clinically indicated. Electrocardiograms for each patient should be obtained from the same machine wherever possible. Lead placement should be as consistent as possible. Electrocardiogram recordings must be performed after the patient has been resting in a supine position for at least 10minutes. For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper c opies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study file at the site. Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities must be documented on the eCRF. 4.5.8 Patient -Reported Outcomes To more fully characterize the clinical pro file of atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab , PRO data will be obtained through use of the following instruments: theEORTC QLQ -C30, HCC disease- specific treatment questionnaire (EORTC QLQ -HCC18), and the EQ-5D-5L. Thequestionnaires will be translated as appropriate (if necessary) in the country language(s) and as feasible in the local language. To ensure instrument validity and that data standards meet health authority requirements, questionnaires must be completed by the patient during a clinic visit before discussion of the patient’s health state, lab oratory results, or health record, before administration of study treatment , and/or prior to any other study assessment(s ). Patients will complete paper versions of the EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -HCC18, and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires at the clinic site on Cycle 1, Day 1 and Day 1 of every cycle thereafter until the treatment discontinuation visit (included); after treatment discontinuation or disease progression, whichever come s first, questionnaires will be completed every 3 months (for 1 year), unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study as is denoted in Appendix 1. Paper PRO questionnaires will be provided and collected by site staff. Questionnaires should be self -administered, or they can be interviewer -administered by staff prior to other study assessments. Study personnel should review all questionnaires for completeness before a patient leaves the investigational site. Patients for whom PRO questionnaires are not available in their native language or who are deemed by the investigator incapable of completi ng their PRO assessment may be exempt from all PRO assessments. In the event that"
74,page_74,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 75/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6PRO questionnaires are not administered, site staff will record the reasons for why the measure was not completed in the eCRF. 4.5.8.1 EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a validated, reliable self -report edmeasure (Aaronson etal.1993 ; Fitzsimmons etal.1999 ; seeAppendix 5). It consists of 30questions that asses s 5aspects of patient functioning (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, and social), 3symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain), global health/ QoL, and 6single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) with a recall period of the previous week. TheEORTC QLQ -C30 module takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. Each score is transformed ontoa 0 to 100point scale. In the 5functional scales and the Global Health Status (GHS) scale, a high score means a ""high level of functioning or global health status. ""For the symptom scales and single items scales , a higher score implies a ""high level of symptoms or problems. "" Previously published minimally important differences will be used to identify meaningful changes from baseline in each treatment group on the disease and treatment -related symptom scales ( Osoba et al. 1998). 4.5.8.2 EORTC QLQ -HCC18 The EORTC QLQ -HCC18 is a disease -specific measure designed for use along with theEORTC QLQ -C30 in patients with HCC ( Blazeby et al. 2004; Chie et al. 2012). Itcontains 6multi -item symptom scales (fatigue, body image, jaundice, nutrition, fevers, and pain), and 2single -item scales (abdominal swelling and sexual interest) for a total of 18 questions with a recall period the past week. The EORTC QLQ -HCC18 module takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. All item responses are scored according tothe EORTC guideli nes for scoring and the supplementary manuscript on the QLQ -HCC18 module ( Fayers et al. 2001 ; Chie et al. 2012). 4.5.8.3 EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a validated self -report edhealth status questionnaire that is used to calculate a health status utility score for use in health economic analyses (EuroQol Group 1990 ; Brooks 1996; Herdman et al. 2011 ; Janssen et al. 2013 ; seeAppendix 7). There are 2components to the EQ -5D-5L:a 5-item health state profile that assesses mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depressi on, as well as a visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health state. Published weighting systems allow for creation of a single composite score of apatient 's health status. The EQ-5D-5L takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. TheEQ-5D-5L will be included to derive utility to inform pharmacoeconomic models."

Although any available tumor tissue sample can be submitted, sites are strongly encouraged to submit a representative FFPE tumor specimen in a paraffin block (preferr ed) or approximately 1015slides containing unstained, freshly cut, serial sections along with an associated pathology report . Samples collected via resection, core-needle biopsy, or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsy are preferred. However, all specimen types (e.g., fine-needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellets from pleural effusion, and lavage samples) are acceptable . Exploratory biomarker research may include, but not be limited to, analysis of genes or gene signatures associated with tumor immunobiology, PD -L1, or cytokines associated with T -cell activation and may involve extraction of circulating tumor DNA, or RNA, analysis of somatic mutations by NGS. If there is no available archival tissue sample at baseline, an optional scre ening biopsy may be performed . The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses this optional screening biops y. A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to undergo optional biopsies. The i nvestigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to participate and (ifapplicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the Optional Biopsy Sample Informed Consent eCRF. SeeSection 4.5.6 for details on sample storage, use of samples after patient withdrawal, and confidentiality standards for data. 4.5.10 Optional Samples for Research Biosample Repository 4.5.10.1 Overview of the Research Bi osample Repository The Research Biosample Repository (RBR) is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides). The collection, storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future. Specimens for the RBR will be collected from patients who give specific consent to participate in this optional research. Research Biosample Repository specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives: To study the association of biomarkers with effica cy, adverse events, or disease progression To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology"
76,page_76,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 77/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption and disposition To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establis h the performance characteristics of these assays 4.5.10.2 Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee Collection and submission of biological samples to the RBR is contingent upon the review and approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent Form by each site's IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body. If a site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol ( see Section 4.5.1 0) will not be applicable at that site. 4.5.10.3 Sample Collection In addition to the RBR plasma sample collected during treatment, the following samples willalso be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to atezolizumab and bevacizumab combination or HCC: Serum and plasma samples collected at Day 1 of Cycles 1, 2, and 4 and at time of radiographic progression Archival tumor tissue samples (e.g., from an earlier biopsy) collected at screening Tumor tissue samples collected on treatment at the investigator 's discretion during the study Tumor tissue samples from biopsies collected after disease progression at the investigator's discretion during the study Leftover serum, plasma, and tumor tissue samples (with the exception of remaining archival tissue blocks, which will be returned to sites) and any derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides), including leftover tissue samples from medically indicated procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy, EGD , colonoscopy) performed at the investigator's discretion during the course of the study The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis of germli ne or somatic mutations via whole -genome sequencing (W GS), whole -exome sequencing (WES), NGS, or other genomic analysis methods . Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology. Whole-genome sequencing and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches. Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents."
77,page_77,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 78/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Research Biosample Repository specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are exhausted. However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 4.5.10.4 Confidentiality Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification number. Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. Given the complexity and explora tory nature of the analyses of RBR specimens, data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or patients unless required by law. The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with t he effective Sponsor policy on study data publication. Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate. Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise. 4.5.10.5 Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RBR. The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of pa rticipation in the RBR. Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agr eement to provide optional RBR specimens. Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. The investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, b y completing the RBR Research Sample Informed Consent eCRF.

After withdrawal of consent, any remaining samples will be destroyed or will no longer be linked to the patient. However, i f RBR specimens have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data. If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the investigator must inform the Me dical Monitor in writing of the patient's wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject W ithdrawal Form and, if the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RBR Research Sample Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF. A patient's withdra wal from Study YO40245 does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RBR. Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RBR does not constitute withdrawal from Study YO40245. If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens after closure of the site, the investigator must inform the Sponsor by e -mailing the study number and patient number to the following e -mail address: global_rcr -withdrawal@roche.com 4.5.10.7 Monitoring and Oversight Research Biosample Repository specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the Informed Consent Form. Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RBR for the purposes of verifying the data provided to the Sponsor. The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and documents related to the RBR samples. 4.6 TREA TMENT, PA TIENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISC ONTINUA TION 4.6.1 Study Treatment Discontinuation Patients must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: Intolerable toxicity related to study treatment, including development of an immune -mediated adverse event determined by the inv estigator to be unacceptable given the individual patient's potential response to therapy and severity of the event Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient's safety if he or she continues study treatment Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient Use of another non -protocol anti -cancer therapy Pregnancy"

The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not bereplaced. Patients will return to the clinic for a treatment discontinuation visit 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. The visit at which response assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the treatment discontinuation visit. Pati ents who discontinue study treatment for any reason other than progressive disease or loss of clinical benefit will continue to undergo tumor response assessments and PRO assessments as outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). After treatment discontinuation, information on survival status and new anti -cancer therapy will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or cl inic visits approximately every 3months until death (unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study). 4.6.2 Patient Discontinuation from Study Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following: Patient w ithdrawal of consent Study termination or site closure Patient non-compliance, defined as failure to comply with protocol requirements as determined by the investigator or Sponsor Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be docum ented on the appropriate eCRF. If a patient requests to be withdrawn from the study , this request must be documented in the source documents and signed by the investigator. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. If apatient withdraws from the study, the study staff may use a public information source (e.g., county records) to obtain in formation about survival status ."

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY PLA N The safety plan for patients in this study is based on clinical experience with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in completed and ongoing studies. The anticipated important safety risks are outlined below (see Sec tions5.1.1 , 5.1.2 , 5.1.3 , and 5.1.4 ). Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria ,close monitoring of patients during the study , and regular monitoring by the iDMC (see Section 3.1.2 ). Administration of atezolizumab and bevacizumab will be performed in a monitored setting in which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to manage potentially serious reactions. Guidelines for managing anticipated adverse events, including criteria for treatment interruption or discontinuation and dosage modification (sorafenib only) , are provided in Appendix 11and Appendix 12. SeeSections 5.25.6for details on safety reporting (e.g., adverse events, pregnancies) for this study."
81,page_81,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 82/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Patients with active infection are excluded from study participation. In the setting of a pandemic or epidemic, screening for active infections (including SARS -CoV -2) prior to and during study participation should be considered according to local or insti tutional guidelines or guidelines of applicable professional societies (e.g., ASCO or European Society for Medical Oncology ). Severe COVID -19 appears to be associated with a CRS involving the inflammatory cytokines IL -6, IL -10, IL -2, and IFN -(Merad and M artin 2020 ). If a patient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include COVID -19, which should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic ev aluations per investigator judgment. If a diagnosis of COVID -19 is confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines. 5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with A tezolizumab Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following: IRRs and immune -mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, men ingoencephalitis , nephritis, myocarditis , myositis , and severe cutaneous adverse reactions . Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome (considered to be potential risks for at ezolizumab). SeeAppendix 12and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab. 5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with Bevacizumab Bevacizumab has been associated wit h risks such as the following: GI perforations, hemorrhage, arterial thromboembolic events, fistulae, wound -healing complications, hypertension, VTE, and proteinuria. Referto Section 6 of the Bevacizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detailed description of anticipated safety risks for bevacizumab . 5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Sorafenib The most common side effects reported in patients receiving sorafenib include diarrhea, nausea, weight loss, hand -foot skin reaction, alopecia, anorexia, and voice changes. The most common Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions include diarrhea, hand -foot skin reaction, hypertension, abdominal pain , cardiac ischemia and/or infarction, hemorrhage, hype rtension, hand- foot skin reactions and rash, and GI perforation .

82,page_82,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 83/Protocol YO40245 , Version 65.1.4 Risks A ssociated with Combination Use of A tezolizumab and Bevacizumab The risk of overlapping t oxicities between atezolizumab and bevacizumab is anticipated to be minimal. Nevertheless, the attribution and management of certain adverse events that have been associated with each agent separately (e.g., hemorrhage, hypothyroidism , and GItoxicity) may not be unambiguous when the agents are administered together. It is theoretically possible that allergic or inflammatory adverse events associated with bevacizumab could be exacerbated by the immunostimulatory activity of atezolizumab. Toxicities should initially be managed according to the recommendations in Appendix 11 with dose holds and modifications (if applicable) applied to the co mponent of the study treatment judged to be the primary cause. If individual component causality for the toxicity cannot be adequately determined, then the most conservative management recommendation should be applied (in addition to Appendix 11, refer to adverse event management guidelines in Appendix 12and in the most recent version of the Atezolizumab and Bevacizumab Investigator 's Brochures). 5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINITIONS Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types o f events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can ; therefore ,be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition ; see Sections 5.3.5.9 and5.3.5.10 for more information) Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline"

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 84/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study treatment Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actual ly causes or leads to death) Is life -threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11 ) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient's ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study treatment Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" ar e not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse ev ents are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions)."
84,page_84,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 85/Protocol YO40245 , Version 65.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; seeSection 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows : Cases of pote ntial drug -induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law (see Section 5.3.5.7 ) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, as defined below: Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or no n-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of study treatment is suspected. Pneumonitis Colitis Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency, hyperthyroidism, and hypophysitis Hepatitis, including AST or ALT 10ULN Systemic lupus erythematosus Neurological disorders: Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, and meningoencephalitis Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, IRRs , CRS , influenza --like illness, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome Nephritis Ocular toxi cities (e.g., uveitis, retinitis, optic neuritis ) Myositis Myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis Grade 2 cardiac disorders (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, pericarditis) Vasculitis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia Severe cutaneous reactions (e.g., Stevens -Johnson syndrome, dermatitis bullous, toxic epidermal necrolysis) Grade 3hypertension Grade 3 proteinuria"

For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. Alladverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment ,only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study treatment , all adverse events will be reported until 30days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first, and serious adverse events and adver se events of special interest will continue to be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of new systemic anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6."

Examples of non -directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems s ince you were last here?"" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE v4.0 will be used for assessing adverse event severity.

87,page_87,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 88/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 7 ): Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study treatment, or reintroduction of study treatment (asapplicable) Known association of the event with study treatment or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are kn own to be associated with the occurrence of the event Table 7Causal A ttribution Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by study treatment on the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of study treatment, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therap ies; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to study treatment; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of study treatment or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than study treatment (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, orconcom itant m edication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of study treatment (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after firstdose of study treatment). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be ass essed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only 1adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study treatment administration and are judged to be related to study treatment infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., ""infusion -related reaction"") on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible,"
88,page_88,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 89/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6avoid ambiguous terms such as ""systemic reaction."" Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study treatment, each re action should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse E vent eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a sin gle diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by 1adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.3 Adverse Events that a re Secondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF If vomiting resul ts in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF If a severe GIhemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all 3events shoul d be reported separately on the eCRF If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes"
89,page_89,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 90/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes ser ious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a ch ange in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment Note: For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events. It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e.,cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicatin g whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal potassium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events)."
90,page_90,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 91/Protocol YO40245 , Version 65.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high BP), only the dia gnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3baseline value) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's law). The patient population for this study consists of patients with decreased hepatic function who may exhibit abnormal liver function test results, some of which may meet Hy 's law criteria prior to enrollment in the trial. The following modified Hy's law criteria are for the purpose of determini ng what may constitute a drug-induced liver injury for this trial population and define those cases which require expedited reporting to the health authorities in relation to Hy's law . Investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN (of which 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 )."
91,page_91,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 92/Protocol YO40245 , Version 65.3.5.8 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of HCC should be recorded on the Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF. All other deaths that occur during the adverse event reporting period , regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). AniDMC will monitor the frequency of deaths from all causes. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the sing le medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If th e cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac de ath""). Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions A pre existing medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A pre existing medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre existingcondition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying diseas e should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECIST v1.1 . In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be b ased on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event ."

An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event. All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). No safety data related to overdosing of atezolizumab or bevacizumab are available. Thehighest dose of sorafenib studied was 800 mg BID, at this dose, adverse events observed were primarily diarrhea and dermatologic. No information is available on adverse events associated with an overdose of sorafenib in nonclinical studies."

Separate analyses will be performed for the global population (see Sections 6.16.9)and the China subpopulation (see Section 6.11). Any deviations to this will be noted. The analyses of PFS , time to progression (TTP) ,and OS will be performed on the basis of all randomized patients ( the ITTpopulation ), with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization, regardless of whether they receive any assigned study drug. Objective response rate will be analyzed on the basis of all randomized patients who have measurable disease at basel ine. Duration of response will be assessed only in patients who have an objective response. Time to deterioration (TTD) analyses will be conducted inthe ITT population. Change from baseline analysis of PROs will be performed with use of patients who ha ve both a baseline assessment and at least 1post-baseline assessment, with patients grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization . Safety analyses will be performed on the basis of all randomized patients who receiv ed any amount of study drug (the safety population) , with patients grouped according to the treatment the patient actually received. 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE A total of approximately 480patients will be randomized in the global enrollment phase of this study, with use of a 2:1 randomization ratio toallocate patients to either the atezolizumab and bevacizumab arm (Arm A) or the sorafenib arm (Arm B) . The final OS analysis will be conducted at approximately 33 months after the first patient is randomized (first patient in [FPI]). The final OS analysis will be descriptive and considered as optional if statistical significance is achieved at one of the pre -planned interim analyses of OS. The co -primary efficacy endpoints for this study areas follows: Overall survival , defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause Independent Review Facility -assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease progression per RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause, whichever occurs first The ov erall type I error rate for this study will be controlled at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05 by a graphical approach (i.e., -splitting and recycling ; Bretz et al. 2009; Burman etal.2009 ). The overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05 will be split into a 2-sided significance level of 0.048 for the testing of OS and a 2-sided significance level of 0.002 for the testing of PFS as a first step .

To detect an improvement in OS using a log -rank testat a 2-sided signif icance level of 0.048 , approximately 312deaths will be required to achieve 80% overall power assuming a target HR of 0.71 ( median OS improvement vs. control is 4.9months ). The minimum detectable difference (MDD) of OS is an HR of 0.783 (median OS improvement is 3.3 months ). Three -hundred and twelve deaths are expected to occur approximately 33months after FPI. Overall Survival The calculation of sample size and estimates of the OSanalysis timelines are based on the following assumptions: Patient s will be randomized to the atezolizumab and bevac izumab andsorafenib armsin a 2:1 ratio Overall survival follows a 1-piece exponential distribut ion The median OSin the control arm is 12months The stopping boundaries of t he interim and final analyses of OS use the O'Brien-Fleming boundar ies approximated with use of theLan-DeMets method (DeMets and Lan 1994 ) The dropout rate is 5% for the atezolizumab and bevacizumab arm and 10% for the sorafenib arm over 12 months for OS The recruitment of approximate ly 480patients will take place over approximately 10months Independent Review Facility -Assessed Progression -Free Survival To detect an improvement in IRF- assessed PFS using a log -rank test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.002, approximately 308 events will be accrued for the primary PFS analysis, which will provide approximately 97% power with a target HR of 0.55 (median PFS improvement of 3.3 months from 4 7.3 months). This is to ensure a minimal follow -up of approximately 6 months for all patients (i.e., to have a clinical cutoff date at approximately 6 months after the last patient is randomized to the study). TheMDD is a PFS HR of 0.688 (median PFS improvement of 1.8 months from 45.8months). The clinical cutoff date for this primary PFS analysis is expected to occur approximately 16 months after the first patient was enrolled in the study. Thefollowing assumptions were made for PFS based on the ITTpopulation: Patients will be random ized to the atezolizumab and bevacizumab and sorafenib arms in a 2:1 ratio Progression- free survival follows a 1-piece exponential distribution The median duration of PFS in the control arm is 4 months The dropout rate is 5% for the atezolizumab andbevaci zumab arm and 10% for the sorafenib arm over 12 months for PFS The recruitment of 480 patients will take place over 10 months"

Proportion of patients with a clinically meaningful change (improved, deteriorated, remained stable) in select scales of the QLQ -C30 (GHS/QoL, physical function, role function, appetite loss, diarrhea, fatigue, pain) and QLQ -HCC18 (jaundice , fatigue, pain) will be summarized by treatment arm. Proportion of responses for the itching item of the QLQ -HCC18 jaundice subscale , the abdominal pain item of the QLQ -HCC18 pain subscale ,and each timepoint while patients are on treatment will be summarized . In the event of incomplete data for any questionnaire subscales, if more than 50% of theconstituent items are completed, a prorated score will be computed, consistent with the scoring manuals and validation papers. For subscales with less than 50% of the items completed, the subscale will be considered as missing ( Fayers et al. 2001 ; Chie etal. 2012 ). 6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES The safety analysis population will consist of all randomized patients who received at least 1full or partial dose of study treatment, with patients grouped according to treatment received. Verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) thesaurus terms, and adverse event severity will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.0."
106,page_106,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 107/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics to include treatment duration, number of doses, and dose intensity. The following events occurring during or after the first dose of study treatment will be summarized by treatment arm and NC ICTCAE grade: All adverse events All adverse leading to death All serious adverse events All severe adverse events (Grade 3) All adverse event of special interest All adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation or interruption Multiple occurrences of the same event will be counted once at the maximum severity. Laboratory data with values outside the normal ranges will be identified. In addition, selected laboratory data will be summarized by treatment arm and grade. Descriptive statisti cs will be used to summarize changes in vital signs by treatment arm. Deaths withcauses of death reported during the study will be summarized by treatment arm.

Patients will be grouped according to treatment received or, if no treatment is received prior to study discontinuation, according to treatment assigned. The numbers and proportions of ADA-positive patients and ADA-negative patients at baseline ( baseline prevalence) and after drug administration (post -baseline incidence) will be summarized for ADA -evaluable patients . When determining post -baseline incidence, patients are considered to be ADA -positive if they are ADA-negative or have missing data at baseline but develop an ADA response following study drug exposure (treatment -induced ADA response), or if they are ADA-positive at baseline and the titer of 1or more post-baseline samp les is at least 0.60 titer unit sgreater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment -enhanced ADA response). Patients are considered to be post-treatment ADA-negative if they are ADA -negative or have missing data at baseline and all post-baseline samples are negative, or if they are ADA-positive at baseline but do not have any post-baseline samples with a titer t hat is at least 0.60 titer unit sgreater than the titer of the baseline sample (treatment unaffected). The relationship between ADA status and safety, efficacy, PK, and biomark er endpoints may be analyzed and reported. 6.8 EXPLORA TORY BIOMA RKER ANAL YSES Exploratory biomarker analyses will be performed in an effort to understand the association of tissue or blood -based biomarkers (see Table 1 ) with response to atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab versus sorafenib, or increase the understanding of HCC disease evolution under atezolizumab andbevacizumab treatment.

Two interim analyses of OS are planned to beperformed. The first interim analysis will be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis, estimated to occur at approximately 16months after FPI. It is anticipated that at this time approximately 172deaths will have been observed. The respect ive MDD OS HR is 0. 633(median OS improvement is 6.9months). The second OS interim analysis is planned to be"
108,page_108,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 109/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6conducted when approximately 243 deaths are accumulated, estimated to occur at approximately 24 months after FPI. The respective MDD OS HR is 0. 728 (median OS improvement is 4.6 months). To control the 2-sided significance level at 0.048 for the interim and final OS analyses, the Lan -DeMets method will be used to approximate the O'Brien -Fleming boundaries.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 110/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6arms in a 2:1ratio in an extended China enrollment phase to ensure a total of approximately 135 patients from mainland China forinclusion in the China subpopulation. The primary efficacy objective of the China sub population analysis is to assess efficacy , as measured by the co -primary endpoints of PFS by an IRF -assessment per RECIST v1.1 and OS, ofatezolizumab and bevacizumab compared with sorafenib in the Chinese patients . The China subpopulation is not powered to demonstrate statistical significance in terms of efficacy ,andno formal hypothesis testing will be performed . The China subpopulation analys eswill be conducted when sufficient PFS and/or OS events have occurred to demonstrate at least 80% probability of maintaining 50% of risk reduction compared with that estimated from the global population. The exact timing of analyses will be specified in the SAP. The analysis methods for China subpopulation will be the same as for the global population unless elsewhere noted. The results of the China subpopulation analyses will besummarized in a separate report from the CSR forthe global population. Thestatistical details for such analys es in the China subpopulation will be documented in the SAP. 7. DATA COLLECTION A ND MANAGEMENT 7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory data and any other externally gener ated electronic study data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using theSponsor's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. Electronic Case Report Forms and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC sy stem's audit trail. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor's standard procedures. Patient -reported outcomes data will be collected on paper questionnaires. The data from the questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff."
110,page_110,"Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 111/Protocol YO40245 , Version 67.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS Electronic Case Report Forms are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. Electronic Case Report Forms will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. Electronic Case Report Forms should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited t o, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accura te and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of sour ce documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. To facilitate source data verification and review, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.

Results of standard ofcare tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining informed con sent and per protocol relevant window may be used for screening assessments rather than repeating such tests. Screening local laborator y assessments obtained 96 hours prior to the initiation of study treatment do not have to be repeated for Cycle 1. Te st results should be reviewed prior to administration of study treatment. cPatients will be asked to return to the clinic 30 days after the last dose of study treatment for an end -of-treatment visit. After this visit, serious adverse events and protocol defined adverse events of special interest, regardless of attribution, will be recorded until 90 days after the last dose of study treatment or until initiation of another systemic anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. Ongoing adverse events thought to be related to study treatment will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed by the investigato r as stable, new anti -cancer treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it is determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event. Scans performed within 6 weeks prior to the treatment disc ontinuation visit do not need to be repeated. dCancer history includes stage, date of d iagnosis, and prior anti -tumor treatment. Demographic information includes age and self -reported race/ethnicity. Reproductive status and smoking history should also be captured. eA complete physical examination at screening should include the evaluation o f head, eye, ear, nose, and throat and cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinar y, and neurologic sy stems. Changes in abnormalitie s noted at baseline should be recorded at the end of the visit. New or wors ened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events if appropriate. fA limited physical examination will be performed at other visits to assess changes from baseline abnormalities and any new ab normalities and to evaluate patient -reported sy mptoms. New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events if appropriate. gECOG Performance Status, limited phy sical examination, local laboratory assessments , and PROs may be obtained 96 hours before Day 1 of each cycle. hThe EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QL Q-HCC18, and EQ -5D-5L questionnaires will be completed by all patients on paper starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of ever y cycle thereafter. All PRO questionnaires scheduled for administration during a clinic visit are r equired to be completed by the patient at the investigational site at the start of the clinic visit before discussion of the patient's health state, lab res ults or health record, before administration of study treatment, and/or prior to any other study assessment(s). This is to avoid any potential bias to patients’ responses to ensure that the validity of the instrument is not compromised and that data quality meets regulatory requirement s. Interview assessment by a member of the clinic staff will be allowed if the patient is not able to complete the measure on their own. Study personnel should review all questionnaires for completeness before the patient leaves the investigational site. During survival follow -up, all PRO questionnaires will be completed every 3 months (for 1 year), unless the patient withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study. PRO questionnaires during the survival follow -up period may be completed at the investigational site should the patient come in for a clinic visit or be administered via interview i n telephone calls. iAll measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at the screening visit. Radiologic imaging performed during the screening period should consist of 1) CT and/or MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis and brain, 2) bone scan or PET scan as c linically indicated, and 3) any other imaging studies (CT scan of the neck, plain films, etc.) as clinically indicated by the treating physician. The same radiographic procedures and technique must be used throughout the study for each patient (e.g., if t he patient had CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed during screening, then she should subsequently undergo CT performed with use of the same radiologic protocol throughout the remainder of the study). Results must be reviewed by the investigator before dosin g at the next cycle. Tumor assessments will be performed at baseline, every 6weeks ( 1 week) for the first 54 weeks following the initiation of study treatment, and every 9 weeks ( 1 week) thereafter, with additional"

All known sites of disease documented at screening should be re -assessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. Tumor response will be evaluated by the investigator with use of RECIST version 1.1 and imRECIST. In the absence of disease progression, tumor asse ssments should continue regardless of whether patients discontinue study treatment or start new anti -cancer treatment, unless the patient dies, withdraws consent, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. jVital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and temperature. For patients randomized to Arm A, on days of study treatment administration (atezolizumab and bevacizumab), the patient's vital signs should be determined up to 60 minutes before all infusions. Vi tal signs will be measured at the end of bevacizumab infusion and 2 ( 1) hours after end of the infusion and will also be collected during and after every infusion of atezolizumab if clinically indicated. kThe dose of bevacizumab will be based on the patient's weight (in kilograms) measured 14 days prior to baseline (the initiation of study treatment) and will remain the same throughout the study unless there is a weight change of 10% from baseline.

All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional assessments may be performed as clinically indicated for suspicion of progression. DEFINITION OF MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS Tumor Lesions Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval 5 mm) 10-mm caliper measurement b y clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray Malignant Ly mph Nodes To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided below (see ""Identification of Target and Non- Target Lesions"" and ""Calculation of Sum of Diameters""). 1For clarity and for consistency within this document, the section numbers and cross -references to other sections within the article have been deleted and minor changes have been made."
129,page_129,"Appendix 3: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 130/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURA BLE LESIONS Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdomi nal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. SPECIA L CONSIDERA TIONS REG ARDING LESION MEA SURA BILITY Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local ther apy require particular comment, as outlined below. Bone Lesions: Technetium -99m bone scans, sodium fluoride positron emission tomography scans, and plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions. However, these techniq ues can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging techniques such as CTor MRI can be cons idered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability describ ed above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loc oregional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion."
130,page_130,"Appendix 3: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1(RECIST v1.1) (cont.) Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 131/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6METHODS FOR A SSESSIN G LESIONS All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option. CLINICA L LESIONS Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10mm in diameter as assessed using cali pers (e.g., skin nodules). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is suggested. CHEST X -RAY Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an import ant endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT AND MRI SCA NS Computed tomography is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm. W hen CT scans have slice thickness of 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. Magnetic resonance imaging is also acceptable. If prior to enrollment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT sca ns with IV contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and during the study should be guided by the tumor type under investig ation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enhanced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with the prior studies if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is po ssible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward . Care must"

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 132/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non -target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appe ar to have a different size using a new modality. ENDOSCOPY, LA PAROSCO PY, ULTRA SOUND, TUMO R MA RKERS, CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be used for objective tumor evaluation. ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. IDENTIFICA TION OF TA RGET AND NON- TARGET LESIONS When more than 1measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5lesions total (and a maximum of 2lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline. This means that, for instances in which patients have only 1or 2organ sites involved, a maximum of 2lesions ( 1site) and 4lesions ( 2sites), respectively, will be recorded. Other lesions (albeit measurable) in those organs will be considered non-target les ions. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements . It may be the case th at, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, in which circumstance the next largest lesion that can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical str uctures that may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. As noted above, pathological nodes that are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Lymph node size is normally reported as 2 dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT, this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane of acquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node t hat is reported as being 20 mm30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and"

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 133/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10mm but 15mm) sh ould be considered non -target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis of 10 mm are considered non -pathological and should not be recorded or followed. All lesions (or sites of disease) not selected as target lesions (measurable or non-measurable), includi ng pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required. It is possible to record multiple non- target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the Case Report Form (CRF; e.g., ""multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes"" or ""multiple liver metastases""). CALCULA TION OF SUM O F DIA METERS A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline and at each subsequent tumor assessment as a measure of tumor burden. Measuring Ly mph Nodes Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical p lane as the baseline examination), even if the node regresses to 10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of diameters may not be zero even if complete response (CR) criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of 10 mm. Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure During the study, all target lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assi gning an exact measurement and may report them as being too small to measure. When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF, as follows: If it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned and ""too small to measure"" should be ticked. (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by fat such as in the retroperitoneum; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present"

To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measurement, that should be recorded, even if it is 5 mm, and in that case ""too small to measure"" should not be ticked. Measuring Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment When non lymph node lesions fragment, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the sum of diameters. S imilarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longes t diameter in this instance should be the maximum longest diameter for the coalesced lesion. EVALUATION OF NON -TARGET LESIONS Measurements are not required for non -target lesions, except that malignant lymph node non-target lesions should be monitored for reduction to 10 mm in short axis. Non-target lesions should be noted at baseline and should be identified as ""present"" or ""absent"" and (in rare cases) may be noted as ""indicative of progression"" at subsequent evaluations. In addition, if a lymph node l esion shrinks to a non -malignant size (short axis10 mm), this should be captured on the CRF as part of the assessment of non-target lesions. RESPONSE CRITERIA CRITERIA FOR TA RGET LESIONS Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions are provided below: Complete response ( CR): Disappearance of all target lesions Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to 10mm. Partial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR Progressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters in the study (including baseline) In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5 mm."

A modest increase in the size of one or more non -target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. Thedesignation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target lesions in the face of SD or PR in target lesions will ;therefore ,be extremely rar e. NEW LESIONS The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for theidentification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than a tumor ( for example , some ""new"" bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). This is particularly important when the patient 's baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ""new"" cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression."

This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a patient had a baseline sum of 50 mm with 3measured lesions and during the study only 2lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion."

All measurable and non -measurable lesions should be assessed at screening and at subsequent protocol -specified tumor assessment timepoints. Additional assessments may be performed as clinically indicated for suspicion of progression. DEFINITION OF MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS Tumor Lesions Tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least 1dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI scan slice thickness/interval 5 mm) 10-mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable) 20 mm by chest X -ray Malignant Ly mph Nodes To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 5 mm). At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Additional information on lymph node measurement is provided below (see ""Id entification of Target and Non- Target Lesions,"" ""New Lesions,"" and ""Calculation of Sum of Diameters""). DEFINITION OF NON -MEASURA BLE LESIONS Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diameter 10mm or pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 mm but 15 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.

However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with identifiable soft tissue components that can be evalua ted by cross- sectional imaging techniques such as CTor MRI can be considered measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable. Cystic Lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment: Tumor lesions situat ed in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. METHODS FOR A SSESSIN G LESIONS All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the sa me technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during the study. Imaging -based evaluation should always be the preferred option. CLINICA L LESIONS Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when the y are superficial and 10mm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 141/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6CHEST X -RAY Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new lesions. However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung. CT AND MRI SCA NS Computed tomography is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for response assessment. In this guideline, the definition of measurability of lesions on CT scan is based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm. W hen CT scans have slice thickness of 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. M agnetic resonance imaging is also acceptable. If prior to enro llment it is known that a patient is unable to undergo CT scans with IV contrast because of allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI (without IV contrast) will be used to evaluate the patient at baseline and durin g the study should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non -contrast CT or MRI (enha nced or non -enhanced) will be performed should also be based on the tumor type and the anatomic location of the disease, and should be optimized to allow for comparison with prior studies ,if possible. Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of these other approaches is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable from that point forward . Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions and interpretation of non- target disease or new lesions on a different modality, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size using a new modality. ENDOSCOPY, LA PAROSCO PY, ULTRA SOUND, TUMO R MA RKERS, CYTOLOGY, HISTOLOGY Endoscopy, laparoscopy, ultrasound, tumor markers, cytology, and histology cannot be used for objective tumor evaluation. ASSESSMENT OF TUMOR BURDEN To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements."

This means that, for instances in which patients have only 1or2organ sites involved, a maximum of 2lesions ( 1site) and 4lesions ( 2sites), respectively, will be recorded.

All new lesions (measurable or non -measurable) must be assessed and recorded at the time of identification and at all subsequent tumor assessment timepoints. Up to a maximum of 5measurable new lesions total (and a maximum of 2lesions per organ) can be included in the calculation of tumor burden that is performed as part of the tumor response evaluation. New lesion types that would not qualify as target lesions per RECIST v1.1 cannot be included in th e calculation of tumor burden and thus will not affect overall tumor response evaluation. New lesions that are not measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria at a subsequent timepoint can be included in the tumor response evaluation fr om that point on, if the maximum number of measurable new lesions has not been reached. Note regarding new lymph node lesions : If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph node lesion is 15 mm, it will be considered a measurable new lesion. If at f irst appearance the short axis of a lymph node lesion is 10 mm and 15 mm, the lymph node will not be considered measurable but will still be considered a new lesion and should be identified as a non -measurable new lesion. If at first appearance the short axis of a lymph node is 10 mm, the lymph node should not be considered pathological and should not be considered a new lesion. A lymph node can subsequently become measurable, when the short axis is 15 mm. CALCULA TION OF SUM O F DIA METERS A sum o f the diameters (longest diameter for non lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions at baseline as a measure of tumor burden. At each subsequent tumor assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest diame ter for non -lymph node lesions, short axis for lymph node lesions) will be calculated for all target lesions plus measurable new lesions (up to 5new lesions, with a maximum of 2new lesions per organ) that have emerged after baseline. Hence, each net per centage change in tumor burden per assessment accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old lesions and new lesions as they appear. Measuring Ly mph Nodes If at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node lesion is 15 mm, it will be considered a measurable new lesion and may be included in the sum of the diameters.

However, if it subsequently decreases to 10 mm and all other lesions are no longer detectable or have also decreased to a short axis of 10mm (if lymph nodes), a response assessment of complete response (CR) may be assigned. Lymph nodes should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the node regresses to 10 mm during the study. Thus, when lymph nodes are include d in the sum of diameters, the sum may not be zero even if CRcriteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of 10mm. Measuring Lesions That Become Too Small to Measure During the study, all target lesions and up to 5meas urable new lesions (lymph node and non lymph node) should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).

Patient s with any history of immune deficiencies or autoimmune disease listed in the table below are excluded from participating i n the study. Possible exceptions to this exclusion could be patients with a medical history of such entities as atopic disease or childhood arthralgias where the clinical suspicion of autoimmune disease is low. Patients with a history of autoimmune- related hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible for this study. In addition, transient autoimmune manifestations of an acute infectious disease that resolved upon treatment of the infectious agent are not excluded (e.g., acute Lyme arthritis). Caution should be used when considering atezolizumab for patients who have previously experienced a severe or life -threatening skin adverse reaction while receiving another immunostimulatory anti -cancer agent.

Atezolizumab can be resumed after being withheld for 12 weeks if the Medical Monitor agrees that the patient is likely to derive clinical benefit. Bevacizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxicity considered to be related to study treatment. If the event resolves to Grade 1, bevacizumab may be restarted at the same dose level. If bevacizumab is delayed due to toxicity for 42 days beyond when the next dose should have been given, the patient must be permanently discontinued from bevacizumab.

Additional tests, such as autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology. Although most immune -mediated adverse events observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and sel f-limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major complications. Discontinuation of atezolizumab may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, immune- mediated toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents. The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may be experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab. In patients who have met the criteria for permanent discontinuation, resumption of atezolizumab may be considered if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -mediated event.

Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgias, impotence, constipation, or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopathies. The pa tient should be referred to an endocrinologist if an endocrinopathy is suspected. Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) and free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels should be measured to determine whether thyroid abnormalities are present. Pituitary hormon e levels and function tests (e.g., TSH, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulating hormone, testosterone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels, and ACTH stimulation test) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (wit h detailed pituitary sections) may help to differentiate primary pituitary insufficiency from primary adrenal insufficiency."

Immune -mediated myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection (commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history o f gastrointestinal illness), ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, or progression of malignancy. All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiog ram, and a cardiac MRI as appropriate per institutional guidelines. A cardiologist should be consulted. Anendomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 173/Protocol YO40245 , Version 6INFUSION -RELA TED REA CTIONS AND CYTOKINE -RELEASE SYNDROME No pre medication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab. However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) or cytokine -release syndrome (CRS) with atezozlizumab may receive pre medication with antihistamines or anti-pyretics /analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions. Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing agranulocytosis. Infusion -related reactions are known to occur with the administration of mo noclonal antibodies and have been reported with atezolizumab. These reactions, which are thought to be due to release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24hours of atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in severity. Cytokine -release syndrome is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune effector cells. Symptoms can be prog ressive, always include fever at the onset, and may include hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end -organ dysfunction (Lee et al. 2019). Cytokine -release syndrome has been well -documented with chimeric antigen receptor T -cell therapies and bispeci fic T-cell engager antibody therapies but has also been reported with immunotherapies that target PD -1 or PD -L1 (Rotz et al. 2017; Adashek and Feldman 2019), including atezolizumab. There may be significant overlap in signs and symptoms of IRRs and CRS, an d in recognition of the challenges in clinically distinguishing between the two, consolidated guidelines for medical management of IRRs and CRS are provided inTable 7. Severe COVID -19 appears to be associated with a CRS involving the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) -6, IL -10, IL -2, and IFN - (Merad and Martin 2020 ). If a patient develops suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include COVID -19, which should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory testing, and clinical or radiologic evaluations per investigator judgment. If a dia gnosis of COVID -19 is confirmed, the disease should be managed as per local or institutional guidelines."

Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyos itis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy. Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13."

HEMOPHA GOCYTIC LYMPH OHISTIOCYTOSIS A ND M ACROPHA GE ACTIVATION SYNDROME Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by McClain and Eckstei n (2014). A patient should be classified as having HLH if 5of the following 8criteria are met: Fever 38.5°C Splenomegaly Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least 2of the following: –Hemoglobin 90g/L (9 g/dL; 100 g/L [10 g/dL] for infants 4 weeks old) –Platelet count 100109/L (100,000/ L)"
