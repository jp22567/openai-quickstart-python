Introduction 4.1. Background Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed otorhinolaryngologic procedures with more than 4.5 million procedures performed annually. Aside from the conventional technique of cold steel and electrocautery dissection, the introduction of numerous energy based tools and techniques allow for the simultaneous dissection and sealing of vessels, significantly improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure (1 -3). Generally thought of as safe and effective, energy based devices such as laser, Shaw scalpel, electrosurgical devices (needle, scissor, or knife), radiofrequency needle ablation device, thermal welding, and Coblator, use heat energy to denature protein, leading to vascular tamponade and hemostasis. Unfortunately, a byproduct of using this energy during surgery is the lateral heating of the surgical area, which can damage adjacent structures, delay wound hea ling, increase post - operative pain, and increase the subject’s time to return to normal diet and activity (4) . In order to address these concerns, Covidien (Covidien LP is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc.) has developed Bi Zact™, a bipolar electrosurgical instrument intended for use in open surgical procedures, such as tonsillectomies, where ligation and division of vessels, tissue bundles and lymphatics is desired. BiZact™ is designed as a pistol grip radiofrequency (RF) sealer/dissector for use with vessels up to and including 3mm. Compatible with the already in use Valleylab™ (LS10) energy platform, BiZact™ employs bipolar electrosurgical RF energy and pressure to ligate vessels interposed between its jaws which can then be transected using the built in knife deployed by the device trigger. Based off"

In summary, biocompatibility testing and animal model studies have found BiZact ™ to be safe and effective in achieving hemostasis and reducing lateral thermal spread potentially resulting in reduced post -operative pain. Full details of biocompatibility testing and prior investigations can be found in S ection 4.3. The primary objective of this study is to assess the severity of post- operative pain and return to normal diet and activity for up to 14 days following the use of the BiZact™ device in adult (≥22 years of age in United States and ≥18 years of age in Europe) tonsillectomy procedures. At the conclusion of this study, data will be used for publication. 4.2. Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess the severity of post- operative pain following the use of the BiZact™ device in adult ( ≥22 years of age in United States and ≥18 years of age in Europe) tonsillectomy procedures. The results of this study will be offered for publication at the conclusion of the study, if participating investigators believe the data warrants publication in an appropriate journal. 4.3. Report of Prior Investigations 4.3.1. Biocompatibility Evaluation Biocompatibility testing for a device having tissue/bone/blood contact was conducted per ISO 10993: Biological evaluation of medical devices and met the necessary requirements. This testing was performed utilizing BiZact™ (BZ4112) and included cytotoxicity, sensitization and irritation, toxicity (acute) and hemo - compatibility testing. 4.3.2. Animal Evaluations Table 1.

Rationale In order to demonstrate the clinical use of BiZact™ (BZ4112) effects post -operative pain and return to normal diet and activity after standard tonsillectomy procedure, Medtronic is performing a prospective, multi -center, single arm non -comparative pilot study of BiZact™ on adults ( ≥22 years of age in United States and ≥18 years of age in Europe ) undergoing tonsillectomy. Post -operative pain, and other quality of life aspects will be collected via questionnaire for up to 14 days following the procedure. As a study with no comparator this study does not utilize any randomization or blinding. The BiZact™ device will only be used during the course of the tonsillectomy procedure and subjects will be followed for up to 14 days to monitor bleeding, pain and return to normal diet and activity. Currently there are no known factors"

If any adverse occurrences are identified they will be assessed, reported and documented. 7. Product Description 7.1. General The BiZact™ (BZ4112) is a single use bipolar electrosurgical instrument intended for use with the Valleylab™ (LS10 with V1.1 or V1.2 software) energy platform in general open surgical procedures. It is also indicated for adult ENT procedures, including tonsillectomy, for the ligation and division of vessels, tissue bundles and lymphatics 2 -3 mm away from unintended thermally sensitive structures. This instrument creates tissue fusion by application of bipolar electrosurgical RF energy and pressure to vessels/tissue interposed between the jaws of the instrument. The tissue fusion can then be transected using the built in cutting mechanism. The instrument can be used for vessels and lymphatic tissue up to and including 3mm in diameter and tissue bundles. The instrument also incorporates inline RF activation, features for grasping and tips for dissection. The instrument is intended primarily for surgeons performing tonsillectomies. It is also indicated for adult ear, nose and throat (ENT) procedures, including tonsillectomy, for the ligation and division of vessels, tissue bundles and lymphatics 2 -3 mm away from unintended thermally sensitive structures.

Such notice must be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than 5 working days after the emergency has occurred. Except in such an emergency, prior written approval by Medtronic is required for changes in or deviations from the I nvestigational Plan. If these changes or deviations affect the scientific soundness of the Investigational Plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human subjects the IRB/EC will also be notified. All other deviations will be reported per the site’s IRB/EC deviation policy. Should any deviations from the Investigational Plan occur, these will be reviewed by Medtronic for their clinical significance and identifying any additional corrective and/or preventive actions (e.g. amend the CIP, additional training, terminate the study, etc.). Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may result in the need to initiate a corrective action plan, and in some cases , freeze enrolment or ultimately terminate the Investigator’s participation in the clinical st udy. 9.10. Screen Failure A subject is considered enrolled in the study when ICF is signed, and must be followed regardless of whether or not the subject received treatment with the study device unless considered a screen failure or withdrawn due to physician de cision . Subjects who provide study consent, but then are determined to be ineligible prior to study procedure will be considered a screen failure and will not require additional study follow -up visits. The reason for the screening failure will be clearly delineated on the applicable eCRFs. Subjects in whom the procedure is begun but not completed will be considered “discontinued” and will be followed until discharge. These subjects will only contribute AE data intraoperatively until discharge (no addition al follow -up). 9.11. Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation The reason for study exit, including screen failure , will be documented on the applicable electronic case report form (eCRF). In the event the subject withdraws consent during the study, the date of w ithdrawal will be documented. If the Study Investigator voluntarily removes a subject from further study participation, supporting documentation must be in place for the rationale and date of removal. Follow up to subjects withdrawn or discontinued will b e deemed by the standard of care for a standard tonsillectomy procedure. Every attempt will be made to contact subjects that are noncompliant with study procedures. Subjects will be considered lost to follow -up once the following steps have been taken: • Two phone calls should be made to the subject. Each attempt should be clearly documented in the source documents and the response or lack thereof should be captured."

A copy of the letter and return or delivery receipts should be retained in the subject’s source document. • Additionally, the site should attempt to reach out to the primary care practitioner to determine the status of the subject. • When all due diligence attempts to contact have been made, after a period of two (2) weeks, the subject will be considered Lost to Follow- up. The Sponsor should be notified and the End of Study (EOS) form should be completed. 9.12. Selection of Investigators Surgeons who are qualified by training (board certified in otolaryngology in accordance with US/European and hospital guidelines), education, and relevant experience appropriate to the use of the product and associated procedures will be considered for participation as investigators in this study. Investigators/sites must have adequate time and resources to conduct the study throughout the duration of the study and have access to an adequate number of eligible subjects. Investigators/sites must be able to comply with applicable Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and regulatory requirements. Investigator is not debarred, disqualified, or working under sanctions in applicable regions. Qualifications are verified through valid CV and current licensing and maintained with study documentation. 10. Risks and Benefits 10.1. Potential Risks The potential risks associated with the standard tonsillectomy procedure include but are not limited to: reaction to anesthesia, swelling, bleeding, infection and pain. The potential risks associated with BiZact™ include, but are not limited to: unintende d cutting or bruising, arcing, pinching, tearing of tissue, inadequate/no seal, pain, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and headache. Results from preclinical testing and the instructions for use (IFU) will be used to mitigate risk. Reproductive and developme ntal toxicology studies in animals to evaluate the potential for AEs on reproductive ability and effects on the embryo/fetus have not been conducted. As with any device, there is always a risk of a rare or previously unknown side effect developing from th e treatment. The risk analysis assumes the system is operated by properly trained personnel. The overall residual risk after design risk mitigation strategies and/or design control was deemed acceptable in the Risk Management Report for the BiZact™ system ."
30,page_30,"BiZact ™ Adult Clinical Investigation Plan Version 4.0 dated 20 -Mar -2018 Page 30 of 61 Medtronic Confidential This document is electronically controlled 056-F275, v3.0 Clinical Investigation Plan Template 10.2. Potential Benefits The potential benefits associated with BiZact™ device usage include, but are not limited to: reduction in pain and decreased time to return to normal diet and activity post tonsillectomy procedure. 10.3. Risk-Benefit Rationale Post -operative pain and delayed time to normal diet and activity are common challenges after tonsillectomy procedures. Aside from conventional cold steel and electrocautery dissection, the introduction of numerous energy based tools and techniques allow for the simultaneous dissection and sealing of vessels significantly improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure. In most cases however, these energy based devices use heat to establish hemostasis, which can lead to lateral heating and damage to adjacent structures delaying wound healing and increasing post -operative pain. A positive risk/benefit ratio has been demonstrated with BiZact™ as evidenced by preclinical and biocompatibility testing. BiZact™ was safely tolerated in animals and there were no apparent adverse systemic or local effects in any of the preclinical studies. BiZact™ is also based off Ligasure™ technology which historically has been shown to be safe and effective for tonsillectomy procedures providing adequate hemostasis while minimizing postoperative pain. The product design, as well as the results of these studies, shows that BiZact™ is a promising class 2 FDA and CE -mark approved product. Consequently, with respect to performance and safety, BiZact™ presents a favorable ris k/benefit ratio to the subject. Results from preclinical testing, the device instructions for use (IFU) and experienced surgeons will be used to mitigate risk. There are currently no known interactions between the BiZact™ device and concurrent medical inte rventions. 11. Adverse Event s and Device Deficiencies Adverse event (AE) definitions used in this study are based on ISO 14155:2011 (Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects -- Good Clinical Practice). 11.1.

Adverse Event Severity Classification Severity w ill be defined according to the f ollowing criteria: Mild Awareness of event, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort enough to cause some interference with activities of daily living (ADL) Severe Incapacitating, with an inability to perform ADL Death Death related to AE An AE can be classified a s severe and not d eemed an SAE. Simil arly, an SAE is not a utom atically severe in nature. 11.1.7. Adverse Event Relationship Classification Causality assessments define the relationship between the use of the medical device (including the medical- surgical procedure) and the occurrence of each adverse event, according to MEDDEV (Guidelines on Medical Devices, Clinical Investigations: Serious Adverse Event Reporting). The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered. Each SAE will be classified according to five different levels of causality. The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to the investigational medical device or procedures : Not related: relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when: 1. the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures 2. the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures; 3. the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 4. the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event; 5. the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by the device or procedure; 6. the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors); 7. the event does not depend on a false result given by the device used for diagnosis, when applicable; 8. harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error;"

In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event. Unlikely: the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. Possible : the relationship with the us e of the device is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible. Probable : the relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. Causal relationship: the serious event is associated with the device or with procedures beyond reasonable doubt when: 1. the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures; 2. the event has a temporal relationship with device use/application or procedures; 3. the event involves a body -site or organ that a. the device or procedures are applied to; b. the device or procedures have an effect on; 4. the serious event follows a known response pattern to the medical dev ice (if the response pattern is previously known); 5. the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious event (when clinically feasible); 6. other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled out; 7. harm to the subject is due to error in use; 8. the event depends on a false result given by the device used for diagnosis, when applicable; 9. In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event. The Sponsor and the Investigators will distinguish between the serious adverse events related to the device and those related to the procedures (any procedure specific to the clinical investigation). An adverse event can be related both to procedures and t he device. Complications of procedures are considered not related if the said procedures would have been applied to the subjects also in the absence of device use/application."

The sponsor and the Investigators will make the maximum effort to define and categorize the event and avoid these situations. Where the sponsor remains uncertain abo ut classifying the serious event, it should not exclude the relatedness and classify the event as “possible”. Particular attention shall be given to the causality evaluation of unanticipated serious adverse (device) events. The occurrence of unanticipated events related to the use of the device (USADE) could suggest that the clinical investigation places subjects at increased risk of harm than was to be expected beforehand. 11.1.8. Adverse Event Outcome Classification Outcome of the event will be defined accor ding to the following: • Fatal : This event is d etermined to be the cause of death. • Not Recovering/Not Resolved : The event has retained p athological conditions resulting fr om the prior disease or injury. • Recovered/Re solved: The eve nt has fully re solved at the end of the study. • Recovering/Resolving : The event is on going at the e nd of the study. • Unknown: The event has been unclassified at the end of the study. 11.2. Reporting of Adverse Events The following events are generally considered reportable during the course of this study and should be reported in a timely manner to the sponsor: • any ADE, SADE, SAE, or USADE • any Device Deficiency that might have led to an SADE if • suitable action had not been taken or • intervention had not been made or • if circumstances had been less fortunate • new findings/updates in relation to already reported events Events will be reviewed by the sponsor to determine any reporting obligations to National Competent Authorities and IRBs/ECs. SAEs need to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware ."

Adverse Event Recording Assessment of the occurrence of an AE will be based on changes in the subject’s physical examination, laboratory results and/or signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be monitored until a subject completes the study unless the Investigator determines the event is related to the device, in which case they will be monitored until resolution if possible. Medical care will be provided, as defined in the informed consent, for any AE related to study participation. Adverse events will be collected on an AE eCRF and applicable source documentation. To the extent possible, the event to be recorded and reported is the event diagnosis as opposed to event symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, nausea and vomiting in the presence of a clinically diagnosed infection is to be reported as infection only). For the purposes of this protocol , AEs will collected and documented in a timely manner at baseline and 0 to 14 days follow -up. The following should not be considered an AE: • A condition requiring a preplanned procedure unless the condition worsened since screening • A preexisting condition found as a result of screening, unless the condition has worsened since enrollment. All responses to the above events that require treatment beyond the institution’s standard procedures will be reported as AEs. All AEs observed during the course of this study, regardless of severity or relationship to the device will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF except for what is noted in Section 11.1.1 ."

Device Deficiencies In alignment with ISO14155:2011 (Section 3. 15), a Device deficiency is an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance, such as malfunction, misuse or use error and inadequate labeling. All BiZact ™ device deficiencies will be documented on the appropriate Device malfunction eCRF and the device should be returned to Medtronic for analysis, if possible. Instructions for returning the device wil l be provided. Device deficiencies should also be documented in the subject’s medical record. Device deficiencies are NOT to be reported as AEs. However, if there is an AE that results from a device deficiency, that specific event would be recorded on th e appropriate eCRF. 12. Data Review Committees There will be no use of data review committees in this study. Instead, a steering committee and a n internal safety review committee will monitor the trial’s progress including trends of data over time and scientific relevance of the data collected. Please see section 15.10 on the review of data for this study. These groups will provide oversight in terms of scientific validity and the safe conduct of the study. By nature , this study’s focus is about the level of post -operative pain. Additionally, this is a study of two sites with forty -eight subjects, with no planned interim analysis, and as such, has a less burden in terms of severity of implications, and degree of data review and analysis compared to a larger study with interim data review needs or a study focusing on severe complications or mortality. Per FDA guidance (OMB Control No 0910- 0581 “The Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees for Clinical Trial Sponsors” Data Monitoring Committees ( DMCs ) are “generally"

This study does not meet any of the criteria listed wherein a DMC would provide added benefit. 13. Statistical Design and Methods 13.1. Statistical Test Methods Continuous variables will be summarized using counts, means, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Changes to the planned statistical analysis as defined in the protocol will be documented in the statistical analysis plan and clinical study report. 13.2. Sample Size Determination This study d oes not have a statistically powered hypothesis. There will be no sample size calculations since the study is not hypothesis -driven. The number of enrolled subjects is pre -defined at a minimum of 48, which is adequate to reflect the study purposes. A ll the results will be summarized in a descriptive manner which will be further defined in the statistical analysis plan with the following measures utilized: • Mean, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum for quantitative variables. • Numbers and percent ages for qualitative variables. 13.3. Analysis Populations The analyses will be done based on the subjects who are enrolled and have the intended procedure. 13.4. Statistical Analysis of Endpoints 13.4.1. Primary Endpoint To assess pain, p ain levels will be captured at post -operative days 1 -7, 10, and 14 for each subject using the VAS . For each defined post -operative time point, paired tests will be used to test whether there is a mean change along the follow -up. 13.4.2. Secondary Endpoints To assess procedure details, operativ e time and intra -operative bleeding volume a sample value and margin of error (95% confidence level) will be calculated."

Additionally, subject charts and clinical records will be requested and reviewed so that protocol adherence and source documentation can be verified. In instances where data protection regulations prohibit the direct examination of hospital records by the study Sponsor or designee(s), the Investigator will cooperate in a system of source data verification with the Sponsor. Monitoring, including site initiation visi ts, interim monitoring visits, and closeout visits may be performed with in person visits or remotely, when applicable. To ensure the rights, safety, and welfare of study subjects are being maintained, the monitor will maintain assurance that all study staff are trained on the study protocol and use of the study devices. If the monitor discovers that an investigator is not complying with the signed Investigator Agreement, the I nvestigational Plan, applicable laws, or any conditions of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB/EC, the monitor will report to the Sponsor and take such steps necessary to promptly secure compliance. If compliance cannot be secured, device shipments to the investigator may be discontinued and the investigator’s participation in the investigation terminated. The monitor shall also require such an investigator to dispose of or return the device, unless this action would jeopardize the rights, safety, or welfare of a subject. 15.2. Data Management Visual and/or computer data review will be performed to identify possible data discrepancies. The investigator will clearly mark clinical record to indicate that the subject is enrolled in this clinical investigation (in regions where applicable) . Where copies of the original source document as well as print outs of original electronic source documents are retained, these shall be signed and dated by a member of the investigation site team with a statement that it is a true reproduction of the original source document. Manual and/or automatic querie s will be created in the Oracle remote data capture (RDC) system and will be issued to the site for appropriate response. The site staff will be responsible for resolving all queries in the database. Medications will be coded under the WHO dictionary while Medical History, Surgical History and/or Adverse Events will be coded in Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). This study will be using a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant electronic data capture system. All system level validation documentation is retained within the Information Systems group."

Introduction Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed otorhinolaryngologic procedures with more than 4.5 million procedures performed annually. The introduction of numerous energy based tools and techniques allow for the simultaneous dissection and sealing of vessels, significantly improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure. Generally thought of as safe and effective, energy based devices such as laser, Shaw scalpel, electrosurgical devices (needle, scissor, or knife), radiofrequency needle ablation device, thermal welding, and Coblator, use heat energy to denature protein, leading to vascular tamponade and hemostasis. Unfortunately, a byproduct of using this energy during surgery is the lateral heating of the surgical area, which can d amage adjacent structures, delay wound healing, increase post -operative pain, and increase the subject’s time to return to normal diet and activity. In order to address these concerns, Medtronic (formerly Covidien) has developed BiZact™, a bipolar instrume nt intended for use in open surgical procedures, such as tonsillectomies, where ligation and division of vessels, tissue bundles and lymphatics is desired. BiZact™ is designed as a pistol grip radiofrequency (RF) sealer/dissector for use with vessels up to and including 3mm. Compatible with the already in use Valleylab (LS10) energy platform, BiZact™ employs bipolar electrosurgical RF energy and pressure to ligate vessels interposed between its jaws which can then be transected using the built in knife depl oyed by the device trigger. Based off LigaSure technology, bipolar electrosurgical devices have been shown to be safe and effective for tonsillectomy procedures, providing adequate hemostasis while minimizing postoperative pain. In summary, biocompatibility testing and animal model studies have found BiZact™ to be safe and effective in achieving hemostasis and reducing lateral thermal spread potentially resulting in reduced post ‐operative pain."

Study Objectives The study population consists of patients being treated with BiZact™ device for tonsillectomy. 4.1. Primary objective The primary objective of this study is to assess the severity of post -operative pain following the use of the BiZact™ device in adult tonsillectomy procedures using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) at days 1 through 7, 10 and 14. 4.2. Secondary objectives Several secondary hypotheses will be analyzed: • To assess the incidence of patients with post-operative analgesic consumption • To assess the ability to return to normal diet and normal activity after operation : o Time between dates of operation and return to a normal situation o Incidence of patients returning to a normal situation • To assess the incidence of patients with of post -operative hemorrhage o Incide nce of patients with primary bleeding, occurring at the latest 24 hours after operation. o Incidence of patients with secondary bleeding, occurring more than 24 hours after operation. • To assess the incidence of patients with post -operative readmission • To assess the quantity of intra -operative bleeding volume • To assess the quantity of intra -operative irrigant volume • To assess the operative time from the first incision to complete hemostasis of the tonsillar bed (procedure duration and device use duration)"

Investigation Plan This is a Prospective, multi- center, single -arm non -comparative pilot study to assess the severity of post - operative pain with the use of BiZact™ for tonsillectomy. A minimum of 48 subjects being treated with BiZact™ for tonsillectomy may be enrolled at up to 3 sites in the United States and Europe with competitive enrollment not to exceed 24 subjects per site. Subjects’ participation in the study will last 14 days 14 (+3) post-procedure. Assessments of pain, quality of life, safety, readmission, concomitant medications, ability to return to normal diet and activity will be performed. An at home survey form during post -operative days 1 through 7 and day 10 will be used . At day 14 (+3 ) these parameters will be evaluated via a clinical follow -up visit in the sites. Inclusion criteria Subjects are eligible to be enrolled in the study only if they meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Adults (male or female) ≥22 years of age in United States and ≥18 years of age in Europe 2. Scheduled to undergo non -elective tonsillectomy 3. Signed informed consent by subject or the legally authorized representative Exclusion criteria Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following exclusion criteria: Subjects undergoing; a. Simultaneous adenoidectomy b. Tonsillectomy as a result of cancer c. Unilateral tonsillectomy d. Current participation in other clinical trials Subjects with; e. Current tobacco use f. Known bleeding disorders g. History of peritonsillar abscess h. Craniofacial disorders i. Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) j. Cerebral palsy k. Major heart disease l.

There will be no sample size calculations since the study is not hypothesis- driven. The number of enrolled subjects is pre -defined and all the results will be summarized in a descriptive manner. 7 Statistical Methods Study Subjects 7.1.1 Disp osition of Subjects Screen, consented, eligible, intent -to-treat patients (ITT), operated patients (Full Analysis Set - FAS) and per-protocol patients (PP) will be summarized by frequency , as well as patients early withdrawn. Early withdrawal reasons will be presented by related reason and listed . Protocol deviations, post -operative assessment completions and length of follow -up will be reported (frequency and percentage from Full Analysis Set population ). Subjects who provide study consent, but then are determined to be ineligible pri or to study procedure will be considered a screen failure and will not require additional study follow -up visits as well as subjects withdrawn due to physician decision . The reason for the screening failure will be clearly delineated. Subjects in whom th e procedure is begun but not completed will be considered “discontinued” and will be followed until discharge. These subjects will only contribute to Adverse Event data intraoperatively until discharge (no additional follow -up). They will only be part of the ITT analysis set. 7.1.2 Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) D eviations Full-list of protocol deviations will be reported and major violations to be excluded from Per-Protocol Analysis Set ( PPAS) will be reviewed and discussed with the study team prior to run statistical analysis."

Evaluation of Objectives 7.9.1 Primary objective The severity of pain will be analyzed at each post -operative assessment : at days 1 through 7, 10 and 14. This pain score will be assessed quantitatively using the VAS scale and qualitatively using the below subgroups : • No Pain: VAS= 0 • Mild Pain: VAS > 0 and < 4 • Moderate: VAS ≥ 4 and < 7 • Severe: VAS ≥ 7 Friedman ’s test will be performed so as to assess the distribution of the VAS along the follow -up and testing whether the VAS per visi ts are from a same population : • H0: M1 = M 2 = M3 = M 4 = M 5 = M 6 = M 7 = M 10 = M 14 (the distribution of the VAS is the same in all timepoints) • Ha: There is at least one paire (i,j) such as Mi ≠ M j. Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the use of pain killers. Primary objective analysis will be run on both FAS and PPAS. 7.9.2 Secondary objective s • The incidence of patients with analgesic consumption will be assessed at each timepoint and globally using frequency and percentages. On the whole follow -up the total consumption of analgesics (narcotics and non -narcotics analgesics) will be assessed. Patients with analgesics will be identified based on dosing diary. • Ability to return to no rmal diet and normal activity and patients quality of life after operation will be presented: o Calculating the time ( counts, means, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum ) between the operation and the return to normal diet or activity date s. o Calculating the incidence of patients being returned to normal diet or activity after operation. o Using the EORTC QLQ -H&N35 questionnaire : The head & neck cancer module is meant for use among a wide range of patients with head & neck cancer, varying in di sease stage and treatment modality (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) (Bjordal and Kaasa, 1992; Bjordal et al., 1994, 1999, 2000) (1-3).

It has been field tested in Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands, and in a large cross- cultural study involving more than ten countries (EORTC Protocol 15941). Scoring of the head & neck cancer module The head & neck cancer module inc orporates seven multi- item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. There are also eleven single items. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems (i.e. there are no function scales in which high scores would mean better functioning). Friedman’s test will be applied to assess the distribution of the scores along the follow -up timepoint: o H0: M1 = M 2 = M3 = M 4 = M 5 = M 6 = M 7 = M 10 = M 14 (The distribution of the Symptom score is the same in all timepoints) o Ha: There is at least one paire (i,j) such as Mi ≠ M j .

During causality assessment activity, clinical judgment shall be used and the relevant documents, such as the Clinical Evaluation Report and the Risk Management Report shall be consulted, as all the foreseeable serious adverse events and the potential risks are listed and assessed there. The presence of confounding fact ors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered. Each SAE will be classified according to five different levels of causality. The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to the investigational medical device or procedures: Not related : relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when: 1. the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures 2. the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures; 3. the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 4. the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event; 5. the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by the device or procedure; 6. the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlyi ng or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors); 7. the event does not depend on a false result given by the device used for diagnosis, when applicable; 8. harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; 9. In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event. Unlikely : the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. Possible : the relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. a n underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible. Probable : the relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained.

Introduction Tonsillectomy is one of the most frequently performed otorhinolaryngologic procedures with more than 4.5 million procedures performed annually. The introduction of numerous energy based tools and techniques allow for the simultaneous dissection and sealing of vessels, significantly improving safety and reducing the complications of the procedure. Generally thought of as safe and effective, energy based devices such as laser, Shaw scalpel, electrosurgical devices (needle, scissor, or knife), radiofrequency needle ablation device, thermal welding, and Coblator, use heat energy to denature protein, leading to vascular tamponade and hemostasis. Unfortunately, a byproduct of using this energy during surgery is the lateral heating of the surgical area, which can d amage adjacent structures, delay wound healing, increase post -operative pain, and increase the subject’s time to return to normal diet and activity. In order to address these concerns, Medtronic (formerly Covidien) has developed BiZact™, a bipolar instrume nt intended for use in open surgical procedures, such as tonsillectomies, where ligation and division of vessels, tissue bundles and lymphatics is desired. BiZact™ is designed as a pistol grip radiofrequency (RF) sealer/dissector for use with vessels up to and including 3mm. Compatible with the already in use Valleylab (LS10) energy platform, BiZact™ employs bipolar electrosurgical RF energy and pressure to ligate vessels interposed between its jaws which can then be transected using the built in knife depl oyed by the device trigger. Based off LigaSure technology, bipolar electrosurgical devices have been shown to be safe and effective for tonsillectomy procedures, providing adequate hemostasis while minimizing postoperative pain. In summary, biocompatibility testing and animal model studies have found BiZact™ to be safe and effective in achieving hemostasis and reducing lateral thermal spread potentially resulting in reduced post ‐operative pain."

Evaluation of Objectives 7.9.1 Primary objective The severity of pain will be analyzed at each post -operative assessment : at days 1 through 7, 10 and 14. This pain score will be assessed quantitatively using the VAS scale and qualitatively using the below subgroups : • No Pain: VAS= 0 • Mild Pain: VAS > 0 and < 4 • Moderate: VAS ≥ 4 and < 7 • Severe: VAS ≥ 7 Friedman ’s test will be performed so as to assess the distribution of the VAS along the follow -up and testing whether the VAS per visi ts are from a same population : • H0: M1 = M 2 = M3 = M 4 = M 5 = M 6 = M 7 = M 10 = M 14 (the distribution of the VAS is the same in all timepoints) • Ha: There is at least one paire (i,j) such as Mi ≠ M j. Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the use of pain killers. Primary objective analysis will be run on both FAS and PPAS. 7.9.2 Secondary objective s • The incidence of patients with analgesic consumption will be assessed at each timepoint and globally using frequency and percentages. On the whole follow -up the total consumption of analgesics (narcotics and non -narcotics analgesics) will be assessed. Patients with analgesics will be identified based on dosing diary. • Ability to return to no rmal diet and normal activity and patients quality of life after operation will be presented: o Calculating the time ( counts, means, standard deviations, medians, minimum and maximum ) between the operation and the return to normal diet or activity date s. o Calculating the incidence of patients being returned to normal diet or activity after operation. o Using the EORTC QLQ -H&N35 questionnaire : The head & neck cancer module is meant for use among a wide range of patients with head & neck cancer, varying in di sease stage and treatment modality (i.e. surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) (Bjordal and Kaasa, 1992; Bjordal et al., 1994, 1999, 2000) (1-3).

It has been field tested in Norway, Sweden and The Netherlands, and in a large cross- cultural study involving more than ten countries (EORTC Protocol 15941). Scoring of the head & neck cancer module The head & neck cancer module inc orporates seven multi- item scales that assess pain, swallowing, senses (taste and smell), speech, social eating, social contact and sexuality. There are also eleven single items. For all items and scales, high scores indicate more problems (i.e. there are no function scales in which high scores would mean better functioning). Friedman’s test will be applied to assess the distribution of the scores along the follow -up timepoint: o H0: M1 = M 2 = M3 = M 4 = M 5 = M 6 = M 7 = M 10 = M 14 (The distribution of the Symptom score is the same in all timepoints) o Ha: There is at least one paire (i,j) such as Mi ≠ M j .

This definition inclu des events related to the investigational medical device and the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to investigational medical devices. Adverse Events may include but are not limited to pain, bl eeding, nausea, vomiting, and headache. AEs will be reported by frequencies and percentages of subjects by categories of AEs and by count of each AE. A listing will also be provided. AEs will be collected and documented at baseline and 0 to 14 days follow -up. AEs will be presented globally and based on their occurrence periods: PRE-PROCEDURE , DURING PROCEDURE and POST - PROCEDURE . The MedDRA coding system will be used so as to report the AEs in the statistical tables. Safety analysis will be run on t he whole ITT population and on the FAS . 7.10.1 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that has: • led to death, • led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in o a life-threatening illness or injury, or o a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or o in-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or o medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, or • led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition or a procedure required by the clinical investigational plan, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE. SAEs will be collected and documented at baseline and 0 to 14 days follow -up. 7.10.2 Adverse Device Effect An Adverse Device Effect (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device. This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device."

During causality assessment activity, clinical judgment shall be used and the relevant documents, such as the Clinical Evaluation Report and the Risk Management Report shall be consulted, as all the foreseeable serious adverse events and the potential risks are listed and assessed there. The presence of confounding fact ors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered. Each SAE will be classified according to five different levels of causality. The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to the investigational medical device or procedures: Not related : relationship to the device or procedures can be excluded when: 1. the event is not a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures 2. the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures; 3. the serious event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 4. the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious event; 5. the event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected by the device or procedure; 6. the serious event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlyi ng or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors); 7. the event does not depend on a false result given by the device used for diagnosis, when applicable; 8. harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; 9. In order to establish the non -relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the serious event. Unlikely : the relationship with the use of the device seems not relevant and/or the event can be reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. Possible : the relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. a n underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases were relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible. Probable : the relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the event cannot reasonably explained by another cause, but additional information may be obtained. Causal relationship : the serious event is associated with the device or with procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:"
