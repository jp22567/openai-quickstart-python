In the United States (US) the device was approved in October 2020 by premarket approval application ( PMA ). Outside the US , the device is CE mark ed. The study will be conducted within the approved indication. Investigation Purpose Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Abre venous self -expanding stent system for treatment of symptomatic iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction in patients with venous occlusive disease. The collected data will be used to support regulatory applications to seek market approval in the US and potentially other geographies. Product Status The Abre system was investigational in the US at the time of study enrollment . The product was approved by the FDA on 21/OCT/2020. The Abre system is CE marked in countries that require CE. Geographies where CE mark is accepted might participate in the study. Primary Objective(s) The primary objectives are to evaluate effectivene ss (i.e. achieving a performance goal of 75% primary patency at 12 months) and safety (i.e. achieving a performance goal of 12.5% incidence of major adverse events within 30 days) of the Abre system in subjects with iliofemoral venous obstruction. The post -approval primary objective is to evaluate freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 36 months. Secondary Objective(s) Secondary objectives include descriptive analyses of secondary endpoints as well as acute procedural observations and clinical utility measures. Study Design This is a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, single arm, multi - center, worldwide study, with each center following a common protocol. Sample Size A maximum of 200 implanted subjects were to be included in the United States (US) and outside the United States (OUS) to support the ABRE study primary endpoint evaluations . A total of 200 subjects were implanted and included in the study from 24 investigational sites. No new sites will be added and no new subjects will be enrolled under this protoco l, only those already in the study are eligible to continue. Data from 160 subjects was needed to evalua te the primary effectiveness endpoint of primary patency at 12 months , and data from 193 subjects was needed to evaluate the primary safety endpoint of major adverse event s at 30 days . A minimum of 40% of included subjects were to be from the US."

A 30 -day Major Adverse Event PG of 12.5% and a 12 -month Primary Patency PG of 75% in patients with venous occlusive disease are used. 200 subjects are planned for inclusion . This inc ludes correction for 20% lost-to-follow -up on the effectiveness endpoint and 3.5% lost-to-follow -up on the composite safety endpoint. The sample size is driven by the primary effectiveness and safety endpoint s and based on a one -sided alpha of 0.025 and at least 8 0% overall study power. Primary analyses will be conducted after a minimum of 160 subjects have evaluable primary patency data at 12 months to evaluate the primary effectiveness endpoint and 193 subjects have evaluable follow - up data at 30 days to evaluate the primary safety endpoint . A premarket approval application was submitted to FDA once all available 12-month follow -up data was collected on April 27, 2020 . The primary effectiveness endpoint of the post -approval study phase is Target Lesi on Revascularization (TLR) through 36 months . The new ly added objective will be characterized with descriptive statistics. Time -to- event analysis will be performed for the TLR rate through 36 months (1080 days), subjects with no TLR will be censored at the last contact date.

When the first examination after the procedure is non -diagnostic, a second examination has to be performed as soon as possible . Every effort should be made to perform this within 7 calendar days after the index procedure. 3 X-rays at 30 days will be performed on the first 30 subjects only. They will be assessed for first safety analysis (i.e. stent fracture). 4 An additional venogram must be performed when: (1) DUS assessment is suggestive of ≥50% restenosis or occlusion per investigator assessment, or; (2) whe n DUS is non -diagnostic or suboptimal such as when a subject is obese (e.g. with a BMI >40 ), or; (3) is clinically required, or in other words when the subject is having symptoms of venous disease in the target limb requiring a venogram. 5 Plain x -ray is required pre and post re -intervention to assess for stent fracture. 5 Introduction 5.1 Background Iliofemoral venous obstruction has been recognized with increasing frequency as the underlying cause of lower extremity symptoms including edema, pain, skin changes and, in advanced cases, ulceration. When the presentation is that of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), swelling and pain predominate. However, in addition to these symptoms, patients with chronic venous obstruction from nonthrombotic or postthrombotic etiologies often have skin and subcutaneous changes which can present as hyperpigmentation, lipodemat osclerosis , or venous ulceration. (2) The latter pattern of symptoms comprises the postthrombo tic syndrome. The etiologic mechanism of the symptoms is two -fold; venous valvular incompetence (reflux) and outflow obstruction. These two mechanisms are interlinked; obstruction can lead to dilatation of veins resulting in valvular incompetence. As well, spontaneous recanalization after venous thrombosis often results in destruction of the valves in the involved segments. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms to the development of symptoms varies from patient to patient, but the best results can be achieved when both reflux and obstruction can be treated. (3) (4) The prevalence of chronic iliofemoral outflow obstruction, whether postthrombotic or nonthrombotic, is difficult to discern fr om the literature. Many live for years with the disease and only seek treatment when the symptoms become incapacitating. For this reason, there is a paucity of strong data on which to base estimates of disease prevalence. An estimate of the size of the pop ulation appropriate for iliofemoral venous stenting relies on two assumptions. First, venous stenting is indicated only in patients with significant symptoms (CEAP class C3 or greater). Second, venous stenting is not appropriate for those patients with valvular incompetence as the primary etiology for symptoms, or in those with venous obstruction limited to the femoral and more caudal veins. Estimates vary for the prevalence of significant (CEAP class C3 or greater) venous disease. For C3/C4 disease, estima tes range from 5% to 17%. For C5/C6 disease, estimates range between 1% and 2%. (5) (6) (7) (8) Using a midpoint of 12%, the prevalence of C3 – C6 disease is approximately 29 million in the US adult population. Among these, Lurie and colleagues estimate that 90% will manifest iliofemoral venous outflow"
27,page_27,"056-F275, Clinical Investigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 CIP: ABRE Study Medtronic Confidential Page 28 of 152 CIP Identifier: APV – ABRE Version 2.0: 02/MAR /2021 obstruction. Thus, approximately 25 million pati ents in the US have iliofemoral venous obstruction of a severity where iliofemoral venous stenting might be appropriate. Despite the basis of this calculation on a consensus document, many will find this estimate far too high. To approach the problem from a different angle, we consider again the epidemiology study by Criqui , et. al. (2003) (5). These authors found that 1.0% prevalence of deep functional disease and trophic changes (C4 - C6 disease). While this excludes C3 patient s who might also benefit from stent placement, it also includes patients with deep venous reflux without obstruction, or obstruction in the femoral vein that does not extend into the iliofemoral segment. Assuming that these exclusions and inclusions are ap proximately equal, the 1.0% estimate suggests that about 2.4 million patients have iliofemoral outflow obstruction suitable for venous stenting. So we conclude that the true prevalence of iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction lies between 2.4 million and 25 million US adults. The aforementioned estimates do not include those patients appropriate for stenting after acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT). These patients, by and large, have chronic, often asymptomatic iliofemoral venous lesions; lesio ns unmasked after removing the acute thrombus. Based on US hospital discharge data, approximately 600,000 DVT are diagnosed in the US annually (ICD -9-CM code 453.xx). There are varying estimates of how many of these involve the iliofemoral segment. One rec ent estimate from (9) documented iliofemoral involvement in 38% of patients with DVT. Discounting the overall estimate for recurrent DVT in the same patients, estimated to be approximately 30% over long -term follow -up, (10) (11) the incidence of acute iliofemoral DVT suitable for stenting is approximately 160,000 per year (600,000 x 38% x 70%). Even today, most patients presenting with acute iliofemoral DVT are t reated with anticoagulation alone. (12) (13) (14) Patients with postthrombotic symptoms are often followed with non -interventional management consisting of compression hose and elevation of the extremity. (11) While effective at preventing pulmonary embolism and recurrent DVT, medical management of sympt omatic venous obstruction is associated with the development of debilitating symptoms over long -term follow -up. (15) A variety of definitive modalities have been used to restore venous outflow and alleviate symptoms. For acute DVT, active thrombus removal techniques such as pharmacologic thrombolysis and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy in combination with venous angioplasty and stenting has emerged as the first line treatment to rapidly re - establish venous patency. (16) (17) (18) (19) Venous stenting has been successfully employed as a stand -alone primary intervention for symptomatic non -acute postthrombotic an d nonthrombotic iliofemoral outflow obstruction. (17) (18) (20) (21) Despite the increasing use of stents for acute DVT, chronic postthrombotic and nonthrombotic venous obstruction, most studies have employed stents originally designed for arteries or for biliary indications. Most publications comprise single -center retrosp ective series. Prospective, protocol -driven, monitored studies with core laboratory analyses of imaging studies are rare. (22) This observation must be taken into account when assessing the frequency of clinical events; with th e possibility of underreporting due to the retrospective nature of data collection. Currently, there are several societal guideline documents on the standard of care for the treatment of iliofemoral venous lesions. Most of these are heavily weighted toward the treatment of acute DVT. A guideline document published by the American College of Phlebology in October 2015 (23) supplements a 2014 clinical practice guidelines document from the Society of Vascular Surgery and the America n Venous Forum for the management of venous leg ulcers, (24) and other earlier societal guideline documents. (25) (26) (27) While many of the guideline documents are focused on the management of acute thrombotic venous obstruction, some caveats regarding venous stenting have been included. As well, several review articles"

(28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) Today, venous stenting can be considered as a standard of care for symptomatic, anatomically -significant iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. (21) (28) (33) Currently, however, no dedicated venous stent is approved for the iliac vein indication in the US, although several are CE marked and marketed outside the US. 5.1.1 Literature Review A scientific literature search has been performed to provide an up -to-date review of published data on the safety and effectiveness of stenting for iliac and iliofemoral venous disease. The review included peer - reviewed publications identified by the web -based search strategy with the National Library of Medicine National Center for Biotechnology Information PubMed resource and Cochrane Library through a search date of October 1, 2016 . The substance of the literature review was formed by 63 selected publications. Most publications were single -center, retrospective, non -randomized series. Articles were published between 1996 and 201 6 with treatment dates between 1987 and 2014. The reviewed publications outline the clinical and anatomic characteristics of the population of patients with il iofemoral venous obstruction who were medically -managed and/or treated with venous stents and provided the conclusions below. The average age at presentation was 52 .7 years, although patients presented throughout all age ranges. Females presented more ofte n than males; 6 3.5% versus 3 6.5%, respectively. Lesions were more often on the left than the right; 70.0% vs. 2 0.4%. Bilateral lesions were treated in 9.6% of patients. At baseline, two - thirds of patients were within the C3 or C4 CEAP categories; more mild symptomatology was found in only 8.7% of cases; 26 .4% presented with a healed ( C5, 7.5 %) or active ulcerations ( C6, 18.9%). The literature has shown that venous stenting is generally safe. Major hemorrhage occurred in 1. 1% of patients with access site hematomas in 3. 6%. Other access site complications such as false aneurysms or arteriovenous fistulae were very rare, as was pulmonary embolism or death within 30 days of the procedure ; each occurring in 0.2% or fewer patients . When major adverse events (MA E) were defined as the composite occurrence of death, stent thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stent migration, 5. 6% experienced an MAE within 30 days. Stent fracture was reported in only 1.4% of patients, with stent dislodgement (at the index procedure) in 0.6% and stent migration (after the index procedure) in 1.6%. Effectiveness as measured by patency rate was also satisfactory. At 12 months primary, primary -assisted and secondary patency rates were 85. 7%, 93. 8% and 9 5.2%, respectively. Target lesion rev ascularization (TLR) at 12 months was 8. 3%. There did not appear to be substantial differences in outcome between patients treated with off -label or CE marked venous stents, but the relatively small sample for CE marked stents precludes a robust analysis. In summary, iliofemoral venous stenting as reported in the literature appears to be associated with relatively few perioperative and longer -term complications, with a primary patency rate of approximately 85 .7% at one year. The literature shows that angiop lasty and venous stenting are safe and effective in patients presenting with acute deep vein thrombosis , chronic postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) and chronic nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion (NIVL ). The Abre s ystem was developed specifically for this need. This study will evaluate safety and effectiveness of the Abre s ystem specifically in order to support regulatory submissions in the US and other geographies. The 63 selected publications on past trials for the target indication ( Appendix A Scientific Literature Search ) did not report any race and ethnicity -specific prevalence. Although evidence exists that incidence rates of venous thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis) show significant"

In the ABRE Study , race and ethnicity data will be collected t o improve the completeness and quality of demographic subgroup dat a to better understand whether there are potentially clinically important racial/ethnic -based differences in the anticipated effect of the intervention . 5.2 Purpose The purpose of th e ABRE study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Abre venous self - expanding stent system for the treatment of patients with symptomatic iliofemoral outflow obstruction. The clinical performance of the Abre system w as evaluated during the pivotal study phase through a prospective, single -arm, non -randomized mu lti-center clinical study that treated and included 200 subjects from 24 investigational sites with a hypothesis -based 30 -day composite safety endpoint and a hypothesis - based 12 -month effectiveness endpoint to be tested against performance goals. With anti cipated 20% loss of data on the effectiveness endpoint and 3.5% loss on data on the composite safety endpoint, a Premarket Approval application was to be submitted to FDA when all available 12-month follow -up data have been collected, including the data needed to demonstrate primary safety ( 193 subjects have evaluable follow -up data at 30 days) and primary effectiveness (1 60 subjects have evaluable primary patency data at 12 mon ths) are obtained. The premarket approval appl ication was submitted to FDA and approval was received on October 21, 2020. Subjects who were implanted with the Abre stent in the pivotal study phase will continue to be followed through 36 months in th e post -approval study phase to evaluate long -term safety and effectiveness. The primary endpoint to be assessed during the post-approval study phase is freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 36 months. 6 Objective s and Endpoints 6.1 Primary Objective s The primary objective was to evaluate the effectiveness (i.e. achieving a performance goal of 75% primary patency at 12 months ) and safety (i.e. achieving a performance goal of 12.5% incidence of major adverse events within 30 days ) of implanting the Abre stent in subject s with il iofemoral venous obstruction. The primary objective of the post-approval study phase is to evaluate the long -term effectiveness by assessing the freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 36 months. 6.2 Secondary Objectives Secondary objectives include descriptive analyses of secondary endpoints as well as acute procedural observations and clinical utility measures."

Individual components of the primary safety composite endpoint have been reported in a number of venous stenting studies. Primary eff ectiveness endpoint Primary Patency is defined as meeting all of the following criter ia at 12 months post -procedure: • Freedom from occlusion2 of the stented segment of the targe t lesion ; • Freedom from restenosis2 ≥50% of the stented segment of the target lesion ; • Freedom from clinically -driven3 target lesion revascularization4 Primary effectiveness endpoint of the ABRE Post -Approval Study Phase The primary effectiveness endpoint is Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) through 36 months , defined as any re -intervention of the stented segment of the target lesion. Primary safety endpoint The primary safety endpoint of this study will be the incidence of compo site Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days following stenting of an obstruction in the iliofemoral venous segment. MAEs will be adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee (CEC) , except for stent thrombosis and stent migration as they are confirmed by core laboratory . The components of the 30 -day MAE composite include: • All-cause death occurring post -procedure • Clinically significant (i.e. symptomatic, confirmed by CT pulmonary angiography ) pulmonary embolism • Major bleeding complication (pr ocedural) • Stent thrombosis confirmed by imaging as assessed by core laboratory • Stent migration confirmed by imaging as assessed by core laboratory Note: Migration excludes stent dislodgement at the index procedure as may occur with under -sizing of a stent . 2All subjects will undergo DUS assessments for determin ation of patency. An additional venogram must be performed when : (1) DUS assessment is suggestive of ≥50% restenosis or occlusion per investigator assessment, or (2) when DUS is non -diagnostic or suboptimal such as when a patient is obese (e.g. with a BMI >40), or (3) is clinically required, or in other words when the patient is having symptoms of venous disease in the target limb requir ing a venogram. All DUS an d venographic imaging examinations will be analyzed by respective independent core laboratories. 3Clinically driven is defined as the recurrence of symptoms present at baseline or the onset of new symptoms including, but no t limited to venous pain, swell ing, dermatitis, or ulceration related to the target limb. 4Clinically driven target lesion revascularization will be adjudicated by the CEC based on core laboratory adjudicated imaging data and relevant clinical information provided by the site."

A total of 200 subjects were included in the ABRE study at 24 sites in the US and selected countries outside of the US. The participating sites and principal investigators are listed in a separate overview, which is maint ained in the Trial Master File and Investigator Site File. To avoid introduction of bias to the study results due to disproportionate inclusion , the maximum number of subjects included per site was restricted to no more than 40 (or 20% of the total study population). Study -wide, 200 subjects were implanted with one or more Abre stent(s). A total of 302 stents were used during the study as subject s could receive more than one stent when needed. It was expected that the average sub ject will require 1 or 2 stents. Refer to the IFU for additional device use and sizing details. Subjects who were implanted with the Abre stent were planned to be evaluated at baseline, procedure, hospital discharge, 30 days, 6 months, and annually thereaf ter through 3 years or until study closure. Protocol -required evaluations are performed at the investigative study site s by authorized study staff. The collected data was planned to be used to support regulatory applications in seeking market approval for the Abre system in the US, and potentially other geographies. In the US, the data collected in the ABRE pivotal study phase through 12 -month follow -up was used to support a pre -marke t application. The Abre Venous System was approv ed by the FDA on 21/OCT/2020. In the US , after receiving PMA approval the ABRE study has transitioned to a post -approval study. Outside the US , the study is a post -market study . A common protocol is being followed at all investigational sites. 7.1 Duration Once included, subjects will remain in the study through completion of the required follow -up duration, unless the subject withdraws consent, the investigator withdraws the subject for the subject’s best medical interest, or Medtronic terminates the study for any reason. The enrollment phase was planned to last approximately 13 months. Enrollment of 200 subjects was completed in 12 months. The ABRE study had a planned follow -up duration for each subject of 36 months. The ABRE post-approval study phase will maintain the same follow -up schedule with follow -up completing for each subject at 36 months. The t otal expected duration of the study is approximately 5 years. 7.2 Rationale The clinical performance of the Abre system was evaluated through a prospective, single -arm, non - randomized multi -center clinical study in a total of 200 included subjects with a hypothesis -based 30 -day composite safety endpoint and a hypothesis -based 12 -month effectiveness endpoint derived from performance goals. The study was designed to meet a primary patency performance goal of 75% and a safety performance goal of 12.5% to achieve study success. An extensive scientific literature review ( Appendix A Scientific Literature Search ) was undertaken with the objective to provide an up -to-date review of published data on the safety and effectiveness of stenting for iliac and iliofemoral venous disease."

The design was single -arm since (1) no gold standard exists to treat iliofemoral vein obstruction and (2) “medical treatment alone” cannot assess the effectiveness endpoint of primary patency of the stented segment, meaning comparison s are not relevant . Significant pre -clinical testing via bench and animal models along with research feasibility activities have been performed to ensure product quality and optimize system performance. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness in subject s. 8 Product Description 8.1 General The Abre system is intended for use in the iliofemoral veins for the treatment of symptomatic venous outflow obstruction. The Abre system consists of a stent and stent delivery system designed specifically for implantation in the peripheral venous system. The Abre system consists of a flexible self -expanding stent made of a nickel - titanium alloy ( nitinol ) provided in multiple lengths and di ameters and an over -the-wire stent delivery system. Table 1 lists the stent diameters and lengths for the Abre stent . Table 1: Stent Diameters and Lengths Stent Length (mm) Nitinol Tube Wall Thickness 40 60 80 100 120 150 Stent Diameter (mm) 10 x x x x x x 0.018” 12 x x x x x 14 x x x x x 16 x x x x x 0.028” 18 x x x x x 20 x x x x x 8.1.1 Stent The Abre stent is a flexible self -expanding nitinol (nickel -titanium alloy) stent provided in multiple lengths and diameters. The stent is laser machined from a continuous seamless piece of nitinol tubing into an open lattice design. A drawing of the laser cut Ab re stent is seen in Figure 1. There are no welds, joints , or bonds used in the construction of the stent. The Abre stent cell geometry includes three wave peaks between connection bridges. An alternating off -line pattern used for the connection bridges is intended to increase stent flexibility. The Abre stent is designed for durability . Compound radii were applied to specific nodes in order for high strain locations to be further reduced resulting in a higher fatigue life. These radi i can be seen in the figures below. After being laser cut, the stent is electropolished and passivated. The Abre stent uses integral nitinol markers for visibility. Figure 2 is a picture of the finished stent. Upon deployment, the stent achieves its predeterm ined diameter and exerts a n outward force to maintain patency and placement (i.e. no migration) in the target vessel."

Figure 1: Abre laser cut pattern Figure 2: Abre finished stent 8.1.2 Abre Stent Delivery System The Abre stent delivery system is an over -the-wire (OTW), 9 Fr, 0.035” guide wire compatible, delivery system for deploying the Abre self-expanding nitinol stent in the iliof emoral vein . The catheter is a triaxial shaft configuration consisting of an inner shaft , a retractable sheath, and an isolation sheath. The inner shaft is PEEK (polyether ether ketone) with a radiopaque Pebax tip. The retractable sheath is a braid reinforced nylon with a PTFE liner. The isolation sheath is High-Density Polyethylene ( HDPE ). The retractable sheath has one 90% Platinum/10% Iridium radiopaque marker that aids in positioning the catheter. The isolation sheath is attached to t he deployment handle assembly via the strain relief. A single luer port is located on the proximal end of the deployment handle. Saline is injected into this port to flush air from the system. The handle assembly contains a thumbwheel actuated deployment m echanism that, along with the isolation sheath, provides control and accuracy during stent deployment. A locking pin prevents the stent from being deployed prior to intended use and must be removed to actuate the thumbwheel. As the thumbwheel is rotated, a stainless steel Pull Cable is wound onto the thumbwheel and pulls the retractable sheath toward the handle , deploying the stent. Figure 3 provides a drawing of the Abre stent delivery system."

At the end of the study enrollment period, all remaining investigational devices (in US) were returned to Medtronic. 9 Selection of Subjects 9.1 Study Population Patients between 18 and 80 years (inclusive) requiring treatment of a non-malignant venous obstruction within the common il iac, external iliac , and/or common femoral vein were considered for the study if they met all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (I/E criteria) . 9.2 Subject Enrollment (Point of Enrollment and Inclusion ) The point of enrollment was the time at which the subject sign ed and dated the informed consent form. The point of inclusion was the time at which the subject who signed and dated the informed consent form, adhere d to all I/E criteria and the Abre system entered the vasculature. 9.3 Subject Screening Patients identified with symptomatic venous outflow obstruction in the iliofemoral veins requiring a venous stent were screened by the site’s investigative team for possible inclusion in the study. During the course of the study, Medtronic had the option to limit enrollments to specific indications (i.e. acute DVT, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) , or nonthrombotic iliac ve in lesion (NIVL)), if needed in order to achieve a distribution that was similar to the literature review used to develop the study performance goals. Investigators were notified of specific indications that would no longer be considered for enrollment. This determination would be made during the screening process, at which time the subject would become a screening failure. Enrolled Patients who met all general screening criteria were asked to participate in the stu dy. If the patient agree d to participate, prior to any study -specific tests or procedures, a personally signed and dated informed consent was obtained. Signing and dating the informed consent form was considere d the point of enrollment. Once informed conse nt was obtained study -specific tests were performed to assess any remaining I/E criteria. Enrolled – not included Consented subjects who did not meet all I/E criteria were to not be treated with the Abre stent. This might have been based on the outcome of imaging during the implant procedure. If subject s left the study before the implant date, safety assessment s could be stopped at the date of screening failure. If subjects were"

No imaging need ed to be sen t to the core laboratory for these subjects . Included Consented subjects who met all study -specific I/E criteria were eligible to be treated with the Abre stent. During the study procedure, the point at which the Abre system enter ed the vasculature was considered the point of inclusion into the study. Subjects who were implanted with the Abre stent were to be followed for the duration o f the study. Two hundred (200) subjects were included in the ABRE study. Included – not implanted This is a sub -category of the Included group. Consented subjects who met all study -specific I/E criteria were treated with the Abre stent. During the study procedure, the point at which the Abre system enter ed the vasculature was considered the point of inclusion into the study. Those subjects who were not implanted with the Abre stent were to be followed for 30 days for safety assessment only . These subjects were to be included in the primary analysis. The pre -procedure/pre -stenting imaging was to be submitted to the core laboratory. No subjects were included -not implanted in the ABRE study. The subject’s medical record must have indicate d that the subject was enrolled in the ABRE Study . Sites were required to maintain a Subject Identification and Enrollment Log. These subject categories are described in Table 5. Table 5: Description of subject categories Subject category Description Enrolled Subjects who signed and dated the informed consent form. These subjects were to be recorded on the Subject Identification & Enrollment Log. Enrolled - not included Subjects who signed and dated the informed consent form and where the Abre system did not e nter the vasculature . For example due to not fulfilling all I/E criteria which could only be assessed after the point of enrollment. These subjects were to be recorded on the Subject Identification & Enrollment Log. Included Subjects, who signed and dated the informed consent form, adhere d to all I/E criteria and where the Abre system entered the vasculature. These subjects were to be recorded on the Subject Identification & Enrollment Log. Included - not implanted Subjects, who signed and dated the informed consent form, adhere d to all I/E criteria and where the Abre system entered the vasculature and the Abre stent was not implanted."

These templates may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual site. For US sites, this must include Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization language. This language may be incorporated into the ICF or (if requ ired by the Ethics Board ) included as a separate document. Medtronic, Ethics Boards , and Competent Authorities (CA), where applicable, shall approve all informed consent documents prior to implementation in the study. Medtronic, Ethics Boards, and CAs, w here applicable must pre -approve all language changes to the PI/ICF throughout the course of the study prior to implementation; this includes initial submission, annual reviews (if applicable) , and protocol amendment reviews. The original Ethics Board -approved PI/ICF must be retained at the investigational site. Any revisions required by the Ethics Board must be forwarded to Medtronic for review and approval before the revised consent form is returned to the Ethics Board for final review and full approval. Medtronic will provide any important new information that impacts the health, safety or welfare of study subjects, for inclusion in PI/ICF updates as it becomes available. Sites should follow any Medtronic, CA , or Ethics Board requirements for disseminating new information and re -consenting subjects during the course of the study. 10.2.2 Informed Consent Process The investigator (or authorized designee ) was required to administer the approved PI/ICF to each prospective study patient without coercion or undue improper influence on, or inducement of, the patient to participate. During the consent discussion the investigator (or authorized designee) was required to fully inform the patient of all pertinent aspects of the s tudy, using native non -technical language that was understandable to the patient. The patient was required to be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which th e patient was otherwise entitled, and also be informed that withdrawal from the study would not jeopardize their future medical care. The patient was required to also be informed that by participating in the study, they were not waiving their legal rights. The patient was required to have ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study, and to decide whether or not to participate in the clinical s tudy. All questions about the study were to be answered to the satisfaction of the patient. All items discussed in the PI/ICF was required to be explained. Informed consent was to be obtained in writing from the patient. The date of consent and process by which the consent was obtained (including documentation of speci al circumstances, if applicable) was to be documented in the patient’s medical record prior to any study -specific procedures. Patient informed consent was required to be obtained in accordance with the national and local laws, regulations and guidelines of each site. The institutional standard procedure consent form does not replace the study PI/ICF. The subject ’s signature and date of consent serve to document that they underst ood the written and verbal information that the investigator (or authorized designee ) provide d, and their agreement to participate and collect their medical data . The i nvestigator (or authorized designee ) who conducted the informed consent process was required to provide their handwritten signature and date the consent was completed on the ICF. The ICF was required to be signed and dated prior to any specific protocol assessments or procedures."

The original signed and dated ICF is kept at the investigational site. A copy of the signed and dated ICF was to be provided to the subject . 10.2.3 Special Circumstances for Informed Consent Process and Signature If a patient could not read or write, an impartial witness was required to be present during the entire informed consent discussion. The written PI/ICF (and any other information ) could be read aloud and explained to the patient and witness. The witness would then sign and perso nally date the ICF attesting that the information was accurately explained and that consent was freely given. The patient would sign and date if possible. Given the investigational status of the Abre system in the US at the time of enrollment , and the av ailability of approved endovenous stents in some geographies, emergency cases were not allowed under this protocol. Given the commercial availability of other endovenous stents in some geographies, requests for compassionate use of the Abre stent were not anticipated. 10.3 Screen ing/Baseline Procedures (-30 days) The following baseline evaluations were completed and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. Baseline evaluations were to be completed within 30 days of the scheduled implant procedure unless otherwise specified . • Informed consent • Demographics • Medical history • Physical examination • Pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential only. This must be done within 7 days prior to the index procedure. • CEAP classification (for b oth limbs ) • Physical assessment of limbs • Villalta score, VCSS (for both limbs) • Quality of life questionnaires: EQ -5D and VEINES -QOL/Sym • Blood tests (See Section 10.3.2 Blood Tests) • INR required for sub jects on warfarin • Venogram or IVUS for diagnosis if performed as standard of care .

For any interventions, the date of the most recent intervention was to be captured. Data collected at baseline: • Gender • Age at time of enrollment • Race/Ethnicity , to be collected per the FDA Guidance for Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials (20 16) (38), in support of regulatory submissions in the US (FDA). • Risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemi a, tobacco use, obesity (BMI), previous knee/hip replacement, immobility and any other cardiovascular risk factors, with measure of severity and current treatment • Co-existing cardiovascular conditions (including, but not limited to superficial ablation, co ngestive heart fail ure, peripheral vascular disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI)) • Symptoms • Physical examination • Assessment of target lesion and access vessel characteristics • Medications: Antithrombotics, Antibiotics, Immunosuppressants, NSAIDs, Steroids, Diuretics, Calcium -channel blockers , Statins; 10.3.2 Blood Tests The following blood tests were required : • Serum creatinin e for GFR calculation (GFR must be ≥ 30 to be included in the study) . Any method to perform the GFR calcu lation is allowed ; • White Blood Cell (WBC) count (must be ≥ 3,000 cells/mm3 and ≤ 12,500 cells/mm3 to be included in the study) • Platelet count (must be ≥ 50,000 cells/mm3 and ≤1,000,000 cells/mm3 to be included in the study); • Hemoglobin ; • Hematocrit ; • INR required for subjects on warfarin . 10.4 Acute DVT Subject s Acute DVT subjects were required to be treated with the Abre stent within 14 days after onset of symptoms. Subject s with acute deep vein t hrombosis (DVT) were required to first undergo successful treatment of acute thrombus . This was required to be done within 14 days after the onset of symptoms and only with market released devices. S uccessful treatment was defined as less than 30% residual thrombus by venogram, as determ ined by physician , and no bleeding, no symptomatic pulmonary embolism (confirmed by imaging ), and no renal compromise. Subject s with underlying obstructive lesions were then permitted to be includ ed in the study within the same procedure , or the procedure may have been staged ."

The IFU was provided with each device. 10.5.1 Procedure Data The following data was to be recorded for each subject in the study: • Date of procedure • Indication for stenting: acute DVT, NIVL, PTS , and any combination of these • Identification data for the stent(s) • Details of procedure, including any adjuncti ve vascular procedure performed • Chosen access sites • Medications: Antithrombotics, Thrombolytics • Assessment of handling, visualiza tion, deployment , and withdrawal • Assessment of patency, position ing, and integrity of the stent • Adverse events • Comparison of int ended and actual stent location • Date of hospital discharge 10.5.2 Imaging During the index procedure, venography and IVUS were required, prior and post stent placement to aid with stent sizing and lesion ass essment. 10.5.3 IVC Filter Placement Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) filter placement was at the discretion of the physician. IVC filter placement was not encouraged, however may have been considered in the following situations: • presence of floating thrombus in iliocaval segments; • planned use of mechanical thrombectomy in the presence of acute thrombus. IVC filter was recommended to be removed as soon as deemed safe by the operating physician. 10.5.4 Inflow Requirements Negative outcom es are best avoided by good inflow directed by IVUS in the least diseased portion of the vein above the deep femoral vein . Good inflow involves either the femoral or deep femoral vein inflow being patent and at least a caudal section of the common femoral vein that is free of significant disease. Good inflow was to be determined by the investigator . 10.5.5 Lesion(s) The target lesion was defined as non -malignant venous obstruction within the common iliac, external iliac , and/or common femoral vein: the proximal point of the obstruction may have extend ed to the iliac venous confluence of the inferior vena cava and the distal point may have been at or above the deep femoral vein ."

Predilation of the lesion with a balloon catheter was required to be the same diameter of the stent to be implanted , i.e. if a 14 mm stent was to be implanted, a 14 mm diameter balloon was required to be used. A high pressure balloon was highly recommended. At a minimum the balloon should have been inflated up to nominal pressure and should have been inflated within the segment that was intended to be stented. The balloon would then have been removed from the subject while access with the guidewire was maintained . 10.5.7 Stent Size Selection To optimize visualizing of the true extent of a venous lesion , venogram and IVUS could have been used. However, IVUS was the preferred modality . Stent length It is important that the proximal and distal end s of the stents lie in a relatively normal/healthy venous segment. Therefore, a stent length must have been chosen that extend ed cranial and caudal to the target lesion , covering a t minimum 1 cm cranial and 1 cm caudal , if the disease allow ed. Additional coverage can reduce the risk of reste nosis. The Abre stent should not have occlude d the inflow of the contralateral limb or touch the contralateral wall. Stent diameter Vein d iameters could be measured using one of the following two methods: 1. Using IVUS : take the average of the min imum and max imum diameters of a normal segment of vein in the same anatomical segment; 2. Using Venogram: take the average diameter of a normal segment of vein in the same anatomical segment in two planes. Considering the estimated anatomic vessel diamete r, the appropriate Abre stent diameter was to be selected . A stent with a diameter of at least 2 mm more than the chosen reference vessel diameter was recommended to achieve good wall apposition . Reference vessel diameter could have been obtained b y one of the following methods: 1. Measure the diameter of a normal segment of an appropriate segment of the target vein (which generally should be the most caudal segment) ; 2. Measure the diameter of the vein in an appropriate segment of the co ntralateral limb; 3. Use the literature reference vessel diameter for the appropriate segment : a. Common Iliac Vein: 16 mm b. External Iliac Vein: 14 mm c. Common Femoral Vein: 12 mm Proper size selection reduces stent migration and ensures appropriate stent apposition to the vessel wall."

Whenever possible, one stent should have been used to cover the entire length of the target lesion . Multiple stents If multiple stents were needed to cover the entire length of the target lesion, they should have been implanted in an overlapping manner with a minimum overlap of 1.5 cm. The more cranial stent should have been placed first. It was recommended to use the same s tent diameter . If different diameters were needed, the smaller diameter stent should have been placed first. Non-stented areas in between stents , i.e. skip areas, were not allowed. Stents ending in the inguinal ligament were to be avoided. 10.5.9 Post-dilation Post-dilation of the lesion with a balloon catheter was recommended up to the diameter of the implanted stent to achieve the expected nominal stent diameter. 10.6 Hospital Discharge The discharge visit occurred at the time of subject’s discharge from the hospi tal. The following evaluations were completed and data was recorded on the Discharge eCRF: • Duplex ultrasound (target limb) . The DUS exam ination immediately after the index procedure needs to be performed between 0 and 7 calendar days from the index procedu re. When the first exam ination after the procedure is non -diagnostic, a second exam has to be performed as soon as possible . Every effort should be made to perform this within 7 calendar days after the index procedure; • Duplex ultrasound (contralateral limb) ; image of the CFV waveform only. • Physical assessment of limbs ; • Adverse events/device deficiency ; • Medications: Antithrombotics, Antibiotics, Immunosuppressants, NSAIDs, Steroids, Diuretics, Calcium -channel blockers , Statins ; • Compression stockings.

Pre-procedure If subject is taking an anticoagulant , this needs to be stopped prior to intervention with an appropriate transition regime. If subject is on warfarin, a slight increase in the pre -procedure prothrombin time (INR ≤ 1.7) is not a contraindication to proceed with the procedure. Peri-procedure In all subjects , full anticoagulation is instituted prior to the index procedure and it is important to maintain adequate treatment throughout the procedure . The regimen is to be determined by the investigator. A suggested anticoagulation regimen for chronic subjects is : • a heparin bolus of 5000 units, after placement of the sheath in the access vessel; • followed by bolus of 5000 units or infusion of 100 U/kg to keep ACT>200 seconds for a full systemic anticoagulation. Post -procedure Full anticoagulat ion should be commenced within 4 hours of completion of the procedure. Anticoagulation should follow local guidance . However , when using warfarin, an INR>2.0 with appropriate bridging cover is recommended . DOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban , or edoxaban) can be used instead of warfarin."

Antiplatelets With respect to antiplatelet treatment, the following recommendations were provided: • A regimen of dual antiplatelet treatment in addition to anticoagulation should be carefully considered in light of the high bleeding risk. If used, d ual antiplatelet treatment in addition to anticoagulat ion should be limited to only the first 6 weeks following the index procedure. • After discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy, consider switching subjects to an antiplatelet therapy (if not currently ongoing); 10.12.2 CEAP Classification At baseline, t he American Venous Forum CEAP classification (2004) was used to provide a comprehensive objective classification of the severity of the veins. This assessment was required to be performed for both limbs. The CEAP Classification needs to be assessed by a medical doctor or qualified delegated person . See Appendix C CEAP Classification . 10.12.3 Scores 10.12.3.1 Villalta Score The Villalta score categorize s the severity of p ostthrombotic syndrome (PTS) . The V illalta score is assessed for all subjects for both limbs at baseline , 30-days, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-Month and Unscheduled follow -up visits . At Unscheduled visits, the Villalta should be taken before an intervention in the target vein takes place. The Villalta Score needs to be assessed by a medical doctor or qualified delegated person . See Appendix D Villalta Score . 10.12.3.2 Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS ) The VCSS is used to assess changes in disease severity over time. The VCSS is assessed for both limbs at baseline , 30-days, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-Month and Unscheduled follow -up visits . At Unscheduled visits, the VCSS should be taken before an intervention in the target vein takes place. The VCSS needs to be assessed by a medical doctor or qualified delegated person . See Appendix E Venous Clinical Severity Score (VCSS) . 10.12.4 Quality of Life questionnaires Health -related quality of life outcomes are assessed at baseline and 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-Month follow -up visits using the EQ -5D and VEINES -QOL/Sym questionnaire s. See Appendix F EQ-5D and Appendix G VEINES - QOL/Sym questionnaire . These questionnaires need to be complete d either by the subject or by a delegated person who asks the questions to the subject and completes the questionnaire on behalf of the subject .

Subjects exempt from this requirement were those who had been surgically sterilized, who were infertile, or who had been post -menopausal for at least 12 months (no menses). 10.12.6 Imaging 10.12.6.1 Venogram A venogram (target limb) must be performed : • during the index procedure, prior and post stent placement to aid with stent sizing and lesion assessment; • in case a re -intervention in the target vein takes place; • to assess the primary effectiveness performance goal endp oint during the 12 month follow -up visit only when : (1) DUS assessment is suggestive of ≥50% restenosis or occlusion per investigator assessment, (2) when DUS is non -diagnostic or suboptimal such as when a subject is obese (e.g. with a BMI>40), or (3) clinically required, or in other words when the subject is having symptoms of venous disease in the target limb requiring a venogram. Furthermore, a venogram (target limb) may be performed: • during screening : the diagnosis can be made based on objective imaging using venograph y or IVUS ; • at all other time points, an additional venogram m ay be performed at the investigator discretion. In case that the subject refuses a venogram, it will be documented in the eCRF. This is not considered a deviation . All venographic imaging examinations should be performed according to the core laboratory guidelines and are analyzed by an independent core laboratory (See Section 13.4). 10.12.6.2 Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) The screening DUS was to be performed per standard of care in both l imbs . All DUS after the index procedure were to be performed in the target limb , including an image of the contralateral CFV waveform. The DUS exam immediately after the index procedure was to be performed between 0 and 7 calendar days from the index procedure. When the first exam after the procedure was non-diagnostic, a second exam was to be performed as soon as possible . Every effort should have been made to perform this within 7 calendar days after the index procedure. DUS was/will be performed to assess patency during the 6, 12, 24, 36 months follow -up visits. All DUS examinations , except the screening DUS, should be performed according to the core laboratory guidelines and are analyzed by an independent core laboratory (See Section 13.3)."

Deviations may include, but are not limited to the following: • Failure to obtain informed consent prior to participation • Incorrect version of the informed consent form used • Failure to obtain Ethics Board approval before the start of enrolling subjects in the study • Included subject did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria • Required testing and/or measurements not done or incorrectly done • Subject did not complete follow -up visit • Follow -up visit was completed outside window • Unauthorized use of Abre system (s) • Adverse events/UADE or device deficiencies not reported in the required timeframe by country regulation or as specified in the CIP • Control of study devices not maintained • Source data permanently lost • Enrollment of subjects during lapse of Ethics Board approval • Subject in clusion limits exceeded The investigator is not allowed to deviate from the CIP, except when necessary to protect the life or physic al well-being of a subj ect in an emergency situation. Deviation s must be reported to Medtronic on the Deviation eCRF. In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain a subject’s consent, or is made to protect the life or physical well -being of a subject in an emergency, the deviation must be reported to the Ethics Board as well as Medtronic as soon as possible but no later than five (5) working days from the date of the deviation occurrence. Reporting of all other deviation s should comply with Ethics Board policies , local laws , regulatory agency requirements and must be reported to Medtronic as soon as possible up on the center becoming aware of the deviation. Refer to Table 16 and Table 17 for geography -specific deviation reporting requirements and timeframes for reporting to Medtr onic and/or regulatory bodies. The COVID -19 global pandemic started during the 24 -month follow -up phase of this study .If a protocol deviation is related to COVID -19, details must be reported as to how the deviation is related to the pandemic . Examples include: Patient preference – declined / did not feel safe and/or comfortable; Patient in quar antine however not tested positive with COVID -19; Research staff – site staffing issue due to COVID - 19; Institutional policy – no resear ch activities permitted on site, e tc. Medtronic is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and identifying any additional corrective and/or preventive actions which may include amending the CIP, conducting additional training, terminating the investigation, etc. Repetitive or serious investigator compliance issues may represent a need to initiate a corrective action plan with the investigator and site, and in some cases, necessitate suspending enrollment at that site until the problem is resolved or ultimately t erminating the investigator's participation in the study. Medtronic may provide center -specific reports to investigators summarizing information on deviations that occurred at the investigat ional site on a periodic basis."

The investigator may withdraw the subject at any time to protect the health, safety , or welfare of the subject. At the last point of contac t (if outside a study -required visit), the subject’s vital status should be recorded on a Study Exit eCRF, and every effort should be made to collect the status of any ongoing adverse events prior to withdrawal . 10.14.2 Lost-to-Follow -up The subject may only be co nsidered lost to follow -up after all efforts to obtain compliance are exhausted. At a minimum, four attempts must be made to contact the subject and documented in the subject’s records: • 3 telephone attempts to the subject’s last known phone number, and if unsuccessful, • 1 certified letter from the PI to the subject’s last known address If the site is unable to reach the subject after the documented attempts, the site should make every attempt to verify the subject’s vital status (alive or deceased). A Study Exit eCRF should be completed. If the subject returns to the study site thereafter, the Study Exit eCRF can be deleted and follow -up data can be collected. A Deviation eCRF should be completed for the missed visit(s), if appropriate. 10.14.3 Subject Discontinuation All subjects will be encouraged to remain in the study through the last follow -up visit. Included subjects who discontinue participation prematurely will be included in the analysis of results, but will n ot be replaced in the inclusio n of total study subjects. If the subject discontinues participating in the study prior to completing the study requirements, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the subject’s study records and on the Study Exit eCRF. There are many scenarios in which a subject may exit the study . Table 8 details how the data will be handled for each scenario. 10.14.4 Medical Care after Study Exit After study exit , the subjects will be followed as per routine standard of care by the investigational site or a treating physician. Relevant medical records may be made available by the investigational sites for the treating physician per local laws and regulations if needed for further subject treatment. As per local law and regulation , the investigator may be contacted by the treating physician in case of questions related to the study device and treatment. Sites shall request permis sion from the subject to follow -up outside of the study, if issues arise with the Abre stent safety or performance."

The risks associated with the Abre system are believed to be similar to those associated with the existing endovascular stent systems in clinical use or commercially available for the treatment of symptomatic iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. Table 9 lists all potential adverse events associated with the implantation of the Abre stent. Table 9: Potential adverse events - Access failure - Access site infection - Allergic reaction to contrast medium or procedure medications - Allergic reaction to nitinol or other device materials - Arrhythmia - AV fistula - Bleeding - Bruising - Death - Device breakage - Device maldeployment - Edema - Fever - Hematoma - Hypotension, nausea, or other vasovagal response - Infection - Myocardial infarction - Pain - Pseudoaneurysm - Pulmonary embolism - Renal insufficiency/renal failure (new or worsening) - Sepsis - Stent fracture - Stent malapposition - Stent malposition - Stent migration - Stroke/paradoxical embolism/transient ischemic attack/intracerebral hemorrhage - Tissue necrosis - Transfusion reaction following blood transfusion for treatment of major bleeding - Vessel damage, including perforation or rupture - Venous occlusion/thrombosis, within or outside of stented segment Additional risks for the subject due to participation in the study may include : - Discomfort during the imaging scans - Potential significant radiation exposure due to beam intensity and length of time of imaging, resulting in acute radiation injury as well as increased risk for physical and genetic defects to subjects. The following measures will be implemented to minimize any risks to study subjects: • Investigator and study personnel will be trained to the design of the Abre system , its application and preclinical results. • Eligibility criteria and screening procedures will be followed to ensure that a ppropriate subjects are enrolled and included . • Investigator will adhere to the Abre system Instructions For Use packaged with the device. • The subjects w ill be carefully monitored throughout the study period. • The investigator will evaluate the subject adverse events during the course of the study. • Data submitted from the investigative centers will be monitored during the course of the study. • Monitoring visits will be conducted to evaluate protocol compliance and data quality."
66,page_66,"056-F275, Clinical Investigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 CIP: ABRE Study Medtronic Confidential Page 67 of 152 CIP Identifier: APV – ABRE Version 2.0: 02/MAR /2021 • Safety and effectiveness data obtained during the course of the study will be shared with investigators in periodic reports to increase understanding of the device and potential adverse events. • A Data Safety Monitoring Board , Clinical Events Committee, and imaging core laboratory will be established to independently evaluate subject health status, device performance, and identify any safety concerns regarding subjects’ w ell-being. • If a woman is pregnant or becomes pregnant, implantation of the study device may involve risks to the embryo or fetus that are unknown at this time. Therefore, pregnant women will be excluded from the study. If a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of this clinical research study they need to inform the in vestigational site immediately without any unjustified delay . Continuation in the study or withdrawal from the study will be up to the investigator’s discretion . Potential treatm ents for the foreseeable risks may include medication, surgery, medical monitoring or other applicable treatments, and will be provided at the discretion of the investigator. Any unanticipated or unforeseen complications will be reported by the principal i nvestigator (or authorized designee) to the Ethics Board and Medtronic. Medtronic is responsible to report any necessary findings to the appropriate regulatory agencies/bodies in each of the respective geographies. 11.2 Potential Benefits 11.2.1 Potential Benefits of the Abre System Potential benefits from use of the Abre system have not been documented; nevertheless, they are expected to be sim ilar to those associated with venous stent systems currently in clinical trials or commercially available. The prim ary benefit is the recanalization of iliofemoral stenosis or occlusion with restoration of blood flow. The potential benefits are improve ment of limb pain , swelling, skin changes and ulcer healing , and enhance ment of quality of lif e. The Abre system has several design features that positively impact the performance of the device for its intended use and is expected to offer additional benefits. These design features are reflected in Figure 6. Figure 6: Design features Abre stent"

Furthermore, the information obtained during this study will be used scientifically. The results of this study can help physicians understand the safety and effectiveness of the Abre system . 11.3 Risk-Benefit Rationale It has been demonstrated that stent placement for iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction can be performed safely and that these devices are effective in restoring and maintaining iliofemoral vessel patency. Any potential risks with this study are minimized by selecting qualified investigators, careful assessment of each subject pri or to, during , and after implantation. Medtronic has further minimized the possibility of risks by completing product testin g prior to the use of the Abre system in this clinical study, implementing quality control measures into production processes, provi ding guidelines for subject selection and evaluation, and providing adequate instructions and labeling. The investigator in addition performs a continuous monitoring, assessment , and documentation of any risks. The risks associated with the Abre stent or participation in this study are not anticipated to be worse than the risks normally associated with the use of other commercially available devices. Risk management for the Abre system is performed in accordance with EN ISO 14971:2012 . Furthermore, the indications and contraindications are provided in the Instructions for Use."

AEs will be followed until the event has resolved or until study exit. In case of permanent impairment, the event will be followed until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained. Reporting of AEs and DDs will end once the subject exits the study. In case AEs are unresolved at the time of study exit, this will be documented in the eCRF. The following subjects will be followed for 30 days after the procedure: • subjects in who m the Abre system did not enter the vasculature during the implant procedure (for example because of not meeting the I/E criteria); • subjects in who m the Abre system entered the vasculature , but who did not have a n Abre stent implanted. All AEs during this 30 day follow -up period will be handled as per the described study requirements. Adverse events and device deficiencies (see also Section 12.2.4 ) that occur during this study are required to be reported to Medtronic by completing the A dverse Event or Device D eficiency eCRF , which will be accessible by Medtronic and designees who have authorized access to the EDC system . All reported adverse events will be reviewed by Medtronic or authorized designee to determine whether the adverse event meets regulatory reporting requirements . The general process for reporting Adverse Events is as follows: • Report the event to Medtronic as soon as possible , but no later than the timeframes outlined in Table 14 • Sites will be provided with the contact information of the appropriate Medtronic authorized designee • Complete all sections of the Adverse Event eCR F • Each unique event/diagnosis must be docum ented separately • The Adverse Event eCRF must be reviewed and approved by the investigator The following information should be collected on the Adverse Event eCRF: • Date of onset or first observation (if full date not available the date when diagnos is was e stablished can be used) • Date of first awareness by investigator • Description of the event (single diagnosis term) • AE code number (provided by Medtronic) • Seriousness of the event • Causal relationship of the event to the Abre system • Causal relationship of the event to the implant procedure • Action taken, including any medical or surgical intervention and date of intervention • Narrative (describe any additional details relevant to the AE)"

The CEC may request source documentation on additional events, at their discretion and according to the CEC Manual of Operations . Additional information regarding the CEC is detailed in Section 13.2. 12.2.2 Reporting of Device Deficiencies Device deficiencies that led to an AE are reported on the AE eCRF (one for each AE) . Device deficiencies that did not lead to an AE should be reported on a Device Deficiency eCRF (one for each device deficiency). Device deficiencies that did not lead to an adverse event , but might have led to an SADE if: a) a suitable action had not been taken, or b) an intervention had not been made, or c) circumstances had been less fortunate, should be reported to M edtronic immediately (but no later than 72 hours of the investigator’s / site’s first knowledge of the event (or sooner if required by local regulation) of the site’s first learning of the event on a Device Deficiency eCRF. Any device or accessory involve d with a device deficiency should be returned to Medtronic (unless implanted) for analysis (see Section 8.9). 12.2.3 Non-Reportable Medical Occurrences Documented pre -existing conditions or a procedure required by the CIP, are not considered AEs and should not be report ed unless there is a change in the nature or severity of the condition. Pre -existing events should be reported as Adverse Events in the situation where a new treatment has to be started or an existing treatment has to be changed to treat the adverse event and the event is accompanied with signs and symptoms. Unavoidable events are conditions inherent to a n endovenous procedure that can potentially occur in each subject for a projected duration according to the investigator’s opinion, including, but not limited to the events listed in Table 13. Unavoidable events should not be reported unless the event worsens or is present outside the stated timeframe from the endovenous procedure."

Primary endpoint and study success criteria has been added in the below corresponding sections . The clinical performance of the Abre system will be evaluated through a prospective, single -arm, non -randomized , multi -center , global clinical study in a total of 200 included subjects with a hypothesis -based 30 -day composite safety endpoint and a hypothesis -based 12 -month effectiveness endpoint assessed b y performance goals. Statistical analysis will be performed by Medtronic statisticians or their designated representatives. A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) has been developed to further describe pre -specified statistical methods, data handling rules, and analyses that will be employed. Any deviation from the original statistical analysis plan will be reported in the final study report, along with justification for th e deviation(s). One-sided statistical tests will have p -values less than 0.025 deemed significant while two -sided tests will have p -values less than 0.05 deemed significant. Statistical analyses will be conducted in SAS version 9.4 or above (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) or another validated statistical software package. For adverse event reporting, the primary analysis will be based on subject counts, not event counts. Both subject counts and event counts will be presented i n tabular summaries of results , as appropriate . 14.1 Performance Goals 14.1.1 Performance Goal: Primary Effectiveness Endpoint The primary effectiveness performance goal endpoint in the study is primary patency. The statistical hypothesis on this endpoint is that primary patency through 12 months will exceed a performance goal established from historical literature references using venous stenti ng as the treatment of choice. Formally, the null and alternative hypoth eses to be tested appear below: H0: π ≤ PG HA: π > PG Where π is the prim ary patency at 12 months in the study population and PG is the performance goal, which is calculated as follows. An extensive and independent review of the available literature produced references on venous stenting in similar patient populations. These da ta are derived from published studies of venous stenting which measured target vessel patency as an endpoint. In order to estimate the expected rate of primary patency in the study population at 12 months, the review of the available literature was used (see Appendix A Scientific Literature Search ). Based on the literature, the weighted mean expected primary patency was 85 .7%. By subtracting a margin of indifference of 10% from expected performance (85 .7% - 10% = 75 .7%); consequently, the value of 75% is therefore taken as the performance goal for the current study. For analysis of the imaging component of primary patency, if a subject has both a valid venogram and DUS during the 12 -month follow -up period then the venogram will be used . If no venogram is available, then the DUS will be used."
82,page_82,"056-F275, Clinical Investigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 CIP: ABRE Study Medtronic Confidential Page 83 of 152 CIP Identifier: APV – ABRE Version 2.0: 02/MAR /2021 14.1.2 Performance Goal: Primary Safety Endpoint The study’s primary safety endpoint is defined as a composite of all -cause death occurring post -procedure, clinically significant (i.e. symptomatic, confirm ed by CT pulmonary angiography ) pulmonary embolism, major bleeding complication (procedural) , stent -migration and stent thrombosis confirmed by imaging as assessed by core laboratory within 3 0 days of the index procedure. The review of the literature that provided results on these endpoints suggests an expected rate of 5. 6% (see Appendix A Scientific Literature Search ). It should be noted that considerably less data, compared to primary patency, was found for the componen ts of this composite endpoint. Therefore, due to the greater uncertainty, a relativel y larger margin of indifference was used of 6.8% giving a performance goal of 12.5%. Formally, the null and alternative hypoth eses to be tested appear below: H0: P ≥ PG HA: P < PG where P is the primary safety endpoint at 30 days in the study population an d PG is the performance goal. 14.2 Sample Size Calculation Primary Effectiveness: Using the assumptions above on the performance goal and anticipated outcome, we assume desired power of at least 92% under difference testing relative to the performance goal at a one-sided alpha of 0.025. The resulting evaluable sample size required is then 1 60 subjects using exact binomial test for a single proportion . Accounting for attrition during follow -up, the s ample size is augmented by 20% to 200 subjects. Every effort will be made, however, to minimize loss to follow -up. Primary Safety: Using the assumptions above on the performance goal and anticipated outcome, we assume desired power of at least 92% under d ifference testing relative to the performance goal at a one - sided alpha of 0.025. The resulting evaluable sample size required is then 1 93 subjects using exact binomial test for a single proportion . Accounting for attrition during follow -up, the sampl e size is augmented by 3.5% to 200 subjects. Every effort will be made, however, to minimize loss to follow -up. In summary, the overall power of the study is at least 8 4% while the effectiveness and safety performance goals are as follows: Table 15: Effective ness and safety performance goals Endpoints PGs Primary Patency at 12 months 75% MAE at 30 days 12.5%"

In general, all analyses will be performed using all evaluable subjects for primary effectiveness and safety analyses (evaluabl e subject definitions provided below). The PMA primary analysis will occur when all 12 -month follow -up data have been collected. For the primary effectiveness endpoint, subjects will be included in the primary analysis when : a) the subject experiences at least one clinically -driven target lesion revascularization within 390 days; or b) the subject has occlusion or restenosis ≥50% of the stented segment of the target lesion confirmed by core laboratory at 12 months visit; or c) the su bject has at least 330 days follow up without an event in the primary effectiveness endpoint. For the primary safety endpoint, subjects will be included in the primary analysis when : a) the subject experiences at least one of the primary safety composite ev ents within 30 days; or b) stent -migration and stent thrombosis confirmed by imaging as assessed by core laboratory at 30 - day visit; or c) the subject has at least 23 days of clinical follow up without an event in the primary safety endpoint. Secondary analys es for primary safety en dpoint will be conducted on all implanted subjects in whom the denominator for the primary safety endpoint will be the number of implanted subjects who had sufficient follow up (at least 23 days for 30-day visit) plus any subjects who had an event prior to the 30-Day Follow - Up visit. One interim analysis will be performed on safety for the DSMB. The interim analysis is planned when 30 - day follow -up data have been obtained on 30 subjects. The interim analysis does not permit early stopping for effectiveness and therefore no alpha -spending or other adjustment to the study’s statistical hypotheses is required. The DSMB C harter may specify additional safety analyses. Additional exploratory analyses of the data may be conducted as deemed appropriate. 14.4 Statistical Method 14.4.1 ABRE Pivotal Study Phase The primary patency rate is calculated as the number of subjects without loss of primary patency divided by the number of subjects having evaluable primary endpoint data for primary patency rate at 12 months. The 12 -month patency rate and lower limit of the 97.5% one -sided confidenc e interval will be reported. The primary effectiveness objective will be considered to be met if the lower limit of the 97.5% one -sided confidence interval of the 12 -month patency rate is above 75%. For analysis of the imaging component of primary patency, if a subject has both a valid venogram and DUS during the 12 -month follow -up period then the venogram will be used. If no venogram is available, then the DUS will be used. The primary safety failure rate is calculated as the number of subjects who had an event prior to the milestone visit divided by the number of evaluable subjects who had sufficient follow up (at least 23 days for 30 -day visit) plus any subjects who had an event prior to the milestone visit."

The primary safety objective will be considered to be met if the exact one -sided 97.5% UCL is below 12.5%. 14.4.2 ABRE Post-Approval Study Phase The primary effectiveness endpoint of the post -approval study phase is Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) through 36 months , defined as a ny re -intervention of the stented segment of the target lesion. Target limb revascularizat ions are adjudicated by the CEC to determine TLR status in addition to assessing related ness and clinically driven status . Time -to-event analysis will be performed for the TLR rate through 36 months (1080 days) , subject s with no TLR will be censored at the last contact date. Kaplan -Meier estimate and the 95% confidence interval for the freedom from TLR rate through 36 months will be repor ted. 14.5 Study Success Criteria The study success criteria set at the start of the study were as follows: t he study will be considered a success if both the primary endpoints meet their respective performance goals. For the effectiveness endpoint this translates into observing a one-sided 97.5% lower confidence limit (LCL) of the point estimate above 75% and for the safety endpoint it means observing a one -sided 97.5% upper confidence limit (UCL) below 12.5%. The ABR E post-approval s tudy phase has no pre -specified hypothesis testing or study success criteria. All analyses will be presented with descriptive statistic s. 14.6 Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data For those subjects not evaluable for primary effectiveness endpoint, multiple imputations will be carried out using the logistic regression approach for a dichotomous outcome using PROC MI in SAS for patients not experiencing t he event and not having endpo int data for at least 330 days of follow -up. The following variables will be included in the imputation model as covariates: • Age • Gender • Race • Ethnicity • Diabetes • Total occlusion • Venous disease category • Villalta score at baseline • CEAP score at baseline • VCSS class at baseline • Reference vessel diameter • Lesion length If there are relatively few missing data points (e.g., <10%) for a given variable, a simple gender -specific imputation using the mean (for continuous variables) or median (for dichotomous or categorical variables) of the non -missing values will be done. If there are >10% missing data points , the variable will be excluded from the imputation analysis. Five data sets will be imputed from these covariates and will mimic different realizations of the missing data. For the endpoint, the numerator (the numerator is the point estimate of the treatment for the effectiveness endpoint) and its relevant standard error (the pooled standard error of"
85,page_85,"056-F275, Clinical Investigation Plan Template, Version 2.0 CIP: ABRE Study Medtronic Confidential Page 86 of 152 CIP Identifier: APV – ABRE Version 2.0: 02/MAR /2021 treatment for the effectiveness endpoint) w ill be pooled across the 5 data sets using established variance - adjustment methods (e.g., via PROC MIANALYZE in SAS) to create one overall numerator and denominator. The lower bound of the 97.5% pooled CI will be co mpared to the effectiveness PG. The Tippi ng Point method will be adopted to further evaluate study primary objectives by assessing the impact of missing or unknown outcome data on study results. Tipping point analysis results for both primary effectiveness endpoint and primary safety endpoint wil l be reported. 14.7 Assessment of Data Pooling Poolability of data across clinical study sites is justified on a clinical basis (i.e. all study sites use the same protocol) . The sponsor monitors the site for protocol compliance, and the data gathering instrum ents are identical. The Food and Drug Administration also requires a statistical assessment of poolability. Poolability is assessed by comparing the baseline characteristics across study sites. For categorical baseline variables such as gender , a generaliz ed Fisher’s exact test or equivalent test will be used and for quantitative variables, parametric or non -parametric analysis of variance (general linear models or an equivalent procedure) will be used. The above statistical analyses do not result in an im pediment to pooling, but rather assess the balance of baseline covariates across study sites. If any baseline covariate is found to be statistically significant by this process, multivariate analyses will be done to determine if the imbalance affected stud y outcome. This is done by using both the variable found out of balance and study site as possible covariates. It may be necessary to combine two or more low enrolling study sites into pseudo -sites to allow these analyses. Sites with fewer than 6 subject s will be ranked by enrollment from low to high. Starting from the lowest enroll ing site, sites will be combined into a pseudo site until the combined size reaches the median enrollment among all sites. This process will be repeated until all resulting sit es have enrollment equal to or greater than 6 subjects. This will be done in a manner to preserve the structure of the study and prevent bias. Because the ABRE Study is being conducted in the US and outside the US (OUS), an analysis will be undertaken to d etermine if the study sites within the US and OUS subsets are homogeneous in the baseline covariates. Similar analyses will be conducted on gender. The statistical tests used will be the same as those discussed for site poolability. Baseline characteristic s to be considered as possible covariates are as following:"

If there are >10% missing data points , the variable will be excluded from the imputation analysis. Poolability analysis will also be performed on the primary endpoints comparing across sites and geographical regions after adjusting for covariates difference. Logistic regression model will be utilized to include unbalanced covariates and site as an independent variable, and the study outcome as dependent variable to assess outcome difference. If the p -value of site effect is less than 0.10, further analyses will be undertaken to investigate the inbalance of the study outcome. 14.8 Minimizing Bias Medtronic shall avoid improper influence on, or inducement of, the subject, monitor, any investigator(s) or other parties participating in, or contributing to, the clinical study . Selection of subjects, treatment of subjects and evaluation of study data are potent ial sources of bias. Methods incorporated in the study design to minimize potential bias include (but are not limited to): • For sites that are participating in other endovenous stent studies , which may have similar I/E criteria as the ABRE Study , a written process for avoiding selection bias is required . • Subjects will be screened to confirm study eligibility with defined inclusion/exclus ion criteria prior to inclusion . Sites are required to maintain a log of all subjects screened and enrolled for the study . • Demographics (including race and ethnicity data) and medical history will be collected at baseline in order to later assess possible characteristics that may influence endpoints . • Data collection requirements and study procedures wi ll be standardized across all geographies . • All geographies will follow the same version of the CIP and eCRFs . • No more than 20% of expected inclusions may come from a single site . • All study investigators will be required to meet the requirements of 21 CFR P art 54, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators ."

Study data collected will be monitored and verified against source documents in accordance wi th ISO14155: 2020 guidelines and international standards. Any data discrepancies will be addressed through queries posted within the EDC system. 16.8 Direct Access to Source Data/Documents Medtronic may conduct audits at participating clinical sites. The purpose of an audit is to verify the performance of the monitoring process and the study conduct, independently of the personnel directly involved in the study . Regulatory bodies, such as th e Food and Drug Administration, may also perform inspections at participating sites. The investigator and/or institution shall permit Medtronic and regulatory bodies direct access to source data and documents during monitoring, audits and inspections . 16.9 Conf identiality All information and data sent to parties involved in study conduct concerning subjects or their participation in this study will be considered confidential. Study sites will assign a unique subject ID number (SID) to each subject. Records of th e subject/SID relationship will be maintained by the study site. The SID number is to be recorded on all study documents to link them to the subject’s medical records at the site. Confidentiality of data will be observed by all parties involved at all ti mes throughout the clinical investigation. All data shall be secured against unauthorized access. The privacy of each subject and confidentiality of his/her information shall be preserved in reports and when publishing any data. In the US, “Protected Healt h Information” (PHI) will be maintained in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). To maintain confidentiality, the subject’s name or any other PHI should not be recorded on any study document other than the informed consent form. This scenario will be covered in the Patient Information -Informed Consent Form. In the event a subject’s name/PHI is included for any reason, it will be blinded as applicable. In the event of inability to blind the identification (e .g., digital media), it will be handled in a confidential manner by the authorized personnel. Data relating to the study might be made available to third parties (for example in case of an audit performed by regulatory authorities), provided the data are t reated as confidential and that the subject’s privacy is guaranteed. No identifiable subject information will be published. 16.10 CIP Amendments Any revisions or amendments to the CIP or Informed Consent document, along with a statement of justification for the changes, will be submitted to all affected Regulatory Authorities (FDA, C ompetent Authority ) and governing Ethics Boards, according to applicable regulations.

Pre-clinical testings met the defined acceptance criteria in -line with applicable I nternational standards, thereby demonstrating specifications and all acceptance criteria set for the devices. The Report of Prior Investigations requirements will be available in the Investigato r’s Brochure separate from this CIP. Risk management activities f or the A bre stent system assessed the risk associated with the design, process, and clinical use of the proposed device. It was concluded that any risks identified as part of this activity are considered acceptable by the Medtronic Risk Management Team whe n weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety. Based on the assessment of the performance of Abre stent; including the state of the art for endovenous stenting, the benefits of the use of this stent outweigh the associated overall residual risk and confirm the conclusion of the risk assessment that the residual risk associated with the Medtronic Abre stent is deemed to be acceptable. The use of human subjects is required as part of an IDE clinical study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the use of device in humans which includes evaluations that cann ot be made using bench testing. The results from the clinical evaluation and the need for an IDE clinical study evalua ting safety and effectiveness of the Abre system use in humans, justifies the conduct of the ABRE Study ."

When the presentation is that of acute deep venous thro mbosis (DVT), swelling and pain predominate. By contrast, when the process is chronic the symptoms include skin and subcutaneous tissue changes that can progress to ulceration. The latter pattern of symptoms comprises the post -thrombotic syndrome. Even tod ay, most patients presenting with acute iliofemoral DVT are treated with anticoagulation alone.1-3 Patients with post -thrombotic symptoms are often followed with non -interventional management consisting of compression hose and elevation of the extremity. Pharmacologic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy have been used to restore venous patency in the setting of acute DVT, and venous stenting has emerged as a useful intervention to address the underlying venous stenosis in such patients. As well, venous stenting has been employed successfully as a primary intervention in patients presenting with sym ptomatic chronic iliofemoral venous occlusion or non - thrombotic stenosis. Despite the increasing use of stents in the venous circulation, most studies have employed stents originally designed for arteries or for biliary indications. For this reason, most p ublications comprise single -center retrospective series. Prospective, protocol -driven, monitored studies with core laboratory analyses of imaging studies are rare. This observation must be taken into account when assessing the frequency of clinical events ; with the possibility of underreporting due to the retrospective nature of data collection. The objective of this literature search is to provide an up -to-date review of published data on the safety and effectiveness of stenting for iliac and iliofemoral venous disease.g Currently, no device is approved for the iliac vein indication in the United States, although several are CE marked and available outside the US. This literature search will evaluate the body of existing literature on the use of predicate stents used in the iliofemoral venous segment, and will include data on stents irrespective of whether or not they were cleared or approved for marketing at the time of the study or thereafter. Currently, there are several societal guideline documents on the standard of care for the treatment of iliofemoral venous lesions. Most of these are heavily weighted toward the treatment of acute DVT. A guideline document published by the American College of Phlebology in October 20154 supplements a 2014 clinical practice guidelines document from the Society of Vascul ar Surgery and the American Venous Forum for the management of venous leg ulcers,5 and other earlier societal guideline documents.6-8 While many of the guideline docume nts are focused on the management of acute thrombotic venous obstruction, some caveats regarding venous stenting have been included. As well, several review articles have been published, some recently, providing some insight to current practice in the field.9-15 For the most part, the guideline documents and review articles are based upon data from original research publications. This Scientific Literature Review is limited to a review of these original publications and the data incorporated therein. g For the purposes of this review, the iliac venous segment is defined as the common iliac vein (CIV) and external iliac vein (EIV), and includes treatment of the most caudal inferior vena cava with a stent to obtain complete coverage of a central common iliac vein lesio n. It does not include treatment of isolated IVC lesions or extension of CIV lesions beyon d the first few millimeters into the IVC. The iliofemoral venous segment is defined as the iliac venous segment and the common femoral vein, but does not include disease progressing into the profunda f emoral vein or the femoral vein."

The effectiveness of the devices will be characterized by the patency rates; primary, primary -assisted and secondary, when available. • Safety and effectiveness data will be limited to one -year follow -up in most cases, noting the paucity of longer - term follow -up data in published st udies. • Performance with respect to symptom resolution and Quality of Life (QoL) is covered in this document to the extent that the original publications included standard measures of symptomatic improvement and QoL. A minority of publications include data on baseline and post -procedure assessment of QoL indices and the number of indices accounts for a relatively small number of publications with outcome on any one index. b) As a secondary objective of the review, outcome data will be characterized by the pr esenting clinical scenario; acute, post -thrombotic, or non -thrombotic.h Therapeutic outcome may vary considerably in these different categories of presentation, so where possible, evaluations will be subcategorized by presentation. c) Secondary objectives include the analysis of the natural history of iliac and iliofemoral venous segment disease left untreated or managed medically without the use of balloon angioplasty or implanted devices. While the outcome after medical management of iliofemoral venous o bstruction is included in this literature review, acute cases are over -weighted, with a paucity of data on the non -interventional treatment of chronic iliofemoral venous disease. Review of Literature Search Results This literature review included peer revi ewed publications identified by the web -based search strategy with the National Library of Medicine National Center for Biotechnology Information PubMed resource through a search date of October 1, 2016 ( Figure 1). Figure 1. Search strategy h For the purposes of this review, the acute subset will be defined when intraluminal thrombus is present and symptoms are of ≤30 days in duration. The post -thrombotic subset includes those patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis in the iliofemoral segment or those w here intraluminal thrombotic obstruction is observed on imaging studies with symptoms beginning >30 days prior to presentation. Th e non -thrombotic subset includes those patients without evidence of intraluminal thrombus. The most common presentation in thi s group is left central common iliac vein stenosis from the May -Thurner syndrome."

The exception comprised a non -indexed abstract presented at a scientific meeting but where no manuscript has been published.16 The search criteria included the following high -level characteristics: a) Citations where any field contained the phrase “venous stent” or “vein stent”. b) Citations where any field contained the word “iliac” or “femoral”. c) Citations with the word “endovascular” in the title were excluded.i d) Human clinical studies; animal and in vitro studies were excluded. e) Studies with a sample size of less than ten (10) patients with attempted stenting of the iliofemoral venous segmentj were excluded. f) Studies where outcome could not be subcategorized by stented versus non -stented patients were not included. g) Review articles were not included. h) When two or more publications reported outcome from the same patients, only the latest (or in some cases the most complete) article was included. i) Non-English publications were excluded. The search was repeated twi ce; once for citations where any field contained the word “iliac” and once for citations containing the word “femoral”. Duplications in these two datasets were removed thereafter, since many citations contained the words iliac and femoral. Once a list of r eferences meeting the search criteria was identified, each full - length article was obtained. The publications were reviewed; excluding those where stented and non -stented patients were studied but outcome was not stratified by the stented versus non -stente d cohorts. In aggregate, the search and selection process was conducted to include all relevant scientific literature, both favorable and unfavorable with respect to iliofemoral venous stenting. The search strategy results are listed in Table I . The search strategies yielded 635 citations; 323 iliac and 312 femoral. Among these, however, there were many duplicates that were identified in the iliac and the femoral searches (search step 3 in Table I ). After exclusion of the 132 duplicates, 503 abstracts remai ned. Next, the text of each of the 503 abstracts were manually reviewed. A total of 218 of 503 abstracts were excluded based on the text of the abstract alone, leaving 285 full publications where review was necessary. After review of each full article, 22 3 were excluded, based upon the reasons listed in Table III ). This process left a total of 62 publications appropriate for the iliofemoral venous stenting literature review. As an added measure to identify pertinent publications, a review of the Cochrane L ibrary was performed (search step 14 in Table I ). Two searches were performed; one for “venous stent” and one for “vein stent.” A total of 140 and 261 citations were returned, respectively. The titles and/or abstracts of these citations were manually revie wed and 16 potential articles were identified. After review of these 16 articles, one article, a study performed in China, was found to be relevant. This study was included in the literature review, raising the total number of articles on iliofemoral venou s stenting to 63. An additional search of publications on patients with medically -managed iliofemoral venous obstruction was also performed. A total of 9 suitable articles were found; 6 of which comprised publications with stented versus non - stented treat ment arms and were already included in the main literature search outlined above. The publications on medical management of iliofemoral obstruction are reviewed separately in this document. Including the 3 additional articles on medical management alone. I n sum, a total of 66 articles comprised the full literature search. i A preliminary review found approximately 100 citations with the word endovascular in the title and almost all were on the top ic of endovascular aneurysm repair. The few tha t were relevant to iliofemoral venous stenting were added back into the search cohort in the manual addition step. j The iliofemoral venous segment is defined as the common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral veins. Patients with stent placement limi ted to the femoral vein or other veins peripheral to the common femoral vein were excluded from the review. Publications were excluded when iliofemoral and more peripheral stenting was studied but where outcome could not be stratified to estimate results s pecific to the iliofemoral venous segment."

Few prospective studies have been performed, and randomized clinical trials are non - existent. The preponderance of retrospective studies accounts for a less robust level of evidence than is characteristic of prospective, protocol -based trials. Further complicating the issue, mos t publications report results from a diverse patient population and do not stratify outcome by category of presentation. For the purposes of analysis, it has been common to group patients by the presenting clinical category for the procedure. In this regar d, patients undergoing iliofemoral venous stenting can be grouped into the following three categories; acute, post -thrombotic, and non -thrombotic. a) Acute. This category comprises patients presenting with acute iliofemoral DVT. For the purposes of this review, acute has been defined as venous thrombus that has formed within 30 days of treatment. Since it is often impossible to determine the exact timing of the process, acute is defined as the onset of symptoms ≤30 days before treatment, or, in the absence of data on the onset of symptoms, the appearance of acute thrombus on imaging studies has been used as a surrogate.k In general, patients presenting with acute DVT were treated with thrombus management technologies such as catheter - directed, intravenous thrombolysis, percutaneous or mechanical or open surgical thrombectomy, followed by deployment of venous stents to address the stenosis unmasked after thrombus removal. b) Post-thrombotic. The post -thrombotic category comprises those patients who have experienced a thrombotic occlusion of the iliofemoral venous segment but present >30 days after occurrence. In general, such patients present months or years after the DVT which, in many cases, may have gone unnoticed by the patient . Such patients generally have an abundance of collateralization around the occlusion and thrombus, when it remains, is often well -organized and resistant to pharmacologic or mechanical thrombectomy. Patients presenting with post -thrombotic iliofemoral ven ous occlusion are most often treated with recanalization and stenting alone, without the use of pre -stenting thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Many post -thrombotic patients have an underlying left common iliac vein stenosis (May - Thurner Syndrome) that has gone on to thrombosis, which then propagates to the hypogastric vein orifice, the external iliac vein and/or the common femoral vein. c) Non-thrombotic. The non -thrombotic category is defined by imaging findings. These patients have a stenosis in the iliofemoral venous segment, usually but not always at the central aspect of the left common iliac vein (May -Thurner Syndro me). This category can be difficult to define with precision, since a significant percentage of the population has a mild to moderate stenosis at the central left common iliac vein. Where inclusion/exclusion criteria of a prospective trial may be able to differentiate symptomatic stenosis from asymptomatic stenosis , retrospective case series without well -defined criteria may include treated patients who may have had lower extremity symptoms from an alternate etiology. k The appearance of intraluminal thrombus on duplex ultrasound, venography, CTV and other imaging studies has not been well -defined. While findings such as an enlarged, occluded vein and an absence of an abundant collateral network are suggestive of an acut e process, the literature review could not apply strict criteria to the determination of acute DVT. For this reason, the categorization of the authors was utilized, without modification."

Publications were also categorized by treatment; stented, balloon angioplast y alone, or medical management. Publications that described open surgical thrombectomy with stenting of unmasked lesions were not included in this analysis. l The 6 groups have overlap; some articles report data on more than o ne indication. Where outcome was stratified by indication, the article is included more than once, with data reported separately for each indication. Where results are not segregated, however, data i s reported from the article as a whole (Groups 2 and 3). m The number of stent series is 68, comprising 63 unique stent articles among which four articles reported results from more th an a single indication. For example, an article that separately reported outcome of stented patients with a) non -thrombotic and b ) post -thrombotic chronic venous obstruction would appear as one article with two series; reported within Groups 4 and 5, respectively. Among the 63 ar ticles, three articles separately reported data from 2 indications (series) and one article separately re ported data from 3 indications – for a total of 68 (63 + 5) total stent series. These numbers do not include series from medically -managed, non -stented patients. In all, there were nine articles that reported data on medically -managed patients. Among these , six articles also separately reported data on stented patients and three reported data on medically - managed patients alone. Therefore, including medically -managed articles/series, the total number of articles in the literature review is 66 (66 + 3) and t he total number of series is 77 (68 + 9)."

In addition 9 publications described the outcome of iliofemoral venous obstru ction when treated without intervention; generally with anticoagulation alone. The series that comprised patients followed with medical management alone are reported separately. Study Design Most publications were single -center, retrospective, non -randomiz ed series ( Table V ). Articles were published between 1996 and 2016 with treatment dates between 1987 and 2014.

The symptoms may be acute (<30 days in duration) or chronic. When chronic, the process can be one of occlusion occurring after a silent or asymptomatic iliofemoral DVT (post -thrombotic group) or stenosis in the absence of prior DVT (non -thrombotic group). Many publications did not subgroup outcome by clinic al category. Mixed categories were created to account for such publications. Where a single publication encompassed more than one category but where outcome was grouped, the publication is listed separately in the row for each category. A summary of the fr equency of each category of clinical presentation is included in Table VI . There were many more publications on stenting for acute presentations than for the other categories, although these series were characteristically smaller in size. This accounted fo r a smaller proportion of data on the acute category with respect to patients or limbs. The fewest number of publications were in the non -thrombotic category, although these series were larger, with the greatest average patients/study and limbs/study. 14 Stent series alone; medical management is reported separately. A single publication may contain more than one series if diffe rent cohorts (e.g. acute and post -thrombotic cases) are reported separately."

Most commonly, the Clinical, Etiologic, Anatomic, and Pathologic (CEAP) categories were reported.78 The CEAP classification was introduced to simplify and standardize the reporting for chronic venous disease. The CEAP definitions were revised in 2004 by a committee of the American Venous Forum. While CEAP is the most frequ ently reported venous index, both pre - and post -intervention, it does not include subjective complaints and has been criticized as a good index for longitudinal follow -up.79 Mean CEAP were reported in some studies and where it was not, the mean CEAP was calculated by a weighted average of the number of limbs in each category. In general, studies were performed for symptomatic limbs with CEAP 2 or greater. The mean baseline CEAP was 3.8 in the studies where it was reported. Table VIII.

Patients were followed for a mean of 24 months after the procedure. Duplex ultrasound was the most frequent imaging modality, although many studies used venography when the duplex study was abnormal and some more recent studies employed computed tomographic venography. Post -procedure anticoagulation varied by the clinical category (indication) for the stent placement, but warfarin was most commonly used; for at least 6 months after stent implantation. 17 Chronic includes both post -thrombotic and non -thrombotic."

Safety Outcomes Adverse events were generally tabulated as periprocedural (≤30 days) or later. This review focused on those events that occurred within 30 days of the index procedure. The following occurrences were tabulated: periprocedural (≤30 day) death, major hemorrhage (using the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium, or BARC definition; Types 3a or greater80), clinically -evident pulmonary embolism, and access site complications (wound hematoma, false aneurysm and arteriovenous fistula). The findings suggested that peri procedural death and pulmonary embolism were exceedingly uncommon in the patient populations studied; each occurring in fewer than 1% of patients treated ( Table X and Table XI). The most common events were wound hematoma, stent thrombosis, and stent dislod gement/migration. Major hemorrhagic complications (BARC Type 3a or greater) occurred in approximately 1.1% of patients. It was often impossible to determine whether major hemorrhagic complications occurred as a result of pharmacologic thrombolytic therapy in those series in which it was employed, accounting for a higher frequency of hemorrhagic complications in series that included patients with acute venous thromboses. Similar findings were evident for wound hematomas. Early (<30 day) stent thrombosis was more common in post -thrombotic cases (4.9%) and was rare in non -thrombotic cases (0.2%). In this literature review, loss of stent patency within 30 days was synonymous with stent thrombosis; no effort was made to differentiate different thrombosis from oth er causes of occlusion since few publications specified the etiology of the process. Stent migration (exclusive of dislodgement19) occurred more often in acute (2.4%) and non -thrombotic cases (2.0%) compared with the other groups (0.8%), possibly related t o the absence of chronic stenotic disease in these cohorts; where chronic stenoses may have protective effects on the 18 Percentages refer to the number of series that reported use of a particular stent. Perc entages add to more than 100 since many series used more than a single type of stent. 19 Dislodgement is defined as stent displacement from the initial deployment site due to catheter/wire/balloon manipulations at the index procedure."

Neither stent migration or stent dislodgement was reported in any of the post - thrombotic cases. Adverse occurrences beyond 30 days were also tabulated and included Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR), stent fracture and stent migration. TLR occurred in 8.3% of patients overall through 12 months, and appeared most common in post -thrombotic cases (13.1%). Stent fracture was reported in 1.4% of patients. Stent dislodgement and stent migration were observed in 0.6% and 1.6% of cases, respectively (including migration beyond 30 days). Table X.

Technical success at the time of the index procedure was defined differently from study to study. In general, technical succe ss implied successful delivery and deployment of the stent at the intended location without significant residual stenosis. Primary patency was defined as the absence of occlusion or target lesion reintervention. Primary -assisted patency was defined as the absence of occlusion irrespective of whether TLR was performed. Secondary patency was defined when the target lesion was patent irrespective of reintervention, as long as patency was restored. Duplex ultrasound was the most common post -procedure imaging su rveillance modality utilized, but many studies also employed contrast venography in follow -up. Technical success at the index procedure was 95.8% and was highest in non -thrombotic cases (98.8%) and lowest in post -thrombotic cases (92.0%). The primary paten cy rate for venous stenting was 85.7% at one year ( Table XIII ). Reintervention was often successful when stent stenosis or occlusion occurred, with primary -assisted and secondary patency rates of 93.8% and 95.2%, respectively. Patency rates were highest in patients with non -thrombotic disease (12 -month primary patency 94.8%) and lowest in post - thrombotic patients (12 -month primary patency 80.5%). Table XIII.

The majority (64.9%) of patients in the medically -managed series were patients with acute iliofemoral venous thrombosis, and the process was on the left in 67.6%, right in 22.9% and bilateral in 9.5%. The follow -up averaged 23 months and, where specified in the publications, the primary treatment modality was heparin follow -up by long - term warfarin anticoagulation. The weighted primary patency rate was 47.1% at 1 year. Data from Publications on CE -Marked Stents for the Iliofemoral Venous Indication While there are no stents approved for the iliofemoral venous indication in the US, several are CE marked in Europe ( Table XV ). These include the Cook Zilver Vena, OptiMed sinus -Venous, Veniti Vici, and the Boston Scientific Wallstent, The Wallstent, while the most commonly employed stent for two decades, did not receive CE mark for the iliofemoral venous indication until 2015. It is not possible to parse data on the on -label venous stents from other, off -label venous stents for most of the publications evaluated in the scientific literature review. Authors rarely report results by type of stent. As well, to date (October 2016) t here have been no publications on the Veniti Vici stent and Bard Venovo stent . Noting these limitations, the outcome after on -label venous stenting is reported from a small subset of the articles reviewed and is limited to those reports that specify outcom e separately for one of the four CE -marked venous stents. CIVIQ -20 scores were reported in only one publication. Higher scor es mean better quality of life. The findings in the on -label venous stents are dominated by publications that used the Wallstent ( Table XVI). While this analysis is limited by the relatively small sample size in the on -label group, currently available data do not reveal marked differences between data from studies on CE marked stents compared to those that used other stents."

The average age at presentation was 52.7 years, although patients presented throughout all age ranges. Females presented more often than males; 63.5% versus 36.5%, r espectively. Treated lesions were more often on the left than the right; 70.0% vs. 20.4%. Bilateral lesions were treated in 9.6% of patients. At baseline, 65.2% of patients were within CEAP 3 or 4 categories; more mild symptomatology was found in 8.7% of c ases; 26.4% presented with a healed (C5, 7.5%) or active ulcerations (C6, 18.9%). The venous stenting procedure was quite safe. Major hemorrhage occurred in 1.1% of patients with access site hematomas in 3.6%. Other access site complications such as false aneurysms or arteriovenous fistulae were very rare as was pulmonary embolism or death within 30 days of the procedure; each occurring in 0.2% or fewer patients. When MAE were defined as the composite occurrence of major procedural bleeding (BARC Type 3a or greater80), all-cause mortali ty, stent thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or stent migration, 5.6% experienced an MAE within 30 days. Stent fracture was reported in 1.4% of patients, with stent dislodgement (at the index procedure) in 0.6% and stent migration (after the index procedure) i n 1.6%. Effectiveness as measured by patency rate was satisfactory. At 1 year, primary, primary -assisted and secondary patency rates were 85.7%, 93.8% and 95.2%, respectively. TLR at 12 months was 8.3%. There did not appear to be substantial differences in outcome between patients treated with off -label or CE-marked venous stents, but the relatively small sample for CE -marked stents precluded a robust analysis. In summary, iliofemoral venous stenting as reported in the literature appears to be associated wi th relatively few perioperative and longer -term complications, with a 30 -day MAE rate of 5.6% and a primary patency rate of 85.7% at one year."

Stent Fracture Classification: Determined by X -ray (assessed by core laboratory ): • Type 0 – No strut fractures • Type I – Single tine fracture • Type II – Multiple tine fractures • Type III – Stent fracture(s) with preserved alignment of the • components • Type IV – Stent fracture(s) with mal -alignment of the components • Type V – Stent fracture(s) in a trans -axial spiral configuration Stent migration Stent migration (as part of primary safety and secondary MAE endpoints): position change of a properly sized venous stent observed with an imaging modality, with displacement of the stent outside of the intended treatment segment after the conclusion of the index procedure, as determined with regard to a reference anatomic stru cture. Delayed stent migration (as part of secondary endpoint): position change of a venous stent observed with an imaging modality > 1 cm from its original location at the conclusion of the index procedure, as determined with regard to a reference anatomic structure. Stent migration occurs following the proper deployment of a venous stent after the index procedure (i.e. stent movement or dislodgement during the index procedure will not be noted as stent migration). Stent t hrombosis Occlusion of the stented venous segment occurring at any time following stent placement. Stent thrombosis may be diagnosed by Duplex Ultrasound. It needs to be confirmed by venogram or IVUS. Thrombosis A total occlusion due to thrombus formation as confirmed by sudden onset of symptoms and documented by DUS and venogram and/or IVUS at the target vessel.
