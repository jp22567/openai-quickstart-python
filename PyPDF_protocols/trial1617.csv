Continuous demographic parameters, such as the subject’s age at the time of enrollment, will be summarized for the ITT population using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 95% two- sided confidence limits) and compared between groups using a two- sample t -test. Categorical demographic parameters, such as gender, will be summarized as a proportion of the ITT population and compared using a two- tailed Fisher’s Exact test. Co -morbid risk factors will be summarized for the ITT population by intervention assignment and according to the type of variable (categorical, continuous) and compared between groups. Kaplan- Meier estimates for time- to-event analyses will be prepared based on the ITT population. Separate tables containing subject counts, percentages, and 95% binomial confidence limits will be prepared based on individual risk factors. The primary efficacy analysis population will be subjects in the ITT population who have any wound measurement data following randomization. For data analyses, complete wound closure requires confirmation at 3 weeks (≥ 21 days) post clinically apparent wound closure. The primary efficacy analysis will compare the proportion of subjects who achieve complete target ulcer closure within 12 weeks after the first study intervention using a random -effects generalized linear model specifying the distribution of the dependent variable as binomial. Statistical significance will be declared if the two- sided probability value is <0.05; tests for interaction will be performed at the 0.1 alpha level. Asymptotic confidence limits will be presented based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for differences in proportions. Exact confidence intervals will be used for all other presentations. For the secondary efficacy endpoints, the change in the wound size, measured in cm 2, will be calculated on an intra- subject basis for each post -baseline measurement. The mean change per week"
12,page_12,"Protocol # CR 2017- 006 V ersion 3.0 27 AUG 2019 ACell Confidential Page 12 of 59 will be calculated for each subject and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups using a random -effects generalized linear model specifying the distribution of the dependent variable as continuous. The time to complete wound closure will be calculated in days from the date of the initial study intervention and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups using a log -rank test. Subject s who fail to ac hieve complete wound closure will be censored using the last date of examination in the study. W ound recurrence after healing is complete at 26 weeks and 52 weeks will be tabulated by intervention group and the proportions will be compared between intervention and standard of care groups using a 2- tailed Fisher’s Exact test. Changes in subject reported outcomes will be summarized and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups based on the distribution of the data. A random - effects gene ralized linear model, specifying the distribution of the dependent variable based on the type of data, will be used to compare the results over time between the intervention and standard of care groups. All computations will be performed using SAS® (Version 9.4 or higher). Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA system dictionary. The percentage of subjects experiencing adverse events will be summarized by body system and preferred term. Subject counts will be tabulated for all adve rse events for the ITT population. Adverse events will also be tabulated for events that occurred following initial treatment application through final study visit. The incidence of subject s with 1 or more adverse events, and restricted to serious advers e events, will be summarized using counts and percentages.

In 2015, the American Diabetes Association estimated 30.3 million Americans , or 9.4% of the population, are affected by this disease, with the incidence expected to dramatically increase over the next 25 years[1,11]. There has been much success in treating diabetes , which has led to improvements in the life expectancy of those affected by the disease[3]. However, the increased prevalence coupled with the extended amount of time people live with the disease has led to an increase in the number of diabetes -related complications[3]. These subject s are at risk for a number of health problems, with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) being one of the most common and serious complications, affect ing roughly 15- 25% of diabetes subject s in their lifetime[4,5,12]. Diabetic foot ulcerations present as an open wound or sore and are commonly located on the bottom of the foot or lower extremities of people with diabetes . The most common contributing factors leading to the development of DFUs are ischemic, neuropathic, or combined neuroishcemic abnormalities, peripheral artery disease (PAD), foot deformity, and minor trauma [3,5,12] . However, when the ulcer appears, the progression is often exacerbated by other risk factors and comorbidities such as g ender, duration of diabetes longer than 10 years, advanced age of subject s, high Body Mass Index (BMI), retinopathy, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1 C), high plantar pressure, infections, and inappropriate foot self -care habits[12]. Regardless of etiology, DFUs require clinical treatment to prevent further progression of the ulcer and other sequelae that have the potential to result in severe and costly outcomes[8]. Due to the chronic nature of these wounds and the characteristically poor healing response, DFU(s) require extensive healing time and are a major source of morbidity and mortality in diabetes subjects , with a 3-year mortality rate of 28% and amputation rates 15 times higher than subject s without the disease [8,12]. These wounds are also a leading cause of hospitalization in diabetes subject s; it is estimated that 20% of hospitalizations for subject s with diabetes are due to complications associated with foot ulceration[8,12]. Aside from these complications, the development of DFUs can lead to physical and mental distress as well as productivity and financial losses that lower the quality of life of subjects[12]. The economic burden associated with people with diabetes is significant, with medical expenditures 2.3 times higher in subject s with diabetes compared to those without the"
16,page_16,"Protocol # CR 2017- 006 V ersion 3.0 27 AUG 2019 ACell Confidential Page 16 of 59 disease[6]. In 2012, the annual cost of diabetes was estimated to be $245 billion, which included health care expenditures and productivity loss es[8]. A substantial amount of these expenditures were related to managing comorbidities and chronic complications such as DFU and lower -extremity amputation[8]. The current Standard of Care (SOC) for DFU(s) as highlighted in the literature includes debridement, pressure offloading, moist wound therapies , and adequate education and nutritional support. The incidence of closure for DFUs treated with SOC alone has been reported to be between 20- 38%[9,10,13] . Thus, w ith the prevalence of diabetes and diabetes -related complications on the rise, there is a need for an intervention that has the ability to increase the incid ence of DFU healing . Such an intervention may provide a cost -effective means of decreasing morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life for subject s who suffer from diabetic foot ulceration(s). This clinical investigation will assess the efficacy of Cytal® Wound Matrix 1 -Layer as a potential therapy for the management of chronic, non- healing DFUs compared to SOC over a 12 week period. 2.2 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 2.2.1 POTENTIAL RISKS Cytal® Wound Matrix 1 -Layer Complications and reactions are possible with any soft tissue repair, including but not limited to: infection, increased chronic inflammation, allergic reaction, unexplained fever or chills, excessive redness, pain, or swelling. 2.2.2 POTENTIAL BENEFITS Cytal® Wound Matrix 1 -Layer Cytal® Wound Matrix 1- Layer is constructed of a naturally -occurring biomaterial designed to manage wounds. The devices may be cut to size and must be hydrated prior to placement by immersion in room temperature sterile saline. The biomaterial is a resorb able extracellular matrix scaffold containing basement membrane which facilitates constructive remodeling of host tissue by integration."

The following is a list of possible reasons for study and/or intervention discontinuation (including but not limited to) : • Screen Failure/Subject does not continue to meet eligibility • Subject withdrawal of consent • Subject is not compliant with study procedures • Adverse Event that in the opinion of the Investigator would be in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study participation and/or study intervention • Protocol deviation • Lost to follow -up • Sponsor request for early termination of study • Subject death All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. Reasonable attempts will be made by the Investigator to provide a reason for subject withdrawals. The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source documents and the Case Report Form (CRF). If a subject is withdrawn from intervention due to an AE, the subject will be followed and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has resolved or stabilized. The Investigator (study st aff) must make every effort to contact subjects who are lost to follow -up. Three (3) attempted contacts should be documented by research personnel prior to consider ing the subject lost to follow -up. Attempts to contact such subjects must be documented in the subject s’ records (e.g. dates of attempted telephone contact). 5.4.2 HANDLING OF PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWALS OR TERMINATION Although subjects may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, (or may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion), subject withdrawal should be avoided as much as reasonably possible. In any case, appropriate follow -up for endpoints sho uld be continued. The reason for study discontinuation will be recorded on the subject’s source document and CRF."

Once the subject is seen, he/she is to return to his/her original weekly visit schedule (window +/ - 2 days). For example: • If a subject was seen regularly on Mondays but missed a scheduled Monday visit and came in on Wednesday, he/she should return the next Monday to maintain his/her weekly Monday Visit. • If the same subject was not able to come in until Friday, the subject would still come in the next Monday to maintain the weekly schedule. 7.1.7 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS/OUTCOME MEASUREMEN TS Wagner Ulcer Classification System GRADE LESION 0 No open lesions; may have deformity or cellulitis 1 Superficial diabetic ulcer (partial or full thickness) 2 Ulcer extension to ligament, tendon, joint capsule, or deep fascia without abscess or osteomyelitis 3 Deep ulcer with abscess, osteomyelitis, or joint sepsis 4 Gangrene localized to portion of for efoot or heel 5 Extensive gangrenous involvement of the entire foot The SF-20® Health Survey ( SF-20) The SF-20 is a 20- item questionnaire used to assess generic health outcomes from the subject ’s perspective.

The SF-20 consists of a subset of 20 items from the SF -36® Health Survey (SF -36), covering the same eight domains of health outcomes, including physical functioning, role functioning, mental health, current health perceptions, and pain. Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale - Short Form (DFS -SF) The DFS -SF is a 29- item questionnaire is a specific instrument designed to assess the impact of diabetic foot ulcers and their intervention on quality of life in people with diabetes. The short form is based on the original Diabetic Foot Ulcer Scale; this questionnaire reduces the burden of a lengthy survey on subject s and has been shown to have good internal consistency, reliability, construct validity, and demonstrated sensitivity to ulcer healing 14. Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS) The visual analogue scale or visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in patient -based outcome questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly/objectively measured. The VAS is anchored by two verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme measured from the zero mark, indicating “no pain” (score of 0) to the mark of 10 on the 10- cm line, indicating “pain as bad as it could be” or “worst imaginable pain.” Respondent s are asked to report current pain intensity or pain intensity in the last 24 hours. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by placing a vertical line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that repre sents their pain intensity. After the patient has marked, using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10- cm line between the “no pain” anchor and the patient’s mark. Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (KATZ ADL) The Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living, formerly referred to as the Katz Activities of Daily Living Scale 15, is a validated measure used to quantify independence in activities of daily living . These activities include bathing, dressing, toileting, transfers, feeding, and continence. The Katz ADL is a 6- item questionnaire where each item is dichotomized as either having a score of zero (i.e. dependence) or one (i.e. independence). A score of 2 or less indicates a dependent subject, 3- 5 for partially dependent and 6 for independent. ARANZ Medical Silhouette"

Concomitant medications that will be documented in the subject’s source documents and CRFs at all of the intervention and follow -up visits as well as recorded on the Medications Log include but not limited to : pain medication use relating the DFU(s), any anti-hypertensives, medications or supplements to control diabetes, nutritional supplements, and antibiotics, if applicable. 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 8.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 8.1.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS (AE) Adverse Event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention- related. Adverse events of interest under this protocol are those to be considered related to diabetes or the DFU . They include but are not limited to: • Infection • Increased chronic inflammation • Allergic reaction • Unexplained fever or chills • Excessive redness • Pain – excessive or exacerbated • Swelling - excessive or exacerbated"

All SAEs are required to be collected following randomization through the final study visit for this study. 8.1.3 DEFINITION OF UNANTI CIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFEC T (UADE )"
37,page_37,"Protocol # CR 2017- 006 V ersion 3.0 27 AUG 2019 ACell Confidential Page 37 of 59 Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the application; or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 8.2 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 8.2.1 SEVERITY OF EVENT The Investigator will be asked to assess the severity of the AE using the following categories: Mild: Events require minimal or no intervention and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities. Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. Severe: Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other intervention. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitat ing. 8.2.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y AGENT For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. Definitely: The relationship of the AE and the study device or the study procedure can definitely be established. Probably: While a clear relationship to the study device or to the study procedure cannot be established, the AE is associated with an expected AE or there is no other medical condition or intervention, which could explain the occurrence of such an event. Possibly: There is no clear relationship between the AE and the study device or study proce dure; however, one cannot definitely conclude that there is"
38,page_38,"Protocol # CR 2017- 006 V ersion 3.0 27 AUG 2019 ACell Confidential Page 38 of 59 no relationship. Unrelated: There is no relationship between the AE and the study device or study procedure. This may include but is not limited to the incident being an expected outcome of a previously existing or concurrent disease, concomitant medication or procedure the subject experienced. 8.2.3 EXPECTEDNESS The Investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study products. 8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQ UENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs (per Investigator discretion) that are deemed ‘Possibly’, ‘Probably’ or ‘Definitely’ related to the development or healing of the DFU(s) and those including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for an SAE, will be captured on the appropriate CRF. Information to be collected includes, but is not limited to, event description, date of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study products, and date of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time following initial treatment application through final study visit. At each study visit, the Investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 8.4 REPORTING PROCEDURES"
39,page_39,"Protocol # CR 2017- 006 V ersion 3.0 27 AUG 2019 ACell Confidential Page 39 of 59 8.4.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Adverse Events will be documented on the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF) as the Investigator learns of the event. All AEs, not serious in nature, will be reviewed by the Sponsor during scheduled Interim Monitoring Visits (IMVs). The Investigator will follow all AEs until adequate resolution is achieved or until AE returns to baseline status, at which point the AE would be considered resolved. The IRB should be notified of all AEs according to their notification policies. All AEs will be reported to ACell Quality Assurance and reported under the appropriate regulatory consideration. 8.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T (SAE) REPORTING In the case of a n SAE, the Investigator must immediately notify (within 1 working day of becoming aware of the event) the study Sponsor (contact information is provided in Section 1, Key Roles). The IRB must also be notified according to their notification policies. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the si te Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the appearance to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the study S ponsor and should be provided as soon as possible. The study Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor's initial receipt of the information. 8.4.3 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFEC T (UADE) REPORTING The study Investigator shall submit to the Sponsor and to the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the Investigator first learns of the effect. The Sponsor contact information is provided in Section 1, Key Roles . The study Sponsor is responsible for conducting an evaluation of an UADE and shall report the results of such evaluation to the FDA, all reviewing IRB (s) and Investigator (s) within 10 working days after the Sponsor first receives notice of the effect. This study is not being conducted under an IDE; therefore, Sponsor reporting timelines may differ from thos e defined above. 8.4.4 REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY If a female subject becomes pregnant during the trial, she must be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known."

A Clinical Monitoring Plan will describe in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS A Statistical analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and signed- off prior to the first subject being enrolled in the study. The SAP will include a comprehensive description of the statistical methods and analyses to be included in the final study report. Any change to the analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the analysis methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, will be described in the SAP. Tabulations of summary statistics, graphical presentations, and statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software version 9.4. The statistical analyses will be based on data pooled across subject and wound characteristics and presented in aggregate; a separate series of analyses will retain specific subject and wound characteristics found to be significant covariates in response. All subset summary tables and data listings will be sorted by subject . The pre- procedure observations will be used as the baseline value for calculating post -procedural changes from baseline. Statistical significance will be declared if the two- sided probability value is <0.05; tests for interaction will be performed at the 0.1 alpha level. Asymptotic confidence limits will be presented based on the normal approximation to the binomial distribution for differences in proportions. Exact confidence intervals will be used for all other presentations. All computations will be performed using SAS ® (Version 9.4 or higher)."

The safety population will be used for the safety analysis. Intention- to-Treat (ITT) Population - The ITT population will include all subjects in the Safety population with at least one post -baseline efficacy data point. The ITT population will be used for the primary efficacy analysis. Per Protocol (PP) Population - The PP population will consist of subjects in the ITT population who did not have major protocol violations. The review of protocol violations, which will be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), will be performed and signed off prior to study database lock. The primary efficacy analysis and the secondary analysis will be conducted on the PP population as part of a sensitivity analysis.

Continuous demographic parameters, such as the age of the subject at the time of enrollment, will be summarized for the ITT population using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 2- sided 95% confidence limits). Categorical demographic parameters, such as gender, will be summarized as a proportion of the ITT population using Clopper -Pearson 2- sided 95% confidence limits. Adverse events will be coded according to the MedDRA system dictionary. The percentage of subject s experiencing adverse events will be summarized by body system and preferred term. Subject counts will be tabulated for all adverse events for the ITT population. Adverse events will also be tabulated for events that occurred following initial treatment application through final study visit. Tabulated subject counts will be presented as a proportion of the ITT population with 95% binomial confidence intervals. 10.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S) The primary efficacy analysis population will be subjects in the ITT population who have any wound measurement data following randomization. For all statistical and data analyses, wound measurement data and confirmation of wound closure will be obtained from an independent wound core lab or cli nical assessor based on the photograph of the wound and the assessment of the investigator (closed vs. not closed). For data analyses, complete wound closure requires confirmation at 3 weeks (≥ 21 days) post clinically apparent wound closure. The date of complete wound closure for those that have confirmed closure will be the date that it was clinically apparent (up to and including 12 weeks post Randomization Day). The primary efficacy analysis will compare the proportion of subjects who achieve complete target ulcer closure within 12 weeks after the first study intervention using a random -effects generalized linear model specifying the distribution of the dependent variable as binomial. Results from this analysis are expected to approach the test statistic used to derive the sample size estimates. 10.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY AND TERTIARY ENDPOINT(S) For the secondary efficacy endpoints, the change in the wound size, measured in cm2, will be calculated on an intra- subject basis for each post -baseline measurement. The mean change per week will be calculated for each subject and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups using a random -effects generalized linear"

The time to complete wound closure will be calculated in days from the date of the initial study intervention and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups using a log -rank test. Subject s who fail to achieve complete wound closure will be censored using the last date of examination in the study. Wound recurrence after healing is complete at 26 weeks and 52 weeks will be tabulated by group and the proportions will be compared between intervention and standard of care groups using a 2- tailed Fisher’s exact test. The time to wound recurrence will also be compared between the intervention and standard of care groups. Changes in subject reported outcomes will be summarized and compared based on the distribution of the data. A random -effects generalized linear model, specifying the distribution of the dependent variable based on the type of data, will be used to compare the results over time between the intervention and standard of care groups. The incidence of adverse events related to DFU recorded during the course of the study will be totaled by intervention group and compared between randomized groups using a generalized linear model and specifying the distribution as binomial. A separate tabulation will be prepared comparing the overall incidence of all adverse events, an d restricted to serious adverse events. The first health economic outcome parameter to be summarized is the change from baseline in the prescription of narcotics related to the DFU(s) by subject and between randomized groups. The summary statistics will be calculated using the daily dosage converted into morphine equivalent units, a veraged over successive 7- day intervals from the time of study enrollment until week 52. The average 7- day changes will be summarized by group assignment . The second health economic outcome parameter is the intra- subject change in ambulatory status (i.e. bed, wheel chair, walk w/ assistance, or walk independent). The distribution of subject s by ambulatory status (improved, no change, worse) at 12, 26 and 52 weeks will be summarized by group. The 2- sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals will be summarized by ambulatory status category and treatment group. The time to a change in status (improved status and worsening status) will also be summarized using K -M estimates and compared between the intervention and standard of care groups using a log -rank test. The third health economic outcome includes work status , disability status, and activities of daily living. T he change in “return to work/reported work status” or disability status as defined by the investigator’s evaluation of the subject ’s ability to return to work related to their DFU status will be derived for each subject and compared between randomized groups.

Shift tables will be prepared by intervention and standard of care only assignment based on sequential 30 day intervals to categorize the proportion of subject s who transition from not working because of the DFU to working following study intervention for the DFU. Separately, the time to return to work will be summarized using descriptive statistics and Kaplan- Meier estimates. Finally, the investigator will be asked to provide the date of the examination where the subject is cleared to return to work, independent of the subject ’s actual work status . Using this date, the number of days from the date of enrollment will be summarized by intervention assignment using descriptive statistics and summarized by intervention group using Kaplan- Meier estimates. This tabulation will include all subject s, independent of the subject being employed prior to enrollment into the study. The scores from the Activities of Daily Living questionnaire will be summarized each time the questionnaire is administered. The actual scores, and the changes from scores recorded at baseline, i.e., prior to study intervention, will be summarized using descriptive statistics and compared between the intervention and standard of care only groups using an analysis of variance test. The fourth health economic outcome is the total direct cost per DFU by intervention and standard of care only group assessed during the treatment period. The total intra-subject direct cost will include the wound care time (physician time, nursing ti me, procedural time, application of products dressing time, application of off -loading device, etc.) and will be modeled over sequential 30 day intervals culminating at the end of the intervention phase; additional factors that are known predictors of healing, along with specific data about the size, depth, and location of the ulcer will be added to the model to derive an estimated direct intervention cost. 10.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and collection of AEs as outlined in the Schedule of Events. All summaries of AEs will be based on intervention- emergent adverse events, which will be coded according to the MedDRA system dictionary. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing adverse events will be summarized by body system organ class and description. Subject counts will be tabulated for all intervention- emergent adverse events for the ITT population. Adverse events will also be tabulated for events that occurred following initial treatment application through final study visit. Summaries by maximum severity and relationship to the study intervention will also be provided.

Compliance and device duration will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and max imum value, and 2- sided 95% confidence limits). 10.4.6 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS Baseline is defined as the observations recorded prior to the application of study intervention. Continuous demographic parameters, such as the subject’s age at the time of enrollment, will be summarized for the ITT population using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 95% two-sided confidence limits) and compared between groups using a two- sample t -test. Categor ical demographic parameters, such as gender, will be summarized as a proportion of the ITT population and compared using a two- tailed Fisher’s exact test. Co-morbid risk factors will be summarized for the ITT population by intervention assignment and according to the type of variable (categorical, continuous) and compared between groups. Kaplan- Meier estimates for time- to-event analyses will be prepared based on the ITT population. Separate tables containing subject counts, percentages, and 95% binomial confidence limits will be prepared based on individual risk factors. 10.4.7 PLANNED INTERIM ANAL YSES A sample size re -estimation will be performed when 50% of the target population or 60 subject s have completed the intervention / evaluation period (confirmed complete wound closure or no confirmed wound closure by Visit 13) of the study to derive the primary endpoint results . 10.4.7.1 SAFETY REVIEW The clinical investigator will be responsible for monitoring the safety of the subject s on an ongoing basis. 10.4.7.2 EFFICACY REVIEW Efficacy will be based on the results from the final analysis of the primary endpoint. 10.4.8 ADDITIONAL SUB -GROUP ANALYSES"

Estimates were prepared based on the primary endpoint considering a type 1 error rate of 5%. A 25% difference in the incidence of response was used to estimate the statistical power over a range of sample sizes from 100 to 150 subject s. To address concerns regarding the reliability of the estimates of intervention effectiveness, an adaptive mid- course sample size re- estimation procedure will be performed when 50% of the subject s have completed the 12 week study or withdrawn prematurely. The data for the re -estimation of sample size will be unblinded for the independent biostatistician; the sample size will be increased based on promising conditional power; therefore, there will be no inflate of the type I error[2]. Table 1 presented below contains 6 scenarios considering total sample sizes from 100 to 150 subject s. Table 1: Power Estimates based on a Type 1 Error Rate of 5% and a 2:1 Randomization Ratio (active: control) Scenario Power Total Sample Size Sample Size / Active Intervention Sample Size / Control Incidence of Closure / Active Intervention (%) Incidence of Closure / Control (%) 1 0.700 100 67 33 45% 20% 2 0.740 110 73 37 45% 20% 3 0.787 120 80 40 45% 20% 4 0.818 130 86 44 45% 20% 5 0.844 140 93 47 45% 20%"

The re- estimation of the sample size by the independent biostatistician is designed to ensure adequate power for the final analysis if the results are promising at the interim assessment. 10.6 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS The methods for assessing bias will be described in the SAP. 10.6.1 RANDOMIZATION Subject s will be randomized using a permuted block randomization scheme in a 2:1 ratio of Cytal to SOC . 11 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site Principal Investigator. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. When making changes or corrections, cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE , OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL. Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a subject’s visit into the protocol -specific CRF when the information corresponding to that visit is available. Subjects will not be identified by name in the study database or on any study documents to be collected by the Sponsor (or designee), but will be identified by a subject number and initials. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to maintain adequate and acc urate eCRFs designed by the Sponsor to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. All paper documentation should be completed in their entirety in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data; black or blue ink should be used to ensure the clarity of the reproduced copy of all documentation. Should a correction be made, the information to be modified must not be overwritten. The corrected information will be transcribed by the authorized person next t o the previous"
