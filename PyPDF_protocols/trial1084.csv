Participating sites The study will be performed in a total of 30 sites in Spain. Objectives Primary objective: ÔÇ∑ To characterize the multiple myeloma (MM) patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in Spain. Secondary objectives: ÔÇ∑ To evaluate how the clinical and sociodemographic findings of the MM patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease can affect the selection of treatment after the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode. ÔÇ∑ To identify any new relevant variables that are not currently collected in clinical records and that could influence in the disease management at relapse ÔÇ∑ To evaluate the quality of life of the MM patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaires. ÔÇ∑ To validate the psychometric properties of the Spanish translation of the EORTC QLQ -MY20 in MM patients with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease. ÔÇ∑ To identify and quantify the use of healthcare resources since the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode. Methodology Observational, cross-sectional, multicenter study of 350 patients with test-retest analysis in 40 patients. This study will not interfere in any way with the clinical and therapeutic management of the patient that will be conducted solely according to the criteria of the physician in line with standard clinical practice.

The study will be performed in the context of a single visit, in which the patient will be invited to participate in the study, the protocol will be explained, and if the patient wishes to participate, he/she will be asked to sign an informed consent form. Study data will be collected in a single visit. Questionnaires will be completed by the patient and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF) by the principal investigator (PI).Other data will be collected from the clinical records, examinations and tests performed according to the criteria of the physician and in line with standard clinical practice. For the test-retest analysis to validate the EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaire, a second questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20) will be provided to 40 patients to complete at home, 7 days after the visit, which should be returned to the site by post, in a pre -paid envelope. These 40 patients will be the first 2 patients enrolled in each site, until a total of 40 patients ha ve been reached. Sociodemographic and clinical data corresponding to the time of the visit will be collected, along with health resource use since the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode. Clinical data from before the study visit will also be collected from the patients‚Äô clinical records: diagnosis, prior relapses, and data on the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode. Number of patients A sample size of 350 patients has been calculated on the basis of an estimation of a proportion in case of maximum indetermination (proportion of 50%) with a 95% confidence interval and a precision of 5%, in the MM population with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease, approximately 3,4807 patients in Spain in 2016. This represents the inclusion of at least 10% of the population with relapsing or refractory MM (RRMM). According to previous publications on questionnaire validation in other languages22, 20 patients are sufficient for a test-retest analysis. Taking into account the possibility of questionnaires with invalid data and those that might not be returned after 7 days, we decided to ask 40 patients to complete the second questionnaire.

Almost all MM patients, including those who maintain prolonged response to first-line treatment, end up relapsing, and some of them also develop resistance to the drugs administered.10 Moreover, the disease becomes more and more aggressive with each relapse, and remissions achieved with successive lines of treatment tend to become shorter.11 The recurrent or refractory patient, then, is still a clinical and therapeutic challenge.10, 12 In recent years there has been a significant improvement, thanks to the development of new drugs with different mechanisms of action13 leading to a considerable change in the MM treatment paradigm, particularly for relapsing or refractory patients who until now had few therapeutic options.12, 14 Nevertheless, the therapeutic management of these patients does not depend uniquely on the availability of new drugs: the characteristics of the patient, the clinical aspects of the disease14-16, and other considerations, such as comorbidities and sociodemographic conditions also play a part.14, 17- 19 Various patient risk factors, such as age, general status, and the individual's history of toxicity to previous treatments will also influence the treatment strategy.20 Various studies have demonstrated the significant impact of comorbidities on mortality18 and disease progress in each patient.9,19 Since this disease is long term in many cases, it is equally important to evaluate the patient's opinion of the impact on their quality of life of not only the disease, but also the side effects of the treatments. This information may help the physician select the most appropriat e treatment in order to achieve better therapeutic adherence and satisfaction.

16,page_16,"CharisMMa Study Observational Study Protocol Final Version V1.0 Page 16 of 53 31/03/2017 commonly used in the evaluation of quality of life in MM patients. The Spanish version of this tool has been validated, with the exception of its psychometric properties.21, 22 An accurate epidemiological characterization of this population may be useful for the appropriate assignation of resources, as shown in a recent study performed on a French national register of hematological diseases.23 No registries or published data are available on the therapeutic management of the MM patient according to their characteristics, and data on results obtained in standard clinical practice are scarce. No epidemiological studies have been performed in MM patients that might contribute to defining if treatments administered are adjusted to the patient‚Äôs characteristics and how these affect their quality of life (QoL). Taking into account that relapsed or refractory MM patients in particular may be exposed to long cycles of treatment with drugs with a not inconsiderable risk of adverse events, the outcome of which may depend on previously administered treatments, the hematologist's choice of therapeutic strategy is crucial, and must be made in consideration of the patient as a whole, and not only in terms of their disease. Accordingly, then, the aim of this study is to characterize the profile of the relapsed and/or refractory MM patient in Spain. The secondary objective, among others, is to evaluate the feasibility, reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the EORTC QLQ-MY20 for this type of patient. The study findings will foreseeably generate new useful hypotheses for expanding the knowledge base of MM and the course and impact of the disease according to patient profile. 3 Study objectives 3.1 Primary objective ÔÇ∑ To characterize the multiple myeloma (MM) patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in Spain. 3.2 Secondary objectives ÔÇ∑ To evaluate how the clinical and sociodemographic findings of the MM patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease can affect the selection of treatment after the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episod e. ÔÇ∑ To identify any new relevant variables that are not currently collected in clinical records and that could influence in the disease management at relapse To evaluate the quality of life of the MM patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaires.

This study will not interfere in any way with the clinical and therapeutic management of the patient that will be conducted solely according to the criteria of the physician in line with standard clinical practice. A total of 30 investigators from the Hematology Departments of 30 public hospitals throughout Spain will consecutively include a total of 350 patients attending a routine visit at their office and who meet the inclusion criteria, during a recruitment period of approximately 12 months. In the study visit, the patient will be invited to participate in the study, the protocol will be explained, and if they wish to participate, they will be asked to sign an informed consent form. During the study visit, sociodemographic and clinical data and the QoL questionnaires20,21 corresponding to the time of the visit and clinical data from before the study visit (diagnosis, previous relapses before the latest, and data on the latest symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode) will be collected from the patients‚Äô clinical records, examinations and tests performed according to the criteria of the physician and in line with standard clinical practice. Data will also be collected for the evaluation of the use of healthcare resources after the latest relapse and/or refractory episode (number of hospital admissions, number of days admitted, visits to the emergency room, visits to specialists, etc. ). For the test-retest analysis to validate the EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaire, a second questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-MY20) will be provided to 40 patients to Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of symptomatic relapsed or refractory MM patients, so the cross-sectional design of this study is considered appropriate. The selected design is considered appropriate for validating the questionnaire which will be performed as a complementary activity. Cross-sectional studies are optimal for estimating prevalence, for simultaneously studying multiple resulting variables and for identifying potential associations between certain factors and the outcome of interest. Thus, these studies are useful for generating hypotheses that can be subsequently evaluated in other studies with more appropriate designs, since transversal studies are limited by being unable to establish a cause-effect relationship or sequentiality. However, they have the advantage of avoiding the patient attrition associated with follow-up studies.24, 25 Information provided by cross-sectional studies is generally used for developing and planning population health strategies.24 The evaluation of the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ -MY20 is designed according t o the method used for original evaluation of the instrument and in subsequent evaluations of translated versions.21, 22, 26 6.3 Selection of the study population Inclusion Criteria ÔÇ∑ Adults (‚â• 18 years) of both sexes. ÔÇ∑ Patients with a diagnosis of MM who have received at least one previous treatment line. ÔÇ∑ Patients who have experienced symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in the 6 months before the study. ÔÇ∑ Patients who continue in follow-up at the time of the study visit.

An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to that medicinal product. Adverse reaction (AR) Any response to a medication that is harmful and unintended, occurring at doses that are normally applied in humans for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or treatment of diseases, or the restoration, correction or modification of physiological functions. Unlike an AE, in the case of an AR, there is a suspected causal relationship between the study medication and that AR. This term also includes all the harmful clinical consequences derived from dependence, abuse and inappropriate use of medications, including those caused by use not included in the approved conditions and those caused by medication errors. Special Situation Report (SSR) A Special Situation Report (SSR) includes any of the following events: ‚Ä¢ Pregnancy: Any case in which a pregnancy patient is exposed to a Takeda Product or in which a female patient or female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant following treatment with Takeda Product. Exposure is considered either through maternal exposure or via semen following paternal exposure. ‚Ä¢ Breastfeeding: Infant exposure from breast milk ‚Ä¢ Overdose: All information of any accidental or intentional overdose ‚Ä¢ Drug abuse, misuse or medication error: All information on medicinal product abuse, misuse or medication error (potential or actual) ‚Ä¢ Suspected transmission of an infectious agent: All information on a suspected (in the sense of confirmed or potential) transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product. ‚Ä¢ Lack of efficacy of Takeda Product ‚Ä¢ Occupational exposure ‚Ä¢ Use outside the terms of the marketing authorization, also known as ‚Äúoff-label‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Use of falsified medicinal product Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"

ÔÇ∑ is life-threatening, understood as any reaction or event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which might have caused death if it had been more severe. ÔÇ∑ requires hospitalization of the patient or prolongs existing hospitalization. ÔÇ∑ results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or ÔÇ∑ causes a congenital abnormality or defect. For reporting purposes, any suspected AEs or ARs that are considered significant from a medical point of view will also be handled as serious, even if they do not meet the above- mentioned criteria, including significant medical events that require intervention to prevent one of the above-mentioned outcomes (e.g., intensive treatment for bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions, even if they do not result in hospitalization, or development of dependence or abuse). Additionally, all suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medication will also be reported as serious. Severity ÔÇ∑ Mild: Transient symptoms that do not interfere with the patient's activities of daily living. ÔÇ∑ Moderate : More pronounced symptoms that interfere moderately with the patient's activities of daily living. ÔÇ∑ Severe : Symptoms that interfere considerably with the patient's activities of daily living. Causality ÔÇ∑ Related : There is a reasonable temporal relationship between the administration of the medication and the appearance of the event, and no obvious alternative explanation is available.

Product complaint information should also be reported to the same mailbox. If the sponsor requires additional information for the evaluation of an adverse reaction, and sends queries to the investigator of the corresponding site, the information provided by that investigator will be considered as follow-up information on the adverse reaction and thus must be reported to the point of contact designated by the responsible authorities in the matter of pharmacovigilance in the autonomous community in which the healthcare professional who reports the case is practicing, at the same time as to the sponsor who requested the information, including a reference to the initially reported adverse reaction. This notification to the responsible authorities and to the sponsor will be made as described in this section. If the CRO becomes aware of any adverse reaction or any other relevant safety information associated with any product marketed by Takeda, the CRO will be obliged to report it to the pharmacovigilance department of Takeda within 24 hours of receipt, using the Takeda adverse reaction notification form and the electronic mail address farmacovigilancia@takeda . Every three months, Takeda Pharmacovigilance will send the CRO a list of adverse events received for reconciliation purposes. The CRO will then send any discrepancies to Takeda Pharmacovigilance for resolution. Only one AE/AR should be reported in each form. A diagnosis should be established, if possible. If this is impossible, the investigator should record each sign or symptom in separate forms. The seriousness, intensity, and causality of the AE/AR should be evaluated. Notifications regarding Takeda medications will be followed up until outcome by the Pharmacovigilance Unit, in accordance with the established protocols and the applicable regulations, for which the collaboration of the investigator will be required.

Regulations applicable to observational studies do not specify monitoring requirements for this type of study. An electronic database will be created in which all data from each clinical record will be recorded. Access to the database will be restricted, for security reasons, to the investigator, the data manager and personnel responsible for data review. The database will contain internal consistency rules and filters to minimize possible errors in data entry. Logic controls will be run to check for inconsistent study data and laboratory values outside normal limits. During the data entry period, consistency of the inclusion/exclusion criteria values and clinical evaluations will be checked. 9.2 Quality Assurance Unit Audits The Quality Assurance Unit may audit the study to ensure that study procedures comply with the provisions of the protocol and standard operating procedures, and that the data collected are correct and complete. 9.3 CREC and health authority inspections Representatives of the CREC or the health authorities may request an on-site data inspection. If the responsible investigator in the site receives notification of an inspection, he/she must immediately contact Takeda Farmac√©utica Espa√±a S.A. and must provide access to the requested files. 9.4 Data management The Data Management Plan must be approved by the sponsor before the database design and study CRFs are complete. The Data Manager will be the CRO. If the IC of a patient is missing, the data from that patient will not be entered in the database, and only the inclusion/exclusion criteria and the visit date will be recorded. If it is subsequently found that no IC is available for a patient, the data entered in the system will be maintained as recorded, but these data will not be used for the statistical analysis and the patient will be considered a screening failure. If a patient is mistakenly included more than once in the study, the information for the initial inclusion will be retained.

The method of coding clinical data will be documented in the Data Management Plan, indicating the dictionaries used and variables to be coded. In the database, patients will be coded according to the site code and patient number; no identifying or identifiable personal data will appear. 9.4.1 Tools for data collection and flow The participating site will receive tools for data collection (electronic CRF) from the Sponsor or the CRO. All attempts should be made in every case to enter the complete data set. The responsible investigator in the site must sign the data set for each patient, thus confirming the information collected just before the database closure. AE/ARs will be collected as specified in Section 7 of this protocol, and SARs will also be reported as described in Section 8 of this protocol. 10 Statistical methods and calculation of the sample size This section describes the statistical analysis foreseen at the time of planning the study. Possible modifications and reasons for any changes, as well as any additional analysis and the final statistical analysis will be described in detail in the revised Statistical Analysis Plan before database closure. All modifications or subsequent deviations will be explained in the study clinical report. 10.1 Statistical analysis plan The principal objective of this study is to characterize the profile of the relapsing/refractory MM patient in Spain. To this end, sociodemographic data, current clinical and therapeutic data, clinical data relative to the latest relapse and clinical data at diagnosis and previous relapses will be collected. A descriptive analysis of all variables will be used to characterize the profile of MM patients with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory episode: ÔÇ∑ For qualitative variables, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be used. ÔÇ∑ For quantitative variables, central tendency and dispersion measurements will be presented. Property of Takeda: For non-commercial use only and subject to the applicable Terms of Use"
39,page_39,"CharisMMa Study Observational Study Protocol Final Version V1.0 Page 39 of 53 31/03/2017 To evaluate which clinical and sociodemographic findings are related with the selection of treatment after relapse, the relationship between the clinical and sociodemographic variables collected before starting treatment with the prescribed treatment will be evaluated. ÔÇ∑ For qualitative variables, numbers and percentages of the variable categories for each treatment will be presented. To evaluate the relationship with treatment, Chi- squared or Fisher exact tests will be performed and the resulting p-value will be presented. ÔÇ∑ For quantitative variables, central tendency and dispersion descriptions will be presented for each treatment. To evaluate the relationship with treatment, ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests will be performed and the resulting p-value will be presented. No type of data imputation will be performed. Only patients observed will be analyzed, and the number of missing data will be described in each analysis. Validation of the EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaire. To validate the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ -MY20 questionnaire, feasibility, reliability and validity will be evaluated using the following constructs: ÔÇ∑ Questionnaire feasibility : o Percentage of non-responses in the questionnaire. o Floor and ceiling effects for each questionnaire item. ÔÇ∑ Internal consistency will be evaluated using Cronbach‚Äôs ÔÅ°. A result of 0.7 or higher is considered acceptable for psychometric scales.21 ÔÇ∑ Temporal stability will be evaluated in a test-retest analysis, and the intraclass correlation coefficient will be presented. ÔÇ∑ Construct validity will be evaluated using a factor analysis.21 ÔÇ∑ Clinical validity will be evaluated by the comparison of results in pre-defined groups (ISS stage, presence/absence of fractures, and ÔÅ¢2-microglobulin levels) that will indicate the capacity of discrimination between patients in different clinical situations.21 The groups will be defined as follows: o ISS Stage I-II vs III o Fractures: fractures currently present vs. absent o ÔÅ¢2-microglobulin: <4 mg/L vs. ÔÇ≥4 mg/L.

A two-tailed level of significance of 0.05 will be used for all tests. All statistical analyses will be carried out using the statistical package SAS¬© system, version 9.3 or higher. 10.2 Interim analyses An interim analysis will be evaluated during the enrollment process. . 10.3 Sample size calculation The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological profile of the MM patient with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease in Spain, and to identify thereby potential differences that may be relevant for making clinical and therapeutic decisions. The sample was calculated on the basis of the estimation of a proportion in case of maximum indetermination (proportion of 50%). To estimate a proportion of the MM population with symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease, approximately 3,4807 patients in Spain in 2016, with a 95% confidence interval and a precision of 5%, a total of 346 patients will have to be included. To facilitate the distribution of patients between the different participating sites, and taking into account the cross- sectional design of the study and the need to have all the information needed for the study as listed in the screening criteria available in the patient records, the risk of patient attrition is high, so the final sample size for the study was established at 350 patients. With this sample size, the psychometric properties of the EORTC QLQ-MY30 questionnaire can be validated.21, 22 , 26 Moreover, for the test-retest analysis to validate the EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaire, a second questionnaire will be provided to 40 patients to complete 7 days after the visit, which should be returned to the site by post, in a pre-paid envelope. According to previous publications on questionnaire validation in other languages22, 20 patients are sufficient for a test-retest analysis. Taking into account the possibility of questionnaires with invalid data or those that are not returned after 7 days, we decided to ask 40 patients to complete the second questionnaire.

INTRODUCTION You have been invited to participate in a research study in multiple myeloma (MM) patients who have received at least one previous line of treatment and who have developed refractory disease and/or relapse. Our aim is to expand the existing knowledge base of this disease. STUDY OBJECTIVE The general objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of MM patients who are experiencing symptomatic relapse and/or refractory disease after a previous treatment. Specifically, the aim is to describe the clinical profile of Study title: ‚ÄúCLINICAL AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERIZATION OF MYELOMA MULTIPLE PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC RELAPSE AND/OR REFRACTORY DISEASE IN SPAIN‚Äù CharisMMa Study Sponsor: Takeda Farmac√©utica Espa√±a S.A.

A second objective of this study is to test the feasibility, reliability and validity of a questionnaire designed to evaluate quality of life (QoL) in MM patients. An important issue in MM patients is how both the disease and the treatments administered can affect QoL. In medicine, QoL is evaluated by using scales and questionnaires. There is a specific questionnaire for evaluating QoL in MM called the EORTC QLQ-MY20. In this study, we want to test the feasibility, reliability and validity of this questionnaire. STUDY INFORMATION This observational cross-sectional (single-visit) study will include approximately 350 adult patients with a diagnosis of MM who, after being treated already, have experienced a relapse of their disease (either after having been in remission for some time or because they are resistant to the treatment administered). As this is an observational cross-sectional study, participation in this study means that your doctor will only consult and record information from your clinical records and tests performed in this visit for the follow-up and/or treatment of your disease. Moreover, two QoL questionnaires will be completed. Some of the patients (40 in all) will be asked to submit a second questionnaire after 7 days by post, in a pre-paid envelope. This is necessary to check the reliability of the EORTC QLQ-MY20 questionnaire, although you can decide if you want to participate in this specific part of the study or not. In order for patients to keep themselves informed about the study progress and when study milestones are reached, Takeda has made available the following open access website, which will be updated as milestones are achieved during the course of the study. This site will contain public information only and in no case will any information on the patient or any confidential information be disclosed. www.charismmastudy.com Risks derived from participation in the study You will not be exposed to any additional risk derived from participation in this study. Except for the completion of the QoL questionnaires, all examinations, tests and treatment will be exactly the same as if you did not participate in the study.
