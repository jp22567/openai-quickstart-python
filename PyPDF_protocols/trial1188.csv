Thus, IA2 has been retooled as IA1 where the trigger is 80% DFS events accrued. This will represent roughly a minimum follow -up of 12 months after enrollment is finished. 05M38T 06CHJR"

The initial intent was to include metachronous and synchronous M1 NED postoperative nephrectomy ≤1 year. Since study inception, the inclusion of metachronous and synchronous M1 NED patients was intended; however, during protocol finalization metachronous was inadvertently removed. Additionally, minor adjustments are incorporated to enhance the clarity of the protocol intent, reflect real-time feedback from investigators, and address language inconsistencies 3475 -564-00 24-FEB- 2017 Original 05M38T 06CHJR"

RCC isthe seventh most common cancer in men and the nint h most common cancer in women. Worldwide, there are an estimated 209,000 newly diagnosed cases of RCC and an estimated 102,000 deaths per year [Escudier, B., et al 2014] . In the United States, the expected number of new cases and deaths from kidney and renal pelvis cancer in 2016 is 62,700 and 14,240, respectively [Siegel, R. L., et al 2016] .Approximately 90% of renal tumors are RCC and approximately 80% of these are of clear cell histology. Other less common cell types include papillary, chromophobe, translocation, and collecting duct tum ors [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2015] . Smoking and obesity are established risk factors for RCC. Several hereditary conditions, such as von Hippel -Lindau disease, predispose patients to having an increased risk of developing RCC . The incidence of RCC is increasing continually in recent decades, and approximately two - thirds of the cases are diagnosed without evidence of metastatic disease [Siegel, R. L., et al 2016] . These patients are usually managed with a radical surgical approach, but a percentage of these patients will have recurrence and eventually die because of the disease. The e stimated 5-year survival of patients with localized RCC patients is approximately 90%, decreasing to 65% in locally advanced RCC, and only 12% in metastatic RCC [National Cancer Institute 2016] . Therefore, novel agents with durable clinical benefit and a potential cu rative effect are still needed. The recently approved immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab has demonstrated an overall survival ( OS)benefit (compared with the standard of care, everolimus), as well as a manageable safety profile, in the treatment of patients with advanced RCC whose disease has progressed following anti -angiogenic therapy [U.S. Prescribing Information 2016] . Multiple studies are currently ongoing or planned to evaluate immune checkpoint inhibito rs as monotherapy or in combination with selective vascular endothelial g rowth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other anti -angiogenic agents (eg, bevacizumab, ipilimumab) in the first- line treatment of advanced or metastatic RCC. Preliminary data from Phase 1b, 2, and 3 studies (nivolumab/ipilimumab [Checkmate -016 Phase 2; Checkmate -214 Phase 3 ]; bevacizumab/ atezolizumab [NCT02420821 Phase 3]; pembrolizumab/axitinib [KN035 Phase 1b/2]) suggest a promising response pattern, with higher overall r esponse rate and progression -free survival rates and tolerable toxicity, as compared with the current standard of care, sunitinib or pazopanib. The safety and antitumor activity of checkpoint inhibitors are also being evaluated in the (neo) adjuvant setting for RCC in Phase 1/2 exploratory trials [Pinto, A. 2014] , and 05M38T 06CHJR"
30,page_30,"Product: MK-3475 31 Protocol/Amendment No.: 564-04 MK-3475 -564-04 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2020 Confidentialpreliminary data suggest a possible benefit of treatment on both disease -free survival ( DFS) and OS, with good tolerability in participants who have no current disease burden following surgery , but a high risk of recurrence [Ravaud, A., et al 2016] . Background Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immuno globulin (Ig)G4 monoclonal antibody with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and pote nt receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment across a number of cancer indications. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure /approved labeling for detailed background information , including specific indications, forpembrolizumab (MK -3475). Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformati ons has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] . Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in ca ncer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T cells/FoxP3+ T- regs correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and RCC. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor respons es in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, N. N., et al 2008]. The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell surface of activat ed T cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1 ) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of it s ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [Greenwald, R. J., et al 2005] [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] . The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [Zhang, X., et al 2004] . PD-1 and itsfamily members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig variable -type domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the b inding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif. Following T- cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP -1 and SHP -2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta, protein kinase C - theta, and zeta -chain -associated protein kinase, which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] [Chemnitz, J. M., et al 2004] [Sheppard, K -A, et 05M38T 06CHJR"

The mechanism by which PD -1 down modu lates T- cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA -4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of s ignaling proteins [Parry, R. V., et al 2005] [Francisco, L. M., et al 2010] . As a consequence, the PD- 1/ PD -L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in participants who have undergone nephrectomy and have intermediate -high risk, high risk, or M1 NED RCC with clear cell component . Benefit/Risk Assessment It cannot be guaranteed that participant s in clinical trials will directly benefit from treatment during participation, as clinical trials are designed to provide information about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine. Pembrolizumab has been administered to a large number of cancer patients, with a well-characterized safety profile, and has received regulatory app roval in the USand several other countries for advanced melanoma, NSCLC , and head and neck squamous cell carcin oma. Overall, pembrolizumab is well tolerated and has demonstrated preliminary evidence of anticancer activity in multiple tumor types. At present, there are no curative systemic treatments for about 35% of primary treated patients with intermediate -high risk, high risk, and M1 NED RCC. Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participant s participating in this clinical trial may be found in the accompanying Investigator’s Brochure and Informed Consent documents. 4.Objec tives/Hypotheses and Endpoints The following objectives will be evaluated in the adjuvant treatment of participants who have undergone nephrectomy and have intermediate -high risk, high risk, or M1 NED RCC with clear cell component .

Screening Period Individual screening procedures must be performed within the time frames reported in the schedule of activities (SoA - Section 2) and procedural details in Section 9. Participants must have undergone a nephrectomy and/or metast asectomy ≥28 days prior to si gning informed consent and ≤12 weeks from randomization. Participants must be tumor -free as assessed by the investigator via CT or MRI of the CAP , bone scan , and brain scan . Tumor tissue from the participants’ nephrectomy (and metast asectomy for M1 NED ) must be submitted to a central laboratory for biomarker analysis . Treatment Period and End of Treatment Approximately 950 e ligible participa nts will be randomized 1:1 to receive either placebo or pembrolizumab 200 mg,administered by IV infusion Q3W. Durin g the treatment period, participants will have routine c linical visits for administration of study treatment and monitoring of safety ,wellbeing, and changes in disease status. Scheduled on- treatment imaging assessmen ts will be performe dQ12W from randomization and should not be adjusted for delays in treatment or cycle starts . Participants will also complete QoL questionnaires to assess the impact of treatment on HRQoL . Key safety assessments include the monitoring of AEsand ECI, physical examinations, vital signs, ECG s, as clinically indicated , hematology and chemistry laboratories (including thyroid function test), and urinalysis. Participants may receive study treatme nt for up to 17 cycles ( approximately 1 year)oruntil confirmation of disease recurrence or meet ing the criteria for discontinuation of study treatment as outlined in Section 8. Participants who discontinue from treatment without documented disease recurrence should have imaging performed at the time of discontinuation if the last assessment was more than 28 days prior AND should continue with posttreatment Follow -up procedures until disease recurrence, pregnancy, the start of new anticancer treatment, death, withdrawal of consent, or study conclusion (whichever occurs first). The End of T reatment Visit should occur at the time study treatment is discontinued for any reason (see Section 9.10.4.).

Scientific Rationale for Study Design Selection of Patient Population RCC has long been considered an immune -reactive malignancy based on anecdotal reports of spontaneous remissions in advanced RCC pa tients with evidence of antigen -specific lymphocyte infiltration of tumor tissues [Wierecky, J., et al 2006] and the fact that high- dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2)could produce durable long -term response in a small subset of advanced RCC patients. In RCC, upregulation of the PD -1 receptor on tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and its ligand PD -L1 on tumors is associated with more aggressive disease and poor prognosis [Pedoeem, A., et al 2014] [Ahmadzadeh, M., et al 2009] . The rate of PD -L1 expression in RCC has been reported to be between 10% and 30%, and PD- L2 expression has been reported as approximately 50% [Abbas, M., et al 2016] [Shin, S. J., et al 2016] [Iacovelli, R., et al 2016] .The evidence above supports targeting RCC with an immunotherapeutic approach. Single -agent antitumor activity has been demonst rated by another anti -PD-1 antibody, nivolumab, in advanced RCC [Motzer, R. J., et al 2015] . 05M38T 06CHJR"

P., et al 1998]. Therefore, novel treatments , including in the adjuvant setting, are needed to prevent disease recurrence in patients with high errisk RCC. Watchful waiting or participation in an experimental clinical trial evaluating adjuvant treatment are the only options for patients with high risk of recurrence based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines and current literature. Othe r than patients with nodal involvement, t he patients with the highest risk of RCC recurrence are those that present with not only the primary kidney tumor , but also solid , isolated, soft tissue metastases that can be completely resected at the time of neph rectomy, known as M1 NED . Resection of metastatic disease (metastasectomy) isperformed in several situations: Patients with Stage IVdisease at presentation, where it is performed with nephrectomy Patients who develop metastatic disease following nephrect omy Patients who have persistent disease despite systemic therapy In selected patients with metastatic RCC, surgic al resection of metastatic foci is a treatment option that can yield long- term DFS . The potential role of surgery is illustrated by the result s from a series of 278 patients with recurrent RCC , in which 51% of patients underwent removal of all of their metastatic disease with curative intent, 25 %underwent partial resection of their metastatic disease, and 24 %were treated without surgery [Kavolius, J. P., et al 1998] . Metastases were most frequently resected from the lung, brain, bone, and soft tissue. The following findings were noted on multivariate analysis: The 5 -year OS rate was highest in patients treated with metastasectomy with curative intent (44%versus 14 % for noncurative surgery and 11% for non surgical intervention ). Survival rates after complete resection of a second and third metastasis were not different from t hose after initial metastasectomy. The strongest predictors of prolonged survival were a disease- free interval from nephrectomy to detection of metastases of greater than 1 year (55 % 5-year OS versus 9% 5 -year OS for patients with a diseas e-free interval of a year or less); a single site of metastasi s (54% 5- year OS for a single site versus 29% 5-year OS for multiple sites), espe cially if the site was the lung; and age younger than 60 years (49% 5- year OS versus 35% 5- year OS for age 60 years or older ).

Almost all patients with recurr ence after primary nephrectomy and M1 NED patients after primary resection develop dista nt metastasis and require first -line metastatic treatment ; a summary of Phase 3 studies of first -line treatments for RCC and their associated survival rates is shown in Table 1. Therefore, reduction in the risk for recurrence through appropriate adjuvant treatment could be valuable in patients at a higher risk of recurre nce, but to date no agent has proven to be useful in this setting. Immune therapies, hormonal therapies, and finally targeted therapy, effective in the advanced setting, have been tested for this indication, without success for this unmet medical need [Pinto, A. 2014] .

B., et al 2016] [National Cancer Institute 2016] [Pinto, A. 2014] . For patients with a partial or radical nephrectomy, the risk o f recurrence largely depends on tumor size, grade, stage, histology, performance status, and completeness of resection [Eggener, S. E., et al 2006] [Stephenson, A. J., et al 2004] [Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003]. Currently, pathologic tumor stage is the single most important prognostic factor in resected RCC, but does not fully explain dispar ities in survival among stages [Frank, I., et al 2005] . Some other histologic features, such as histologic subtype, and presence of necrosis or sarcomatoid component have been linked with a poorer prognosis [Kunkle, D. A., et al 2007] . Regarding histologic subtypes, chromophobe and papillary type I seem to have a more indolent clinical course, and papillary type II and clear cell RCC show a more aggressive behavior [Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003] .The most common form of RCC is clear cell disease, so named because the high lipid content in the cytoplasm is dissolved during histological preparation methods l eaving a clear cytoplasm. A 4 -tiered grading (Fuhrman) system based on nuclear morphology is also an important prognostic factor in c learcell RCC [Kunkle, D. A., et al 2007] [Rini, B. I., et al 2009] [Fuhrman, S. A., et al 1982] . A systematic review with meta- analysis of adjuvant thera pies for locally advanced RCC was published in 2011 [Scherr, A. J., et al 2011] ;it concluded that there was no support for using systemic therapy in the adjuvant setting, as there was no evidence of any benefit and there was evidence of substantial toxicity. The therapeutic modalities included in this study were mainly chemotherapy, immune therapies, and hormonal treatments, since no trial with targeted therapies had been completed at that time. Immunotherapy wa s one of the standard options for metastatic RCC before the advent of targeted therapies. IL-2 and IFN were commonly used in that setting , but with poor results, achieving a response rate of 6% to 10% and some durable responses, and a median OS of 12 to 15 months [Gleave, M. E., et al 1998] .Nevertheless, none of the adjuvant trials with immune therapies has been successful. Two trials compared IFN with placebo in T3 to T4 and/or node -positive pa rticipants, without improvements in DFS or OS [Pizzocaro, G., et al 2001] [Messing, E. M., et al 2003]. Two other small tria ls that explored the role of IL -2, whether in monotherapy as a single -dose treatment [Clark, J. I., et al 2003] or combined with IFN[Passalacqua, R., et al 2014] ,also had negative results. A triple combination of IL-2, IFN, and 5-fluorouracil also failed to show an improvement in DFS compared with placebo and was associated with significant toxicity [Aitchison, M., et al 2014] .This same schedule was tes ted in a different trial, showing no differences in DFS, but a worse OS for the treatment arm [Atzpodien, J., et al 2005] . Some other trials have explored the potential role in the adjuvant setting of therapeuti c vaccines [Patel, D. N., et al 2016]. The use of radiotherapy in an adjuvant setting has not been established as a standard for this indication. In a trial published in 1987, a total of 72 pa rticipants with Sta ge II to III kidney cancer were randomized to adjuvant radiation therapy (50 Gy in the tumor bed and both ipsilateral and contralateral nodes) or no further treatment. This trial was closed early because of unacceptable toxicity, and no differences in recurrence rate or survival were seen between the arms [Kjaer, M., et al ] . A similar trial performed even earlier, in the 1970s, also did not find a benefit from postoperative radiation therapy [Finney, R. 1973] . 05M38T 06CHJR"

One prospective multicenter study compared medroxyprogesterone acetate treatment for 1 year versus no treatment after radical nephrectomy and failed to demonstrate any benefit in survival [Scherr, A. J., et al 2011] . Another trial testing chemotherapy with adjuvant tegafur and uracil was also unsuccessful [Naito, S., et al 1997] . Until recently, a number of Phase 2/3clinical studies failed to demonstrate substantial and consistent benefit in the adjuvant setting for RCC, whether using immunotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy. Trials testing targeted therapies such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib have either failed (eg, ASSURE – ECOG2805) or are ongoing, dealing with significant toxicities in pa rticipants with no existing disease burden during treatment (Table 2; [Haas, N.

The incidence of SAEs in the groups was similar (21.9% for sunitinib vs. 17.1% for placebo); no deaths were attributed to toxic effects related to study treatment [Ravaud, A., et al 2016] . These recent data are encouraging, as this is the first study to show a positive DFS in this patient population; however ,the treatment discontinuation rate was high and the AEs created a meaningful burden for pa rticipants .Additionally, the study did not include those at the highest risk of recurrence, M1 NED , in the investigated patient population. Globally, there is no current treatment standard in the adjuvant setting for RCC after nephrectomy . Rationale for Stratification In previous studies [Haas, N. B., et al 2016] [Ravaud, A., et al 2016] and ongoing adjuvant RCC trials, stratification for ECOG 0 versus 1+ is considered an important strategy to equally distribute participants. Participants with an initial diagnosis of RCC and an ECO G status greater than 0 typically have underlying comorbidities and are clinically considered to have a worse long -term outcome when compared to participants with an initial diagnosis of RCC and an ECOG status of 0. The stratification of US over rest of world addresses the potential significant treatment paradigm shift in first and second -line metastatic RCC due to early adoption of new treatment regimens and broader availability of treatments in the US over other regions of the world. This stratification factor does not impact the primary endpoint of DFS. Instead it addresses equal distribution of participants having differential access to new treatment regimens during OS Follow -up. Rationale for Endpoints Efficacy Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint, DFS as assessed by the investigator ,is considered an appropriate clinical endpoint for an adjuvant trial that will evaluate the study treatment’s impact on disease recurrence and has been explored in a number of ongoing pivotal Phase 3 studies serving as a surrogate for OSassessment [Ravaud, A., et al 2016] [Haas, N. B., et al 2016] .DFS has been accepted as a surrogate endpoint to support drug approval for adjuvant settings in which pa rticipants are expected to experience cancer symptoms upon recurrence (eg, adjuvant breast cancer hormonal therapy, adjuvant colon cancer, and adjuvant cyt otoxic breast cancer therapy). In the pr oposed patient population, participants are entering the trial tumor free . In the adjuvant setting, an investigator determines the absolute recurrence of disease. This assessment is equally appropriate to an independ ent reviewer determination since it does not involve tumor burden level grading expected with existing advanced metastatic disease. 05M38T 06CHJR"
43,page_43,"Product: MK-3475 44 Protocol/Amendment No.: 564-04 MK-3475 -564-04 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2020 ConfidentialWhile OS has been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in ra ndomized clinical studies, in some oncology indications such as RCC, survival may be prolonged. In such instances where a survival endpoint would be difficult to achieve, DFS may represent a measure of clinical benefit, especially if the magnitude of the e ffect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk/benefit profile. Safety Endpoints Safety parameters commonly used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incide nce of, causality, and outcome of AEs/SAEs; and changes in vital signs and laboratory values. AEs will be assessed as defined by CTCA ), Version 4.0. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints THIS BLOOD WORK WILL NO LONGER BE COLLECTED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AMENDMENT 2. Blood samples will be obtained to measure the PK of pembrolizumab. PK parameters (clearance, volume of distribution) will be characterized and the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors will be evaluated to support the proposed dosing regimen. PK data will also be used to explore the exposure -response relationships for pembrolizumab antitumor activity/efficacy, as well as safety in the proposed patient population, if feasible. Patient -Reported Outcomes Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit. As part of the analyses for this trial, participants will provide information regarding their HRQoL via EORTC -QLQ- C30 and EQ- 5D-5L.These PROs are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease recurrence and treatment tolerability. Clinical experts have indicated that the FKSI -DRS instru ment primarily captures disease -related, as opposed to t reatment - related, ch anges in HRQoL . Rationale for the EORTC -QLQ -C30 The EORTC -QLQ- C30 is the mo st widely used cancer- specific HRQoL instrument, which contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive , and social), 3 symptom items (f atigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global health and QoL scale. Thus, secondary objectives are to assess mean changes from baseline in the global health status/ QoL scale from the EORTC -QLQ- C30. Rationale for the FKSI -DRS The FKSI -DRS is a patient -reported instrument that measures whether the pa rticipant has experienced any of the following 9 kidney cancer -related symptoms: lack of energy, fatigue , weight loss, pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, or blood in the urine. Responses to all FKSI -DRS items are summed to generate a summary symptom score 05M38T 06CHJR"

The FKSI -DRS is a reliable, valid, and responsive brief index of the most important symptoms associated with advanced kidney cancer. Rationale for the EQ -5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome sand will provide data for use in economic models and analyses including developing hea lth utilities or quality- adjusted life -years. The 5 health state dimensions in this instrument include the following: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomf ort, and anxiety/depression. Ea ch dimension is rated on a 5 -point scale from 1 ( noproblem) to 5 (extreme problem). The EQ - 5D-5L also includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual a nalog scale on which the participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment.

Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewh ere in the protocol (as part of the main trial) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriately consented participant s. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for Future Biomedical Research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inf orm the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that participant s receive the correct dose of the correct dr ug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of Future Biomedical Research are presented in Appendix 6 –Collection and Management of Specimens for Future Biomedical Research. Rationale f or the Use of Comparator/Placebo The use of a placebo control for th is trial is considered appropri ate in this patient population because such a patient would have no disease burden following nephrectomy; these participants would then be followed without further treatment until disease recurrence ,as no other regimens are yet approved for RCC in the adjuvant setting . Justification for Dose The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this trial is 200 mg Q3W . The initial dose approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of melanoma patients was 2 mg/kg Q3W. Currently, clinical trials evaluating pembrolizumab are using a fixed dose of 200 mgQ3W. The use of a fixed dose is based on PK findings summarized below . The PK profi le of pembrolizumab is consistent with that of other humanized monoclonal antibodies, which typically have a low clearance and a limited volume of distribution. A population PK model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure using available data from 1139 participants (from Keynote 001 and Keynote 002) ,has been performed. The majority of these participants (1077; 94.6%) had advanced melanoma. The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose wer e predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose and importantly maintained individual participant exposures within the exposure range established in 05M38T 06CHJR"

This comparison also demons trated that the 200 mg Q3W regimen provided no substantive differences in PK variability (range of the distribution of individual exposures) as seen with weight- based dosing. In translating to other solid tumor indications, similarly flat exposure -response relationships for efficacy and safety as observed in participants with melanoma can be expected, as the antitumor effect of pembrolizumab is driven through immune system activation rather than through a direct interaction with tumor cells, rendering it in dependent of the specific tumor type. In addition, available PK results in participants with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at tested doses among tumor types . A fixed -dose regim en is expected to simplify the dosing regimen (potentially reducing dosing errors), as well as be more convenient for physicians. A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities, as well as reducing waste. 6.Study Population Male and f emale participant s with intermediate -high risk, high risk and M1 NED RCC of at least 18 years of age will be enrolled in this trial.

All baseline, on -treatment ,and follow -up scans must be sent to the central imaging vendor. Acceptable modalities for each anatomic region are as follows: For imaging of the CAP, CT is the strongly preferred modality and should be acquired with IV and oral contrast. An MRI with IV contrast should only be used when CT is contraindicated. For brain imaging MRI is preferred; however, CT imaging will be acceptable, if an MRI is medically contraindicated. For imaging of bone, bone scintillation or the loca l standard of care modality should be used. X- rays may also be taken for symptomatic sites even if a bone scan is negative. The same imaging technique regarding modality and contrast should be used in a participant throughout the trial to optimize the visualization of existing and new tumor burden. The investigator will verify that each participant is tumor free at baseline and will make the determination that a participant has met the criteria for recurrence of RCC. To assess the adequacy of DFS as assessed by the investigator, a blinded audit for a subset of participants will b e conducted as outlined in the supplemental Statistical Analysis P lan (sSAP) . Criteria for Determination of Disease Recurrence Disease r ecurrence is defined as loca l recurrence of RCC, oroccurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) and is to be determined according to the clinical, pathologic, and radiographic criteria inTable 7. Radiographic evidence for disease recurrence is required, while confirmation of recurrence by biopsy or cytology is strongly encouraged, when safely feasible .

It is strongly recommended that PROs be administered prior to AE evaluation, disease notification status, and study treatment administration. EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes. The EQ-5D-5L will provide data for use in economic models and analyses including developing health utilities o r quality- adjusted life -years. The 5 health state dimensions in thi s instrument include the following: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/disc omfort, and anxiety/depression [Rabin, R. 2001] [ Pickard, A. S., et al 2007] . Each dimension is rated on a 5-point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (extreme problem). The EQ -5D-5L also assesses the general state of health using a visual analog scale (0 to 100). The EQ -5D-5L will always be completed by participants first, prior to co mpleting any other PRO. European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 The EORTC -QLQ- C30 was developed to assess the QoL of patients with cancer. It has been translated and validated into 81 languages and u sed in more than 3,000 studies worldwide. It consists of 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea /vomiting , pain), and additional single -symptom items. It is scored on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all, 2 =a little, 3 =quite a bit, 4 =very much). The EORTC -QLQ- C30 instrument also contains 2 global scales that use a 7 -point scale scoring with anchors (the scores range from 1 = very poor to 7 = excellent) [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Kidney Symptom Index –Disease - Related Symptoms The FKSI -DRS is a patient -reported instrument that measures whether the participant has experienced any of the following 9 kidney cancer -related symptoms: lack of energy , fatigue, weight loss, pain, bone pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, or blood in the urine [Cella, D., et al 2007] . Each item is scored by using the following 5 response categories: 0, not at all; 1, a little bit; 2, somewhat; 3, quite a bit; and 4, very much. Responses to all FKSI -DRS items are summed to generate a summary symptom score ranging from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating improved (more favorable) symptom status. The FKSI -DRS is a reliable, valid, and responsive brief index of the most important symptoms associated with adva nced kidney cancer [Cella, D., et al 2007] . If, at the time of first dose of study treatment, the translated version of the FKSI -DRS –one of the PRO measures – is not available for that language/country, and it cannot be completed by the participant at Cycle 1, Day 1, then the FKSI -DRS will not be required for this participant at any point of the study.

All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in accordance with all applicable global l aws and regulations, i.e., per ICH Topic E6 (R1) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Investigator s afety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy an d forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AE s or SAEs Progression/recurrence of the cancer under study is not considered a reportable event. The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the participants in the trial. Any suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression /recurrence of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Global Safety as a n SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression /recurrence of the cancer under study . 05M38T 06CHJR"

Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 1.anoverdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section 9.4 –Treatment of Overdose, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of nor mal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). It may also be appropriate to conduct additional evaluation for an underlying etiology in the setting of abnormalities of liver blood tests including AST, ALT, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase that do not meet the criteria noted above. In these cases, the decision to proceed with additional evaluation will be made through consultation between the study investigators and the Sponsor Clinical Director ; however, abnormalities of liver blood tests that do not meet the criteria noted above are not ECIs for this trial. Treatment of Overdose For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for pembrolizumab (200 mg) by 5 times (ie, any dose higher than 1000 mg)in a 3- week time period. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . In the event of overdose, pembrolizumab should be discontinued and the 05M38T 06CHJR"

If, after the study has begun, cha nges are made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with ICH Guideline E9). Changes to exploratory or other nonconfirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, but prior to the conduct of any analysis, will be documented in a sSAP and referenced in the Clinical Study Report for the study. Separate analysis plans may be developed for PK/modeling analysis, biomarker analysis, and geneti c data analysis . Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the C linical Study Report . The PRO analysis plan will be included in the sSAP .

The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no Tier 1 events in this trial. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for b etween -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. The 95% CIfor the between - treatment differences in percentages will be provided using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. Interim and Final AnalysesThree interim analyse s areplanned for the study (oneinterim analysis for DFS and 3interim analyses for OS) . Results willbe reviewed by a n exte rnal data monitoring committee. Details areprovided inSection 10.7. IA1 oPurpose :Interim analysis forDFS and OS. oTiming: When at least 265disease recurrence events by investigator assessment have accrued and a minimum follow -up (time from last participant randomized to IA1) of 12months is achieved . Approximately 94OS events are expected at this time. IA2 oPurpose: Final analysis for DFS and interim analysis for OS oTiming: Final analysis of DFS when approximately 332DFS events by investigator assessment have accrued if DFS is not rejected at IA1 , Approximately 1 32OS events are expected at this time. IA3 oPurpose: Interim analysis for OS oTiming: When approximately 172OS events have accrued, Final analysis (FA) oPurpose: Final analysis for OS oTiming: When approximately 200OS events have accrued, Multiplicity The overall Type I error rate is strongly controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided) with a fixed sequence testing procedure to test D FS at alpha level of 2.5% (1 -sided) first and pass the alpha to OS if the hypothesis test of DFS is declared successful . A group sequential approach will be used to allocate alpha between the interim and final analyses. The study will be considered a success if DFS is demonstrated to be statistically significant under multiplicity control. Note that if the statistical criterion for success for DFS is met at an IA, a regulatory application may be submitted based on DFS for a full approval consideration and the study could still conti nue for OS. Sampl eSizeand Power The sample size was planned for 950 , but the following power calculations are based on 990, which is a number more in line with the actual final number of randomized subjects. DFS is the primary endpoint for this study .The expected median DFS time in the control group is 45months; based on 332events and a Poisson mixture cure rate model with assumed cure rate of 0.3, the study has 95% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0. 67(pembrolizumab v ersus placebo ) at alpha =2.5% (1 -sided).

Planned interim analyses are described in Section 10.7 . Blinding to treatment assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites. The results of interim analyses will not be shared with the investigators prior t o the completion of the study. Participant -level unblinding will be restricted to an external unblinded statistician and external unblinded scientific programmer performing the interim analysis, who will have no other responsibil ities associated with the study. Treatment -level results of the interim analysis will be provided by the unblinded statistician to the external d ata monitoring c ommittee ( eDMC). Limited additional Sponsor personnel may be unblinded to the treatment -level results of the interim analysis (analyses), if required, in order to act on the recommendations of the eDMC. The extent to which individuals are unblinded with respect to results of interim analyses will b e documented by the unblinded statistician. The eDMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the unblinded results of the DFS and OS at interim analyses and will make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or modification to an EO Cof the Sponsor. Depending on the recommendations of the eDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. If the eDMC recommends modifications to the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study, the EOC may be unblinded to results at the treatment level in order to evaluate and direct the Sponsor protocol team as to the appropriate actions to be taken on these recommendations. Additional logistical details, revisions to the above plan, and data monitoring guidance will be provided in the DMC Charter. Prior to final study unblinding, the unblinded statistician and unblinded scientific programmer will not be involved in any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, identification of protocol deviations, or data validation effor ts after the interim analyses.

If the curves are not parallel, indicating that hazards are not proportional, supportive analy ses may be conducted to account for the possible nonproportional hazards effect associated with immunotherapies: for example, using the Restricted Mean Survival Time method [Uno, H., et al 2014] andparametric m ethod [Odell, P.

Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs andlaboratory tests. Tiered Approach The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (T able 12). The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. Safety parameters or adverse experiences of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to infere ntial testing for statistical significance with p values and 95% CIprovided for between -group comparisons. Other safety parameters will be considered Tier 2 or Tier 3. There is no expectation of enhanced safety signal in this adjuvant study other than saf ety signals of which we are alre ady aware from past studies. Participants do not have tumor burden and their existing saf ety profile might be less intens ive. Hence, we do not expect any new safety signals. There fore there are no events of interest that will be analyzed as Tier 1 safety endpoints in this study. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CI sprovided for between -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. AEs (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) will be classified as belonging to ""Tier 2"" or ""Tier 3 ,"" based on the number of events observed. Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of the subjects in any treatment group exh ibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. 05M38T 06CHJR"

Because many 95% CIsmay be provided withou tadjustment for multiplicit y,theCIsshould be regarded asahelpful descriptive measure tobeused in review, not a formal method for assessing thestatistical significance ofthebetwee n-group differences inAEs and predefined limits ofchange. Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory values that are not prespecified as Tier 1 safety parameters will be considered Tier 3 safety parameters. Summary statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change from baseline values will be provided by treatment group in table format. In addition, the broad clinical and laboratory AE categories consisti ng of the percentage of participants with Grade 3 -5 AE (incidence ≥5% of subjects in one of the treatment groups) and SAE (incidence ≥5% of subjects in one of the treatment groups) will be c onsidered Tier 2 endpoints. The threshold of at least 5 % of subjects with events was chosen for Tier 2 Grade 3 -5 AEs and SAEs because the incidence rate would allow meaningful statistical assessments; those AEs are expected to happen less frequent than sp ecific AEs/SOCs , but important for overall safety profile assessment. The broad clinical and laboratory AE categories consisting of the percentage of subjects with any AE, any Grade 3 -5 AE, any SAE, any drug-related AE, any AE thatis both drug- related andGrade 3- 5, any AE that is both serious and drug -related, dose modification due to AE, discontinuation due to an AE, death ,and s pecific AEs or SOCs with incidence <10% of subjects in all of the treatment groups will be considered Tier 3endpoints.

For each endpoint, group sequential methods will be used to adjust for the interim and final analyses p lanned. If the DFS null hypothesis is rejected at an interim or final analysis, each OS interim and final analysis test may be compared to its rejection boundary for formal testing. For instance, the OS hypothesis will not be formally evaluated for statist ical significance until the DFS null hypothesis is rejected. For DFS, the information fraction at each analysis will be based on the final planned number of 332events.

This analysis will be performed if requested by the eDMC . However, eDMC review of DFS and OS data beyond the planned efficacy analysis to assess the overall risk:benefit to trial participants will not require multiplicity assessment typically associated with a planned efficacy IAbecause these analyses are not to declare a positive efficacy finding. Sample Size and Power Calculations The study will randomize participants in a 1 :1 ratio into the p embrolizumab and placebo arms. DFS and OS are the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint, respectively .The sampl e size was planned for 950 , but the following power calculations are based on 990 , which is a number more in line with the actual final number of randomized participants. For the DF S endpoint, based on a target number of 332 events and one IAat approximat ely 80% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 95 % power to detect a HR of 0.6 7 atan overall alpha level of 2.5% (1 -sided) . For the O S endpoint, the power is conditional on the null hypothesis of DFS being rejected, based on a target number of 200 events and 3 interim analyse s at approximately 47%, 66%, and 86% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 79% power to detect a HR of 0.67 or approximately 88% power to detect a HR of 0.635 at an overall alpha level of 2.5% (1 -sided). The above sample size and power calculations for DFS and OS assume the following: DFS follow a Poisson mixture cure rate model [de Castro, M., et al 2010] with assumed cure rate of 0.3. The cure rate of 0.3 is estimated based on historical data [Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003] . The m edian DFS is assumed to be 45months for those not cured in the control group . OS follow san exponential distribution with a median of 145 months for the control group. Enrollment period of 27months with monthly accrual of 20 pa rticipants during the first 5 months and monthly accrual of 30 pa rticipants from month 6 to month 21, and monthly accrual of 1 participant for the last month. Ayearly drop-out rate of 2%for DFS and 1% for OS . Technical details on the Poisson mixture cure rate model are in Appendix 7 . The sample size and power calculation were performed using R (package “gsDesign”). 05M38T 06CHJR"

Purpose Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the high est ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant safety is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg,contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are not under the control of Merck. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices o f Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine participant preferences, etc. The design ( ie,participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Research participant s must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participant s, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated b y Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and data disclosed accordingly. B. Publication and Authorship To the extent scientifically appropriat e, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be und erpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of multiplicity. Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH -Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribu tion to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in pub lications. 05M38T 06CHJR"
120,page_120,"Product: MK-3475 121 Protocol/Amendment No.: 564-04 MK-3475 -564-04 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2020 ConfidentialIII. Participant Protection A.IRB/ IEC review All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/ IECbefore being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/ IECprior to implementation, except that changes required urgently to protect participant safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/ IEC approval. For each site, the IRB/ IECand Merck will approve the participant informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential partici pants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Participants are never denied access to appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Participants are enrolled only after providing informed consent for participation. Participants may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality Merck is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the research participant by name. D.Genomic Research Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by an Ethics Committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor- intensive. It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performe d in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to enroll participant s in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additio nal payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. Merck does not pay for participant referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible partici pants. B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local IRB/ IECmay wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Reque sts Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical Association (AMA). V. Investigator Commitment Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. * In this document, ""Merck"" refers to Me rck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corporation, each of which is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

Furthermore, it is not known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm. For this trial, male participants will be considered to be of nonreproductive potential if they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition). Female participants will be considered of nonreproductive potential if they meet 1 of the following criteria: She is pos tmenopausal, defined as at least 12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. In women <45 years of age who are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy, a high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post menopausal state.

Participants should be informed that taking the trial medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the trial. In order to participate in the trial, participants of child bearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of trial medication initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of trial medication for oral contraception) throughout the trial period up to 120 days after th e last dose of trial medication. If there is any question that a participant of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that participant should not be entered into the trial. Pregnancy If a female participant inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab, the participant will be immediately discontinued from trial treatment. The site will contact the participant at least monthly and document the participant ’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (eg, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The trial investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male participant impregnates his female partner, the trial personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor and followed as descri bed in Section 9.3.1 ( Table 8). Use in Nursing Women It is unknown whether pembrolizumab is excreted in human milk.

In fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical trial data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing participant characteristics like gender, age, medic al history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results. To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for Future Biomedical Research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and proce dures. All specimens will be single-coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below. At the clinical trial site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the trial site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5.Biorepository Specimen Usage Specimens obtaine d for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. Analyses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may be performed by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (e.g., a university investigator) designated by the Spon sor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope of analysis outlined in the future biomedical research protocol and consent . Future Biomedical Research specimens remaining with the third party after specific analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor. 05M38T 06CHJR"

Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Participant s may withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical R esearch and ask that their biospecimens not be used for Future Biomedical Research. Participant s may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If medical records for the main trial are still available, the i nvestigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the participant 's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected fr om study participants specifically for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigat or confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the respo nsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available (e.g., if the investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 7. Retention of Specimens Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequately addressed. Specimens fr om the trial site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular trial, the trial site will ship directly to the Sponsor-designated biorepository. Th e specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in t he biorepository database. 8.Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database us er authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices b ased on international standards to protect against unauthorized access. 9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants No information ob tained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the participant , family, or physicians.

138,page_138,"Product: MK-3475 139 Protocol/Amendment No.: 564-04 MK-3475 -564-04 Final Protocol 13-Oct-2020 Confidentialparticipant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive capabili ty, and concerns regarding misinterpretation. If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidly report this information to doctors and participant s. Participant s will not be identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific publication or presentation. 10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population Every effort will be made to recruit all participant s diagnosed and treated on Sponsor clinical trials for Future Biomedical Research. 11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized. No additional risks to the participant have been identified as no additional specimens are being collected for Future Biomedical Research (ie, only leftover samples are being retained). The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies and procedures to address participant data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation there is risk that the information, like all medical information, may be misused. 12.Question s Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e -mailed directly to clinical.specimen.management@merck.com. 13.References 1.

The latter pa rticipants are called long -term survivor s. The Poisson mixture model assumes a survival function [de Castro, M., et al 2010] for a control group (c) as a function of time (t), as follows : where θ= –log(Cure_Rate) , λ is a constant hazard rate, and t≥0. Inthe adjuvant setting, according to the publi shed literature [Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003] and study assumption s, ~30% participants will be long -term survivor sor will be cured in the long-term (ie, Cure_Rate =0.3) ,and it is more likely that after approximately 5to 6years after study initiation there will be m inimalaccumulation of DFS events. According to the published literature [Leibovich, B. C., et al 2003] , it is assume dthat D FS follows a Poisson mixture model distribution with median DFS of 45months in the placebo group .Figure 3below shows the DFS curves using the Poisson mixture model and exponential model . Compared to t he curve from the exponential model, t he curve from the Poisson mixture model looks more similar to the curve in the published literature.

(2) Changed α -spending function for primary DFS from Hwang -Shih- DeCani (HSD) spending function with = -15 to Lan-DeMets O’Brien- Fleming spending approximation α- spending function .(1) IA1 will be triggered by achieving approximately 265 DFS events by investigator and 12 months minimum follow up to ensure data maturity for the first IA; The trigger for IA2 is updated based on an increased total number of 332 DFS events by investigator to allow more mature DFS data and increased probability of success at the final analysis of DFS to align with the extended enrollment period and the actual number of randomized subjects. Replaced the wording of ‘at least 265 DFS events’ by ‘approximately 265 DFS events’ to allow some flexibility in the IA 1 timing for this event -driven study.

Study Design Overview This is a randomized, double- blind, multicenter Phase III trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus placebo as an adjuvant treatment for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) post nephrectomy. Treatm entAssignment Approximately 950 participa nts will be randomized 1:1 into the following two treatment arms: pembrolizumab 200 mg or matching placebo (saline 200 mg infusion) administered intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (Q3W). Stratification factors are provided in protocol Section 7.3.1. Analys isPopulations Efficacy: Intentio n-to- Treat Safety: AllParticipants asTreated PrimaryEndpoints Disease -free survival (DFS) as assessed by the investigator Key Secondary EndpointsOverall survival (OS) Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary and secondary hypotheses addressing DFS and OS will be evaluated by comparing pembrolizumab to placebo using a stratified log-rank test. Estimation of thehazar dratio will bedone using a stratified Cox regression model.Event rates over time will beestimate dwithi n each treatment group using theKaplan -Meier method. Statistical Methods for Key Safety AnalysesThe analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach. The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no Tier 1 events in this trial. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) provided for between -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 s afety parameters. The 95% CI for the between -treatment differences in percentages will be provided using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. 05P4KQ 06DTS8"
149,page_149,"MK-3475 PAGE 10 PROTOCOL NO. 564-04 Supplemental SAP 22 DEC 2020 –AMENDMENT #4 Interim and Final AnalysesThree interim analyses are planned for the study (one interim analysis for DFS and three interim analyses for OS). Results willbe reviewed by an external data monitoring committee. Details areprovided inSection 10.7. First Interim Analysis (IA1) oPurpose : Interim analysis for DFS and OS. oTiming: When approximately 265disease recurrence events by investigator assessment have accrued and a minimum follow - up (time from last participant randomized to IA1) of 12 months is achieved . Approximately 94 OS events are expected at this time. Second Interim Analysis (IA2) oPurpose: Final analysis for DFS and interim analysis for OS oTiming: Final analysis of DFS when approximately 332 DFS events by investigator assessment have accrued if DFS is not rejected at IA1 , Approximately 1 32OS events are expected at this time. Third Interim Analysis (IA3) oPurpose: Interim analysis for OS oTiming: When approximately 172OS events have accrued, Final analysis (FA) oPurpose: Final analysis for OS oTiming: When approximately 200OS events have accrued, Multiplicity The overall Type I error rate is strongly controlled at 2.5% (1 -sided) with a fixed sequence testing procedure to test DFS at alpha level of 2.5% (1-sided) first and pass the alpha to OS if the hypothesis test of DFS is declared successful. A group sequential approach will be used to allocate alpha between the interim and final analyses. The study will be considered a success if DFS is demonstrated to be statistically significant under multiplicity control. Note that if the statistical criterion for success for DFS is met at an IA, a regulatory application may be submitted based on DFS for a full approval consideration and the study could still conti nue for OS. Sampl eSizeand Power The sample size was planned for 950 but the following power calculations are based on 990 which is a number more in line with the actual final number of randomized subjects. DFS is the primary endpoint for this study. The expected median DFS time for those not cured in the control group is 45 months; based on 332events and a Poisson mixture cure rate model with assumed cure rate of 0.3, the study has 9 5% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.67 (pembrolizumab versus placebo) at alpha = 2.5% (1 -sided). 3.2 RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANALYSES/IN- HOUSE BLINDING The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will generate the randomized allocation schedule(s) for study treatment assignment. Randomization will be implemented in IVRS/IWRS. This study will be conducted as a double -blind study under in- house bli nding procedures. The official, final database will not be unblinde d until medical/scientific review has been performed, protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and 05P4KQ 06DTS8"

In addition, blinded independent central imag ing review will be performed on imaging scans without knowledge of the treatment group assignments of participants. Planned interim analyses are described in Section 3.7. Blinding to treatment assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites. The results of interim analyses will not be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study. Participant -level unblinding will be restricted to an external unblinded statistician and external unblinded scientific programmer performing the interim analysis, who will have no other responsibilities associated with the study. Blinding issues related to the planned interim analyses are described in Section 3.7. 3.3 HYPOTHESES/ESTIMATION Objective/Hypothesis Endpoint(s) Primary ●Objective: To compare DFS as assessed by the investigator for participants treated with pembrolizumab versus those receiving placebo Hypothesis: Pembrolizumab is superior to placebo with respect to DFS●DFS as assessed by the investigator : time from randomization to the first documented local recurrence, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

All randomized participants will be included in this population. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they are randomized. Details on the approach to handling missing data are provided in Section 3.6.1 –Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses. 3.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations The All Participants as Treated (APaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participa nts will be analyzed in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actually received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT population. For most participants this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Participants who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment actually received. Any participant who receives the incorrect study treatment for one cycle but receives the correct treatment for all other cycles will be analyzed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the participant is incorrectly dosed. At least 1 laboratory measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1 dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analysis of specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. Details on the approach to handling missing data for safety analyses are provided in Section 3.6.2– Statistical Methods for Safety Analysis. 05P4KQ 06DTS8"

Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they are randomized. 3.6 STATISTICAL METHODS 3.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary objectives on OS and disease recurrence specific survival. Separate analysis plans may be developed for PK/ADA modeling analysis, biomarker analysis, and genetic data analysis. Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type I error control strategy are described in Section 3.8 –Multiplicity. Nominal p values may be computed for other efficacy analyses, but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of mult iplicity. 3.6.1.1 Disease -Free Survival ( DFS) The non-parametric Kapla n-Meier method will beused toestimate theDFScurve ineach treatment group. Thehypotheses addressing a treatment difference inDFSwillbetested bythestratified log-rank test.

The HRand its95% CIfrom thestratified Cox model with Efron's metho doftiehandling andwith asingle treatmen tcovariate will be reported. The stratification factors including Metastasis status (M0 versus M1 NED), ECOG PS (0 versus 1) and US participant (YES versus NO) willbeapplied toboth the stratified log- rank testandthestratified Cox model . Since participants enrolled with baseline disease by BICR could have a different time to event distribution compared to participants who were disease free at baseline by BICR, a sensitivity analysis will be performed using the stratified Cox model and stratified log-rank testwith stratification factors used for randomization with baseline disease status by BICR as an additional stratum. Specifically, a total of six strata will be used: M0+ ECOG PS 0 + US participant vs. M0 + ECOG PS 0 + Non -US participant vs. M0 + ECOG PS 1 + US participant vs. M0 + ECOG PS 1 + Non- US participant vs. M1 NED vs. M1 by BICR. In addition, DFS by BICR will be analyzed as a sensitivity analysis in which partic ipants enrolled with baseline disease by BICR will be censored at randomization date . Since the trial was ongoing during the outbreak of COVID -19, sensitivity analyses are planned to evaluate the impact of COVID- 19 on primary DFS analysis if there are more than 5% of randomized participants who were censored at last disease assessment due to COVID- 19 resulted missing imaging scans . In order to stress -test the assumption of censored at random with an assumption that favors the placebo group over the experim ental treatment group , we will assume COVID- 19 related censoring in the experimental treatment group is informative of impending DFS event, while the censoring in the placebo group is non-informative. 05P4KQ 06DTS8"
156,page_156,"MK-3475 PAGE 17 PROTOCOL NO. 564-04 Supplemental SAP 22 DEC 2020 –AMENDMENT #4 Specifically, we will randomly select a certain percent age (δ) ofCOVID- 19 related censoring and count them as events at the censoring time in the experimental group, while keep all COVID- 19 related censoring as censored in placebo group. A series of sensitivity analyses could be performed with increasing values of δ to assess whether the primary DFS analysis results are robust to the deviations from censored at random assumption for the COVID- 19 related censoring. Since disease recurrence isassessed periodically, disease recurrence canoccur any time inthe time interval between thelastassessme ntwhen disease recurrence was notdocumented and the assessment whendisease recurrence isdocumented .For the primary analysis, for the participants who have disease recurrence (local recurrence or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es)) as assessed by the investigator’s review, the true date of disease recurrence will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which disease recurrence is objectively documented, regardless of discontinuation of study treatment. Death isalwa ys considered as a confirmed disease recurrence event. In order to evaluate the robustness of the DFS endpoint, a sensitivity analysis with a different set of censoring rules may be performed. The sensitivit y analysis is the same as the primary analysis except that events after 2 consecutive missed disease assessments or after new anti-cancer therapy, if any,should be censored at last disease assessment prior to the earlier date of ≥2 consecutive missed disease assessments and new anti -cancer therapy. The censoring rules forprimar y andsensitivit yanalysis aresummarized in Table 1.

The log [-log] of the survival function versus time for DFS will be plotted for the comparison between pembrolizumab and the placebo arm. If the curves are not parallel, indicating that hazards are not proportional, supportive analyses may be conducted to account for the possible non-proportional hazards effect associated with immunotherapies: for example, using the Restricted Mean Survival Time method [1]and 05P4KQ 06DTS8"

The RMST is simply the population average of the amount of event - free survival time experienced during a fixed study follow -up time. This quantity can be estimated by the area under the Kaplan -Meier curve up to the follow -up time. The clinical relevance and feasibility should be taken into account in the choice of follow -up time to define RMST (e.g., near the last observed event time assuming that the period of clinical interest in the survival experience isthe whole observed follow -up time for the trial, but avoiding the very end of the tail where variability may be high); a description of the RMST as a function of the cutoff time may be of interest. The difference between two RMSTs for the two treatment groups will be estimated and 95% CI will be provided. A sensitivity analysis may be performed based on the MaxCombo test with logrank FH (0, 1), FH (1, 1) at the final analysis of DFS to account for the potential loss of power with logrank test when the prop ortional hazard assumption is violated. 3.6.1.2 Overall Survival (OS) The non-parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The hypotheses of treatment difference in survival will be tested by the stratified log -rank test. A stratif ied Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization will be applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. The proportional hazards assumption on OS may be examined using both graphical and analytical methods if warranted. The log [-log] of the survival function vs. time for OS will be plotted for the comparison between pembrolizumab and the placebo arm . If the curves are not parallel, indicating that hazards are not proportional, supportive analyses may be conducted to account for the possible non -proportional hazards effect associated with immunotherapies: for example, using the Restricted Mean Survival Time method [1], parametric method [2], etc. The RMST is simply the population average of the amount of event -free survival time experienced during a fixed study follow -up time.

For DRSS1, only local recurrence is counted as an event. Death, or occurrence of distant kidney cancer metastasis(es) will be censored at documented date of disease metastasis or death, whichever occurs first. For DRSS2, only disease recurrence with visceral lesion is counted as an event. Death, local recurrence without visceral lesion, distant metastasis without visceral lesion will be censored at documented date of disease recurrence or death, whichever occurs first . 3.6.1.4 Event -Free Survival The non-parametric Kapla n-Meier method will beused toestimate theEFS curve ineach treatment group.

Tiered Approach The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach (Table 3). The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. Safety parameters or adverse experiences of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance with p values and 95% CIprovided for between -group comparisons. Other safety parameters will be considered Tier 2 or Tier 3. There is no expectation of enhanced safety signal in this adjuvant study other than safety signals of which we are alre ady aware from past studies. Participants do not have tumor burden and their existing safety profile might be less intensive. Hence, we do not expect any new safety signals. There fore there are no events of interest that will be analyzed as Tier 1safety endpoints in this study. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for between -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. Tier 2 Events Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for differences in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method [3]. Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population enrolled in this study is in critical condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; events reported less frequently than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs (≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and SAEs (≥5% of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not as a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences. Tier 3 Events Safety endpoints that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. The broad AE categories consisting of the proportion of participants with any AE, a drug related AE, a serious AE, an AE which is both drug-related and serious, a Grade 3-5 AE, a drug-related Grade 3-5 AE, and discontinuation due to an AE will be considered Tier 3 endpoints. Only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. 05P4KQ 06DTS8"

Numbers and percentages of complete and missing data at each visit will be summarized. An instrument is considered complete if at least one valid score is available according to the missing item rules outlined in the scoring manual for the instrument. Completion rate of treated participants (CR-T) at a specific time point is defined as the number of treated participants who complete at least one item over the number of treated participants in the PRO analysis population.

To assess the treatment effects on the PRO score change from baseline in the global health status/QoL and its physical functioning, nausea and vomiting symptom, diarrhea symptom, FKSI-DRS, EQ-5D-5L VAS outcome a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model proposed by Liang and Zeger [4] will be applied, with the PRO score as the response variable,and treatment by time interaction and stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 7.3.1) as covariates. The treatment difference in terms of least square (LS) mean change from baseline will be estimated from this model together with 95% CI. Model-based LS mean with 95% CI will be provided by treatment group for PRO scores at baseline and post-baseline time point. The cLDA model assumes a common mean across treatment groups at baseline and a different mean for each treatment at each of the post-baseline time points. In this model, the response vector consists of baseline and the values observed at each post-baseline time point. Time is treated as a categorical variable so that no restriction is imposed on the trajectory of the means over time. The cLDA model is specified as follows: ܧ൫ܻ ௜௝௧൯ൌߛ଴൅ߛ௝௧ܫሺݐ൐ 0ሻ൅ܺߚ௜,݆ൌ 1,2; ݐൌ 0,1,2,3, . . ݇ where Yijtis the PRO score for participant i, with treatment assignment jat visit t; γ0is the baseline mean for all treatment groups, γjtis the mean change from baseline for treatment group jat time t; Xiis the stratification factor (binary) vector for this participant, and βis the coefficient vector for stratification factors. An unst ructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. If the unstructured covariance model fails to converge with the default algorithm, then Fisher scoring algorithm or other appropriate methods can be used to provide initial values of the covariance parameters.

Depending on the recommendations of the eDMC, the Sponsor may prepare a regulatory submission. If the eDMC recommends modifications to the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study, the EOC may be unblinded to results at the treatment level in order to evaluate and direct the Sponsor protocol team as to the appropriate actions to be taken on these recommendations. Additional logistical details, revisions to the above plan, and data monitoring guidance will be provided in the DMC Charter. Prior to final study unblinding, the unblinded statistician and unblinded scientific programmer will not be involved in any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods, identification of protocol deviations, or data validation efforts after the interim analyses.

In this study, the futility bounds are non-binding . Results of the interim analyses (IA) will be reviewed by an eDMC. If both DFS and OS null hypotheses are rejected prior to the final analysis, the eDMC may recommend stopping the trial early for efficacy. At each IA, the eDMC may also recommend stopping the trial early for futility. Details on how the above planned analyses are incorporated into establishing statistical significance and the boundaries with regard to efficacy and futility are discussed further in Section 3.8, Multiplicity.

The weights for reallocation from each hypothesis to the others are represented in the boxes on the lines connecting hypotheses. This is further explained below. Figure 1 Multiplicity Graph for Type I E rror Control of Study Hypotheses If the DFS null hypothesis is rejected at the 2.5% level, then the OS null hypothesis may be formally evaluated for statistical significance at the 2.5% level. For each endpoint, group sequential methods will be used to adjust for the interim and final analyses planned. If the DFS null hypothesis is rejected at an interim or final analysis, each OS interim and final analysis test may be compared to its rejection boundary for formal testing. For instance, the OS hypothesis will not be formally evaluated for statistical significance until the DFS null hypothesis is rejected.

This analysis will be performed if requested by the eDMC. However, eDMC review of DFS and OS data beyond the planned efficacy analysis to assess the overall risk:benefit to trial participants will not require multiplicity assessment typically associated with a planned efficacy IAbecaus e these analyses are not to declare a positive efficacy finding. 3.9 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATIONS The study will randomize participants in a 1:1 ratio into the p embrolizumab and placebo arms. DFS and OS are the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint , respectively. The sample size was planned for 950 but the following power calculations are based on 990 which is a number more in line with the actual final number of randomized participants. For the DFS endpoint, based on a target number of 332 events a nd one IA at approximately 80% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 95% power to detect a HRof 0.67 at an overall alpha level of 2.5% (1 -sided) . For the OS endpoint, the power is conditional on the null hypothesis of DFS being rejected, based on a target number of 200events and three interim analyses at approximately 47%, 66%, and 86% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 79% power to detect a HR of 0.67 or approximately 88% power to detect a HR of 0.635 at anoverall alpha level of 2.5% (1 -sided). 05P4KQ 06DTS8"
168,page_168,"MK-3475 PAGE 29 PROTOCOL NO. 564-04 Supplemental SAP 22 DEC 2020 – AMENDMENT #4 The above sample size and power calculations for DFS and OS assume the following: •DFS follow a Poisson mixture cure rate model [7] with assumed cure rate of 0.3. The cure rate of 0.3 is estimated based on historical data [8]. •The median DFS is assumed to be 45 months for those not cured in the control group . •OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 145 months for the control group. •Enrollment period of 27 months with monthly accrual of 20 participants during the first 5 months and monthly accrual of 30 participants from month 6 to month 21, and monthly accrual of 1 patient for the last month. •A yearly drop-out rate of 2% for DFS and 1% for OS. The Poisson mixture model is applied to account for the failure rates decreasing over time in a trial in which the patient population is a mixture of patients who are susceptible to disease recurrence and patients who would not have a di sease recurrence event after long-term follow- up. The latter patients are called long-term survivors. The Poisson mixture model assumes a survival function [5] for a control group (c) as a function of time t, as follows: Sሺtሻൌexp ሺെθሺ1െexpሺെλtሻሻሻ, where ) _ log( Rate Cure−=θ ,λis a constant hazard rate, and 0≥t . In the adjuvant setting, according to the published literature [8] and study assumptions, ~30% participants will be long-term survivors or will be cured in the long-term (ie, Cure_Rate=0.3), and it is more likely that after approximately 5 to 6 years after study initiation there will be minimal accumulation of DFS events. According to the published literature [8], it is assumed that DFS follows a Poisson mixture model distribution with median DFS of 45 months for those not cured in the placebo group. Figure 2 below shows the DFS curves using the Poisson mixture model and exponential model. Compared to the curve from the exponential model, the curve from the Poisson mixture model looks more similar to the curve in the published literature.  3.4 '76"

The consistency of the treatment effect will be assessed using descriptive statistics for each category of the subgroup variables listed above. If the number of participants in a category of a subgroup variable is less than 5% of the ITT population, the subgroup analysis will not be performed for this category of the subgroup variable. The subgroup analyses will be conducted using an unstratified Cox model. 3.11 COMPLIANCE (MEDICATION ADHERENCE) Drug accountab ility data for study treatment will be collected during the study.
