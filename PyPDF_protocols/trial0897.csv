TAVR has been established as a safe and effective treatment option for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at intermediate, high and extremely high risk for surgical aortic valv e replacement [2-8]. The Medtronic CoreValve TAVR sys tem received the CE Mark in 200 7, and FDA approval in 2014. To date, over 65,000 patients have been im planted with the Medtronic Cor eValve system in ove r 70 countries, with more than 20,000 of these patient s enrolled in post-approval re gistries or clinical studies that further confirm the safety and performan ce of the CoreValve device. The re is extensive published experience demonstrating the CoreValve system is fulfilling its intended r ole with a favorable risk/benefit ratio [9-13]. Rigorous clinical studies have established its safety and effec tiveness, with improved mortality and quality of life compared with medical t herapy in extreme risk patients [6], superiority to SAVR among high operative risk patients [7] and noninferiority to surgery in pa tients at intermediate surgical risk [8]. As experience with early generation TAVR devices increased, sig nificant improvements in TAVR outcomes were achieved due to better patient selection, increasing opera tor experience, and it erations in device technology, important issues rem ained to be addressed, includin g the occurrence of major procedural complications [14-16], stroke [17, 18], paravalvular aortic reg urgitation [19, 20], vascular complications [21, 22] and need for new permanent p acemaker implantation [23-26]. To this end, Medtronic developed modifications to the CoreValve frame and delivery catheter system to enable resheathing or full recapture of the device before relea se from the delivery system. These modifications were incorporated in the CoreValve Evolut R syste m (hereafter “Evolut R system”). The ability to resheath or recapture the devi ce allows the operator to repo sition or remove the bioprosthesis if the initial implant positioning was sub-optimal (too high or too lo w). This feature is desirable in that it facilitates accurate final positioning, which has been shown to mitigate ri sks associated with sub-optimal positioning such as paravalvular leak [27, 28] acute migration [16] and AV- conduction disturbance related to implant depth [23]. A comprehensive protocol of bench and animal testing of the Evo lut R system has d emonstrated its functionality and has confirmed that changes to enable recaptur e have not impacted the structural integrity, hydrodynamic performa nce, or durability of the CoreV alve bioprosthesis. Beginning in October 2013, clinical studies of the Evol ut 23R, 26R and 29R valve siz es involving 301 patients have been conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Europ e, and the United States. Thes e clinical studies confirmed that TAVR with the Evolut R system ca n be performed with an acceptable inciden ce of procedural and device-related complications, that short term safety and clinical efficacy of the Evolut R system are similar to the predicate CoreValve system, and there are no new safety risks associated with the use of the resheath/recapture feature. Results from these studi es were used to gain the CE Ma rk in February 2015 for the Evolut 26R and"

Subsequently, the Evolut R 34 mm size was approved for use in the United States a nd Europe. In order to continue striving for improvement with TAVR systems , Medtronic developed additional modifications to the Medtronic E volut R system. The next-genera tion Evolut PRO syst em represents an enhancement to the Evolut R system and the latest Medtronic TAV R technology. The Evolut PRO TAVs feature a porcine pericardial ti ssue wrap on the outside of the frame (outer wrap) that covers the first 1.5 cells of the inflow portion of t he TAV. The wrap is designed to reduce paravalvular leak (PVL). As the outer wrap has been added to the inflow portion of the TAV, a minor d esign modification has been made to the LS inflow cone to reduce friction during loading of the TAV. Th e clinical configuration of this iteration to Evolut R was called the Medtroni c TAVR 2.0 system (TAVR 2.0). Medtronic completed a comprehensive protocol of bench testing t hat collectively demonstrated the functionality of TAVR 2.0, and th at the changes associated with the modification to the valve did not impact the structural integrity, hydrod ynamic performance, or durabili ty of the TAVR 2.0 bioprosthesis. The next generation device was approved in US for use in clinical trials in March 2016 under the name of Medtronic TAVR 2.0 System and with comme rcial approval in March 2017 was branded as “Evolut PRO system”. In July 2017, the Medtronic CoreV alve, Evolut R, and Evolut PRO systems were approved for use in the United States for subjects at intermediate risk for SAVR. In January 2018, FDA approved var ious minor modifications to th e EnVeo R Delivery C atheter System (DCS) and EnVeo R Loading System (LS). The devices, as modified, are marketed under the trade name EnVeo PRO Delivery Catheter System and EnVe o PRO Loading System. With the se changes, the most current generation of Medtronic TAVR technology bec ame the Evolut PRO system for 2 3mm, 26mm and 29mm sizes used with the EnVeo PRO DCS and LS. Evolut R TAV 34mm is the most current generation of the 34 mm and is also compatible with the EnVeo P RO DCS and EnVeo PRO LS. Over time, regulatory approvals have been received for use of M edtronic TAVR in several additional patient populations (eg, transcatheter ao rtic valve (TAV) in failed aor tic bioprosthesis, end st age renal disease, and patients with severe AS but prese nting with low gradient and lo w flow) who were not included in the original Medtronic TAVR clinical studies. Another subset of pat ients excluded from the original Medtronic TAVR studies were patients prese nting with symptomatic severe a ortic stenosis and congenital bicuspid aortic anatomy. It is reported t hat over 50% of all surgical ao rtic valve replacements are due to bicuspid aortic valve disease [29], 6% of the general population over 85 years has a bicuspid valve and 2-year mortality for these subjects fo llowing presentation of aortic s tenosis symptoms with no treatment is 50% [30]. In their 2014 paper, Colo mbo and Latib reported the preva lence of bicuspid ao rtic anatomy among patients presenting for SAVR in their 80 s and 90s as 18% and 22 %, respectively [31]. C urrent literature does not provide specific information regarding the prevalence of bi cuspid aortic valve an atomy among patients considered at low risk for SAV R. However, in their 2012 paper, Roberts et al reported a prevalence of bicuspid aortic valves in 51% of p atients between the ages of 5 1 and 79 who underwent SAVR [56]."

Wijesinghe and colleagues [ 32] evaluated 11 high-risk pati ents with a bicuspid aortic valve treated with a balloon-expanded TAV. They fou nd that 27% and 14% of subject s experienced grade 2+ paravalvular leak (PVL) at post-procedure and at 1 year, respectively. Mortality was reported as 7% at 30 days and 36% at the 1 year. At 1 year, all surv iving subjects were either NYHA class I or II. Similarly, Himbert and colleagues examined 15 bicuspid aortic valve patients deemed to be high-ri sk implanted with a self-expanding TAV [33]. They reported that 7% of s ubjects experienced grade 2+ PV L post-procedure. Mortality was reported as 7% at 30 days and 13% at a mea n follow-up time of 8 months a nd of the surviving patients at 8 months, 79% were in either NYHA class I o r II. Two other studies examin ing a total of 247 bi cuspid patients who received a TAV reported 1-year mortality as 18% and 17% [34, 35 ]. These studies have reported permanent pacemaker implant rates from 1 9-40% [33-35]. The 30-day post im plant rate of ш grade 2 PVL was 28.4%; however, it was only 17.4% in patients that had MSCT-based sizi ng used to determine the appropriate valve size. As an extension of the establishe d use of the Medtronic TAVR sy stem in extreme, high, and intermediate risk severe aortic stenosis pati ents, Medtronic initiated the T AVR in Low Risk Patient s IDE in March 2016. The low risk IDE is ongoing and will evaluate the safety and ef fectiveness of the Medtronic TAVR system in tricuspid aortic valve patients with aortic stenosis who are at low predicted risk for mortality with SAVR. The current study will be conducte d under the Medtronic TAVR in Low Risk Patients IDE and will evaluate the procedural safety and effica cy of Medtronic TAVR (Evolut PR O system and Evolut R system) in patients with severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis who are at low predi cted risk of mortality with SAVR.

However, patients with bicuspid aortic valve anatomy were excl uded from these pivotal studies. Anatomical differences between b icuspid and tricuspid aortic va lves include increased annular ellipticity; asymmetrical, bulky and heavily c alcified leaflets, and commiss ural fusion in bicuspid patients [31]. These anatomical differences can present challenges for TAVR systems and can impact positioning of the prosthetic valve within the annulus, expansion of valve frame, and sealing of valve annulus [31]. The bicuspid aortic valve anatomy d ifferences could theoretically l ead to sub-optimal procedural outcomes resulting in higher ra tes of procedural mortality, stroke, para valvular regurgitation, or implantation of multiple devices. Therefore, the impact of the anatomical diffe rences between bicuspid and tricuspid aortic valve anatomies on the clinical performance of TAVR systems can be assessed by evaluating procedural and short term (30 day) clinical outcomes."

In addition, similar one and two-year mortality rate s have been reported for patients with bicuspid and tr icuspid aortic valve anatomy [ 37, 38]. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that if the procedural outcomes are similar between patients wi th bicuspid and tricuspid anatomies, outcomes beyond the procedural period will be similar. Therefore, the primary endpoints in this study measured at 30 d ays will effectively assess the clinical performance in patients with bicuspid aortic valve anatomy. The endpoints are clinically relevant and address the most important procedural safety and efficacy aspec ts of the Medtronic TAVR System in subjects with bicuspid aortic valves.

Medtronic has determined the Medtronic TAVR sys tem to be a significant risk medical devi ce. Therefore, Medtronic is sponsoring this clinical study to support approv als for the use of the Medtroni c TAVR system to patients with aortic stenosis at low risk for 30-day mortality for SAVR and with bic uspid aortic anatomy. Risks As with any TAVR procedure, there are risks associated with par ticipation in this study. However, the risks to a patient for participation i n this study are not materially different than those a patient would incur if they underwent TAVR outside of this study. TAVR has been associated with se rious complications, including death. In addition, complications may occur at varying intervals necessitating re-intervention or surgical replacement of the TAV. Known complications that may result from TAVR include but are not limited to the fo llowing: xDeath xCardiac arrest xCoronary occlusion, obstruction, or vessel spasm (including acu te coronary closure) xUrgent surgery (eg, coronary art ery bypass, heart valve replace ment, valve explant) xMulti-organ failure xHeart failure or low cardiac output xMyocardial infarction xCardiogenic stroke xRespiratory insufficiency or respiratory failure xCardiovascular injury (including rupture, perforation, or disse ction of vessels, ventricles, myocardium, or valvular structures that may require intervention) xPerforation of the myocardium or a vessel xStroke or other neurological deficits xTransient ischemic attack xPermanent disability xUrgent need for balloon valvulopl asty (note that BAV during imp lantation is expected) xUrgent need for Percutaneous C oronary Intervention (PCI) xMajor or minor bleeding that may or may not require transfusion or intervention (including life- threatening or disabling bleeding) xRespiratory insufficiency or respiratory failure"

TAVR with the Medtronic TAVR system has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at intermediate risk through extreme risk for operative mortality with SAVR. 5LVN%HQHILW5DWLRQDOH TAVR is now established as a saf e and effective treatment optio n for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are at inter mediate, high and extremely hig h risk for surgical aortic valve replacement [2-8]. The Medtronic CoreValve system has been used widely afte r receiving the CE Mar k in 2007, and there is extensive published experience demonstrating the CoreValve s ystem is fulfilling its intended role with a favorable risk/benefit ratio [9- 13]. Rigorous clinical studies have established its safety and effectiveness, with improved mortality and quali ty of life compared with medic al therapy in extreme risk patients [6], superiority to SAVR among high o perative risk patients [7] and noninferiority to surgery in patients at intermediate surgical risk [8]. The Evolut R and Evolut PRO syste ms are built upon the same fun damental design principles and mode of operation as the predicate Medtronic CoreValve System. The Evol ut R system introduces the feature of recapturability, and the Evolut P RO system builds upon Evolut R and introduces a design feature for reduction of paravalvular regurgi tation. A comprehensive protoc ol of bench and an imal testing has indicated the Evolut R and PRO s ystems are equivalent to the Co reValve system in terms of structural integrity, hydrodynamic perfor mance, and valve durability. Clin ical studies of the Evolut R and PRO system have confirmed the safety and effi cacy of the Evolut R and PRO systems to be equivalent to the CoreValve system, with no new clinical ris ks associated [40-42]. Further, no new Zone III risks were identified for patients with bicuspid aortic val ve anatomy through Risk Analys is [43]. The risks and benefits of the Medt ronic TAVR systems in low ris k patients are expected to be similar to those at intermediate through ex treme risk for SAVR. The Medtr onic TAVR Low Risk IDE trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of t he Medtronic TAVR systems in t ricuspid aortic valve patients with aortic stenosis who are at low predicted risk for mortality with SAVR. This study will be conducted under the Medtronic TAVR Low Risk IDE, a nd will evaluate the procedural s afety and efficacy of Medtronic TAVR (Evolut PRO system and Evolut R system) in patients with severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis who are at low predicted risk of mo rtality with SAVR."
