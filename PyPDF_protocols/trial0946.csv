The primary mechanism of the anti- inflammatory effect of crisabo role is through inhibition of PDE -4. Crisaborole has demonstrated in vitro i nhibition of a range of cy tokines implicat edin the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD ). Crisaborol e inhibits the release of chemokines that are also importa nt inflammatory mediators. Crisa borol e applied to human skin ex vivo or on AD lesions on a sub ject reduces express ion of key drivers of at opic inflammation including T -cell derived cy tokines IL - 13,IL-31, and interferon gamma (IFN ) as well as innate markers of inflammatio n such as matri x metalloproteinase (MMP)12. Supporting evidence of the safet yand efficacy of this product in patients 2years and older represent a major advancement in the treatm ent of AD given the challenges of managing this common, ch ronic dermatologic condition and the treatment limiting effects of currently available therapie s. All prima ry and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the tw o Phase 3 regi stration studies. Across the development program, crisabo role demonstrated an accepta ble safetyprofile, with no crisaborole treatment related Serious A dverse Events (SAEs) and with the majority of Adverse Events (AEs) being mild and deemed unlikel y or no t related to investigational product. In this China and Japan study , a similar st udy design to the two global pivotal studies (AN2728 -AD-301 and AN2728- AD -302) will be used to inve stigate the efficacy and safety of crisaborole ointment, 2% twice dail y (BID ) in Chinese and Japanese pediatric an d adult subjects ( ages 2 years an d old er) with mild to moderate AD, to support the registration of crisaboro le in C hina and Japan . Objectives and Endpoints: Prim ary Objectives Prim ary Endpoint(s) To ev aluate the efficacy of crisaborole ointment, 2% applie d BID versus Vehicle in Chinese and Japanese pediatric and adu lt subjects (ages 2 years and older) w ith mild to moderate AD. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of crisaborole ointment, 2% applied B IDversus Vehicle in Chinese and J apanese pediatric an d adult subjects (ages 2 years and older) w ith mild to mo derate AD.Efficacy endpoint: Percent Chan gefrom Baseline (BL) in Eczem a Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at Day 29. Safety endpoint: TEAEs (including application site reactions )& SA Es, a nd clinically significant changes in vital signs and clin ical laborato ry para meters."

The primar y mechanism of th e anti - inflammatory effect of crisaborole is through inhibition of PDE -4. Crisaborole has demonstrated in vitro inhibition of a range of cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Crisaborole inhibits the release of chemokines that are also important in flammatory mediators. Crisaborole applied to human skin ex vivo or on AD lesions on a subject reduces expression of key drivers of atopic inflammation including T- cell derived cy tokines IL -13, IL-31, and IFN as well as innate markers of inflammation such as MMP -12. Crisaborole ointment, 2% (weight b y weight) (20 mg/g) (referred to as crisaborole hereafter), is an approved therap y in the United States (US) and Canada (EUCRI SA®), and Israel and Australia (STAQUI S®) as a topical treatmen t therapy in pati ents2 years of age and older with mild -to-moderate AD. I t is currentl y being developed worldwide as a topical therap y for patients with mild to moderate AD. 1.2.Background AD, also referred to as eczema, is a chronic and relapsing disease affecting an incre asin g number of patients. Although AD affects patients of all ages, it is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the United States (US) with 85% of affected individuals showing signs of the dis ease before 5 years of age.1,2 Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in industrialized, temperate countries such as the U S and Japan.3,4 The prevalence rate of atopic dermatitis is graduall y increasing in recent 20 years in China and the total prevalence rate in the school age populati on 6-20 years old was0.69% in 19985and the prevalence rate in the preschool age children (1 - 7years) in 10 cities was 2.78% in 2002,6however, the epidemiological survey in Shanghai district in 2012 revealed that the prevalence rate was up to 8.3% in the 3-6years old children,7a recent national survey revealed that the prevalence of AD was 12.94% in the 1 - 7years old chi ldren by clinical diagnosis of dermatologists.8 AD is a distinctive inflammatory , highl y pruritic, chronic eczematous condition that usually occurs in people who have a personal or family history of other atopi c conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis.1,4 The majority of patients (up to 90%) with AD present with mild to moderate disease.9 Manifestation of the disease includes intense pruritus, ery thematous papules, excoriation, exudation, lichenification, and bacterial colonization.10 Continuous"

AD is often associated with other conditions including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy .11,12 Theburden of the clinical sy mptoms of AD coupled with the stigma associated with highly visible skin lesions correlates with significant morbidity and extensive impairments on health related quality of life measures (HRQOL) for patients, esp eciall y in childr en, and caregivers.1,13,14,15 Psy chosocial problems, depre ssion, and anxiet y are associated with AD in both adults and children.16 The negative impact on HRQOL caused by childhood AD exceeds that in asthma, epileps y, and diabetes, is comparable to that in renal disease or cy stic fibros is, and is equal (child) or exceeds (parents) that in psoriasis.2,14,17 The hallmark symptom of itching causes scratchin g which is associated with sleep disturbance in greater than 60% of patients. Sleep deprivation leads to phy sical and mental exhaustion in patients and other famil y members resulting in loss of concentration and impaired performance at sc hool or work.18 ,19 AD is often associated with significant childhood behavioral problems and ps ychological disorders including depression, attention deficit hy peract ivity disorder, a nxiety, stress, and autism.16 Preschool children with AD show a significant increase in behavioral s ymptoms compared with matched controls.21 Absol on et al22reported that the rate of ps ychological disturbance in school age children with AD doubled compared with matched controls. For older children with AD, in addition to problems associated with itching and sleep disturb ance, their social and school life may be substantially affected. Social embarrassment, due to visible signs of the disease (crusted, excoriated, oozing, bleeding lesions), teasing, and bully ing, often results in social isolation leading to depression.2 AD has a significant impact on day to day functioning, as evidenced b y its impact on the overall wellbeing of the patient and their family on multiple levels; medical management and treatment, HR QOL, and psy cho s ocial implications. I n summary , AD is a disease with multiple comorbidities and significant impact on the health, day to day functioning, and HRQOL of AD patients, their caregivers, and family members. AD may also be a source of significa nt economic burde n23as this relapsing disease is often misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and ineffectivel y treated.4 AD is a condition associated with significant morbidity . Currentl y, there is no cure for AD. AD is a chronic disease with treatment focused on the management of flares and maintenance of remissions. Due to the chronic, relapsing nature of the disease, treatment may be needed for man y years."

Crisaborole is a novel, non- steroidal, topical anti- inflammatory PDE 4 inhibitor that wi ll serve an unmet need in the treatment of AD. Supporting evidence of the safet y and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatol ogic condition an d the treatment limiting effects of currentl y available therapies. All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in favor of crisaborole ointment, 2% BID versus vehicle ointment BID in the two Phase 3 pivotal studies.24 Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile, with no crisaborole treatment related SAEs (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classif ied as possibly related), and the majority of AEs were mild and deemed unlikel y or not related to investigational product. 1.3.Drug Development Crisaborole ointment, 2% is an oxaborole compound developed as a topical antiinflammatory -agent. I t demonstrates invitro inhibit ion of a wide range of proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammatory skin diseases. Crisaborole has been formulated as a topical ointment. The formulation ingredients for crisaborole ointment, 2% a re listed in Section 5. Crisaborole inhibits a range of cy tokines implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory skin diseases, including TNF -, IFN -y, IL -2, IL -5, IL -6, IL - 10, IL- 12, and IL -23.25 The level of inhibitory activity , ie,the concentrations needed to produce 50% inhibition, ranges from the high nanomolar to the low micromolar concentrations. Crisaborole also inhibits the release of chemo kines that are important inflammatory mediators. One mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect of crisaborole is through inhibition PDE -4. Crisaborole proved efficacious against an inflammatory challenge in vivo, in a mouse model of ear edema induced b y phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Crisaborole formulated as ointment and cream formulations for topical use has demonstrated clinical benefit in nine psoriasis clinical studies and seven AD clinical studies. Safet y has been evaluate din a total of 23 completed clinical studies. The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) contains summaries of nonclinical and clinical studies performed with crisaborole.25 A brief summary as background to this study p rotocol is presen ted here."

Nonclinical Studies Crisaborole demonstrated inhibitory capacity against human leukocyte cytokine release with half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) values ranging from high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. Crisaborole also inhibits the release of chemokines that are important inflammatory mediators. The primary mechanism of the antiinflammatory effect of crisaborole is through inhibition of PDE4, which causes elevation of cAMP in leukocytes and subsequent protein kinase A (PKA)mediated phosphorylation of transcription factors that are important for cytokine, chemokine, or prostaglandin forming enzyme synthesis and release from cells. Crisaborole proved efficacious against an inflammatory challenge in vivo in a mouse PMA induced ear edema model. AN8323, a metabolite of crisaborole, lacks antiinflammatory activities against PDE4 and a panel of cytokines.

Overall, crisaborole ointment, 2% was well toler ated over 21 days of dosing in sensitive skin areas of healthy subjects. 1.3.3.2. Sensitizing and Cumulative Irritation Potential In a repeat insult patch test and cumulative irritation study in healthy subjects (Study AN2728-RIPT-101), the potential for inducing cutaneous sensitization was assessed in 238 subjects randomized in Cohort 1. None of the subjects demonstrated cutaneousevidence of sensitization potential (a reaction of at least Grade 4 [definite edema] or a pattern suggestive of contact sensitization in the opinion of the Investigator) to the investigational products, crisaborole ointment, 2% or vehicle. The potential for causing cutaneous irritation was evaluated among 40 subjects randomized in Cohort 2. There were no statistically significant differences in irritation between the crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle. In addition, the similar results were observed from Japan study C3291029 Cohort 1. In this study, crisaborole ointment 2% and vehicle were applied topically to 1-side of the intrascapular area of the back once on Day 1 and remained under occlusion for 48 hours (Cohort 1 in Study C3291029) to Japanese healthy participants. The skin irritancy was to be evaluated approximately 30 minutes after removal of the patches on Day 3 and 24 hours after removal of the patches on Day 4. The degree of erythema, edema and other signs of skin irritation at the application site was evaluated using the visual scale. All participants for the crisaborole ointment 2% patch had a maximum irritation score of 0 (No reaction) or 0.5 (Mild erythema) except for the 3 participants with a maximum irritation score of 2 (Erythema + edema, papule). Overall, Crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle showed no evidence of sensitization and only very minimal irritation. 1.3.4.

Study and Dose Rationale In this China and Japan study , a similar study design to the two global pivotal studies (AN2728 -AD-301 and AN2728 -AD -302) will be used to investig atethe efficacy and safety of Crisaborole Ointment, 2% twice dail y (BID) in Chinese and Japanese pediatric and adult subjects (ages 2 years and older) with mild to moderate AD ,to support the registration of Crisaborole in China and Japan . Dose selection for the global pivotal clinical studies was based on safety and efficacy results from Phase 2 studies, and the dose selected was later confirmed to be safe and effective for commercialization by the results of the Phase 3 studies. Phase 2 Study AN2728 -AD-204 compared two concentrations of crisaborole (2% and 0.5%) applied QD or BID in adolescents with mild to moderate AD. The largest dose-related response and the greatest improvement in all 5 component signs and symptoms of AD occurred in the cri saborole 2 % BID group, with a notable reduction from baseline in the pruritus score. The 2% dosage strength of the crisaborole ointment formulation administered BID was selected for study in Phase 3 as the highest well -tolerated dose to maximize the potent ial for efficacy with minimal safety risk.

Long-term (up to 12 months) intermittent use in this patient population was shown to be safe in a 48-week long -term safety study (AN2728-AD-303). The safety of the 2% dosage strength was confirmed in additional studies, including maximal use systemic exposure (MUSE) studies (pediatric subjects with AD and adult subjects with psoriasis) and with supra-therapeutic dosing in a TQT study (healthy adult subjects). In the pooled Phase 3 registration studies, higher rates of success in ISGA at Day 29 were observed in the crisaborole group than in the vehicle group for the subgroups of sex, age, race, and ethnicity. The proportion of Asian subjects is around 5%, similar trend was observed in the Asian subgroup of the pooled global pivotal studies, with a success in ISGA of 17.3% in the crisaborole group and 11.1% in the vehicle group. The safety profile of crisaborole was not affected by age, sex, ethnicity, or race. This China and Japan Phase 3 study will evaluate the same dosing regimen which was investigated in the global pivotal Phase 3 studies. 1.4.2. Single Reference Safety Document Additional information for crisaborole may be found in the Single Reference Safety Document (SRSD), which for this study is the crisaborole Investigator’s Brochure. 1.5. Anticipated Benefits and Risks The benefit/risk balance of crisaborole ointment, 2% application in this study is considered favorable and supported by the following: •The expected efficacy of crisaborole ointment, 2% for the treatment of atopic dermatitis based on the results of clinical studies conducted to date. •The expected limited crisaborole systemic exposure when applied topically based on the results of clinical studies conducted with crisaborole ointment, 2% to date.CCI"

Randomization Criteria Subject will be randomized into the study provided that the subject [or parent(s)/legal guardian] has signed an informed consent (or assent, if applicable) document to participate in the study , and the s ubject has undergone all screening procedures, and meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in the study at the baseline visit. A centralized computer generated randomization schedule will be used to assign subjects to the treatment groups. Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the 2 parallel treatment gr oups (Crisaborole ointment, 2% BID or Crisaborole placebo vehicle ointment BID). Subjects will be assigned a subject identification number in the order of their screeni ng for the study . The identify ing number will be retained throughout the study . 4.4.Lifestyle Requirements 4.4.1. Contraception All female subjects who are of childbearing potential as applicable to the study who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use an appropriate method of contraception consistently and correctly for the screening period, the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of i nvestigational product. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception method s(see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities, the investigator or his/her designee will inform the subject of the need to use an appropriate contraceptive method consistently and correctl y and document the conversation and the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s"

In addition, the investigator or his/her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the partner. Contraceptives allowe dduring the study include: 1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. 2.Correctl y placed copper containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3. Male condom or female condom used with or without a spermicide product (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository ). 4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post vasectomy ejaculate. 5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectom y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance w ith the device’s label). NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently refraining from all heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) may obviate the need for contraception O NLY if this is the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. 4.4.2. Other Lifestyle Requirements Routine preventative immunizations are permitted during the stud y; however, it is preferred that immunizations be administered at least 28 days before the start or following the completion of the subject’s participation. Subjects should not swim, be bathed or have treatment areas washed for at least 4hours after application of investigational product. Use of sunscreen is permitted, but only on areas without AD i nvolvement."

However, they must be instructed to wash their hands with mild soap and water before and after each application. 4.5.Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The cont a ct information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact det ails for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study . The conta ct number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team are no tavailable. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y. The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly , and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) guidelines ,investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). For this study , investigational products are the following: Crisaborole ointment, 2 %,also referred to as active."

The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select inf ormation including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or conta i ner number when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The IRT sy stem will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be sto r ed in the site’s files. The study specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 5.2.Breaking the Blind The study will be subject, and investigator blinded. At the initiation of the stud y,the investigator site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The method will be an electronic process. Blinding codes should be broken onl y in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is absolutel y essent ial for further management of the subject. Investigators are encouraged to discuss with a member of the stud y team if they believe that unblinding is necessary . When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case report form (CRF). 5.3. Subject Compliance Subject/a parent/legal guardian will appl y crisaborole ointment, 2% or Vehicle to the subject at home; compliance will be captured and completed by the subject/parent/legal guardian/legall y acceptable representative u sing a dosing diary provided by the site. The subject and parent/legal guardian (if applicable) will be instructed to complete the Dosing Diary starting with the first dose applied in the clinic on Day 1, then BID through Day 28 (ie,each time investigati onal product is applied) for the investigational product doses applied at home. In special situation if the subject come to the clinic in the afternoon, two doses (8- 16 hours apart) or single dose could be administered on Day 1,if single dose is administ e red on Day 1, a morning dose will be applied at Day 29 for these special subjects in order to keep 56 doses.

This will be verified by the dosing records. Subjects having missed doses of I P will be re -educated on the importance of compliance. 5.4.Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Crisaborole Ointme nt, 2% and vehicle ointment will be supplied in 60 g tubes for topical administration. The tubes will be provided in cartons and labeled in a blinded fashion according to local regulatory requirements. 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing Within this protocol, preparation refers to the investigator site activities performed to make the investigational product read y for administration or dispensing to the subject/caregiver b y qualified staff. Dispensing is defined as the provision of investigational product, concomi tant treatments, and accompany ing information by qualified staff member(s) to a healthcare provider, subject, or caregiver in accordance with this protocol. L ocal health authority regulations or investigator site guidelines may use alternative terms for t hese activities. The investigational product will be dispensed in a blinded fashion using an I RT s ystem at each visit from Baseline/Day 1 to the Day 22 visit. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers inthe cartons provided, in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. For doses to be administered at home, the caregiver (parents/legal guardians) should be instructed to maintain the product in the package provided throughout the course of do sing and return the product (including empt y, partial used and unused tubes) to the site at the next study visit. 5.5.Administration Ointment should be applied as an even lay er of approximately 3 mg/cm2. The tool to standardize the calculation of the amount of ointment required for each participant will be provided by the sponsor to the study sites, which is based on each participant’s own AD %BSA adjusted b y height and weight."

Subjects and parents/legal guardians (if applicable) will be encou raged to observe and participate in the initial investigational product application on Day 1. All subsequent doses, including the second dose on Day 1, will be applied at home. Those subjects apply ing IP at home and having difficult y reaching treatment e ligible atopic dermatitis areas (eg, back) may be assisted by another person who will need to apply the investigational product to the subject according to the above IP application instructions. Subjects and/or parents/guardian/legal guardians will be inst ructed to not wipe investigational product off the skin, avoid occluding the treated areas, and refrain from swimming or bathing/washing the treated areas within 4 hours after application. Regimen: Investigational product will be applied BID to all treatab leAD involved areas (excluding the scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1 through Day 28. The initial dose application on Baseline/Day 1 will be applied in the clinic, and all subsequent doses will be applied at home. Subjects and/or parents/legal guardian swill be instructed to apply enough investigational product to cover each lesion with a lay er of ointment. A total of 56 doses are expected to be applied between Baseline/Day 1 and Day 29, inclusive. In the event the scheduled Day 29 (End of Treatment) Vi sit does not occur on Day 29, eg, due to an unavoidable scheduling conflict, the subject and parent/legal guardian (if applicable) will be instructed to continue investigational product application BID through the evening before the day that the reschedu l ed End of Treatment Visit is to occur. Investigational product will continue to be applied to all treatable AD involved areas (excluding scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1 regardless of whether they become clinicall y clear prior to Day 29. Investigationa l product will also be applied to any new treatable AD involved areas that appear following Baseline/Day 1. Subjects and parents/legal guardians (if applicable) will be instructed to apply evening (PM) doses approximately 8–16 hours after the morning (AM )doses (eg, if an AM dose is completed at 8:00 AM, the PM dose can be applied an ytime between 4:00 PM and 12:00 AM). Caregivers or partners may also be ones to apply investigational product, especiall y for areas that a subject cannot reach, even in adults. The first dose is preferred to be administered in the morning on Day 1 if applicable. In special situation if the subject come to the clinic in the afternoon, two doses (8- 16hours apart) or single dose could be administered fine to onl y administer th ePM dose on Day 1, if single dose is administered on Day 1, a morning dose will be applied at Day 29 for these special subjects."

Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the product label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum tem peratures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous monitoring system s, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation a ndto provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all nonworking day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as appli c able, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product t othe storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must b equarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investiga tional product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site.

If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts must be documen ted in the subject’s medical reco rd. In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved adverse e vents (AEs). If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no furt her evaluations should be perform ed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are complete d asdescribed. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances out side of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases, the investigator wil ltake all steps necessary to ens ure the safet y and wellbeing of the subject. When a protocol required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adher ed to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner . For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study . 7.1.Efficacy Assessments Clinical evaluations of atopic dermatitis will be performed b y an experienced and certified physician, dermatologist, or medical professional.

If the screening serum chemistry and hematology tests are performed within 15 days prior to Baseline/Day 1,whether th e Day 1 serum chemistry and he matology tests are to be performed will be at the discretion of the investigator or his/her designee. At the discretion of the investigator or his/her designee , a lidocaine -based topical anesthetic (eg,lidocaine 4%cream) may be used prior to clinical lab oratory sample collection to decrease potential discomfort to the subject provided the anesthetic does not contain propy lene gl ycol. However, the skin must be thoroughl y cleansed prior to blood sample collection. The Investig ator will review all clinical laboratory test results for safety evaluation upon receipt. After reviewing the laboratory reports and evaluating the results for clinical significance, the i nvestigator or his/her designee must sign and date the l aboratory report. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are defined as abnormal values that have clinical manifestations or require medical intervention. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted from the Screening Visit will be rec orded in the medical history . A clinical ly significant laboratory abnormality detected after the Screening Visit may reflect the development of an AE. Whenever possible, Investigators should report the clinical diagnosis suggested b y the laboratory abnor mality rather than listing individual abnormal test results as AEs. If no diagnosis has been found to explain the abnormal laboratory result, the clinically significant lab result should be recorded as an AE, reflecting the lack of a diagnosis (see Section 8.2.2 ). 7.2.2. Physical Examination, including Height, and Weight Physical examinations, including height, and weight will be performed at times specified in the Schedule s of Activities section of th is protocol. Physical examinations may be conducted by a ph ysician, trained ph ysician's assistant, or nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. A full phy sical examination will be performed at Screening and Day 29 (End of treatment) /Earl y termination visit which will include, but is not limited to the following organ or bod y systems: head, ears, ey es, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal, abdomen (liver, spleen), a nd neurological sy stems.

For meas uring weight, a scale with app ropriate range and resolution is used and must be placed on a stable, flat surface. Subjects must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains. They must also remove the co ntents of their pockets and remain stil l during measurement of weight. 7.2.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements (temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, and BP) will be performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Day 15 and Day 29. Vital sign measurements should be perfo rmed with the subject in the s eated or l ying position and after the subject has been sitting or ly ing calmly for a minimum of 5 minutes. The position of recording must be consistent within subject through -out the study . On study day visits when clinical l aboratory tests are performed, assessment of vital signs should precede blood draw. 7.2.4. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is a validated tool for investigative staff to use to evaluate suicidal ideation and behavior and will be completed at the Screening for subjects ≥ 7 years of age. This is investigator completed. For younger participants under 7 years of age, the investigator/designee should assess the suicidal ideation and behavior risks cli nically in consultation with t heir parents/caregivers. 7.3.Pregnancy Testing For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test (beta -human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hCG), with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed a t screeni ng, prior to dosing with inves tigational product on Day 1 and at the end -of-treatment (Day 29) visit, to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study . A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject may receive th e Crisaborole. Pregnancy tests will al so be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected). Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by institutional review board s (IRBs)/ ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations or at the discretion of the investigator or his/her designee. Pediatric female subject who has not experienced menarche is not required to perform pregnancy testing. If the pediatric fe male subj ect starts menarche during the study , pregnancy testing will be performed."

78,page_78,"Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728]) C329 1032 Final Protocol Amendm ent 3,18 Dec2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 79Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an investigational product under study . In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notificatio n to Pfizer Safety must be mad e immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously forwarded reports. I n the rare situation that the invest igator do es not become immediately awar e of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtai n adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow fo r a compl ete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary of availabl e autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Sa fety ONLY upon request."

To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further i nformation may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study . 8.1.1. Additional Details onRecording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be re corded usin g concise medical terminolog y and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AE s spontaneously reported b y the study subject/[parent(s)/legal guardian]. I n addition, each study subject/[parent(s)/legal guardian/] will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to A dverse Events ( see also the Subject Withdrawal /Early Termination section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recor ded on the CRF. When a subject withdra ws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section a bove. 8.1.4. Time Peri od for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the su bject’s partici pation in the study (ie, before undergoing an y study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. For subjects who are screen failures, the active col lection period ends when screen failure status is determined."

Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurrin g in a s ubject after t he active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to in vestigat ional pr oduct must be re ported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfize r concur s with t hat assessment . 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabi lize at a level accept a ble to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.3. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “rel ated to invest igational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records. Inadditio n, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Fo rm and i n accord ance with the SAE reporting requirements."

Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations . 8.2.Defini tions 8.2.1. Adverse Events AnAE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test fin dings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Progression/worsening of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms r esulting from: Drug ov e rdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding;"

Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test find ings sho uld be r ecorded as AEs w hen any of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a ch ange in study dosing (outside ofany protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merely repeating an abnormal te s t, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is a ny untow ard medi cal occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantia l disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An important medical event."

An im portant medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other A E outcom es, the import a nt medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasia s or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or deve lopment of drug depend ency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessaril y cons titute a hospita lization; howe ver, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilit ies; Nursing h omes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatm ent of a preexisting c ondition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to slee p);"

These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and inv asive procedur es, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begin s during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.3.Severity Assessment If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to d escribe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's u sual fun ction. SEVERE Interfe res significantl y with subject's usual function. Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significan tly with the subject's usual f unction) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above."

Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol specified SAEs in this study . All SA Es will be repor ted to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determ ined by elevatio ns in transami nases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adap t and therefore are ""sus ceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitor ed more frequent ly to determin eif they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by seve ral daysor week s. The increa sein TBili typicall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values m ight hav e decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criter ia) case s and sh ould alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individual baseline v alues and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Subjects with AST/AL T and TB ilibaseline values wi thin the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available;"
86,page_86,"Crisaborole (PF -06930164 [AN2728]) C329 1032 Final Protocol Amendm ent 3,18 Dec2020 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 87For subjects with baseline AS T OR ALT OR TBil i values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline va lues AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN (whicheve r is sma ller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sp onsor. The subj ect should ret urn to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In add ition to repeating mea s urements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), to tal bile acids, alkaline phospha tase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contem poraneou s analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or ov er-the- counter m edications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and poten tial occ upationa l exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory crite ria of A ST/AL T and TBili eleva t ion defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, i rrespect ive of a vailability"

A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and hav e excluded an alternat ive etiology . 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are rep ortable to Pfizer Safe tywithin 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, preg nant eit her whil e receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product . An exa mple of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatmen t or environmental expos ure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy . If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s treat ment wit h the in vestigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding enviro nmental exposu reto a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safet y using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespe ctive of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should"

Follow -up is conducted to obta in gener al information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow - up to the initial EDP supplemen t al form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possibl e, the structura l integrit y ofthe terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregn ancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the pro cedures for repo rting SAEs."

In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional informat ion rega rding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow - up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his par tner. 8.4.3.2. Exposure D uring Breastfe eding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfe eding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s admin istratio n, the S AE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned di rect con tact wit h the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an asso ciated SAE. Since the informa tion does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file."

Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE . 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) which includes all subjects who are randomized and dispensed investigational product. Analyses based on the Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) will be considered supportive. The PPAS includes all subjects in the FAS who complete the Day 29 evaluation without any major protocol deviations. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set (SAFETY) which includes all subjects who are randomized and received at least one confirmed dose of investigational product. Major protocol deviations will be summarized. Noncompliance with investigational product administration requirement will be summarized in terms of number of applications, number of days dosing, amount of drug used, and compliant status. A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least 80% but no more than 120% of the expected applications during the investigational product application period, and has not missed 6 or more consecutive doses. 9.1. Sample Size Determination The total sample size of 384 subjects in this study with a 2:1 randomization ratio (256:128) will provide approximately 90% power to detect a 12% difference of percent change from baseline in EASI total score at Day 29 between crisaborole arm and vehicle arm at the 0.05 (2-sided) significance level, Comparative EASI data relative to vehicle was not collected in previous crisaborole studies. The 12% treatment effect in EASI percent improvement was converted from the ISGA response in the Phase 3 studies using a linear regression equation that evaluated the relationship between ISGA response rate and EASI percent improvement from historical trial CCI"

From the crisaborole Phase 3 pooled data, the ISGA response rate is 32.1 % for crisaborole and 21.8% for vehicle. The converted EASI percent improvement is 38.9 % and 26.8% respectively. The difference of EASI percent improvement between crisaborole and vehicle is approximately 12%. 9.2.Efficacy Analysis 9.2.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint, percent change from baseline in EASI total score a t Day 29, will b e analyzed usi n ga linear mixed -effect model for repeated measures that includes treatment group, visit, and treatment group b y visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Within- subject variability will be accounted fo r using a random eff ect with thefirst order autoregressive (AR(1)) covariance matrix. 9.2.2. Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints Type I error rate will be strictly controlled for the anal yses of the key secondary efficacy endpoints with sequential testing in the following order : Improvement in ISGA (defined as ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1)) at Day 29, Success in ISGA (defined as an ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2 grade improvement from Baseline) at Day 29, and change fr om baseline to W eek4 in weekl yaverage of peak pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). The percentage of subjects with I mprovement in I SGA at Day 29 will be compared between crisaborole arm and vehicle arm and the difference will be tested based on normal a pproximation to response rates .Missing Day 29 ISGA scores will be derived for the anal ysis using the method of multiple imputations (MI) based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The percentage of subjects with Success in I SGA at Day 29 will be analy zedin the same way as Improvement in ISGA. The same sets of imputed I SGA scores will be used for both Success in I SGA and Improvement in I SGA. The change from baseline to Week 4 in weekl y average of peak pruritus NRS will be analyzed using a linear mixed -effect model for r epeated measur es that includes treatment group, visit, and treatment -group b y visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate. Within -subject variability will be accounted for using a random effect with the first order autor egressive (AR(1) ) covariance m atrix. 9.2.3.

No imputation will be made for missing safet y data. The following safet y data will be summarized: TE AEs, including SAEs; Clinically signific ant changes in vital signs; Clinically significant changes in laborato ry parameters. 9.4.

The E- DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitori ng of the safet yof subjects inthe study according to the charter. The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for a final decision. Pfizer wil l forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate ana lyses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct per iodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that the protoc ol and Good C linical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institut ion will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the investigator site may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC , and/or to qua lity assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator( s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory insp ection notifi cation in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow P fizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present d uring the inspec tion. The in vestigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its a gent. Before r esponse submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such fin dings. It is important that the investigator(s) and th eir relevant personn el are avai lable during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process."

Case Report Form s/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed original CR Fs are the sole prop erty of P fizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate r esponsibility forthe collect ionand reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consiste nt, legible, time ly (contempo raneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source docum entsmust be dat ed, initialed, and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician subject char t. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must ma tch the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifie s those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF w ill stand as th esource document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, includi ng the identity of all participating subjects (suffici ent information to link recor ds, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent[/assent] documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed recor ds of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant co rrespondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulatio ns, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (C SA), whichever i slonger. If theinvestigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notif ied. The"

Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completi on or discontinuation of the study or for longer if re quired by applic ablelocal re gulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements have been met. 12.ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Revi ew Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have pros pective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent[/assent] documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable , from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retai ned in the inves tigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where th e change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subje cts. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in a ccordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory requirements, and th egeneral pri nciples set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002) , ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the De claration of Helsinki. 12.3.
