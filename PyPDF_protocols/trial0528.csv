Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, are summarized below: Sections A ffected Rationale for Change 4.1.1 Hormone receptor status was incorrectly referred to as “hormone receptor -positive status” in the inclusion criteria. This error has been corrected. 4.5.11; Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)Albumin has been added as part of blood chemistry at Screeni ng,for determin ation of patient eligibility. 5.2.4.3 Reporting conventions have been added for local infusion reactions. 6, 6.6, 9.4 An interim analysis will now be conducted to support a planned regulatory filing for FDC. The scope of this interim will be a subset of the analyses planned for the primary analysis. Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)The timing of pregnancy tests during the Treatment Cross - over and Treatment Continuation Periods has been clarified. It has been clarified that pregnancy testing is only required for women of childbearing potential. Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)The Schedule of Assessments has been revised to clarify that adverse events and concomitant medications are collected on an ongoing basis throughout the Treatment Cross -Over Period and the Treatment Continuation Period. Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments )It has been clarified that, for all protocol -mandated study visits, a time window of ±3 days is allowed. Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments)It has been clarified that no specific investigations are required per protocol for Cycles 8 -10 and Cycles 12- 14 during the Treatment Continuation Period, although the investigator may perform safety laboratory assessments or other tests per institutional practice. Information on treatment administration as well as any new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities will be collected. Appendix 7 An error in the definition of Grade 4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) has been corrected."

During this period, pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC or P+H IV will be administered for the number of 3-weekly cycles calculated based on the number of Perjeta and Herceptin cycles received as neoadjuvant treatment prior to study entry and P+H IV and pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC cycles (six total cycles) received during the Treatment Cross -over Period. A total of 18 cycles of anti-HER2 treatment should be adm inistered for EBC treatment unless disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal from treatm ent necessitates early cessation of treatment. No specific investigations are required per protocol for Cycles 8-10 and Cycles 12-14 during the Treatment Conti nuation Period, although the PI may perform safety laboratory assessments or other tests per institutional practice (these results are not required to be reported in the eCRF). However, information on treatment administration will be collected, and new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. … n.Haematology: haemoglobin, total WBC, ANC / neutrophils, platelet count. Limited biochemistry : alkaline phosphatase; AST; ALT; LDH; total bilirubin; creatinine. Albumin should be measured at Screening for determining patient eligibility. Bilirubin fractions (direct and indirect) must be included if total bilirubin is greater than ULN. During the treatment period, bloods for haematology / biochemistry may be taken within three days prior to study treatment administration. o.Pregnancy testing is only required for women of childbearing potential: A woman of childbearing potential is defined as: post-menarchal, has not reached a post-menopausal state (post -menopausal defined as ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing potential may be adap ted for alignmen t with local guidelines or requirements. For all wom en of childbearing potential, Ppregnancy tests must be performed via serum -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at baseline within seven days prior to first study treatment administration. Urine pregnancy tests should be repeated during the Treatment Cross - over and Treatment Continuation Periods within seven days prior to every three treatment cycles starting at Cycle4, Cycle 7, Cycle 11 and Cycle 15(or at last treatment cycle) , (and as clinically indica ted), with results available prior to study treatment administration, as well as at the End of Treatment Visit and at the Follow -up Visit until seven months after discontinuation of study treatment. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum -HCG test."

An overview of the study design is provided in the figure below. A Schedule of Activities is provided in Appendix 1. Study Schema Abbreviations: IV: intravenous; P+H: Perjeta + Herceptin; FDC SC: subcutaneously administered fixed -dose combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab; HCPQ s: Healthcare Professional Questionnaire s;PPQ: Patient Preference Questionnaire; SC subcutaneous; TASQ: Therapy Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire Eligibility will be assessed within a 28- day screening period. Eligible patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to treatment Arm A (P+H IV followed by pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC) or treatment Arm B (FDC SC followed by P+H IV). Patients will be stratified according to neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen (anthracy clines + taxanes vs. carboplatin + taxanes vs. taxanes only) , neoadjuvant treatment response (pathologic complete respon se [pCR] vs. non -pCR) and hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor [ER]-positive and/or progesterone receptor [PgR] - positive vs. ER-negative and PgR-negative) . Study treatment will be initiated ≥2 weeks from breast cancer surgery but ≤9 weeks from the last administration of sy stemic neoadjuvant therapy and will be administered on Day 1 of each 3- week treatment cycle. No adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed after surgery , however, adjuvant hormone and/or radiation therapy are allowed. Patients randomized toArm A will receive P+H IV for three treatment cycles followed by pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for three treatm ent cycles. Patients randomized to Arm B w ill receive pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for three treatm ent cycles followed by P+H IV for three treatment cycles. This period of 3+3 cycles in both treatment arms constitutes the study Treatment Cross -over Period. The 6study treatment cycles of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC and P+H IV received during the Treatment Cross -over Period and P+H treatment cycles received in the neoadjuvant setting prior to study entry will be considered part of the total 18anti-HER2 treatment cyclesplanned for all study patients. Following completion of the Treatment Cross -over Period, patients will enter the Treatment Continuation Period wherein they will receive the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles required to complete their 18 planned cycles unless disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal from treatment necessitates early treatment cessation. Study treatment during this period will be either P+H IV or pertuz umab and trastuzumab FDC SC as selected by the patient at the end of the Treatment Cross -over Period ."
20,page_20,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 20/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Patients who, by the investigator’s assessment, cannot tolerate pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC or P+H IV may be allowed to receive P+H IV or pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC, respectively, for their remaining planned anti-HER2 treatment cycles. The investigator must obtain approval from the Medical Monitor to switchstudy treatm ent. Patient preference will be assessed based on the Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ ) (administered following treatment administration on Day 1, Cycle 6 of the Treatment Cross -over Period). Treatment satisfaction will be assessed based on the Thera py Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire ( TASQ )(administered following treatment administration on Day 1 of Cy cles 3 and 6 of the Treatment Cross -over Period). Healthcare professionals will record their perception of time/resource use and convenience of treatment administration completing the Healthcare Professional Questionnaires (HCPQs ). Perception of time use will be captured during the Treatment Cross -over Period and perception of convenience will be captured after administration of each patient’s treatment Cycle 6. Health -related quality of life will be assessed based on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ - C30 completed at baseline, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and the end of study treatment visits as well as at 18 months, 2 years, and 3 years from random ization . The study questionnaires are provided in Appendix 2and Appendix 3. Patients will be assessed for safety by regular evaluation of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology, blood chemistry) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) assessments ; and by physical examinations. Adverse events will be reported and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0). Efficacy will be assessed based on investigator -evaluated disease status determined according toassessments conducted per institutional practice or according to the American Cancer Society /American Society of Clinical Oncology (ACS/ASCO) Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline [ Runowicz et al. 2016 , see Appendix 4 ]. Patients will undergo an End of Treatment Visit approximately 28 days after completing study treatment and will enter the Follow -up Period wherein they will be followed for safety, disease status, survival and HRQoL (via the EORTC QLQ -C30) for three years from the date the last patient is randomized. Patients who withdraw from the study following randomization will not be replaced. Patients can be screened for the study more than once. Number of Patients Approximately 140 patients will be randomized in the study to obtain at least 126 evaluable patients. Target Population The target population will consist of adult patients with HER2+ EBC who have received neoadjuvant Perjeta and Herceptin, and have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently undergone surgery for their breast cancer. Inclusion Criteria Patients must me et the following criteria for study entry: Disease -specific criteria Female ormale with histologically confirmed, HER2+ inflammatory , locally advanced or early - stage breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant Perjeta + Herceptin and have completed neoadj uvant chemotherapy and subsequently undergone surger y for their breast cancer.

Statistical Methods Primary A nalysis The primary objective of this study is to evaluate patient preference for pertuz umab and trastuzumab FDC SC based on the proportion of patients indicating an overall preference forpertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC based onQuestion 1 of the PPQ. Question 1 of the PPQ is as follows: “All things considered, which method of administrati on did you prefer?”. The primary endpoint will be analy sed for the intent -to-treat (ITT) population and for the modified ITT (mITT) population. The mITT population will include all patients who received at least one dose by both SC and IV routes of administration during the Treatment Cross -over Period and subsequently answered at least Question 1 of the PPQ. A point estimate with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for the proportion of patients who preferred pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC will be calculated for the mITT and ITT populations. Analysis of the primary study endpoint will take place when all patients have completed their last treatment administration during the Treatment Cross -over Period. Determination of Sample Size The binary prim ary endpoint (the proportion of patients who express a preference for pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC) will be estimated with associated two -sided 95% CI."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON HER 2-POSITIVE EA RLY BREA ST CA NCER Among developed countries, breast cancer is the most common malignancy and was associated with 198 000 deaths in 2012 alone . Globally, its incidence is exceeded only by lung cancer [Ferlay et al. 201 3]. Amplification or overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene occurs in 20% to 30% of invasive breast cancers and has both prognostic and predict ive implications [Slamon et al. 1987 ,Owens et al. 2004 ]. HER2 is a member of the family of human epidermal growth factor receptors (HER) that includes HER1 [also known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)], HER3, and HER4. Each HER receptor co nsistsof an extracellular ligand binding site, a transmembrane lipophilic segment, and an intracellular domain with tyrosine kinase catalytic activity . HER activation initiates a variety of intracellular signalling pathways that are involved in cell proliferati on, survival, differentiation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Low levels of HER2 are normally expressed on the surface of epithelial cells and arenecessary for the normal development and repair of many tissues, including those of the breast, gastrointestinal tract , central nervous system and myocardium [Ozcelik et al. 2002 , Vu and Claret 2012 ,Iqbal and Iqbal 2014 ]. When overexpressed in breast tumours ,however, HER2 isassociated with more aggressive disease characterized by shorter time sto relapse and over all survival (OS) [Slamon et al. 1987 ,Carr et al. 2000 ]. HER2 activation occurs viaautophosphorylation of receptor cytoplasmic domains through homo -dimerization or hetero -dimerization with other ligand -induced HER family members wherein HER2 is the preferred HER family dimerization partner [Graus -Porta et al. 1997 , Moasser 2007 ]. Constitutive HER2 activation and downstream signalling can also occur by proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain (ECD) , a process known as shedding, to produce a truncated internal domain [ Molina et al. 2001 ]. The benefit of anti-HER2 treatment strategies for HER2 -positive (HER2+) breast cancer was first realized with theintroduction of the anti -HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin®) into clinical management in 2000 [Cobleigh et al. 1999 , Slamon et al. 2001 , Bonifazi et al. 2014 ].The subsequent development of additional HER2 -targeted agents , including pertuzumab (Perjeta® ; another HER2 -specific monoclonal ), trastuzumab emtansine (a trastuzumab -cytotoxic drug conjugate), and lapatinib and neratinib (HER2/HER1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors ),has widened the range of available anti-HER2 approaches including the possibility for dual HER2 blockade with Perjeta and Herceptin . Perjeta and Herceptin each bind to distinct epitopes on the HER2 ECD without competing with each other. As described in Sections 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 , these molecules have complementary mechanisms for disrupting HER2 signalling. Dual HER2 blockade with Perjeta and Herceptin in HER2 + disease has been shown to improve pathologic complete response (pCR) in the neoadjuvant setting, invasive disease- free survival (IDFS) in the adjuvant setting, and progression -free survival (PFS) and OS in the metastatic setting ,and has become standard ofcare in each of these indications [Swain et al. 2013 , Gianni et al. 2016 , von Minckwitz et al. 2017 , Cardoso et al. 2017,Curigliano et al. 2017 ,Gradisher et al. 2018]."
30,page_30,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 30/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Whileimproving disease outcomes, the incorporation of intravenous ly administered (IV) Perjeta and Herceptin IV (P+H IV) into HER2+ breast cancer care results in longer treatment administration schedules due to sequential administration of each monoclonal antibody in addition to IV chemotherapeutics. A recently reported metastatic breast cancer (MBC )study evaluated Herceptin IV and Perjeta IV combined for administration from a single infusion bag compared with Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV administered as sequential infusions. The study found the safety profile in the co-infused treatment group was consistent with the known toxicity profiles of each drug with no unexpected safety signals and no apparent alteration with co -mixing / co-infusion [ Andersson et al. 2017 ]. More recently, Herceptin has been developed in aformulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration (see Section 1.2.3 ) that can be delivered in under 5 minutes versus the 30-60minute infusions required for administration of the IV formulation. Herceptin SC has been shown to be preferred over Herceptin IV byHER2+ early breast cancer (EBC)patients in a randomized, cross -over study [Pivot et al. 2013]. Herceptin SC is currently approved in the EU for use in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic HER2+ breast cancer settings and is referenced for use with Perjeta IV in this jurisdiction . Initial data from a Phase IIIb single -arm safety study of combined treatment with Herceptin SC and Perjeta IV have shown a safety profile consistent with combined treatment with Herceptin and Perjeta IV formulations [Kummel et al. 2016 ].As described in Section 1.2.4 , pertuzumab formulated for SC administration and co-administration with Herceptin SC is undergoing development in this study and others. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON STUDY MEDICA TIONS 1.2.1 Study Drug Nomenclatur e Pertuzumab and trastuzumab are both monoclonal antibodies developed by Roche. Throughout the protocol, their international non-proprietary names (pertuzumab, trastuzumab) are used when describing their pharmaco kinetic (PK) properties and when referring to the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed -dosed combination formulation for subcutaneous administration (FDC SC). Other versions of trastuzumab for IV administration may be available in some countries. To distinguish the source of trastuzumab that is an investigational medicinal product (IMP) in this study, as well as inRoche -sponsored clinical studies referenced in support of this study, the trade name (Herceptin) is used throughout the protocol when referring to the commercially available drug product (i.e. trastuzumab plus excipients). Forconsistency, the trade name (Perjeta) is also used when referring to the commercially available drug product (pertuzumab plus excipients) and IMP in this study. 1.2.2 Background on Perjeta Perjetais a recombinant, humanized immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal that binds to the subdomain II of the HER2 ECD and sterically hinders HER2 dimerization [Franklin et al. 2004 ]. Inhibition of homo -dimerization and ligand -activated hetero -dimerization precludes activated intracellular signalling and downstream stimulation of HER- regulated pathways involved in tumorigenesis .In vitro studies have also shown that Perjeta can mediate antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) ."
31,page_31,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 31/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Perjeta and Herceptin each bind to distinct epitopes on theHER2 ECD without competing with each other . The molecules have complementary mechanisms for disrupting HER2 signalling (see Section 1.2.3 )resulting in augmented in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative activity when delivered in combination. Perjeta is approved in the European Union (EU) and United States (U.S.) for IV administration (Perjeta IV)in combination with Herceptin and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant and adjuvant (neo/adjuvant) HER2+ EBC at high risk of recurrence and in combination with Herceptin and docetaxel for the treatment of HER2+ MBC. For further details of non-clinical and clinical studies with Perjeta, please refer to the Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.3 Background on Herceptin Herceptin is arecombinant, humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody with high affinity for the subdomain IV of the HER2 ECD. Herceptin binding has been shown to prevent access by proteases responsible forcleaving the ECD at the cell surface to produce the constitutively activated truncated form of HER2 [Molina et al. 2011 ]. In addition to inhibition of HER2 shedding, Hercep tinmediates ADCC on HER2 -overexpressing cancer cells [Sliwkowski et al. 1999 ]. The addition of Herceptin to standard chemotherapy in the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer improves pCR rates, disease- free survival and OS in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings; and PFS and OS in the metastatic setting [ Slamon et al. 2001 ; Romond et al. 2005 , Smith et al. 2007 , Gianni et al. 2010 , Cameron et al. 2017 , Slamon et al. 2011 ].Herceptin is indicated for the treatment of patients with HER2+ breast cancer in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic settings. Herceptin can also be administered SC. Herceptin SC is approved in many countries as treatment for patients with HER2 +EBC and MBC. For further details of non-clinical and clinical studies with Herceptin, please refer to the Herceptin Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.4 Background on Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab Fixed -dose Combination for Subcutaneous Administration Pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC represents a combination of both anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodie s in a single drug product. A Phase III, randomized, multicentre, open - label, two-arm study comparing the PK, efficacy, and safety of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC with P+H IVas neo/adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by a taxane) for EBC is currently underway with 500 patients planned for enrolment (Roche Study W O40324) . As described in Section 1.2.2 , Perjeta IV is approved for administration with Herceptin IV and Herceptin SC. Improvement in disease outcomes with combined P+H IV versus Herceptin alone has been shown inneoadjuvant and adjuvant studies inHER2+ EBC. In the randomized Phase II NEOSPHERE (Roche Study WO20697) , patients receiving neoadjuvant Perjeta plus Herceptin and standard chemotherapies had a higher pCR rates (39.3%) over patients receiving neoadjuvant Perjeta IVor Herceptin IV with standard"
32,page_32,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 32/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12chemotherapy (17.7% or 21.5% , respectively ) [Gianni et al. 2012 ]. In the adjuvant setting, the Phase III APHINITY study (Roche Study BO25126) compared adjuvant P+H IVand standard chemotherapy to adjuvant placebo plus Herceptin IVand standard chemotherapy. The study found a statistically significant improvement in IDFS with a hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.00; p = 0.045) in favour of the Perjeta IV arm [von Minckwitz et al. 2017 ]. In each of these studies, combined treatment with Perjeta and Herceptin were found to be well tolerated. Herceptin for SC administration (Herceptin SC, see Section 1.2.3 )has been shown tobe as safe and effective as Herceptin forIV administration in a Phase III, randomized, open -label, non-inferiority study ofneo/adjuvant treatment for HER2+ early EBC (Roche Study BO22227). In thatstudy, Herceptin was administered every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 600 mg (SC arm) or at an8 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg maintenance dose (IVarm). Analyses of the co-primary endpoint s(pCR and serum trough concentration [Ctrough]) found Herceptin SC non -inferior to Herceptin IV with respect to both PK profile and efficacy [ Ismael et al. 2012 ]. Immunogenicity evaluations found 53 patients in Herceptin SC arm (n=297) had at least one anti -Herceptin anti-drug antibod y(ADA) positive result post -baseline whereas 33 patients in Herceptin IV arm (n=299) had at least one positive ADA result post-baseline. However, exploratory analyses suggested that the occurrence of anti-Herceptin ADAs had no clinical consequences with respect to PK, efficacy (patients with and without ADAs had similar pCR, OS, and event -free survival [EFS] rates), or safety. Analyses of EFS and OS conducted after median follow -ups of approximately 40 and 71 months supported the non- inferiority of Herceptin SC . At 40 months, the unstratified hazard ratio sfor EFS and OS were 0.95 (95% CI 0.69-1.30) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.44-1.32) ,respectively. At 71 months, the EFS and OS rates were 65% and 84% in both arms ,respectively. During the study treatment period, the overall safety profile and tolerability in the IV and SC arms wereconsistent with that expected from combination treatment with chemotherapy and Herceptin. Safety findings in the follow -up analyses were also consistent with theknown safety profile of Herceptin IV [Jackisch et al. 2016 , Herceptin Investigator ’sBrochure, v18, 2017 ]. Patient reported preference for Herceptin SC (delivered via single -use injection device or handheld syringe and needle from a vial) over Herceptin IV was evaluated in a Phase II randomized, multi -centre, open -label, crossover study in over 480 patients with HER2+ EBC (Roche Study MO22982). The study found the majority (88.9%) of patients strongly preferred Herceptin SCover Herceptin IV. Results from questionnaires completed by healthcare professional s(HCP s) during the study indicated that HCPs were most satisfied with Herceptin SC administration compared with Herceptin IV administration . Healthcare professionals also reported notable time savings with Herceptin SC administration. Safety and efficacy (3-year EFS) were comparable among the study arms [Herceptin Investigator ’s Brochure, v18, 2017 ]. Pertuzumab formulated for SC administration is being tested in an ongoing open -label, two- part, multicentre dose -finding /dose confirmation study (Roche Study BO30185) . In part 1 of the study, two pertuzumab formulations were assessed in healthy male volunteers: pertuzumab given as a single -agent SCinjection (for eventual use in co -administration with Herceptin SC single -agent injection) and pertuzumab formulated for SC administration co- mixed with Herceptin SC in a single injection. Pertuzumab doses selected for evaluation with"

In part 1 of Study BO30185 , a 600 mg dose of pertuzumab SCwasfound to provide similar Ctrough and area under the curve (AUC) as Perjeta IV delivered at a420 mg dose .Part 2 of Study BO30185 include sconfirmation of the 600 mg pertuzumab SC dose when administered with Herceptin SC co-mixed or as FDC in female EBC patients who have completed standard adjuvant treatment . Pertuzumab SC 600 mg (co-mixed and FDC) in EBC patients was confirmed to provide similar Ctrough and AUC to 420 mg Perjeta IV in healthy male volunteers enrolled in study part 1. Dose proportionality through PKlinearity is considered to confirm a pertuzumab 1200 mg SC loading d ose [PerjetaInvestigator’s Brochure, v17, 2018 ]. Study BO30185 safety data are available for thehealthy volunteer cohorts in part 1 and for part 2 EBC cohorts receiving pertuzumab SCco-administered or co-mixed with Herceptin SC. The safety results are generally consistent with prior experience with combined treatment with P+H IV. Treatment in the final study cohort evaluating pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC in EBC is ongoing [PerjetaInvestigator’s Brochure, v17, 2018 ] . Hercep tin SC, pertuzumab for SC administration ,and pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC are each formulated with 2000 U/mL human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase (rHuPH20). The excipient acts as a permeation enhancer to allow SC administration of higher drug volumes . The concentration of rHuPH20 for theseSC formulations was based on preclinical studies in mini-pigs (an animal model selected due to itssimilarities with human skin structure ) and has been tested and found safe in clinical studies [Pivot et al. 2013 , Rummel et al. 2017 ]. Human recombinant PH20 hyaluronidase included in formulations of human immunoglobulin, humanized monoclonals, and insulin has been found to induce only modest immunogenicity with no associated adverse events (AEs) [Rosengren et al. 2015 ]. Consistent with these findings, anti-rHuPH20 antibodies were detected in Study BO22227 of Herceptin SC,however , exploratory analyses suggest that their occurrence does not affect PKor safety [Herceptin Investigator’s Brochure, v18, 2017 ].

For further details of non -clinical and clinical studies with Perjeta SC and pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC, please refer to the Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE AND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT 1.3.1 Study Rationale Treatment with P+H IVhas been shown to be efficacious in both early and advanced metastatic HER2+ breast cancer and dual HER2 blockade with these agents has become standard of care in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings (see Sections 1.1and 1.2.4 ). Herceptin SC, which has been shown tohave a similar safety profile and non -inferior efficacy to Herceptin IV, can be administered more quickly and without requirement for IV access. The relative appeal of SC administration over IV administration and the reduction in time and resource use with SC administration havebeen reported by breast cancer patients and HCPs, respectively (see Section 1.2.4 )."
34,page_34,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 34/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Given the potential involvement of multiple treatment modalities including repeated IV administration of multiple systemic agents , standard therapy for EBC can be a complex and taxing expe rience for any patient . The requirement sfor individual drug preparation , sequential infusion periods and observation periods also result in greater use oflimited medical resources . The development of an FDC SC formulation of pertuzumab and trastuzumab provides an opportunity to build on the improvements achieved by Herceptin SC by further reduc ingthe burden associated with treatment for HER2+ breast cancer. By formally assess ing, from the patients ’perspective, whether FDC SC administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab is preferable totwo separate, consecutive IV administrations , this study will provide patient experience data to supplement the results of the ongoing Roche Phase III W O20324 study comparing the PK, efficacy , and safetyof these regimens. This study will also document HCP reported perceptions of resource use with FDC SC administration to evaluate the impact of co- formulation and SC delivery on clinical resources. Study safety analyses will further characterize safety profiles of SC administration of co- formulated pertuzumab and trastuzumab as well as the safety of switching from P+H IVto pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC and vice versa . The measurement of secondary efficacy endpoints in this study will further investigate the potential effects of switching study treatments on disease outcomes. 1.3.2 Benefit -Risk A ssessment As described in Section 1.2.4 , the safety and efficacy of Herceptin SC has been shown to be consistent with Herceptin IVwith no safety issues attributable to the route of administration or to formulation with rHuPH20 .Pertuzumab dosing in the FDC SC formulation has been selected to provide similar PK as approved Perjeta IV dosing.No new safety issues have been seen in clinical evaluation ofco-infused Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV preparations (see Section 1.1).Ongoing clinical evaluation of co-administered and co-formulated SC preparations conducted by the Sponsor has also found no safety issues that would not be expected with sequential IV administrations (see Section 1.2.4 ). This study is being conducted in HER2+ EBC patients for whom combined treatment with Perjeta IV and Herceptin is indicated. As summarized above, the benefit -risk of incorporating pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC into study participants’ anti-HER2 regimen is based on the demonstrated non-inferiority of Herceptin SC PK profile and efficacy (as assessed by pCR rate) with respect to Herceptin IV, the equivalent bioavailability of pertuzumab SC and IV formulations and the consistency of safety profiles among IV,SC,and FDC SC formulations. 2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINT S This study will evaluate patient reported preference forpertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC in HER2+ EBC. The study will also evaluate patient reported satisfaction with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC; HCP reported perception of time/resource use and convenience of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC andP+H IV; patient reported health- related quality of life (HRQoL); the safety of each study regimen alone and within the co ntext of the order in which they are administered; as well as efficacy in each treatment arm."

Eligible patients will be enrolled and randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to treatment Arm A (P+H IV followed by pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC) or treatment Arm B (pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC followed by P+H IV). Patients will be stratified according to neoadjuvant chem otherapy regimen (anthracyclines + taxanes vs. carboplatin + taxanes vs. taxanes only) ,neoadjuvant treatment response (pCR vs. non-pCR) , and hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor [ER]-positive and/or progesterone receptor [PgR] -positive vs. ER-negat ive and PgR- negative) . Study treatment will be initiated ≥ 2 weeks from breast cancer surgery but ≤ 9 weeks from the last administration of systemic neoadjuvant therapy and will be administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. No adjuvant chemother apy is allowed after surgery , however, adjuvant hormone and/or radiation therapy are allowed. Patients randomized to Arm A will receive P+H IV for three treatment cycles followed by pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for three treatment cycles. Patients randomized to Arm B will receive pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for three treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for three treatment cycles. This period of 3+3 cycles in both treatment arms constitutes the study Treatment Cross- over Period. The 6study treatm ent cycles of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC and P+H IV received during the Treatment Cross -over Period and Perjeta and Herceptin treatment cycles received in the neoadjuvant setting prior to study entry will be considered part of the total 18 anti-HER2 treatment cycle splanned for all study patients. Following completion of the Treatment Cross -over Period, patients will enter the Treatment Continuation Period wherein they will receive the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles required to complete their 18 planned cycles unless disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal from treatment necessitates early treatment cessation. Study treatment during this period will be either P+H IV or pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC as selected by the patient at the end of the Treatment Cross -over Period.

Treatment satisfaction will be assessed based on the TASQ (administered following treatment administration on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and 6 of the Treatment Cross -over Period). Healthcare professionals will record their perception of time/resource use and convenience of treatm ent administration completing the HCP Qs. Perception of time use will be captured during the Treatment Cross -over Period and perception of convenience will be captured after administration of each patient’s treatment Cycle 6.Health- related quality of life will be assessed based on EORTC QLQ -C30 completed at baseline, Cycle 3, Cycle 6, and the end of study treatment visits ,as well as at 18 months, 2 years, and 3 years from randomization. The study questionnaires are provided in Appendix 2and Appendix 3. Patients will be assessed for safety by regular evaluation of AEs, vital signs, routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology, blood chemistry) and LVEF assessments ; and by physical examinations. Adverse events will be reported and graded according to the NCI CTCAE v 4.0. Efficacy will be assessed based on investigator -evaluated disease status determined according to assessments conducted per institutional practice or according to the American Cancer Society /American Society of Clinical Oncology Breast Cancer (ACS/ASCO) Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline [Runowicz et al. 2016 , see Appendix 4]. Patients will undergo an End of Treatment Visit approximately 28 days after completing study treatment and willenter the Follow -up Period wherein they willbe followed for disease status, survival and HRQoL (via the EORTC QLQ -C30) for 3years from the date the last patient is randomized. The study Schedule of Activities is provided in Appendix 1. Approximately 140 patients from approximately 42study sites worldwide will be randomized in the study. Patients who withdraw from the study following randomization will not be replaced. Patients can be screened for the study more than once. 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY The end of the study is defined the Last Patient ,Last Visit (LPLV) which will occur three years after the last patient is randomized or the date at which the last data point required for the final statistical analysis or safety follow -up is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later. In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time. The study is estimated to last approximately 4years, based on a recruitment period of up to 10 months and 3years of follow -up after the last patient is randomized."

Pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC maintenance and loading doses in the study are based on the approved dose of Herceptin SC (600 mg Herceptin with no loading dose required) ,clinical studies of pertuzumab showing similar Ctrough and AUC with pertuzumab SC 600 mg and Perjeta IV 420 mg (Study BO30185), and dose proportionality of pertuzumab 1200 mg SC confirmed through PK linearity (see Section 1.2.4 ). Both the loading and maintenance doses of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC include 2000 U/mL rHuPH20. The concentration of this excipient is the same as in the approved Herceptin SC formu lation and has been tested in the aforementioned Study BO30185 (see Section 1.2.4 ). The scheduling of all IMPs (every 3 weeks with loading doses required if ≥ 6 weeks since last administration of HER2- targeted therapy) are based on PK studies comparing IV and SC administrations of each molecule (Study BO22227, Study BO30185) and the approved scheduling for Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV and Herceptin SC. 3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population Early breast cancer patients who have received neoadjuvant Perjeta IV and Herceptin and have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently undergone surgery for their breast cancer were selected as the target population for this study since continued dual HER2+ blockade with Perjeta and Herceptin is standard of care in these patients. The completion of chemotherapy prior to study entry limits the influence of chemotherapy administrations and related toxicity on study endpoints. Patients will be allowe d to receive adjuvant radiotherapy and/or hormone therapy during the study as these treatments will be indicated in some cases. 3.3.3 Rationale for Randomization Stratification Factors To include as wide a population as possible while limiting imbalances that may affect study outcomes, randomization will be stratified. Since neoadjuvant treatment selections are associated with varying toxicities anddisease outcomes, randomization will be stratified for neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen (anthracyclines + taxanes vs. carboplatin + taxanes vs. taxanes only). Randomization will also be stratified for neoadjuvant treatment response (pCR vs. non-pCR) and hormone receptor status (positive vs. negative) due to the associations of these factors with disease outcomes . Complete pathological response to neoadjuvant treatment has been shown to predict for improved disease outcomes inHER2+ EBC [Gianni et al. 2016 ]. Differences in treatment response with hormone receptor status have also been shown in HER2+ EBC trials of Herceptin and P+H IV [Cameron et al. 2017 ; Study BO25126 -see Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure 2018 ]."
41,page_41,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 41/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 123.3.4 Rationale for Randomized Cross -over Design The primary objective of this study is to assess patient reported preference for pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC. Patients will be randomized to receive either pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC for three treatment cycles followed by P+H IVfor three treatment cycles versus receiving P+H IVfirst,followed by pertuzuma b and trastuzumab FDC SC. Patients in both treatment groups will then choose either IV orSC administered IMPs for their remaining HER2- targeted treatment cycles. Randomization accommodates potential treatment sequencing -related differences such as in the nature and/or frequency of administration -related reactions (ARRs )with either administration route (e.g. if ARRs to IV formulation occur more frequently following the treatment break for surgery and/or with a loading dose) or in AEs attributable to switc hing administration routes. At the same time, the cross -over design provides exposure to both study regimens allowing each patient to act as their own control forpatient reported outcomes (PROs )measured after study Cycle 3 and study Cycle 6 . 3.3.5 Rationale for Patient Reported Outcome A ssessments Early breast cancer is often asymptomatic, especially after tumour removal , thus it is important to assess treatment impact and tolerability to inform the benef it-risk ratio for a patient on adjuvant therapy. The PPQ used to assess the primary study endpoint has been developed in clinical trials assessing patient preference for SC administered monoclonal antibodies. An interview -based assessment was first developed to assess patient preference for Herceptin SC in a clinical trial of adjuvant Herceptin SC and IV in HER2+ EBC [Study MO22982, Pivot et al. 2013 ]. Interview questions were based on input from experienced clinicians, chemotherapy nurses and psychologists and were tested with patient volunteers prior to use in the study. The three interview questions identified as most informative in the Herceptin MO22982 study were then administered as the patient -completed PPQ in a subsequent lymphoma study evaluating preference for SC or IV administered rituximab [PrefMab study, Rummel et al. 2017 ]. Notably, PPQ endpoints collected in this study were considered adequate evidence for preference claims included in rituximab SC product labelling [Rituxan Hycela™ Package Insert 2017 ].The TASQ questionnaires used in this study have been adapted from administration satisfaction questionnaires used in the aforementioned PrefMab study. Health- related quality of life evaluations in this study will contextualize a patient’s experience on trial, elucidating symptom and treatment burden between P+H IV and pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC. Because treatment -related side effects have the potential to affect patient functioning and HRQoL, it is crucial to characterize not only the incidence of these side effects but also the associated trends and burden from the patient’s perspective, which would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of treatment impact and tolerability. The EORTC QLQ -C30, is a well-known and commonly used questionnaire with strong demonstrated psychom etric properties of both reliability and validity."

MATERI ALS AND METHOD S 4.1 PATIENTS Adult patients with HER2+ EBC who have received neoadjuvant Perjeta and Herceptin, and have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently undergone surgery for their breast cancer will be enrolled in the study . 4.1.1 Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry: Disease- specific criteria Female ormale with histologically confirmed, HER2+ inflammatory, locally advanced or early -stage breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant Perjeta + Herceptin and have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequently undergone surgery for their breast cancer. Note: The neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen (including type and sequencing of selected agents) and the number of neoadjuvant Perjeta and Herceptin treatment cycles are at the discretion of the treating physician and patient. Subcutaneously administered Herceptin may have been used in the neoadjuvant setting. The use of any trastuzumab biosimilars in the neoadjuvant setting is not allowed. HER2+ breast cancer assessed at the local laboratory prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. HER2+ status must be de termined based on breast biopsy material obtained prior to neoadjuvant treatment and is defined as 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or positive by HER2 amplification by in situhybridization (ISH) with a ratio of ≥ 2 for the number of HER2 gene copies to the number of chromosome 17 copies Hormone receptor status of the primary tumour determined by local assessment. Hormone receptor positive status may be either positive (i.e. ER-positive and/or PgR- positive) or negative (i.e. ER -negative and PgR -negativ e) Completed all neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery . Adjuvant radiotherapy may be planned or ongoing at study entry and adjuvant hormone therapy is allowed during the study . Note that study treatment cannot be initiated within < 2weeks of surgery but must be initiated ≤ 9 weeks from the last administration of systemic neoadjuvant therapy. No evidence of residual, locally recurrent or metastatic disease after completion of surgery. Patients with clinical suspicion of metastases must undergo radiological assessments per institutional practice to rule out distant disease. Wound healing after breast cancer surgery adequate per investigator’s assessment to allow initiation of study treatment within ≤ 9 weeks of last systemic neoadjuvant therapy No adjuvant chemotherapy planned. Note that adjuvant hormonal treatment is allowed during the study. General criteria Signed Informed Consent Form Age ≥ 18 years at time of signing Informed Consent Form"

The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) and copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) . The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercours e) or use a condom , and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as defined below: With female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the study treatment periods and for seven months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of preventing drug exposure . A negative serum pregnancy test must be available prior to randomization forwomen of childbearing potential (defined as post-menarchal, has not had ≥ 12 continuous months"

51,page_51,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 51/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria before enrolment . The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or recor d reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 4.5.2 Medical History , Concomitant Medication, and Demographic Data Medical history will be recorded at baseline and will include: clinically significant diseases within the past five years , surgeries, breast and other cancer history (including prior cancer therapies and procedures ),complete cardiovascular history, cardiac risk factors, and reproductive status. In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or home opathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within seven days prior to initiation of study treatment will be recorded. Demographic data collected will include age, sex, and self-reported race /ethnicity. 4.5.3 Pathology Pathology report s from the initial breast cancer diagnosis and from breast cancer surgery will be collected prior to randomization . The report from breast surgery will be used to determine pathological response status for randomization stratification. Results of HER2 and hormone receptor testing conducted by a local laboratory based on breast tumour tissue obtained prior to initiation of neoadjuvant treatment will be collected to assure study eligibility (HER2) and for randomization stratification (hormone receptor status) . 4.5.4 Physical Examinations A complete physical examination, performed during Screening and other specified visits, should include physical measurements (body weight in kilograms and, at screening only, height in centimetres )and evaluation of the head; eyes ;ears;nose ;throat ;and the cardiovascular, dermatologic , musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurologic systems. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. Limited, symptom -directed physical examinations including weight, should be performed at specified post-baseline visits and as clinically indicated. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF. During the study Follow -up Period, physical examinations should be completed per institutional practice or the ACS /ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline [Runowicz et al. 2016, see Appendix 4]. 4.5.5 Vital Signs Vital signs will include temperature and, with the patient in a seated position, heart rate, respirat ionrate,and systolic and diastolic blood pressure . 4.5.6 ECOG Performance status Performance status will be assessed according to ECOG definitions provided in Appendix 5."
52,page_52,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 52/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 124.5.7 Clinical Breast Examination Clinical breast examinations must be performed prior to study entry to assess post-surgery wound healing, eligibility for adjuvant treatment initiation ,and to detect residual /recurrent disease. During the study treatment periods clinical breast examinations must be conducted to detect signs of locoregional relapse during the study treatment periods. The examination should be conducted per institutional practice and include examination of the breast, axilla, and supraclavicular fossa. If the patient shows disease progression post-baseline, this should be recorded on the Disease Status eCRF . During the study Follow -up Period, assessments should be completed per institutional practice orthe ACS /ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline [Runowicz et al. 2016 , see Appendix 4]. 4.5.8 Mammograms Mammograms conducted at the time of diagnosis (before initiation of the neoadjuvant treatment) as well as pre-surgery (if performed) will be collected. Mammograms collected and/or conducted forthe study (including pre-neoadjuvant treatment, pre-surgery, and Follow -up Period evaluations) can be replaced by another conventional imaging method such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)orultrasound per institutional practice, at the investigator’s discretion, but the same method of assessment must be used for each evaluation for an individual patient. If a mammogram (or acceptable alternative breast imaging evaluation) has been conducted as part of routine care within four months prior to the End of Treatment Visit, it may be used in lieu of the End of Treatment Visit evaluation . 4.5.9 Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Recurrence or Second Primary Cancer All patients must be followed to assess disease recurrence and second primary cancers. The designation of disease recurrence whether local, regional or distant, or a diagnosis of second primary cancer will be conducted per institutional practice or accordi ng to ACS / ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline [Runowicz et al. 2016 ; see Appendix 4] but can be made only when clinical, laboratory, radiological and/or histological findings support the diagnosis. The diagnosis of a breast cancer progression, recurrence or a second primary tumour should be confirmed histologically whenever clinically possible. The earliest date of diagnosis of recurrent disease should be used and recorded. This date should be based on objective clinical, radiological, histolog ical, or cytological evidence. The date of disease recurrence should be reported as the date of first diagnosis of a lesion (i.e. an objective finding), not the date of occurrence of the first symptom. Recurrent disease includes local, regional, and distan t recurrence and contralateral invasive breast cancer. Patients who are diagnosed with in situbreast disease or second (non- breast) malignancies should be maintained in regular follow -up wherever possible to fully capture any subsequent recurrent breast c ancer events. In cases of diagnostic doubt (e.g. ill - defined, palpable mass in an irradiated breast), histologic or cytologic confirmation of recurrence should be obtained whenever possible."
53,page_53,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 53/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Some patients may develop a suspicious recurrence that leads quickly to death without the possibility of confirming relapse of disease. Efforts should be made to obtain an autopsy report in such patients. 4.5.10 Cardiac Function Prior to study enrolment, patients must have an assessment for history of cardiac events, a physica l examination, an ECG (per standard institutional methods), and an LVEF assessment (by ECHO or MUGA) to exclude any cardiac condition that would render them ineligible for participation in this trial. Cardiac function will be assessed locally according to the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). All patients must have anLVEF ≥ 55% by ECHO orMUGA scan in order to be eligible for the study . The same LVEF evaluation method should be used throughout the study for each patient and should be performed and assessed by the same assessor ifpossible . Results of LVEF assessments must be reviewed prior to study treatment administration on the scheduled visit day. Investigators must be aware oflocal institutional regulations regarding the maximum allowable frequency of repeat MUGA scans. The repeated administration of radioisotopes is limited in some nuclear medicine laboratories, and patients in this study require LVEF assessment on more than four occasions within oneyear. 4.5.11 Laboratory Samples Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for analysis: Haematology: haemoglobin, total white blood count (WBC), ANC /neutrophil count , platelet count. Limited biochemistry: alkaline phosphatase; AST; ALT; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); total bilirubin; creatinine. Albumin should be measured at Screening for determining patient eligibility . Bilirubin fractions (direct and indirect) must be included if total bilirubin is greater than ULN. Pregnancy test For all women of childbearing potential (see Section 4.1.1 ), pregnancy tests must be performed via serum -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at baseline and via urine tests thereafter according to Appendix 1until seven months after discontinuation of study treatment. Any positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum -HCG test. During the study treatment period s, pregnancy test results must be available prior to study treatment administration. For women who are notof childbearing potential, documentation must be present in medical history confirming that the patient is not of childbearing potential. 4.5.12 Patient Reported Outcomes Patient reported outcomes will be collected via paper questionnaires .

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY PLA N Pertuzumab and trastuzumab drug substances in the FDC SC are identical to the drug substances in Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV and Herceptin SC. As described in Section 1.2.4 , the safety profiles and tolerability of Herceptin SC and Herceptin IV have been shown to be consistent . As also described in Section 1.2.4 , preliminary safety data from healthy volunteers and EBC patients treated with pertuzumab SC co-administered or co-mixed with Herceptin SC are consistent with prior experience with combined treatment with Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV. The safety plansfor this study , as w ell asfor the ongoing Phase III Roche Study WO40324 (see Section 1.2.4 ) comparing pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC with P+H IV, aretherefore based on the anticipated safety risks of Herceptin IVand Perjeta IV, alone and in combination , described in the Perjet a and Herceptin Investigator’s Brochures. Measures taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study include eligibility criteria designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities and ongoing safety monitoring. Safety monitoring includes assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of AEs andcardiac function evaluations . The anticipated important safety risks for pertuzumab and trastuzumab are outlined below. Please refer to the Perjeta and Herceptin Investigator’s Brochure sfor complete summar ies of safety information. 5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with Pertuzumab 5.1.1.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions /Anaphy laxis and A dministration -Related Reactions Like other monoclonal antibodies , Perjeta IV has been associated with ARRs. These include: Infusi on-related reactions (i.e., a systemic reaction with symptoms such as chills, diarrhoea, fatigue, headache, nausea and pyrexia). Such reactions are likely to be due to cytokine release and typically occur during, or very shortly after, the administration of monoclonal antibodies, but they may also show a delayed onset. In general, infusion -related AEs are more frequent and severe with the first infusion, and decrease in number and severity over time. The majority of AEs resolve fully. Injection -related reac tions with SC administration may manifest themselves as : −Systemic reactions, similar to the infusion -related reactions"
57,page_57,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 57/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12−Local injection site reactions (ISRs )with signs and symptoms such as erythema, induration, swelling, pain, hypoaesthesia and discomfort Hypersensitivity reactions /anaphylaxis aresystemic reactions caused activation of mast cells and basophils by antigen -bound IgE that results in degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators. Hypersensitivity reactions /anaphylaxis events are likely to start mildly and increase in number and severity over time. Severe hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis, has been observed in clinical trials with treatment of Perjeta IV. Patients in this study who experience a Grade 4 allergic reaction or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should be discontinued fromstudy treatment. Since there is apotential for delayed onset, patients should be instructed to contact the treating physician with any concerns , signs or symptoms subsequent to treatment administration. Administration- related reactions may be difficult to distinguish from hypersensitivity reaction s. In this study, if a loading dose of Perjeta IVis required, it will be given over 60 (± 10) minutes, followed by an observation period of 60 minutes. If theloading dose infusion is well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered over a period of 30 minutes (± 10) with anobservation period of 30 minutes. If symptoms occur, the infusion should be slowed down or interrupted and appropri ate medical therapies should be administered. The observation period should be completed prior tothe subsequent Herceptin IV infusion. Premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, or corticosteroids may be administered before Perjeta IV administration . For pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC administration, patients should be monitored for 30 minutes after theirfirstdose regardless of whether a loading dose is required. Patients should be monitored for 10-15 minutes following subsequent administrations unless a loading dose is required .If a patient requires a loading dose after their first pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC treatment, they should be monitored for 30 minutes after dosing. If ARRs occur, patients must be monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms. Perjeta IV and pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC will be administered by staff who have immediate access to emergency equipment and are trained to monitor for, and respond to, medical emergencies . Please refer to the Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent data related to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions. 5.1.1.2 Symptomatic Left Ventricular Sy stolic Dy sfunction Similar to trastuzumab , pertuzumab ’s interaction with HER2 may be associated with a risk of symptomatic LVSD. Cardiac dysfunction may manifest as an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic decrease in LVEF (NCI CTCAE, Grade 1 and Grade 2) or as a symptomatic decreased in LVEF /CHF (NCI CTCAE, Grade ≥ 3; NYHA Class III or IV). Please refer to Appendix 6 for manage ment of patients with decreased LVEF. In the Roche pivotal trial WO20698/TOC4129g (CLEOPATRA) in MBC patients, treatment with P+H IVand docetaxel was not associated with increases in the incidence of symptomatic LVSD or LVEF declines compared with placebo in combination with Herceptin IV and docetaxel. The incidence of symptomatic LVSD was 1.5% (6/408) for patients receiving P+H IV and docetaxel (events in the treatment period only) and 1.5% (7/396) in the"

Regardless of treatment arm, patients who had received prior anthracyclines or prior radiotherapy to the chest area were at higher risk of decreased LVEF. In the Roche Phase II WO209697 study (NEOSPHERE ) of neoadjuvant P+H IVand docetaxel , the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction defined as LVEF decline ≥ 10% to below 50% was higher in the Perjeta IVplus docetaxel -treated groups (7.4% with Perjeta IV plus docetaxel , 8.4% P+H IVplus docetaxel) than the Herceptin IV plus docetaxel treated group (1.9%) . An increased incidence of LVEF declines was observed in patients treated in the Perjeta IV plus Herceptin IV and docetaxel . Left ventricular ejection fraction recovered to ≥ 50% in all patients. In the ongoing Roche Phase II WO29217 study (BERENICE ; neoadjuvant anthracycline /taxane based regimens given in combination with P+H IV), the overall incidence of LVEF declines and symptomatic LVD in the neoadjuvant period is consistent with previous data in the neoadjuvant setting. Perjeta has not been studied in patients with the following: a pre-treatment LVEF value of ≤50%; aprior history of CHF;decreases in LVEF to< 50% during prior Herceptin adjuvant therapy ;conditi ons that could impair left ventricular function such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment ,or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure to > 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or its equivalent. Subjects with significant cardiac disease or baseline LVEF < 55% are not eligible for this study. As in all Perjeta trials, study patients must undergo routine cardiac monitoring by ECHO or MUGA scan. During the screening /baseline period, complete medical history information will be collected from all patients to explore possible riskfactors for treatment - associated CHF. Monitoring of LVEF is required while patient s arereceiving study treatment and up to 24 months following discontinuation of study treatment (see Appendix 1).If symptomatic LVSD (heart failure; SAE of NCI CTCAE v4.0Grade 3 or 4; NYHA Class IIIor IV) develops, the patient must be monitored carefully with repeat LVEF assessments. Symptomatic LVSD should be treated and followed according to standard medical practice. Refer to the algorithm in Appendix 6for decisions regarding the continuation or discontinuation of study treatment based on LVEF assessment in asymptomatic patients. Please refer to the Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent data relating torisk of LVSD and CHF. 5.1.1.3 Epidermal Gro wth Factor Receptor (HER1) -Related Toxicities Pertuzumab inhibit sHER2 heterodimerization with other members of the HER family including HER1/ EGFR. As a result, pertuzumab may cause toxicities associated with the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ssuch as diarrhoea , rash and other dermatologic toxicities (e.g., dry skin, pruritus, nail disorders, mucositis). The most recent data relating to the risk ofEGFR -related toxicities are found in the Perjeta Investigator’s Brochure. 5.1.1.3.1 Diarrh oea Diarrhoea has been observed in approximately 60% of patients (treatment -related diarrhoea in 50% of patients) being treated with Perjeta IV in Phase II single -agent studie s, and in up to 90% of patients in combination therapy studies. Diarrhoea was NCICTCAE Grade 1 or 2 in the majority of cases. To prevent dehydration, early treatment of diarrhoea with anti-"

The rash was generally mild to moderate in intensity and NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or 2. The rash /skin reaction appeared to be treatable in some patients with standard acne therapies, including topical and oral antibiotics. 5.1.1.3.3 Mucositis Mucosit is has been observed in approximately 15% of patients treated with Perjeta IVin Phase II single -agent studies and in up to 50% of patients in combination studies. The most common preferred terms reported were mucosal inflammation and stomatitis. 5.1.1.3.4 Intersti tial Lung Disease Interstitial lung disease is associated with the use of EGFR inhibitors and therefore could occur with pertuzumab. The few reports of interstitial lung disease in Perjeta IV-treated patients received to date also had evidence of alternati ve causes (e.g., concomitant medication, preceding /concurrent neutropenia with potential infection or other relevant medical history). In the pivotal study WO20698/TOC4129g (CLEOPATRA; Herceptin IV and docetaxel with Perjeta IV or placebo ), respiratory events (i.e., dyspnoea , cough), which are unspecific symptoms of various conditions, including infusion -related reaction or hypersensitivity / anaphylaxis, cardiac dysfunction, and respiratory disease, were reported in > 10% ofPerjeta IV -treated patients . 5.1.2 Risks A ssociated with Trastuzumab Serious adverse reactions, including LVSD, ARRs, hypersensitivity, allergic -likereactions, and pulmonary events, have been observed in patients receiving Herceptin IV and/or SC . 5.1.2.1 Administration -Related Reactions, A llerg ic-Like Reactions, and Hypersensitivity Herceptin IV and SC have been associated with ARRs. ARRs aredefined as systemic ‘infusion -related reactions’ associated with Herceptin IV and systemic reactions associated with Herceptin SC. In some studies, local ISRs were excluded from the ARR definitions. A revised definition of ARRs potentially associated with IV and SC administration of Herceptin was used in Study BO22227 (see Section 1.2.4 ) and is applicable to all future and ongoing Herceptin IV and SC studies. This definition is based on a modified version of the anaphylactic reaction Standardised Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) Query (as modified by the addition of the following four MedDRA Preferred Terms: hypersensitivity, drug hypersensitivity, infusion- related reaction, and injection-site hypersensitivity). The revised definition of ARRs differs from that in previous studies inthe metastatic and early breast cancer settings which reported only ‘infusion reactions’ or"
60,page_60,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 60/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12‘infusion -related reactions’ associated with Herceptin administration and makes comparison of the rates of ARRs between studies difficult. Serious adverse react ions to Herceptin IV that have been reported infrequently include dyspnoea , hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, asthma, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, urticaria, and angioedema. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week following Herceptin IV administration. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of administration -related symptoms or pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the Herceptin administration. Patient s should be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their physician if these symptoms occur. Patients who have dyspnoea at rest due to comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal ARR therefore should not be treated with trastuzumab . Although such events were not reported in clinical trials with Herceptin SC, caution should be exercised, as these events have been associated with the IV formulation. These reactions were usually associated with the first adminis tration of Herceptin IV and generally occurred during or immediately following administration. In this study, all patients will be pre-treated with Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV or SC in neoadjuvant phase of their treatment. Due treatment delays necessary for breast cancer surgery, a loading dose of Herceptin IV may berequired . If re quired, the loading dose must beadministered over 90 (± 10) minutes, after which the patient must be observed for 60 minutes. If the loading dose infusion is well tolerated, subsequent maintenance doses may be administered over 30 (± 10) minutes, followed by an observation period of 30 minutes. Premedication with antipyretics, antihistamines, or corticosteroids may be administered before Perjeta IV administration (which will occur before Herceptin IV administration). In Study BO22227 , the overall incidence of ARRs in the Herceptin IV arm was 37.2% (111/298) compared with 47.8% (142/297) in the Herceptin SC arm. Most of the ARRs occurred in the neoadjuv ant treatment phase, with an incidence of 32.6% in the Herceptin IV arm and 38.4% in the Herceptin SC arm. Fewer ARRs were reported durin g the adjuvant treatment phase of the study. All but one of the ARRs was Grade 1 or Grade 2 in intensity and the distribution was balanced between the study phases in terms of the most common AEs and MedDRA System Organ Class .There was a higher rate of Herceptin SC injection- site reactions compared with theHerceptin IV infusion (11.1% in Herceptin SC vs. 0.3% in Herceptin IV). With fewexceptions, all of these events were of Grade 1 intensity. Serious reactions to Herceptin IV have been treated successful ly with supportive therapy, such as oxygen, β-agonists, and corticosteroids. In this study, patients should be monitored for 30 minutes after their first pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC dose administration regardless of whether a loading dose is required . Patients should be monitored for 10-15 minutes following subsequent administrations unless a loading dose is required .If a patient requires a loading dose sometime after their first pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC dose, they should be monitored for 30 minutes following administration. If ARRs occur, patients must be monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms."

Please refer to the Herceptin Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent data related tothe risk of ARRs, allergic -like reactions, and hypersensitivity reactions. 5.1.2.2 Pulmonary Events Severe pulmonary events have been reported with the use of the Herceptin IV formulation in thepost-marketing setting. These events have occasionally been fatal. They may occur as part of an ARR or with delayed onset. In addition, cases of interstitial lung disease, including lung infiltrates, ARDS, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema, and respiratory insufficiency have been reported with Herceptin IV. These events have been most common with the first infusion, and their severity has decreased with subsequent infusions. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy, such as oxygen, β-agonists, and corticosteroids. Acute respiratory distress syndrome has been reported with a fatal outcome . Please refer to the Herceptin Investigator’s Brochure for the most recent data related tothe risk of pulmonary events. 5.1.2.3 Symptomatic Left Ventricular Sy stolic Dy sfunction Heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) has been observed in patients who have received Herceptin IV and/or SC alone or in combination with docetaxel following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) -containing chemotherapy. This event may be moderate tosevere and has been associated with death. Risk factors for Herceptin -associated LVSD include increased age, concomitant administration with anthracyclines, anddeclining LVEF while on Herceptin treatment. If symptomatic cardiac failure develops during treatment , it should be treated with standard medications for this purpose. The rates of ca rdiac dysfunction observed in large Herceptin adjuvant trials in EBC are < 4% with event rates comparable across the studies. In Study BO22227 (see Section 1.2.4 ), the proportion of patients who experienced a significant decrease in LVEF (defined as adrop in LVEF ≥ 10 percentage points to a value of < 50%) was similar in each treatment arm (12 [4.2%] patients in Herceptin IV and 11 [3.8%] patients in Herceptin SC). Because the half-life of Herceptin IV is approximately 28-38 days, Herceptin may persist in the circulation for up to 7months after the last dose of Herceptin. Patients who receive anthracyclines after the last dose of Herceptin may possibly be at increased risk ofLVSD. If possible, physicians should avoid anthracycline- based therapy for up to 27weeks (7months) after stopping Herceptin. If anthracyclines are used, the patient’s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. Most patients who developed heart failure in the Phase III trials of Herceptin IV or SCin MBC and EBC improved with standard medical treatment. This treatment included diuretics, cardiac glycosides, and/or ACE inhibitors. The majority ofpatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of Herceptin treatment continued on weekly therapy with Herceptin without experiencing additional clinical cardiac events."
62,page_62,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 62/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Please refer to the Herceptin Investig ator’s Brochure for the most recent data related tothe risk of LVSD. 5.1.3 Reproductive Risk sAssociated with Per tuzumab and Trastuzumab Reproductive toxicity was identified during nonclinical studies with Perjeta . Perjeta administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis led to delayed renal development, oligohydramnios, and embryo -foetal deaths. However, reproductive toxicity studies with trastuzumab conducted in female cynomolgus monkeys revealed no trastuzumab -related embryotoxicity or effec ts on foetal development. There are noclinical studies of trastuzumab or pertuzumab in pregnant women. IgGs are known to cross the placental barrier. In the post-marketing setting, cases of oligohydramnios, some associated with fatal pulmonary hypoplasia of the foetus , have been reported in pregnant women receiving Herceptin. Therefore, neither pertuzumab or trastuzumab should be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the potential risk to the foetus . Due to these risks, female participants of childbearing potential in this study are tested for pregnancy prior to study entry and must undergo pregnancy testing during the study and, guided be the half-life of Herceptin IV, up to seven months after their laststudy treatmen t. Pregnancies in female participants or partners of male participants will be monitored. Further, participants of childbearing potential (defined as post-menarchal, has not reached a post- menopausal state [post -menopausal defined as ≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause], and has not undergone surgical sterilization [removal of ovaries and/or uterus] ), must remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of <1% per year, or two effective non -hormonal contraceptive methods during the study treatment periods and for7months after the last dose of study treatment and must refrain from donating eggs during the same period . Women who have had a tubal ligation do not require additional contraception. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. Men with female partners of childbearing potential , or with pregnant female partners, participating in the study must remain abstinent or use a condom during the study treatment periods and for seven months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. All male participants must also refrain from donating sperm durin g this same period. Examples of non-hormonal contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate) and copper IUDs . The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation methods ) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Alternatively, two of the following effective forms of contraception may be used instead: Placement of non -hormonal IUD or intrauterine system"
63,page_63,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 63/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Consideration should be given to the type of device being used, as there arehigher failure rates quoted for certain types (e.g., steel or copper wire). Condom with spermicidal foam /gel/film/cream /suppository Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical /vault caps) with spermicidal foam /gel/film/cream /suppository The use of barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. The following should be noted: Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are nothighly effective forms of contrace ption. Therefore, the use of additional spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection. However, spermicides alone are ineffective at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of contraception and should not be used alone. It should be noted that two forms of effective contraception are required. A double barrier method is acceptable, which is defined as condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical /vault caps) with spermicidal foam /gel/film/cream /suppository. 5.1.3.1 Breastfeeding It is not known whether trastuzumab or pertuzumab areexcreted in human milk. Since maternal IgGis excreted in milk and either trastuzumab or pertuzumab could harm infant growth and development, women must discontinue nursing during study treatment and should not breastfeed for at least seven months following the last study treatment . 5.1.4 Management of Patient sWho Experience Adverse Events 5.1.4.1 Dose Modifications for Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV, and Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab FDC SC Dose modifications of s tudy treatment are not permitted. 5.1.4.2 Dose Delay s and Treatment Interruption for Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV, and Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab FDC SC The administration of study treatment may be delayed to assess or treat AEs, such as cardiac AEs. During the study treatment period ,a dose delay of up to (and including) sixweeks (i.e., up to and including nine weeks between doses) will be permitted to allow AErecovery to baseline. Following a dose delay of less than 3weeks (i.e., < 6 weeks between doses), study treatment does not need to be reloaded (only the maintenance doses needs to be given). Patients receiving pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC with ≥ 6 weeks since their last study treatment during the study treatment periods, must receive a loading dose consisting of 1200 mg pertuzumab and 600 mg trastuzumab FDC SC before continuing with maint enance doses for subsequent administrations. Patients should be monitored for 30 minutes after their first pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC dose administration in the study (regardless of whether a loading dose is required ) and if a loading dose is requir ed during the study . Patients should be monitored for 10-15 minutes following maintenance dose administrations."

Perjeta IV loading dose (if required) will be administered as a 60 -minute infusion (± 10 minutes), followed by an observation period of 60 minutes. If the loading dose infusion is well tolerated, subsequent maintenance doses can be administered over a period of 30 minutes (± 10 minutes) with an observation period of 30minutes. The observation period should be completed prior to the subsequent Herceptin IV infusion. Patients receiving Herceptin IV with had ≥ 6 weeks since their last study treatment during the study treatment periods, must receive a loading dose of 8 mg/kg before continuing with maintenance doses for subsequent administrations. Herceptin IV loading dose (if required) will be administered as an infusion over approximately 90 (± 10) minutes after which the patient must be observed for 60 minutes. If the loading dose is well tolerated, subsequent maintenance doses can be administered as 30-minute infusions (± 10 minutes) followed by an observation period of 30 minutes. If study treatment iswithheld formore than two cycles (> 9 weeks) because of toxicity, the patient should be discontinued from study treatment , unless resumption of treatment is approved following investigator discussion with the Medical Monitor. Study treatment may be suspended for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with Medical Monitor approval. The investigator and the Medical Monitor will determine the acceptable length of treatment interruption. Patients who are permanently discontinued from study treatment should betreated at the discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated. The patient will continue to be followed post-treatment as describ ed in Section 4.6.1 . 5.1.4.3 Management Guidelines Supportive care and medical management of AEs are at the discretion of the investigator, unless specifically listed below. 5.1.4.3.1 Symptomatic LVSD and/or LVEF Decline All patients must have a baseline LVEF ≥55%. LVEF will be monitored regularly according to the Schedule of Activities (see Appendix 1). If an investigator is concerned that an AE may be related to LVSD, an additional LVEF measurement should be performed as soon as possible and within three weeks. Symptomatic LVSD (CHF) should be assessed as “heart failure” on the basis of NCI CTCAE v4.0 and NYHA classification (see Appendix 7 ). Symptomatic LVSD (CHF) should be treated and monitored according to standard medical practice. These patients should be evaluated by a certified cardiologist . Appendix 6summarizes the management of study medication in patients who develop an asymptomatic decrease in LVEF. The decision to initiate study treatment and whether to continue or stop therapy should be based on two factors: measured LVEF and changes in LVEF from baseline. If a significant LVEF decrease occurs, this decrease should be"

Heart failure and asymptomatic LVEF decline AEs must be graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0 (see Appendix 7 ) and reported in the eCR F as described in Table 1. 5.1.4.3.2 Hypersensitivity / Anaphy laxis and A dministration -Related Reactions (Infusion or Injection) Study treatment administration should be stopped in subjects who develop dyspnoea or clinically significant hypotension (defined per investigator’s discretion). Patients who experience any of the following events will be discontinued from study treatment: Grade 4 allergic reaction Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reaction ARDS Bronchospasm Patients who experience ARRs may be managed by: Slowing or stopping Perjeta IV or Herceptin IV infusion Stopping the injection of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC Supportive care with oxygen, β-agonists, antihistamines, antipyretics, orcorticosteroids as appropriate at the investigator's discretion, as per institutional practice Subsequently pre-medicating with analgesia and antihistamines as per institutional practice Patients should be monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms of any systemic reactions. In order to be able to calculate time to onset of such reactions, the occurrence ofassociated AEs must bedocumented with the date and time of the onset and duration of the event (i.e., resolution of the event). All ARRs s hould be recorded as described in Section 5.2.4.3 . 5.1.4.3.3 EGFR -Related Toxicities Diarrh oea To prevent dehydration, early treatment of diarrh oea with anti-diarrheal medication (e.g. loperamide) should be considered, and patients should be treated with fluids and electrolyte replacement, as clinically indicated. Rash /Skin Reactions Treatment recommendations for EGFR -associated rash /skin reactions include topical or oral antibiotics, topical pimecrolimus, and topical steroids or systemic steroids (for severe reactions). These agents may be used in patients experiencing pertuzumab -related rash / skin reactions, as clinically indicated, although they have not been studied in this context."

Although for some cytotoxic agents, mucositis may be reduced by cooling the mouth using ice chips before and during the infusion. 5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINITIONS Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs (including SAEs and AEs of special interest ),performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments ,measuring protocol -specified vital signs ,and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An AEcan therefore be any of the following: Any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal labor atory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections 5.3.5.8 and5.3.5.9 for more information) Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment ofstudy treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor ) A serious adverse event is any AEthat meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the AEactually causes or lea ds to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any AEthat,had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue ,might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (i.e., the AEresul ts in substantial disruption of the patient 'sability to conduct normal life functions)"
67,page_67,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 67/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Is a congenital anomaly /birth defect in a neonate /infant born to a mother exposed to study drug Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical /surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe ""and ""serious ""are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE(e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE v4.0; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AErecorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor ) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows : An asymptomatic decline in LVEF that requires treatment or that leads to discontinuation of study treatment Cases of potential drug-induce d liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law (see Section 5.3.5.6) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug , as defined below Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 5.2.4 Selected A dverse Events Additional data will be collected for the selected AEs described below. 5.2.4.1 Heart Failure Symptomatic LVSD (referred to as heart failure) should be reported as an SAE. If the diagnosis is heart failure, it should be reported as such, and not as individual signs and symptoms of heart failure. Heart failure should be graded according to both NCI CTCAE and NYHA Class (see Appendix 7 ).Left ventricular ejection fraction results must also be reported. Heart failure occurring during the study (including the Follow -up Period) must be reported irrespective of causal re lationship and followed until one of the following occurs: resolution or improvement to baseline status, no further improvement can be expected, or death."

The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 4 ): Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable) Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments Known assoc iation of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non-treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occu rrence of the event Table 4 Causal A ttribution Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event f ollows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unl ess it fulfils the criteria specified below. Evidence exists that the adverse event has an aetiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre-existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug). 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology /concepts when recording AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one AEterm should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. Refer to Section 5.2.4 for procedures for recording heart failure, asymptomatic decreases in LVEF and ARRs. 5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms For AEs other than heart failure and ARRs (see Section 5.2.4 ), a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically"
72,page_72,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 72/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That AreSecondary to Other Events In general, AEs that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A m edically significant secondary AEthat is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomi ting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent AEis one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the even t is first reported. If a persistent AEbecomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non- serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to SAEs . A recurrent AEis one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an AEshould be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE. A laboratory test result must be reported as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms"
73,page_73,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 73/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalaemia ) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment It is the investigator 'sresponsib ility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease orsyndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g.,""elevated potassium, ""as opposed to ""abnormal potassium ""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, anelevated serum potassi um level of 7.0mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalaemia ."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent AEs). 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result must be reported as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concom itant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator 'sjudgment It is the investigator 'sresponsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality s hould be classified as an AE. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of adisease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on record ing persistent AEs)."
74,page_74,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 74/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 125.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3baseline ) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin (> 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's Law). Therefore, investigators must report as an AEthe occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with total bilirubin > 2ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin) Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3x baseline value in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a n SAE or anAEof special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.7 Deaths For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol - specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to recurrence of breast cancer should be recorded on the Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF. All other deaths that occur during the adverse event reporting period , regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death ""should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death ""should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should be used only for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre -existing heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.8 Pre-existing Medical Conditions A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an AEonly if the frequency, severity, or character ofthe condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on"
75,page_75,"SC Fixed -Dose Combination of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 75/ Protocol MO40628 , Version 12theAdverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches ""). 5.3.5.9 Lack of Efficacy or Recurrence ofBreast Cancer Events that are clearly consistent with breast cancer recurrence should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. Disease recurrence will be determined based on the investigator’s assessment as per institution al practice or the ACS /ASCO Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline (see Appendix 4). Though a determination of clinical recurrence could be based on symptomatic deterioration , every effort should be made to document recurrence through use ofobjective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to wh ether an event is due to disease recurrence , it should be reported as an AE. 5.3.5.10 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Any AEthat results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented andreported as an SAE (per the definition of SAE in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an AEor an SAE: Hospitalization for respite care Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study drug administration or insertion of access device for study drug administration) Hospitalization for a pre-existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: −The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the pre-existing condition −The patient has not experienced an AE Hospitalization due solely to recurrence of breast cancer An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be an SAE , but should be reported as an AEinstead: Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside o f normal outpatient clinic operating hours 5.3.5.11 Patient Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. Because the data collection processes and intent of interpretation of investigator -assessed AEs and patient -completed questionnaires are inherently different, these data sets will not be reconciled by the Sponsor and should not be used as source documents for AEreporting by the investigator ."

After 28 days from the last study treatment, SAEs related to study treatment and all AEs of special interest will be reported until 7months after the last study treatment. Additional events that will be reported during this period are described in Section 5.3.1 . After seven months from the last study treatment until the end of the study , SAEs related to study treatment will be reporte d. Additional ev ents that will be reported during this period are described in Section 5.6. Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Areport will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system. In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, thepaper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event /Adverse Event of special interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators . Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submi tted via the EDC system. Instructions for reporting SAEs thatoccur after the end of the study are provided in Section 5.6. 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies In addition to the reporting requirements described below, other information will be requested by Roche /Genentech Drug Safety in order to learn more about the effects of pertuzumab and trastuzumab on pregnancy. This information will be requested on any pregnancy or infant exposed to Perjeta IV, Herceptin IV or pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC at specific time points (i.e., after having received the initial report during the first trimester, at the end of the second trimester, 2 weeks after the expected date of delivery, and at 3, 6, and 12 months of the infant’s life).

In addition, the inves tigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. 5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within seven months after the final dose of study drug. A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponso r or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Attempts should be made to collect and repo rt details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy. Ifthe authorization has been signed, the investigator should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the foetus , to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician. 5.4.3.3 Abortions Any abortion should be classified as an SAE (asthe Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defects Any congenital anomaly /birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug orthefemale partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.4.4 Reporting Requirements for Cases of Accidental Overdose or Medication Error Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as ""special situations""), are defined as follows: Accidental overdose: accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher than the assigned dose Medication error: accidental deviation in the administration of a drug In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the drug."

Each AEassociated with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated AEfulfilsseriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24hours after learning ofthe event; see Section 5.4.2 ). Adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation: Accide ntal overdose: Enter the AEterm. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the AEterm. Check the ""Medication error"" box. Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the AEterm. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. In addition, all special situations associated withstudy treatment , regardless of whether they result in an AE, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported tothe Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24hours after learning of the event). Special situations should be recorded as described below: Accidental overdose: Enter the drug name and ""accidental overdose"" as the event term. Check the ""Accidental ove rdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the name of the drug administered and a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug administered) as the event term. Check the ""Medication error"" box. Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name and ""accidental overdose"" as the event term. Check the ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details. Intercepted medication error: Enter the drug name and ""intercepted medication error"" as the event term. Check the ""Medication error"" box. Enter a description of the error inthe additional case details. As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the completion of two Adverse Event eCRF pages, one to report the accidental overdose and one to report the headache. The ""Accidental overdose"" and ""Medication error"" boxes would need to be checked on both eCRF pages. 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PA TIENT S AFTER ADV ERSE EVENTS 5.5.1 Investigator Follo w-Up The investigator should follow each AEuntil the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assesse d as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.

The results of this interim analysis will be evaluated by a Sponsor’s Internal Monitoring Committ ee. Further details will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 7. DATA COLLECTION AND M ANAGEMENT 7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE A contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study. The CRO will produce eCRF Specifications for the study based on Sponsor’s templates including quality checking to be performed on the data. Electronic CRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system's audit trail. System backups for data store d by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor's standard procedures. PRO and HCP reported outcomes data will be collected on paper questionnaires .Study site staff will enter these data into the EDC system. Paper copies of each questionnaire are source documents (see Section 7.3) and will be maintained at the study site. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS Electronic CRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. Electronic CRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor . All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the data is required. 7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments,"

Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entere d directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYST EMS When clinical observations are entered directly into astudy site'scomputerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change , and date of the change. 7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, paper PRO and HCP reported outcome data, Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations. No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor . Written notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 8.

For all women of childbearing potential, Ppregnancy tests must be performed via serum -human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) at baseline within seven days prior to first study treatment administration. Urine pregnancy tests should be repeated during the Treatment Cross - over and Treatment Continuation Periods within seven day s prior to every three treatment cy cles starting at Cycle 4, Cycle 7, Cycle 11 and Cycle 15 (or at last treatment cycle) , (and as clinically indicated) , with results available prior to study treatment administration, as well as at the End of Treatment Visit and at the Follow -up Visit until seven months after discontinuation of study treatment. Any positive urine pregnanc y test must be confirmed with a serum -HCG test. p.Adverse event report ing period will continue up to seven months after the last dose of study drug. After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study treatment, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected. After initiation of study treatment, all AEs regardless of relationship to study drug will be reported until 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Between 28 days and 7 months after the last dose of study drug, drug -related SAEs , AEs of special interest , heart failure, pregnancies, non −breast -related second primary malignancies and deaths, should continue to be collected. After the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as seven months after the last dose of study drug), drug-related SAEs , AEs of special interest, heart failure, non −breast -related second primary malig nancies and deaths, should continue to be collected should be collected. q.All concomitant medications used by the patient from seven days prior to initiation of study drug until the End of Treatment Visit should be reported. After the End of Treatment Visi t and until the end of the study, only medications used for the treatment of cancer will be reported. r.The Patient Preference Questionnaire (PPQ) must be completed following study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cross -over Treatment Period Cycle 6. Pa tients who discontinued study treatment prior to study treatment Cy cle 6 should complete the questionnaire at the time of dis continuation as long as they have received at least one dose of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC , Perjeta IV and Herceptin IV post-randomization. s.Patients in Arm A will complete the Therapy Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire for IV administration (TASQ -IV) immediately following study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cy cle 3 of the Treatment Cross -over Period and the Therap y Adm inistration Satisfaction Questionnaire for SC administration (TASQ -SC) immediately following study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cy cle 6 of the Treatment Cross -over Period. Patients in Arm B will complete the TASQ -SC and TASQ -IV immediately fol lowing study treatment administration on Day 1 of Cy cle 3 and 6 of the Treatment Cross -over Period respectively. Patients who switch study treatment due to investigator -assessed lack of tolerance should complete the TASQ corresponding to the study treatme nt they cannot tolerate prior to switching treatment (i.e. after the decision to change study treatment has been approved by the Medical Monitor and before receiving the next study treatment). t.During the study treatment periods, patients must complete the EORTC QLQ -30before the patient and clinician receives any information on disease status and prior to treatment administration on the scheduled visit day. During the Follow -up Period, the EORTC QLQ -30 m ust be completed at 18 months, 2 years, and 3 years f rom randomization."

Applicable HCPs are described in each of the questionnaires (HCPQ -Treatment Room, HCPQ -Drug Preparation Area). Instructions for which questions should be completed in each questionnaire at each timepoint are indicated in the introductio n to each questionnaire. v.Mammograms conducted at the time of diagnosis (before initiatio n of the neoadjuvant treatment) as well as pre -surgery (if performed) will be collected. Mammograms collected and/or conducted for the study (including pre -neoadjuvant treatment, pre -surgery, and study Follow -up Period evaluations) can be replaced by anoth er conventional imaging method such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) orultrasound per institutional practice at the investigator’s discretion, but the same method of assessment must be used for each evaluation for an individual patient. If a mammogram (or acceptable alternative breast imaging evaluation) has been conducted as part of routine care within four months prior to the End of Treatment Visit, it may be used in lieu of the End of Treatment Visit evaluation. w.After completion of the Treatment Cross -over Period, participating patients will select the study treatment formulation (P+H IV or pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC) to complete their 18 cycles of neo/adjuvant HER2 -targeted treatment. The number of study treatment cycles administered during the Treatment Continuation Period required to complete a total of 18 of neo/adjuvant HER2 -targeted treatme nt will be calculated based on the sum of number of P+H cycles received in neoadjuvant treatment (before study entry) plus 6cycles administered in the Treatment Cross -over Period."
