12,page_12,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 12Patients will undergo screening procedures/assessments within 30 day s before the start of Stage 1. They should have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia for >1 year (diagnosis must be reconfirmed b y Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM -5 [SCI D-5]) and have be en generall y responsive to antipsy chotics in the past y ear based on investigator judgement (and discussions with family members, caregivers, or healthcare professionals as applicable). Patients should also have had ≥1 episode of relapse in the last 24 mont hs. Patients will provide informed consent or assent, as applicable, at the screening visit. For adolescent patients, it is mandatory that a parent/caregiver accompanies the patient to each visit and serves as a reliable informant. It is recommended that a caregiver is identified for each adult patient. L ocal requirements should be followed. The caregiver may be contacted in case of loss of contact with the patient or to provide additional information about the patient, if needed. Patients can be accompanie d by caregivers to visits. Stage 1: Oral conversion and stabilization stage (12 weeks). Patients not alread y on oral risperidone or injectable risperidone ( RISPERDAL CONSTA, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, US PI ) and on an y antips ychotic (other than clozapine), and who can benefit from conversion to oral risperidone based on the investigator’s judgement, will be converted to oral risperidone (2to5mg/day ) to ensure that they tolerate risperidone and that the doses are adequate to tr eat their positive sy mptoms. Adolescent patients will receive a maximal dose of 4 mg/day . Patients who are already on risperidone but can still benefit from the study based on the investigator's judgement will also undergo the oral stabilization stage. Open-label oral risperidone (2 to 5mg/day ) will be used to stabilize patients to the treatments (the dose will be based on clinical judgement). Patients will come to the clinic for 4 visits (weeks -12, -10, - 8, and -4) for dose adjustments; however, additional visits may be required for dose adjustments. Patients will be assessed b y . Additionally , telephone contacts will take place at weeks -6 and -2, or more frequently if required in the judgement of th e investigator. Stability on risperidone, while also adequately controlling for s ymptoms of schizophrenia, will be assessed at baseline and is defined as meeting all of the following criteria for at least 4 consecutive weeks prior to the baseline visit: outpatient status     Blood samples for plasma drug concentration will be collected during the in - clinic visits (besides screening) and adverse event inquiry will be performed at all visits and telephone calls/teleconferences (TCs)."
13,page_13,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 13If a patient withdraws from the study prior to the randomization visit (Visit 6), the CRF for the patient's last visit will be marked as ""Not Continuing"" and the reason for discontinuat ion will be recorded. No extra testing or procedures will be required in addition to the regular visits. Stage 2: Double- blind maintenance stage (variable in duration) . Stabilized patients (see definition above) will be randomized to receive TV -46000 q1m s c injections, TV -46000 q2m sc injections, or placebo q1m sc injections in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients that require a stabilization dose below 2 mg/day will not be randomized in the study . Also, as a precautionary measure, adolescent patients that will require a stabilization dose of more than 4 mg during the stabilization stage will not be randomized. Patients in the TV- 46000 groups will receive a dose of TV -46000 (q1m or q2m) that is equivalent to the oral dose on which they were stabilized in Stage 1. The max imal dose administered to adult patients will be equivalent to an oral risperidone dose of 5 mg/day , and the maximal dose administered to adolescents will be equivalent to 4 mg/day . Patients randomized to TV -46000 q1m or placebo sc will receive an sc injection of TV -46000 or placebo, respectivel y, at baseline and every 4 weeks (q4w) thereafter. Patients randomized to TV -46000 q2m will receive a TV -46000 injection at baseline and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter and a placebo sc injection 4 weeks after baseline and q8w thereafter to ensure blinding of the doses and durations of the TV- 46000 injections and the placebo injections. The study will continue on an outpatient basis, and telephone contacts will take place weekl y between clinic visits. I f, in the judgment of the investigator, the patient is likely to relapse or pose a danger to himself/herself or others, that patient may be invited for an unscheduled visit and/or hospitalized if ne eded, and treatment with the study drug may be discontinued. Per definition, an exacerbation in sy mptoms during Stage 1 cannot be defined as a relapse event, since relapse events can only occur following stabilization and randomization. Randomized patients, who relapse or meet 1 or more of the withdrawal criteria should be invited to perform the Earl y Termination (ET) visit as soon as possible, within 4 weeks of the last injection. Patients who remain relapse -free when the study is terminated should be in vited to perform the End -of- Treatment (EoT) visit within 4 weeks of the last injection. Therefore, a patient is considered a study completer if he or she experienced impending relapse or remained relapse -free at the time of study termination. During the conduct of this study , an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review accumulating unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data on a regular basis, as detailed in the IDMC charter, to ensure the continuing safety of the study patients and study conduct issues. The specific details regarding the IDMC sessions will be outlined in the I DMC charter. Brief Summary of Study Design for the Trial Registry(s): The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of different dose r egimens of TV -46000 administered sc as compared to placebo during maintenance treatment in adult and adolescent patients with schizophrenia. The study will include male and female patients, 13 to 65 years of age at screening, who have a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, are clinically stable, and are eligible for risperidone treatment. Patients will be randomized to receive doses of TV - 46000 q1m, TV -46000 q2m, or placebo q1m sc injections in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients randomized to TV-46000 q1m or placebo will receive an sc injection of TV- 46000 or placebo, respectivel y, at baseline and q4w thereafter. Patients randomized to TV- 46000 q2m will receive a TV -46000 sc injection at baseline and q8w thereafter and a placebo sc injection 4 weeks after baseline and q8w thereafter to ensure blinding of the doses and durations of the TV -46000 injections and the"
14,page_14,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 14placebo injections. The doses of TV -46000 will be equivalent to 2 to 5 mg/day of oral risperidone. The primary efficacy endpoint is time to impending relapse, which will be measured by CGI -I, PANSS, and CGI- SS scores, hospitalization due to worsening of psy chotic s ymptoms, or violent behavior. The duration of patient participation in the study will include up to 4 weeks of screening, 12 weeks of the oral convers ion/stabilization stage, and a double -blind maintenance stage. The double -blind maintenance stage will be variable in duration, with patients continuing until they experience a relapse event; meet 1 or more of the study discontinuation or withdrawal criter ia; or remain relapse -free at the time of study termination. Patients will subsequently complete all end -of-study assessments. When the study ends, eligible patients may be offered the opportunity to enter the TV46000 -CNS -30078 extension study to assess th e long -term safet y and tolerability of extended -release risperidone . If they choose to enter the extension study , they will not need to complete the follow- up/exit visits in this study . For all other patients, there will be 2follow -up/exit visits that will take place at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the last dosing visit. During the follow -up/exit period, patients will be treated according to the investigator’s judgement. Method of Randomization and Blinding: Patients will be randomized to receive doses of TV-46000 q1m sc injection, TV -46000 q2m sc injection, or placebo q1m sc injection in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified b y gender (male or female) and the dose of oral risperidone on which the patient was stabilized during Stage 1 (2/3, 4, or 5 m g). The doses of TV-46000 will be equivalent to 2 to 5 mg/day of oral risperidone ( equivalent to the oral dose on which the patient was stabilized in Stage 1) . As a precautionary measure, adolescent patients that will require a stabilization dose of more t han 4 mg during the stabilization stage will not be randomized. Patients randomized to TV -46000 q1m or placebo sc will receive an sc injection of TV-46000 or placebo, respectively , at baseline and q4w thereafter. Patients randomized to TV - 46000 q2m will re ceive a TV -46000 sc injection at baseline and q8w thereafter and a placebo sc injection 4 weeks after baseline and q8w thereafter to ensure blinding of the doses and durations of the TV -46000 injections and the placebo injections . Patients and investigators will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment administered to each patient. Due to the differences between the TV -46000 product and placebo, an unblinded nurse, not associated with rating the patient (including assessment of the injection site if needed) and independent from the study team, will be required at each site to administer the drug . Additional measures to mitigate the risk of unblinding will include: the unblinded nurse will in a room separated from the patient; the unblinded nurse will wrap a blinding film (so that the original appearance is masked) around the barrel of the syringe; to maintain the patient blind, a cover will be used over the inj ection site during treatment administration; the unblinded nurse will administer the injection to the patient. The sponsor’s clinical personnel (and delegates) involved in the study will be blinded to the identity of the IMPs until the database is locked for final anal ysis and the IMP assignment is known."

Pharmacokinetic sample anal ysis and drug concentration calculations will be performed during the course of the study . . Investigational Medicinal Products: Dose, Pharmaceutical Form, Route of Administration, and Administration Rate Test IMP: In general, TV -46000 will b e administered in the abdomen (except as indicated below), b y sc injection at intervals of q1m or q2m, at a dose equivalent to oral risperidone 2 to 5 mg/day per the conversion table below.

The maximal dose administered to adult patients will be equivalent to an oral risperidone dose of 5 mg/day , and the maximal dose administered to adolescents will be equivalent to 4 mg/day . As a precautionary measure, adole scent patients that will require a stabilization dose of more than 4 mg during the stabilization stage will not be randomized. Several investigational centers may be selected by the sponsor (based on the centers’ capabilities, sponsor's considerations, and prior clinical experience with injectable medication) for injection of study drug in the back of the upper arm, instead of the abdomen, to all or some of the enrolled patients at these sites (approximately 20% of the study patient population).

Statistical Considerations Sample Size Rationale: Median time to impending relapse was observed to be 7 months in the placebo group in a similarly designed study (Kane et al 2012). Assuming a similar placebo effect in this study , as well as a hazard ratio of 2.50 (placebo vs each TV- 46000 arm) and a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 (q1m:q2m:placebo) with 2 primary hypotheses to be tested (q1m vs placebo and q2m vs placebo) at a 2 -sided alpha of 0.050, the total number of events across treatment groups tha t will attain a statistical power of at least 90% to meet success criteria in both comparisons ( East 6 [Version 6.3] manual, 2014 ) is 90 relapse events. This number of events will need to be observed during Stage 2 of the stud y in the ITT analysis set (adult patients). The sample size rationale is based on the adult patients. There is no estimation of the sample size in the adolescent population, and their number is not known at this time."
22,page_22,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 22 Primary Efficacy Analysis: Time to impending relapse will be calculated as the earliest date the patient meets ≥1 of the impending relapse criteria minus the randomization date plus 1. Data from patients who did not relapse will be censored at the l ast valid assessment. Time to impending relapse for TV -46000 and placebo will be compared using the stratified log- rank test at the significance levels described (see Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity) . Hazard ratios and their 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TV -46000 q1m and q2m versus placebo will be anal yzed using a Cox proportional hazard model, with treatment and the aforementioned stratification variables as the factors (see Method of Randomization and Blinding) . Kaplan -Meier curves will be provided to present impending relapse rate data over time. The primary anal ysis will be conducted on the population of adult patients. Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity anal ysis will be conducted to assess the impact of large intervals between the pr evious assessment and the assessment at the time the first relapse was observed via the interval censoring method. Sensitivity anal ysis will also be conducted by tipping point anal ysis, that imputes time to relapse for dropouts (for reasons suspected to be related to relapse) with increasing risk to relapse, compared to similar patients in the same treatment group that continue treatment. The per -protocol anal ysis set will also be used to as a suplemental analysis to evaluate the primary efficacy variable. Details will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 1: Time to impending relapse in adult and adolescent patients will be assessed similarly to the Primary Efficacy Analy sis. The Cox proportional hazard model will include patient age group (if applicable) along with treatment, and the aforementioned stratification variables as the factors. The details about the Ty pe-I statistical error control will be discussed in Multiple Compari sons and Multiplicity. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 2: Impending relapse rate at week 24 will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method and calculated as 1 minus the proportion of adult and adolescent patients free of impending relapse events at week 2 4. The Greenwood formula will be used to calculate standard errors for impending relapse rates at week 24, and the pooled standard errors will be used for h ypothesis testing using z statistics, assuming that the differences between TV - 46000 and placebo follow a normal distribution of large samples.Ty pe-I statistical error control will be discussed in Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 3: The anal yses of the proportion of patients who maintain stability at endpoint in Stag e 2 will be described in the statistical analy sis plan. Ty pe-I statistical error control will be discussed in Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 4: The anal yses of the proportion of patients achieving remission at endpoint in Stage 2 will be described in the statistical analy sis plan.

Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 6: Change from baseline of DAI-10 at endpoint will be compared between groups using repeated measures ANCOVA . Type-I statistical control will be discussed in Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 7: Change from baseline of SQL S at endpoint will be compared between groups using repeated measures ANCOVA. Ty pe-I statistical control will be discussed in Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis 8: Time to impending relapse in adolescent patients will be assessed if the numbe r of randomized adolescents will be at least 10, with clinically sufficient exposure. The method will be similar to the Primary Efficacy Analy sis. The details about the Type- I statistical error control will be discussed in Multiple Comparisons and Multipli city. In the event that prefilled sy ringes become available during the stud y, data relating to the ease of dosing administration will be listed. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity: At the final anal ysis after at least 90 relapse events, a fixed sequential (hierarchical) testing approach will be implemented. The first primary efficacy hypothesis comparing q1m to placebo will be tested with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05; if significant, the second primary efficacy hypothesis comparing q2m to placebo will be tested with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05. If the first primary hypothesis test fails to reach statistical significance, no further formal h ypothesis testing will be performed. Type-I error wil l be further controlled for the key secondary endpoints by employ ing the fixed sequential (hierarchical) approach to the secondary endpoints. Accordingl y, secondary endpoints will be anal yzed onl y if primary efficacy endpoints have a p- value less than or e qual to alpha of 0.05."
24,page_24,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 24For the key secondary endpoints, if the resulting 2- sided p- value from the first comparison is significant, then the next comparison of interest will be interpreted inferentially at the same alpha level. This process will continue either until all comparisons of interest are interpreted inferentiall y or until the point at which the resulting 2 -sided h ypothesis is insignificant at the same alpha level. At the point where a comparison is found to be insignificant, no further comparisons will be interpreted inferentially. Further details about the Ty pe-I statistical error control for the key secondary endpoints will be discussed in the statistical anal ysis plan. There will be no multiplicity control for all other exploratory efficacy endpoints, which will be tested at a nominal 5% level. Safety Analyses: Safety anal yses will be performed on the safety anal ysis set. All adverse events will be coded using the Medica l Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class category for the analyses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severit y), including adverse events determined b y the investigator to be related to test IMP (ie, reasonable possibility defined as related or with missing relationship) (overall and by severit y), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the stud y. Summaries will be presented b y treatment group. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented. Changes in laboratory , ECG, and vital sign measurement data will be summarized descriptivel y. All values will be c ompared with predefined criteria to identify potentiall y clinically significant values or changes, and such values will be listed. The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics for allowed rescue medications will be presented b y treatment group. Safety outcomes, including changes from baseline in EPS scale scores (BARS, AI MS, and SAS) and CDSS during Stage 2, will be presented using descriptive statistics by treatment group. Adjustment to stratification factors may be conducted as appropriate. The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events related to EPS will be summarized by the following event categories: akathisia, dy skinesia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and tremor. The C-SSRS and CGI-SS will be used to assess the risk of suicide events during the study . Descriptive statistics will be presented b y treatment group. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) wil l be provided for actual values and changes from baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided, and all relevant informati on will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report. Safety data collected in Stage 1 will also be summarized using descriptive statistics in the enrolled patients set. Selected safet y data will also be presented b y site of injection (abdomen vs arm) and b y age group (adolescents [ages 13 -17] and adults [18 y ears of age and above]), as applicable."

Tolerability Analysis: In case an adverse event related to an injection site reaction is reported, an assessment of the sc injection site (ie, local tolerability [skin at injection site] ) will be made. The presence and sever ity of ery thema, swelling, induration, and pain at the injection site may be assessed. All-cause discontinuation rates and discontinuation rates due to adverse events (dropout rates) will be calculated as the number of patients who withdrew earl y,and the number of patients who withdrew earl y due to adverse events, respectively , divided by the number of patients in each treatment group and will be presented using descriptive statistics.

Pharm acokinetic Analysis: Blood samples will be collected from all patients for quantitation of the plasma concentrations of risperidone, 9 -OH-risperidone, and total active moiety , at weeks -12, -10, - 8, and -4 in Stage 1, at baseline, every 4 weeks in Stage 2,and at the follow - up/exit visits. D uring Stage 2 of the stud y, blood samples for PK assessment will be taken within an hour prior to sc dose administration. During Stage 2, unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples will be aimed to be collected in the event of relapse as defined per the study ’s relapse criteria, any serious adverse event, patient withdrawal, and/or the need for potential TV -46000 depot excision. Every effort should be made to obtain the additional pharmacokinetic sample at the closest time possible to the occurrence of the event. Drug concentrations over time [C(t)] reported by time (visit) and treatment (q1m, q2m, and oral) will be presented using descriptive statistics ( n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, geometric mean, and coefficient of variation). Additional pharmacokinetic parameters may be determined if data permits."

Introduction Schizophrenia is a severely debilitating ps ychotic disorder characterized by positive sy mptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, and grossl y disorganized or catatonic behavior) and negative symptoms (eg, affective flattening, alogia, and avoliti on (New York State Office of Mental Health 2011 , Stefan and Travis 2002 ]). Cognitive deficits are common; they include impairment of executive functioning and attention, as well as difficulties wi th short- and long -term memory . The worldwide lifetime morbidity risk of the disorder is about 1% across diverse geographic, cultural, and socio -economic regions. Since, in most patients, the disease follows a chronic course with long -lasting impairment, long- term treatment with antipsy chotic agents is usually required. Noncompliance and high discontinuation rates are particularl y problematic in patients with schizophrenia. Premature discontinuation of antipsy chotic drug therap y is a common phenomenon; in t he Clinical Antipsy chotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness study , 74% of patients discontinued their antipsy chotic drug within 18 months due to either poor tolerability or lack of efficacy . Even among patients who do not explicitly discontinue drug the rapy, nonadherence to long -term oral medication regimen is one of the most significant therapeutic issues in the therap y of schizophrenia and related disorders. As a result, many of these patients do not experience the full benefit of antips ychotic drug th erapy and suffer frequent relapses or exacerbations that require rehospitalization, often in the context of psy chiatric emergency (Rainer 2008 ). Thus, the use of a long -acting injectable (LAI) antipsy chotic agent may increase compliance in patients with schizophrenia ( Barnes and Curson 1994, Hughes 2007, Keith and Kane 2003 , Walburn et al 2001 ). In addition, r ecent evidence suggests that earl y use of LAI risperidone might carry advantages for clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia, further supported by neuroimaging ( Subotnik et al 2015 ). The underl ying disease mechanisms and initial approach to the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 y ears and adult patients 18 y ears of age and older is essentially the same. Schizophrenia in children and adolescents is accepted to be clinically and biologically similar to adult -onset schizophrenia, but with some differences in the presentation of the s ymptoms, relative frequency of core ps ychotic s ymptoms (eg, auditory hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), neurocognitive impairments, psy chop hysiological abnormalities, and the presence of structural brain abnormalities ( Asarnow et al 1995 , Bo and Haahr 2016 , Rapoport et al 2005). Pediatric patients displa y a more severe clinical prognosis and a greater neurodegenerative trajectory , and can be less responsive to treatment compared to patients with adult- onset schizophrenia ( Bo and Haahr 2016 ). Children and adolescents who are diagnosed with schizophrenia display high stability with regard to the phenoty pical expression of the disorder into adulthood ( Hollis 2000 ). Studies of neurops ychological functions and brain structure in patients with schizophr enia have shown the same degenerative patterns, regardless of the patient’s age at the onset of the disorder ( Weinberger and Harrison 2011). The sponsor is developing a risperidone extended- release injectable suspension for su bcutaneous (sc) use that will deliver therapeutic levels of risperidone over intervals of 1 month (TV -46000 every month [q1m]) or 2 months (TV -46000 every 2 months [q2m]) to patients with"
38,page_38,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 38schizophrenia. TV-46000 is a new formulation of risperidone that uses this technology ; the product is referred to as TV -46000 q1m and TV -46000 q2m to designate t he 1-and 2 -month duration products, respectivel y. There are 4 possible TV -46000 dose strengths for each duration product, comparable to 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/day of oral risperidone.The sponsor will provide a the dose will be comparable to the oral risperidone dose on which the patient will be stabilized. The critical importance of optimal compliance with prescribed antipsy chotic regimens has been repeatedly and convincingl y demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia. Adherence increases the likelihood of positive outcomes in all aspects o f a patient’s life including better s ymptom control, reduced risk of relapse and rehospitalization, and improved quality of life as well as social and occupational functioning. Despite their proven effectiveness, poor adherence to prescribed antipsy chotic regimens remains the most important driver of suboptimal clinical outcomes in patients with schizophrenia ( Birnbaum and Sharif 2008). The rationale for developing q1m and q2m risperidone products is to improve patient complian ce and to offer greater convenience to the patient through a reduction in clinic visits in comparison to other risperidone products currentl y on the market. I t is intended that therapeutic concentrations will be reached within 24 hours of injection. I t is anticipated that these advantages will reduce the rate of relapse and concomitant impact on patients’ well -being and healthcare costs. The purpose of the study is to compare the safet y and efficacy of different durations of TV - 46000 administered sc versus placebo. In addition, there is a paucity of data in relation to L AI use in children and adolescents with serious mental illness and existing reports have substantial methodological limitations ( Lytle et al 2017). Enrollment of adolescents in this study will provide data for evaluating the efficacy , safet y and tolerability of TV -46000 in this patient population. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information on the background, pharmaceutical particulars, nonclinical, and clinical experience with TV -46000. 1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies 1.2.1. Nonclinical Studies The nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of risperidone have been well established for oral and intramuscular (im) administration both in vitro and in vivo. Nonclinical studies evaluating genotoxicity , carcinogenicity , chronic toxicology , and reproductive and developmental toxicology of risperidone are publicl y available in p ublished literature or prescribing information (PI) of approved oral or im risperidone products."
39,page_39,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 39Injection of TV -46000 sc to rats and dogs elicited pharmacological signs t ypical of risperidone. In rats onl y, transient stress -related signs were detected in some of the animals. Pathological findings could be divided into sy stemic pharmacologically related changes Local reaction in rats and dogs was a typical foreign bod y local absorptive reaction. Residual fibrotic capsules at the sites of injection were still evident after injection in but their size showed a trend toward reduction. I n 3 single -dose pharmacokinetic and local tolerance non -Good Laboratory Practice (GL P) studies in minipigs, TV-46000 was administered as a single dose . In these studies, the sc lesions were milder than in rats or dogs; however, 2 cases of generalized ery thema . Both cases were non- life-threatening, and 1 was self-limited. In single -dose GL P toxicology studies in both rats and dogs, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL), and therefore, a margin of safet y, could not be determined under the experimental conditions of the studies performed because expected adverse reactions related to the pharmacological actions of risperidone were noted at all dose levels. Si milarly , a NOAEL (and therefore, a margin of safety ) could not be determined in the multiple dose toxicity study in dogs because of decreased size and weight of male and female reproductive organs that were observed at all tested dose levels of the study drug. These changes are known risperidone pharmacological effects. Overall, TV -46000 and its vehicle were well tolerated locall y and s ystematically in rats, dogs, and minipigs at all doses tested. The mutagenic potential o f the in TV -46000 was tested in a GL P Ames test, and no increase in frequency of revertants was noted. To summarize, nonclinical studies reported b y Teva evaluated TV-46000 administered by sc injection. Subsequent clinical investigations have demonstrated that this formulation is more suited to a 1-month and 2- month dosing interval; however, the nonclinical data that have been generated are still relevant for the ongoing clinical development program. 1.2.2. Clinical Studies 1.2.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies The stud y found that TV- 46000, administered at sub -therapeutic , was safe and well tolerated when administered as an sc injection to either the posterior upper arm or the abdomen."

A total of 96 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were allocated into 8 sequential cohorts of 12 patients each. Stud y participants were clinically stable patients who are currentl y on antips ychotic treatment of oral risperidone. The stud y included 5 single -dose cohorts and 2 multiple -dose cohorts . In addition, interchangeability of inject ion site was assessed via administration of a similar dose to the abdomen and to the upper arm. 1.2.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies As of October 2017, the safet y and efficacy of oral risperidone have been evaluated in clinical studies in a total of 9803 adult and pediatric patients exposed to 1 or more doses of risperidone for up to 3 y ears, including a total of 2687 patients who received oral risperidone in double blind, placebo-controlled studies. The most common adverse events (reported in ≥5% of risper idone treated patients and with a frequency twice that of placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety , blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dy spepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasophary ngitis, and phary ngolary ngeal pain (see RISPERIDONE tablets, Teva Pharmaceuticals, US PI )."
41,page_41,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 41The safet y and efficacy of risperidone LAI (RISPERDAL®CONSTA®, Janssen Pharmaceuticals) have been evaluated in clinical studies in a total of 2392 patients exposed to 1 or more doses of risperidone for up to 4 years, including a t otal of 332 patients who were treated with risperidone LAI while participating in a 12 -week, double -blind, placebo- controlled study . The most common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in patients with schizophrenia (≥5% of risperidone treated patien ts) were headache, parkinsonism, dizziness, akathisia, fatigue, constipation, dy spepsia, sedation, weight increased, pain in extremity , and dry mouth (see RISPERDAL CONSTA, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, US PI ). Limited efficacy data for TV -46000 in patients are available. Furthermore, human safet y data on TV-46000 are also limited; to date, doses up to have been tested. However, the safet y profile is expected to be generall y similar to that of risperidone LAI. To date, the on ly new safet y signals that were identified in the TV- 46000 Phase 1 program were some ty pes of injection site reactions such as injection site pain, ery thema, induration, pruritus, and swelling. The majorit y of these adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and resolved quickly . 1.3. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients 1.3.1. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks of the Test Investigational Medicinal Product(s) Experience with TV -46000 in humans is limited, and there are onl y limited data on ADR s associated with this formulation. However, the safety profile of the active ingredient, risperidone, given in a different long -acting parenteral formulation has been well characterized. The licensed risperidone long -acting injection, RI PERDAL CONSTA, is generally well tolerated. The most commonly reported ADRs include insomnia, anxiety , headache, upper respiratory tract infection, parkinsonism, and depression. The occurrence of ADRs appears to be dose -related. Injection of TV-46000 is expected to result i n less pain than the conventional (oil -based) antipsy chotic im depot injections. Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients can be found in the IB . Based on the limited data from the clinical program, injection site ery thema, injection site edema, injection site pain, and injection site nodules appear to be ADRs of TV -46000. In summary , the benefit and risk assessment of TV-46000 is favorable following review of the available data. Additional safet y information on TV -46000, including RS I, is presented in the TV-46000 IB. 1.3.2. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study In completed clinical studies, oral and im administration of risperidone demonstrated superiorit y over placebo in assessments such as Brief Psy chiatric Rating Scale, Sca le for the Assessment of Negative S ymptoms, and Positive and Negative Sy ndrome Scale (PANSS). This superiority was generall y dose dependent, with oral doses ranging from 2 to 16 mg/day on a once per day or twice per day schedule. On a longer term, risperidone treatment resulted in a significantly longer time to relapse over a 2 -year period compared to treatment with an active comparator. Intramuscular (im) risperidone was generall y well tolerated over the dose range of . The most common adverse events in clinical studies ( ≥5% of risperidone treated patients and with a frequency twice that of placebo) were parkinsonism, akathisia, dy stonia, tremor, sedation,"
42,page_42,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 42dizziness, anxiety , blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach disco mfort, dyspepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasophary ngitis, and phary ngolary ngeal pain. The most common ADRs in cli nical studies of risperidone LAI in patients with schizophrenia ( ≥5% of risperidone treated patients) were headache, parkinsonism, dizziness, akathisia, fatigue, constipation, dy spepsia, sedation, weight increased, pain in extremity , and dry mouth. Based on the extensive safet y and efficacy database for oral and im risperidone, and preliminary findings from the TV -46000 clinical development program thus far, the sponsor anticipates a favorable risk- benefit profile for administration of an extended -release suspension of risperidone for sc injection in adult patients with schizophrenia. To date, the onl y new safet y signals that were identified in the TV -46000 Phase 1 program were some t ypes of injection site reactions (see Section 1.2.2.2). They have not significantl y impacted TV -46000’s benefit -risk profile nor have they presented a significant burden to the patients."

General S tudy Design and Study Schematic Diagram This is a double -blind, randomized, relapse prevention study comparing a therapeutic dose of TV-46000 sc q1m and q2m with placebo sc (q1m) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients will undergo screening procedures/assessments within 30 day s before the start of Stage 1. They should have had a diagnosis of schizophrenia for >1 year (diagnosis must be reconfirmed b y Structured Clinical I nterview for DSM -5 [SCI D-5]) and have been generall y responsive to antipsy chotics in the past y ear based on investigator judgment (and discussions with family members, caregivers, or healthcare professionals as applicable). Patients should also have had ≥1 episode of relapse in the last 24 months. Patients will provide informed consent or assent, as applicable, at the screening visit. For adolescent patients, it is mandatory that a parent/caregiver accompanies the patient to each visit and serves as a reliable informant. It is recommended that a caregiver is identified for each adult patient. L ocal requirements should be followed. The caregiver may be contacted in case of loss of contact with the patient or to provide additional information about the patient, if needed. Patients can be accompanied by caregivers to visits. Stage 1: Oral conversion and stabilization stage (12 weeks). Patients not alread y on oral risperidone or injectable risperidone ( RISPERDAL CONSTA, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, US PI ) and on an y antips ychotic (other than clozapine), and who can benefit from conversion to oral risperidone based on the investigator’s judgement, will be converted to oral risperidone (2to5mg/day ) to ensure that they tolerate risperidone and that the doses are adequate to treat their positive sy mptoms. Patients who are alread y on risperidone but can still benefit from the study based on the investigator's judgement will also undergo the oral stabilization stage. Open - label oral risperidone (2 to 5 mg/day ) will be used to stabilize patients to the treatments (the dose will be base d on clinical judgement). Adolescent patients will receive a maximal dose of 4 mg/day . Patients will come to the clinic for 4 visits (weeks -12, -10, - 8, and -4) for dose adjustments ( Table 1); however, additional visits may be required for dose adjustments. Patients will be assessed b y PANSS, Clinical Global Impression of Severit y (CGI -S), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Barnes Akathisia Rat ing Scale (BARS), Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS), Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS), and Clinical Global I mpression -Severity of Suicidality (CGI -SS). Additionally , telephone contacts will take pla ce at weeks - 6 and -2, or more frequentl y if required in the judgement of the investigator (see Table 1for more details)."

If a patient withdraws from the study prior to the randomization visit (Visit 6), the CRF for the patient's last visit will be marked as ""Not Continuing"" and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded. No extra testing or procedures will be required in addition to the regular visits. Stage 2: Double-blind maintenance stage (variable in duration). Stabilized patients (see definition above) will be randomized to receive TV -46000 q1m sc injections, TV -46000 q2m sc injections, or placebo q1m sc injections in a 1:1:1 ratio. Patients that require a stabiliza tion dose below 2 mg/day will not be randomized in the study . Also, as a precautionary measure, adolescent patients that will require a stabilization dose of more than 4 mg during the stabilization stage will not be randomized. Patients in the TV -46000 gro ups will receive a dose of TV -46000 (q1m or q2m) that is equivalent to the oral dose on which they were stabilized in Stage 1. The maximal dose administered to adult patients will be equivalent to an oral risperidone dose of 5 mg/day, and the maximal dose administered to adolescents will be equivalent to 4 mg/day. Patients randomized to TV-46000 q1m or placebo sc will receive an sc injection of TV- 46000 or placebo , respectively , at baseline and every 4 weeks (q4w) thereafter. Patients randomized to TV -46000 q2m will receive a TV -46000 injection at baseline and every 8 weeks (q8w) thereafter, and a placebo sc injection 4 weeks after baseline and q8w thereafter, to ensure blinding of the doses and durations of the TV -46000 injections and the placebo injections . The study will continue on an outpatient basis ( Table 2 ), and telephone contacts will take place weekl y between clinic visits. I f, in the judgment of the investigator, the patient is likely to relapse or pose a danger to himself/herself or others, that patient may be invited for an unscheduled visit and/or hospitalized if needed, and treatment with the study drug may be discontinued. During Stage 2, unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples will be aimed to be collected in the event of relapse as defined per the study ’s relapse criteria, any serious adverse event, patient withdrawal, and/or the need for potential TV- 46000 depot excision. Every effort should be made to obtain the additional pharmacokinetic sample at the closest time possible to the occurrence of the event. The duration of patient participation in the study will include up to 4 weeks of screening, 12weeks of the oral conversion/stabilization stage, and a double -blind maintenance stage. The double -blind maintenance stage will be variable in duration, with patients continuing until they experience a relapse event; meet 1 or more of the study discontinuation or withdrawal criteria ; or"

Per definition, an exacerbation in sy mptoms during Stage 1 cannot be defined as a relapse e vent, since relapse events can only occur following stabilization and randomization. Randomized patients who relapse or meet 1 or more of the withdrawal criteria should be invited to perform the Earl y Termination (ET) visit as soon as possible, within 4 weeks of the last injection. Patients who remain relapse -free when the study is terminated should be invited to perform the End -of- Treatment visit within 4 weeks of the last injection. Therefore, a patient is considered a study completer if he or she exper ienced impending relapse or remained relapse- free at the time of study termination. Patients will subsequently complete all end -of-study assessments. When the study ends, eligible patients may be offered the opportunity to enter the TV46000- CNS -30078 exten sion study to assess the long- term safety and tolerability of extended -release risperidone. This extension study is bey ond the scope of this protocol, and a separate protocol was issued for it. I f patients choose to enter the extension study , they will not need to complete the follow- up/exit visits in this study . For all other patients (ie, patients who experience a relapse event, meet 1 or more of the stud y discontinuation or withdrawal criteria, or do not consent to join the extension study ), there will be 2 follow -up/exit visits that will take place at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after the last dosing visit. During the follow -up/exit period, patients will be treated according to the investigator’s judgement. End of study is defined as the date when the last patie nt in Stage 2 has completed all efficacy and safet y assessments at the final visit per protocol. The study duration will be approximately 30 months, from Q2 2018 (first patient in) to Q4 2020 (last patient out). During the conduct of this study , an Indepe ndent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review accumulating unblinded safet y and PK data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the stud y patients and study conduct issues (see Section 5.10.3 ).

Planned Number of Patients and Countries Approximately 1260 patients will be screened to achieve enrollment of approximately 860 adult patients in Stage 1, including approximately 70 adult patients in Bulgaria. The number of randomized adult patients in Stage 2 is planned to be approximately 520, including approximately 55 adult patients in Bulgaria. Details on the definition of evaluable patients and determination of the sample size are giv en in Section 9.1. Adolescent patients will only be enrolled in the US; any enrolled adolescents will be in addition to the aforementioned total. The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 80 investigational centers in North America and Bulgaria. 3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population Long -term use of antipsychotic agents has been shown to be effective in preventing rel apse in patients with schizophrenia, but carries the risk of side effects (including weight gain, hypergly cemia/diabetes, and metabolic s yndrome) and must be justified for each new agent or new formulation. Therefore, the sponsor is conducting a scientific ally valid study that supports the use of TV -46000 at the proposed clinical dosage regimen. Moreover, the drug class of LAI at ypical antipsy chotics has not been studied extensively in children or adolescents ( Lytle et al 2017). Although compliance in children and adolescents treated with antips ychotics is substantially higher than in adults, ranging from approximately 74% to 88% ( Pogge et al 2005, Yazdi et al 2008 ), LAIs may be considered for patients with confirmed schizophrenia and with risk factors for medication non -adherence: history of non - adherence, severe s ymptoms, comorbid substance use, cognitive impairment, ambivalence or negative attitudes towards medication, and poor insight ( Ferrin et al 2016 ).In the Pediatric Study Antipsy chotic LAIs are viewed as maintenance therap y in stable patients with schizophrenia, but they are not currentl y approved for treatment of acute sy mptoms. Thus, the population for this study consists of adult and adolescent patients with chronic schizophrenia and excludes patients with acute disease. Onl y patients who have been stabilized on oral therap y with risperidone will be randomized i nto the double -blind maintenance stage of the stud y."

Stopping Rules for the Study There are no formal rules for early termination of this study . During the conduct of the study , serious adverse events will be reviewed ( Section 7.1.5.3.1 ) as they are reported from the investigational centers to identify safet y concerns. The study may be terminated by the sponsor for any reason at any time. For example, the sponsor should terminate the study in the event of: new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safet y issues invalidate the earlier positive benefit -risk assessment discontinuation of the development of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) 3.5.

A negative result must be obtained before study study drug is administered. mCGI-I during Stage 2 will be relative to the baseline visit. nAs of Visit 9, inclusive, this assessment will be conducted every 12 weeks thereafter (Visits 12, 15, 18, and so on). oA blood sample for pharmacogenetic analysis will be collected at baseline or any visit thereafter, unless the patient declines testing or local regulations prohibit testing. pBlood for biomarker analyses will be collected as follows: 6 mL for serum, 6 mL for plasma, and 2.5 mL for PAXgene RNA, unless the patient declines testing or local regulations prohibit testing . qBlood samples for PK assessment will be taken within an h our prior to dosing. rDuring Stage 2, unscheduled pharmacokinetic samples will be aimed to be collected in the event of relapse as defined per the study’s relapse criteria, any serious adverse e vent, patient withdrawal, and/or the need for potential TV -46000 depot excision. Every effort should be made to obtain the additional pharmacokinetic sample at the closest time possible to the occurrence of the event. sAnother pharmacokinetic sample w ill be collected from adolescent patients at a supplementary in -clinic visit at Week 14 (2 Weeks after Visit 9). If it is not possible to take the sample at this visit, it may be taken 2 w eeks after another in -clinic visit. Tw o additional samples, 3 weeks and 1 w eek post -injection, respectively, may be taken at the sponsor's discretion. tStability is defined as meeting all of the following criteria for at least for 4 consecutive weeks prior to the baseline visit: outpatient status; PANSS total score ≤80; minimal presence of specific psychotic symptoms on the PANSS, as measured by a score of ≤4 on each of the following item s: conceptual disor ganization, suspiciousness, hallucinatory behavior, and unusual thought content; Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) score ≤4 (moderately ill); and CGI -SS score ≤2 (mildly suicidal) on Part 1 and ≤5 (minimally worsened) on Part 2. uStudy drug will be administered per the patient’s assigned treatment group. vApplicable only for EoT visit (ie, not ET). If in the judgment of th e investigator, the patient w ill not roll over into the extension study or w ill not come to one or both of the follow -up visits – a dose of study drug should not be given in this EoT/ET EoT visit."

Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient 4.3.1. General Withdrawal Criteria Patients are expected to participate in the stud y for its entire duration, and perform the scheduled visits and procedures. Each patient is free to withdraw from the study or discontinue treatment with I MP at an y time, without prejudice to their continued care but every effort should be undertaken to determine the reason for discontinuation."
69,page_69,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 69Every effort should be made to ensu re patients comply with study visits and procedures as detailed in the protocol. Patients must be withdrawn from the study if an y of the following events occur: 1. The patient withdraws consent or requests discontinuation from the IMP or withdrawal from the s tudy for any reason. 2. The patient develops an illness that would interfere with his or her continued participation. 3.The patient is noncompliant with the study procedures and assessments or administration of I MPs in the opinion of the investigator. 4.The patie nt takes prohibited concomitant medications as defined in this protocol. 5.A female patient has a confirmation of pregnancy during the study from a positive pregnancy test. 6.The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient. 7. Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition which indicates to the investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient. Patients should be treated with standard of care after withdrawal from or termination of the study as appropriate. Alter natively , if the opportunity is available and the patient is eligible, the patient may be offered the option to participate in TV46000 -CNS -30078, the long- term safet y and tolerability extension study . See Appendix Ffor information regarding how the study will define and address lost to follow -up patients to help limit the amount and impact of missing data. If the reason for withdrawal from the stud y or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event and/or clinicall y significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitoring will be continued as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a healthcare professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The specific event or test result (including repeated test results, as applicable) must be recorded both on the source documentation and in the case report form (CRF); both the adverse events page and the relevant page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored as applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a healthcare professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the test IMP or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the study contact person as soon as possible of each patient who is bein g considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested. If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that include also adverse events, the relevant page of the CRF should indicate that the wit hdrawal was related to an adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medicatio n, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be “need to take a prohibited medication”, not the adverse event."
70,page_70,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 70In the case of patients lost to follow -up, attempts to contact the patient must be made and documented in the patient’s medical records and transcribed to the CRF. All assessments should be performed according to the protocol on the last day the patient takes IMP, or as soon as possible thereafter. 4.3.2. Study -Specific Patient Withdrawal Criter ia and Procedures 1.The patient withdraws consent to continue in the study for any reason. Every effort should be undertaken to identify the reason for discontinuation. 2. A serious or intolerable adverse event develops that necessitates discontinuation at the discretion of the investigator. 3. The investigator believes continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient. 4.The investigator believes that the patient has not adhered to the stud y procedures or restrictions. A protocol deviation occurs th at, in the opinion of the investigator, warrants discontinuation from the study . 5.A patient requires concomitant medication that may interfere with the pharmacokinetics of the study drug. 6.A patient relapses, as defined by the study ’s relapse criteria (Section 9.5.1). 7.A patient demonstrates a significant clinical deterioration that cannot be managed with rescue medication, as judged b y the investigator based on an y relevant history or observation made b y the investigative site, including rating scales. 8.A patient has a mean increase of ≥30 ms from baseline in triplicate QTcF (interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula) values at an y visi t, pending discussion between the sponsor and the investigator. 9. A patient exhibits an event of possible drug- induced liver injury that requires immediate study treatment cessation and is defined as follows: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) ALT or AST >5×ULN for more than 2 weeks ALT or AST >3×ULN and total bilirubin level >2×ULN or international normalized ratio >1.5 ALT or AST >3×ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomi ting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%) 4.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Sampling in Case of Patient Withdrawal Note: Withdrawal under the above criteria (see Section 4.3.2 ) will be discussed by the investigator and the sponsor. For patients who withdraw from the study , every effort will be made to follow safet y after withdrawal, including pharmacokinetic sampling when ap plicable,"
71,page_71,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 71unless consent is withdrawn. For pharmacokinetics , the sample date and time will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. If a patient is withdrawn from the study or there is an occurrence of a serious adverse event that in the j udgement of the investigator would be best managed b y immediate cessation of treatment, the possibility to excise the depot should be discussed with the sponsor to draw on learnings of this procedure gained during pre -clinical studies. In this case, 2 cons ecutive pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained: 1 immediately before the excision procedure, and 1 several hours after the procedure and prior to patient discharge. Additional pharmacokinetic samples may be obtained if judged to be required b y the sponso r. The sample date and time as well as the date and time of the excision procedure will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. 4.4. Replacement of Patients A patient who is randomized but does not complete all treatment periods will not be r eplaced with another eligible patient. 4.5. Rescreening A patient who is screened but not enrolled, eg, because enrollment inclusion and exclusion criteria were not met or enrollment did not occur within the specified window, may be considered for screening aga in if, eg, there is a change in the patient’s medical condition or a modification of study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients may have individual parameters retested at the discretion of both the investigator and the sponsor . Patients may be rescre ened once if the repeated values for the laboratory , vital sign, or ECG screening criteria are within acceptable limits as judged by the investigator or if repeated values show normalization of the out- of-range values, but their initial screening period ha s expired. If the patient is rescreened, an informed consent form (I CF) will need to be resigned. 4.6. Screening Failure Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are not subsequently enrolled in the stu dy. Minimal information must be obtained, including but not limited to demography , screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse events."

Investigational Medicinal Products Used in the Study Investigational medicinal product is defined as the test I MP ( Table 4). 5.1.1. Test Investigational Medicinal Product TV-46000 will be supplied as a read y-to-use, extended -release inje ctable product in a single- use . For COVID - 19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 5.1.1.1. Starting Dose and Dose Levels In general, TV -46000 will be administered to patients in the abdomen (except as indicated below) b y sc injection, at intervals of q1m or q2m, at a dose equivalent to oral risperidone 2 to 5 mg/day on which they were stabilized in Stage 1, per the conversion table below ( Table 3). The maximal dose administered will be equivalent to an oral risperidone dose of 5 mg/day . Patients that require a stabilization dose below 2 mg/day will not be randomize d in the study . Also, as a precautionary measure, adolescent patients that will require a stabilization dose of more than 4 mg during the stabilization stage will not be randomized. Several investigational centers may be selected by the sponsor (based on the centers’ capabilities, sponsor's considerations, and prior clinical experience with injectable medication) for injection of study drug into the back of the upper arm, instead of the abdomen, to all or some of the enrolled patients at these sites (appro ximately 20% of the study patient population)."

Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for IMPs 5.2.1. Storage and Security The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained for all medicinal products re ceived, and any discrepancies must be reported and resolved before their use. The IMPs (TV -46000 and TV -46000 placebo) must be stored according to the storage conditions specified on the label and must be securel y locked and kept in the outer carton until use. For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 5.2.2. Labeling Supplies of I MPs will be labeled a ccording to the current International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice and will include any locall y required statements. I f necessary , labels will be translated into the local langua ge. 5.2.3. Accountability Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment and any applicable forms. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs and other study materials from the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and stored safely and properl y in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or national and local regulations, and are used in accordance with this protocol. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMPs, and only authorized staff at each investigational center may suppl y or administer IMPs. All I MPs must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the investigator and authorized staff at each investigational center. The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for IMP accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other study materials received, used, retained, returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for any discrepancies. All test or placebo IMP supplies (used, partially - used and unused) will be returned to the sponsor or its designee according to local and national regulations and the site’s standard operating procedur es (SOPs), following written authorization from the sponsor."
76,page_76,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 76The sponsor’s monitor will review all relevant drug -related information for accountability purposes prior to an y drug destruction. Documented evidence of destruction should be made available to the sponsor and/or its designees. The investigator, pharmacist, or drug administrator must verify that no TV -46000 drug supplies remain in the study centers’ possession at the end of the study . For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 5.3. 5.3.2. Justification for Use of Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product The US FDA requires a placebo -controlled study to demonstrate the efficacy and safet y of TV- 46000 for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenia. Whi le it has been demonstrated that regular use of antipsy chotics reduces the rate of relapses, treatment compliance is poor, which is often related to side effects. It is considered justified to treat patients with placebo after they have been stabilized on oral active treatment. Patients who experience a relapse will discontinue study drug and may be treated using standard of care. 5.4. Other Medicinal Products/Non -Investigational Medicinal Products In the US, oral risperidone for stabilization ( Table 5) will be a commercial product supplied by the study center. In Bulgaria, oral risperidone for stabilization ( Table 5 ) will be a commercial product supplied centrally b y the sponsor. The brand name of the oral risperidone supplied will be recorded on the source documentation."

Treatment After the End of the Study In case the patient is withdrawn from this study , no further treatment is planned by the sponsor after the patient completes their participation in this study . Patients will be advised to return to their primary physician for additional treatment. Patients may be treated in the meantime per investigator judgment and instruction as applicable. When the study ends, eligible patients may be offered the opportunity to enter the TV46000- CNS -30078 extension study to asses s the long -term safet y and tolerability of extended -release risperidone. This extension study is bey ond the scope of this protocol, and a separate protocol was issued for it. 5.6. Restrictions Patients will be required to comply with the following restrictions: 5.6.1. Activity There are no specific restrictions in this study regarding normal daily activities, unless otherwise advised b y the investigator. 5.6.2. Specific Beverages Patients should not consume excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages, defined as more than 2 units per day (1 unit=1/2 pint [8 ounces] of beer, 1 small glass [5 ounces] of wine or 1 measure of spirits) during the course of the stud y, including the follow -up/exit period. Patient should be advised regarding potential risk of drowsiness, dizziness and ot her side effects of alcohol on risperidone treatment."

Randomization and Blinding Patients will be randomized to rec eive doses of TV -46000 q1m sc injection, TV -46000 q2m sc injection, or placebo q1m sc injection in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization will be stratified b y gender (male or female) and the dose of oral risperidone on which the patient was stabilized during Stage 1 (2/3, 4, or 5 mg). The doses of TV -46000 will be equivalent to 2 to 5 mg/day of oral risperidone ( equivalent to the oral dose on which the patient was stabilized in Stage 1 ). Patients randomized to TV- 46000 q1m or placebo sc will receive an sc injection of TV -46000 or placebo, respectivel y, at baseline and q4w thereafter. Patients randomized to TV- 46000 q2m will receive a TV -46000 injection at baseline and q8w thereafter and a placebo sc injection 4 weeks after baseline and q8w thereafter to ensure blindi ng of the doses and durations of the TV - 46000 injections and the placebo injections. Patients and investigators will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment administered to each patient. Due to the differences between the TV -46000 product and place bo,an unblinded nurse, not associated with rating the patient (including assessment of the injection site if needed) and independent from the study team, will be required at each site to administer the study drug. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups by means of a c omputer -generated randomization list. The randomization list will be assigned to the relevant treatment groups through a qualified service provider (eg, via the Interactive Response Technology [IRT] sy stem). The generation of the randomization list and man agement of the IRT s ystem will be done by a qualified service provider under the oversight of the responsible function at Teva. The specifications for randomization will be under the responsibility and oversight of Teva Global Statistics. The sponsor’s cli nical personnel (and delegates) involved in the study will be blinded to the identity of the IMPs until the database is locked for final anal ysis, and t he IMP assignment is known. However, if a prioritized sample analy sis is needed, bioanalytical and IDMC clinical pharmacology representatives are unblinded. In the event of an emergency (ie, where knowledge of the study drug assignment is needed to make treatment decisions for the patient), the treatment group and dose to which the patient has been allocated can be determined by accessing the I RT s ystem. All investigational centers will"
81,page_81,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 81be provided with details on how to access the s ystem for code breaking at the start of the study . The Medical Monitor or equivalent should be notified following unblinding. Any unblinding of the IMP performed by the investigator must be recorded in the source documents. The pharmacist at each investigational center who will dispense the I MPs will know the I MP assignments for each patient. I n addition, up to 2 other individuals from each investigational center will know the IMP assignments to provide quality assurance and oversight in their preparation and administration, as necessary . These individuals will not be involved in conduct of an y study procedures and assessment of an yadverse events and should not discuss the medication assignment or appearance with others (except for the unblinded nurse administering the medication). For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 5.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding 5.10.1. Maintenance of Randomization Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location at the service provider contracted to generate the codes. At the time of analy sis (after the end of study ), after receiving unblinding request from Teva statistician, the service provider will provide the unblinded I MP assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant SOP. 5.10.2. Blinding and Unblinding Pharmacokinetic data will be assessed during the study . Personnel responsible for bioanal ysis will be provided with the randomization code in order to facilitate the analysis. However, the personnel responsible for bioanaly sis will not have access to clinical safet y and efficacy data and will provide unblinded pharmacokinetic concentration data to the unblinded statistician for provisio n to the I DMC members for review, and to a pharmacometrics modeler, independent of the study team, for update of the population pharmacokinetic model. In addition, the modeler may receive other relevant patient information to update the model (such as demo graph y, certain clinical laboratory results, etc). The detailed process of data delivery to the IDMC will be described in the IDMC charter. The detailed process of pharmacokinetic analy sis during the course of the stud y will be described in the pharmacokin eticanaly sis plan. The pharmacokinetic concentrations and modeling results will not be available to the sponsor’s study team until unblinding of study . For information about personnel who may be aware of IMP assignments (including an unblinded nurse and an unblinded pharmacist), see Section 5.9. These individuals will not be involved in conduct of an y stud y procedures or assessment of any adverse e vents . In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of the IMP assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s IMP assignment as deemed necessary , mainl y in emergency situations. Individual randomization codes, indicating the IMP assignment for each randomized patient, will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacist(s) at each investigational center via the IRT, both via telephone and internet. Breaking of the treatment code can alway s be performed b y the investigator without prior approval by the sponsor; however, the sponsor should be notified following the breaking of the treatment code. The patient's IMP assignment should not be revealed to the sponsor."
82,page_82,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 82When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study , and the event will be recorded on the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Assignment of IMP should not be recorded in an y study documents or source document. In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), the Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) team may independently request that the blind code be broken (on a case-by-case basis) to comply with regulatory require ments. The report will be provided in an unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct of the stud y, and anal ysis and reporting of the data. 5.10.3. Data Monitoring Committee During the conduct of this study there will be an IDMC that will review accumulating unblinded safet y and pharmacokinetic data on a regular basis (as detailed in the IDMC charter) to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and an y study conduct issues. The IDMC will be composed of independent physicians with expertise in the relevant therapeutic field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician and a pharmacokinetic specialist. The IDMC chairperson will communicate with the sponsor in regard to issues resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study . The sponsor will work closel y with the committee to provide the necessary data for review. The IDMC will provide recommendations about modify ing, stopping, o r continuing the study . The conduct and specific details regarding the IDMC sessions will be outlined in the IDMC charter. 5.11."

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY For each assessment, where applicable, every effort should be made to retain the same rater for each patient throughout the course of the stud y, except under exceptional circumstances. For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 6.1. Assessments of Efficacy 6.1.1. Clinical Global Impression – Improvement (CGI -I) The Clinical Global I mpression –Improvement (CGI -I) scale permits a global evaluation of the patient’s improvement in sy mptoms overall. The CGI -I scale rates the patient’s impro vement relative to his or her s ymptoms on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse) ( Guy 1976a ). The CGI -I will be administered b y the investigator/trained rater at all visits during the stud y (except for the screening and baseline visits). 6.1.2. Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) The PANSS ( Kay et al 1987) is a 30 -item instrument used in patients with schizophrenia to identify the presence and severit y of ps ychopathology symptoms, the relationship of these symptoms to one another, and the global psy chopathology . Each item is scored on a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The positive sy mptom scale includes 7 items with a maximum score of 49; t he negative s ymptom scale includes 7 items with a maximum score of 49; and the general ps ychopathology scale includes 16 items with a maximum score of 112. The PANSS will be administered b y the investigator at screening and all visits during the study. 6.2. Other Assessments 6.2.1. Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5) The SCI D-5 is a semi -structured interview guide for making DSM -5 diagnoses. I t will be administered at screening by a clinician or trained mental health professional that is familiar with the DSM -5 classification and diagnostic criteria. The SCI D-5 can be used to ensure that the major DSM -5 diagnoses are sy stematically evaluated and that all of the stud y patients have s ymptoms that meet the DSM- 5 criteria for inclusion and exclusion and to char acterize a study population in terms of current and previous psy chiatric diagnoses ( First et al 2015 ). 6.2.2. Quality of Life Scales 6.2.2.1. Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (SQLS) SQL S will be administered to adult patients only at the time points specified in Table 1and Table 2, and is used to capture quality of life. The 33- item measure yields 3 subscale scores:"
84,page_84,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 84psychosocial, motivation/energy , and s ymptoms/side effects ( Wilkinson et al 2000 ). Higher scores on the scales indicate worse quality of life. 6.2.2.2. 5-Level EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ- 5D-5L) The 5 -Level EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D- 5L) will be administered to adult patients only at the time points specified in Table 1andTable 2 , and is a standardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health. The EQ-5D- 5L consists of 2 parts. In Part 1, patients rate their health state in 5 domains (mobility , self - care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood) using a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = no problems, 2 = slight problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, and 5 = extreme problems. In Part 2, patients rate their health state on a 100 -mm visual analog scale; a rating of 0 represents the worst imaginable health state, and a rating of 100 represents the best imaginable health state ( EuroQol Group 1990, Rabin and de Charro 2001 ). 6.2.3. Drug Attitudes Inventory 10- item Version (DAI -10) The Drug Attitudes Inventory 10-item version (DAI -10) will be administered to adult patients only at the time points specified in Table 1andTable 2, and measures subjective responses and attitudes toward maintenance of antipsy chotic drug therapy that may affect compliance. There are 2 versi ons: the DAI -10 and the DAI -30, which track very closel y (r=0.93), and onl y the shorter DAI -10 will be used. The DAI -10 consists of 10 items covering 3 domains (subjective positive, subjective negative, and attitude toward medication), although only a sing le composite score is computed ( Hogan et al 1983, Nielsen et al 2012 ). A positive total score indicates a compliant response and a negative score indicates a non- compliant response. 6.2.4. Personal and S ocial Performance Scale (PSP) The Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) will be administered to adult patients only at the time points specified in Table 1andTable 2,and is a clinician -rated instrument that measures personal and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia ( Morosini et al 2000 ). The PSPis a 100-point si ngle- item rating scale, divided into 10 equal intervals. The score is based on the assessment of patient’s functioning in 4 categories: 1) socially useful activities; 2) personal and social relationships; 3) self -care; and 4) disturbing and aggressive beha viors. Higher scores represent better personal and social functioning, with ratings from 91 to 100 indicating more than adequate functioning, while scores under 30 indicating functioning so poor that intensive supervision is required. 6.2.5. Healthcare Resource U tilization Healthcare resource utilization will be assessed for both adult and adolescent patients approximately every 3 months (at the time points specified in Table 1andTable 2) for hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits, and outpatient visits (ie, not including protocol - mandated outpatient visits). Hospitalizations will be assessed as the percentage of patients with hospitalizations over the past 4 weeks, associated length of stay , and the number of hospitalizations among patients who were hospitalized. I n addition, the percentage of patient s with ER visits and number of ER visits over the past 4 weeks and the percentage of patients with outpatient visits and number of outpatient visits over the past 4 weeks will be evaluated."
85,page_85,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 85This should be completed by the site investigator/coordinator through patient interviews. and where possible, verification against medical records should be performed. The famil y member or caregiver may also need to provide input. 6.2.6. Clinical Global Impression of Severity The CGI -S scale was developed to rate the severity of a patient’s condition on a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients; Guy 1976a ). The CGI -S will be administered by the investigator/trained rater at all in- clinic vis its."
86,page_86,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 867. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study personnel by evaluating the reported adverse events, clinical laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, ECG findings, phy sical examination findings (including bod y weight measurements), use of concomitant medication, and local injection site tolerance . Additional assessments of safet y of specific interest to the use of medicinal products in schizophrenia include assessments of suicidality , depression, and abnormal movements (eg, tardive d yskinesia, akathisia, and parkinsonism). For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 7.1. Adverse Events 7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Eve nt Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorab le and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy , or significant worsening of the disease under study , or of any concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the IMP. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during thisstudy will not be considered adverse events. Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or f requency ) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions drug interactions events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phase of this study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or are considered b y the investigator to be clinically significant. (Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiving stud y treatment are not considered adverse events.)"
87,page_87,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 87Worsening of the disease under study , schizophrenia, will be assessed using PANSS and should be recorded as an adverse event onl y if the presentation or outcome is more severe than would normally be expected from the normal course of the disease in a particular patient. A relapse event, defined per one of the criteria listed (see primary endpoint definition in Section 2.1), will not be automatically classified as an adverse event unless specificall y judged as such by the investigator. 7.1.2. Recor ding and Reporting of Adverse Events For recording of adverse event, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from signature of the ICF to the end of the follow -up period. The follow -up period of recording of adverse events is define d as 120days after the last dose of IMP. The period for reporting treatment -emergent adverse events is defined as the period after the first dose of IMP is administered and until 120days after the last dose of IMP. All adverse events that occur during th e defined study period must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship to the I MP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed, and the serious a dverse event must be reported immediately (Section 7.1.5.3.1). The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patients for adverse events after the defined period. At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as “Have y ou had any unusual sy mptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and sy mptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is mad e, all related signs, symptoms, and an y test findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the serious adverse event form. The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a healthcare professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or stud y procedure is made. The onset and end d ates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study procedures, and the severit y and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged b y the investigator, must be recorded as described below. Further details are given in the Safety Monitoring Plan. 7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event The severi ty of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following: Mild: No limitation of usual activities"
88,page_88,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 88Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities 7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational M edicinal Product The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows: Table 6: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the IMP Term Definition Clarification No reasonable possibility (not related)This category applies to adverse events that, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged t o be unrelated to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the admi nistration of the IMP. It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. It does not reappear or worsen when the IMP is re-administered. Reasonable possibility (related)This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the administration of IMP cannot be ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply: It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. It cannot be reasonably explained by t he known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse ev ent does not disappear after discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship clearly exists. It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. IMP=investigational medicinal product. 7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events For recording of serious adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the I CF to the end of the follow -up period. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow -up period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1. A relapse event, defined per one of the criteria listed (see p rimary endpoint definition in Section 2.1), will not be automatically classified as a serious adverse event unless specificall y judged as such b y the investigator."
89,page_89,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 897.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: results in death is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient a dmission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the ICF will not be considered serious adverse events, unles s there was worsening of the pre -existing condition during the patient’s participation in this study . results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) is a congenital anomal y/birth defect an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event . All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as al l of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event: ALT or AST increase of >3× the ULN total bilirubin increase of >2× ULN absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline phosphatase) An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for serio usness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event. 7.1.5.2. Expectedness A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant RSI by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpecte d adverse event. The RSI for this study is the RSI section of the current version of the IB for TV -46000. For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the RSI at the time of occurrence of the SUSAR applies."
90,page_90,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 90A serious adverse event that is not included in the Listing of Adverse Reactions in the RSI by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The sponsor’s GPSP team will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events. 7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serio us Adverse Event 7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study , regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported to the sponsor by the investigator. Th e event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to active ly monitor patients for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the last administration of I MP of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO) or designee (a contract research organization [CRO] in a country without a sponsor L SO) (contact information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section); the L SO will forward the report to the sponsor’s GPSP team. The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completel y: study number investigator and investigational center identification patient number onset date and detailed description of adverse event investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP (no reasonable possibility and reasonable possibility ) Additional information includes: age and sex of patient date of first dose of IMP date and amount of last administered dose of IMP action taken outcome, if known severit y explanation of assessment of relatedness concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and treatment of the event pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data"

Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarde d by the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report. For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP team will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences form/Extensible Markup Lang uage file to the L SO/CRO for submission to the competent authorities (CAs), Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Boards (IEC/IRBs), and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. For double -blind studies, blinding will be maintained for all study personnel except the unblinded nurse. Therefore, in case of a SUSAR, only the LSO/CRO will receive the unblinded report for re gulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report. 7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators partic ipating in sponsored clinical studies of IMP and the appropriate CAs (and IEC/I RB, as appropriate). In addition to notify ing the investigators and CAs (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate), other action may be required, including the following: altering existing r esearch by modify ing the protocol discontinuing or suspending the stud y modify ing the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new findings modify ing listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as related to IMP"
92,page_92,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 927.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest No protocol -defined adverse events of special interest were identified for this study . 7.1.7. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergenc y, deviations from the protocol may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other phy sician in attendance must contact the ph ysician iden tified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the stud y. 7.2. Pregnancy Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP. All pregnancies of women participating in the study and female partners of men participating in the study , if applicable, that occur during the study , or within at lea st 120 day s after the end of study , are to be reported immediately to the individual identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact I nformation section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the sponsor (LSO/CRO) with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (Section 7.1.5.3). The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between screening and baseline, provided no protocol- related procedures were applied. All female patients (or female partners of men participating in the study ) who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion) .If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8weeks of age), including details of birth and presenc e or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of afte r withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. Since there is lack of data on human teratogenicity, genotoxicity , fetotoxicity , or spermatoxicity for this I MP, female partners of men participating in the study who become pregnant will be asked to sign an ICF and will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion) . If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pr egnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. If the pregnancy in the woman participating in the study and/or the female partners of men partici pating in the stud y does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event."
93,page_93,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 93For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse event. For an elect ive abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form; do not report as an adverse event. 7.3. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the Investigational Medicinal Products Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported as a deviation in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a result. The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations: 1.Medication error: An y uninte ntional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient, or consumer. 2.Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumu latively , which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should alway s be applied. An y dose of IMP (whether the test IMP, reference IMP, or placebo I MP), whether taken intentionally or unintentionall y, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 3.Misuse: Situations where the I MP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorized product information. 4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intenti onal excessive use of IMP, which is accompanied by harmful phy sical or psy chological effects. 5.Off-label use: Situations where an IMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 6.Occupational exposure: Exposure to an I MP, as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation. 7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions, which occur in infants, following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk. 7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests All cl inical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by the investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically significant abnormal and clinically significant"

Physical Examinations Full phy sical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only ) and weight, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 1and Table 2. The full phy sical examination will consist of examining the following body systems: cardiovascular, respiratory , abdominal, skin, neurological, and musculoskeletal sy stems. The ph ysical examination will also include examination of general appearance, including head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest;"

Body weight and ty mpanic temperature will be measured at each visit. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured with the patient in a seated position. Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as clinicall y significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adver se event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 7.6. Vital Signs Vital signs (blood pressure [sy stolic/diastolic] , respirator y rate, t ympanic temperature, and pulse) will be measured at the time points detailed in Table 1andTable 2. All vital sign results outside of the reference ranges will be judged b y the investigator as belonging to 1 of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically significant abnormal and clinically significant Before blood pressure and pulse are measured, the patient must rest in a supine or seated position for at least 5 minutes. (The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient.) Forany abn ormal vital sign value, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded both on the source documentation and on the CRF as an adverse event, and will be monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 7.7. Electrocardiography A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded at the time points detailed in Table 1andTable 2 . Triplicate measurements will be performed at screening and baseline and single measurements at all other in -clinic visits. A qualified phy sician at a central diagnostic center will be interpreting the ECG. All ECG results outside of the reference ranges will be judged by the investigator as belonging to 1 of the following catego ries: abnormal and not clinically significant abnormal and clinically significant Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as clinicall y significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source docu mentation and in the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N. 7.8. Assessment of Local Tolerability and Pain In case an adverse event related to an injection site reaction is reported, an assessment of the sc injection site (ie, local tolerability [skin at injection site]) will be made. The presence and severit y of ery thema, swelling, induration, and pain at the injection site may be assessed using the scales below as applicable."

Erythema and Edema Assessment Scoring of ery thema and edema will be done using 5 -point scales: Erythema: None = 0 Very slight = 1 Well defined = 2 Moderate to severe = 3 Severe = 4 Edema: None = 0 Very slight = 1 Slight = 2 Moderate = 3 Severe = 4 7.8.2. Induration and Nodule Assessment The presence and size (length and width) of an y palpable induration/nodules at the injection site will be assessed and recorded. Scoring of nodules will be done using a 4 -point scale: No induration/nodule = 0 Discernible induration/small nodule <0.5 cm = 1 Marked induration/medium size nodule of 0.5 to 1 cm = 2 Severe induration/significant size nodule >1 cm = 3 7.8.3. Injection Pain Intensity Assessment In case an adverse event related to an injection site reaction is reported, intensity of injection pain will be assessed b y patients using an 11- point NPRS (0 [no pain] to 10 mm [worst pain]) (Williamson and Hoggart 2005 ). Pain measurement will be evaluated during visits and telephone calls until resolution. The exact timing will be captured in the source documentation. 7.9. Assessment of Suicidality Risperidone is considered to be central nervous system- active. In addition, the re is an increased risk of suicide attempt in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical stud y. Risperidone is considered to be an at ypical antipsychotic me dicinal product. Although risperidone or other similar medicinal products in this class are not known to be associated with"
98,page_98,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 98an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to patients with schizophrenia, the sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinical study . The study population being administered TV -46000 or placebo should be monitored appropriatel y and observed closel y for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Co nsideration should be given to discontinuing the test I MP in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Families and caregivers of participants being treated with test I MP should be instructed to monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, and to report such sy mptoms immediately to the study investigator. Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior and treatment -emergent suicidal ideatio n and behavior will be assessed during the study using the C -SSRS and CGI -SS scale. 7.9.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The C -SSRS is a semi structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity , and frequency of suicide -related thoughts and behaviors ( Posner et al 2011). The interview and rating for the C -SSRS will be conducted by a rater specificall y trained to rate the scale (per the minimum requirements outlined b y the scale author), regardless of educatio n level, who has appropriate clinical trial experience with C-SSRS administration, after review and approval by the Teva clinical project ph ysician or designee. There are required items that address suicidal ideation and potential additional items related to intensity of ideation and suicidal behavior if there are any positive responses to a required item. The C -SSRS uses dichotomous scales (ie, y es or no), Likert scales, and text or narrative to further describe the thoughts or behaviors. The C -SSRS will b e administered at screening (baseline/screening version) and all post-screening visits (“since last visit” version) during the stud y, as well as during phone contacts (“since last visit” version). 7.9.2. Clinical Global Impression -Severity of Suicidality The CGI -SS scale provides an overall clinician- rated assessment of the risk of suicidality (Lindenmay er et al 2003 ). The CGI -SS consists of a 5 -point scale in Part 1 ranging from 1 (not at all suicidal) to 5 (attempted suicide) and a 7-point scale in Part 2 ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). The CGI -SS will be assessed at screening and all visits during the study . 7.10. Study -Specific Assessments of Safety 7.10.1. Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) The AIMS will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and Table 2 . The AIMS scores the occurrence of tardive d yskinesia in patients receiving neuroleptic medications ( Guy 1976b). The AIMS is a 14- item scale that includes assess ments of orofacial movements, extremity and truncal dy skinesia, examiner’s judgment of global severit y, subjective measures of awareness of movements and distress, and a yes/no assessment of problems concerning teeth and/or dentures. Higher scores indicate greater severity of the condition."
99,page_99,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV4 6000- CNS -30072 997.10.2. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) The BARS will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1andTable 2. The BARS is an instrument that assesses the severit y of drug -induced akathisia ( Barnes 1989). The BARS includes 3 items for rating objective restless movements, subjective restlessness, and an y subjective distress associated with akathisia that are scored on a 4 -point scale of 0 to 3, and summed y ielding a total scored ranging from 0 to 9. The BARS also includes a global c linical assessment of severity scored on a scale of 0 to 5. Higher scores are indicative of greater severit y of akathisia. 7.10.3. Simpson -Angus Scale (SAS) The SAS will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and Table 2. The SAS is a 10- item instrument for the assessment of neuroleptic- induced parkinsonism ( Simpson and Angus 1970 ). The items on the scale include measurements of hypokinesia, rigidity , glabellar reflex, tremor, and salivation. Each item is rated on a 5- point scale (0 to 4), with a higher score indicating greater severity of s ymptoms. The mean score is calculated by adding the individual item scores and dividing by 10. 7.10.4. Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) The CDSS will be performed at the time points specified in Table 1and Table 2. The CDSS is specificall y designed to assess the level of depression separate from the positive, negative, and EPS in schizophrenia ( Addin gton et al 1993 ). This clinician -administered instrument consists of 9 items, each rated on a 4 -point scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe). 7.11. Other Assessments"

Time to impending relapse will be calculated as the earliest date the pat ient meets ≥1 of the impending relapse criteria minus the randomization date plus 1. The absolute increase of the combined score of the 4 PANSS items is the sum of the increases of those scores (ignoring the decreases). 9.5.2. Key Secondary Endpoints The eITT analysis set (Section 9.2.3) will be used for all summaries in this section, unless otherwise specified. For the endpoints that are evaluted onl y in the adult population, the analy sis will be conducted on the ITT anal ysis set.

This analy sis estimates the treatment effect of randomized treatment on patient's stability once the patient adheres to treatment long enough until the last treatment. The use of eITT anal ysis complies with while on treatment estimand and will be comprised of the difference in proportions under the treatment to which the patient was ini tially randomized of all patients who were successfully stabilized on oral risperidone at a daily dose range of 2 mg to 5 mg. Accordingl y, this estimand addresses the clinical question to what extent patients improve their chances to maintain stability once they start the treatmen t if the patient adheres to the treatment long enough. 9.5.2.4. Percentage of Patients Achieving Remission at Endpoint Positive sy mptom, negative sy mptom, and overall sy mptom remission will be examined and are defined b y Andreasen et al ( 2005) including severity and duration criteria. All remission criteria can be derived from PANSS items. For overall s ymptom remission, the patient must not relapse during the study and in addition, over a period of at least 6 months preceding the endpoint, maintain scores of ≤3 on each of the 8 specific PANSS items: P1 (delusions), G9 (unusual thought content), P3 (hallucinatory behavior), P2 (conceptual disorganization), G5 (mannerisms/posturing), N1 (blunted affect), N4(social withdrawal), and N6 (lack of spontaneity).

The details about the Type-I statistical error control for the key secondary endpoints will be discussed in the statistical analysis plan. 9.5.4.4.1. Time to Event Key Secondary Analysis For the key secondary endpoint discussed in Section 9.5.2.1 , time to impending relapse in adult and adolescent patients will be assessed similarly to the Primary Efficacy Analy sis using the eITT Anal ysis Set (Section 9.2.2). The Cox proportional hazard model will include patient age group (if applicable) along with treatment, and the aforementioned stratification variables as the factors. For the key secondary endpoint discussed in Section 9.5.2.8 , time to impending relapse in adolescent patients will be assessed if the number of randomized patients will be at least 10 with clinically sufficient exposure. The method will be similar to the Primary Efficacy Anal ysis, but will use the adolescent patients subset.

If the first primary hypothesis fails to reach significance no further formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Type-I error will be further controlled for the key secondary endpoints by employ ing fixed sequential (hierarchical) testing strategy within each endpoints family (primary endpoints and key secondary endpoints). Secondary endpoints will be anal yzed in a pooled manner for the treatment groups if the two primary endpoints are foun d to be significant. Further details about the Ty pe-I statistical error control will be discussed in the statistical analy sis plan. A fixed -sequence (hierarchical) testing procedure will be implemented to control the Ty pe-I error rate . The sequence of the secondary endpoints comparisons will be as follows: 1.Time to impending relapse in the eITT anal ysis set 2.Impending relapse rate at week 24 3.Percentage of patients who maintain stability at endpoint 4.

Separate summaries for adolescent patients may be presented separatel y for some anal yses, as applicable, and will be described in the Statistical Analy sis Plan. 9.8. Tolerability Analysis In case an adverse event related to an injection site reaction is reported, an assessment of the sc injection site (ie, local tolerability [skin at injection site] ) will be made. The presen ce and severit y of ery thema, swelling, induration, and pain at the injection site may be assessed using the scales described in Section 7.8as appl icable. All-cause discontinuation rates and discontinuation rates due to adverse events (dropout rates) will be calculated as the number of patients who withdrew earl y for all reasons, and the number of patients who withdrew earl y due to adverse events, r espectivel y, divided by number of patients in each treatment group, and will be presented using descriptive statistics. Time to all- cause discontinuation will be calculated as the discontinuation date minus the randomization date plus 1. Kaplan -Meier curve s for the time to discontinuation as a result of all causes will be plotted. Separate summaries for adolescent patients might be presented separatel y for some anal yses, as applicable, and will be described in the Statistical Analy sis Plan."

Global Amendment 03 (Dated 19 April 2020) The primary reason for this amendment is to rescind the previous interim analy ses strategy , and to perform the final s tatistical anal ysis of the study data when at least 90 relapse events are observed, without an y interim anal ysis. The original assumptions for sample size determination in the initial protocol were as follows: a placebo effect (namel y, median time to impe nding relapse of 7 months in the placebo group) similar to that observed in a similarl y-designed study (Kane et al 2012) ; a hazard ratio of 1.82 (placebo vs TV -46000 for both dosing regimens); a randomization ratio of 1:1:1 (q1m:q2m:placebo), with 2 primary h ypotheses to be tested (q1m vs placebo and q2m vs placebo) at an overall 2- sided alpha of 0.050. As the study progressed, the preliminary study design assumptions were found to no longer hold as the pooled cumulative num ber of relapse events (across all treatment groups, due to blinding) was lower than anticipated, based on the above mentioned median time to relapse and hazard ratio. A stronger treatment effect, a longer time to relapse for the placebo group , and an incre ased early termination (ET) rate -either as single factors or in combination -may cause this decrease in the rate of observed events. Since Teva personnel and delegates are blinded to the treatment assignments, the precise underl ying reasons are not know n at this time. An earlier anal ysis will permit earlier completion of this double blind, placebo- controlled stud y (TV46000 -CNS - 30072) and earlier roll- over of patients into the ongoing TV46000- CNS - 30078 safet y extension study, in which all patients receiv e treatment with TV -46000. Additionally , COVID -19 pandemic -related operational updates were added to the study as a new appendix ( Appendix N). Administrative changes have been applied, including updating the Table of Contents. In addition to the reasons mentioned above, an earlier completion may be even more important now given the COVID -19 challenges. All major changes to the protocol body are listed below in the table, and are reflected in the synopsis, as applicable. Minor editorial changes (ty pos, punctuation, etc) have been made to the protocol (and protocol s ynopsis, as appropriate). Table 2(Study Procedures and Assessments) and Figure 1(Overall Study Schematic Diagram) have also been revised to reflect the changes described below."

143,page_143,"Placebo- Controlled Study -Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 14316.4. Global Protocol Amendment 02 (Dated 02 September 2019) The primary reason for this global amendment is to revise the number of relapse events at which the formal, pre -specified interim analy sis will be conducted. In addition to the originally - planned, single interim analy sis that was to be conducted when 125 relapse events were observed, the Sponsor now plans to also conduct an earlier i nterim anal ysis when 90 relapse events are reached. Since the study 's initiation, the rate of observed relapse events (pooled across all treatment groups due to blinding) is lower than expected. This may be due to a longer median time to relapse than assumed for the placebo group, or a higher hazard ratio than assumed during the study planning. An earlier anal ysis, if successful, will allow the Sponsor to stop this double - blind, placebo -controlled study and roll the patients over earlier into the long term TV46000 - CNS -30078 extension study (in which all patients receive treatment with TV -46000) without affecting the statistical power of the stud y,while maintaining control of the ty pe-I error. Patients randomized to the q1m or q2m treatment arms in the RI SE study will continue on their assigned treatment regimen in the extension study , and patients randomized to the placebo arm in the RISE study will be re -randomized in a 1:1 manner to the q1m or q2m treatment arms in the extension study . These changes to th e statistical methodology are unlikely to affect the safety (phy sical or mental integrit y) or rights of the patients in this clinical Phase 3 study, the secondary endpoints of the study or the study’s scientific value, since the focus on the impending time to relapse as the primary endpoint is maintained, as well as the originally -planned time points for the interim and final anal ysis, and the overall control of t ype-I error using the same principles and methodology originall y used for the study . Moreover, from an ethical perspective, adding an earlier interim analysis will enable patients on placebo to receive effective treatment earlier, if the treatment is found to be effective.The technical details of the planned statistical anal ysis of the study data wi ll be provided in the Statistical Anal ysis Plan. Further clarifications and changes related to stud y conduct were also implemented in this amendment. These include (but are not limited to) prolongation of study duration ( although in case of a successful interim analy sis, the study will be terminated earlier), change of inclusion criterion k to omit the BMI percentile limitation, updates to the planned number of enrolled patients per updated projections, clarification of procedures to be performed during uns cheduled visits (per Clarification Letter 02 dated 27 June 2019) and clarification regarding highl y effective birth control methods (see Appendix E) and some administrative details (see Appendix A).

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Introduction [Not applicable] The underlying disease mechanisms and initial approach to the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia in adolescent patients aged 13 to 17 years and adult patients 18 years of age and older is essentially the same. Schizophrenia in children and adolescents is accepted to be clinically and biologically similar to adult -onset schizophrenia, but with some differences in the presentation of the symptoms, relative frequency of core psychotic symptoms (eg, auditory hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), neurocognitive impairments, psychophysiological abnormalities, and the presence of structural brain abnormalities ( Asarnow et al 1995 , Bo and Haahr 201 6, Rapoport et al 2005 ). Pediatric patients display a more severe clinical prognosis and a greater neurodegenerative trajectory, and can be less responsive to treatment compared to patients with adult -onset schizophrenia ( Bo and Haahr 2016 ). Children and adolescents who are diagnosed with schizophrenia display high stability with regard to the phenotypical expression of the disorder into adulthood ( Hollis 2000 ). Studies of neuropsychological New text regarding schizophrenia in the pediatric population. Literature references added to reference list."

General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram Patients will provide informed consent or assent, as applicable, at the screening visit. For adolescent patients, it is mandatory that a parent/caregiver accompanies the patient to each visit and serves as a reliable informant. It is r ecommended that a caregiver is identified for each adult patient. Local requirements should be followed. The caregiver may be contacted in case of loss of contact with the patient or to provide additional information about the patient, if needed. Patients can be accompanied by caregivers to visits. Open -label oral risperidone (2 to 5 mg/day) will be used to stabilize patients to the treatments (the dose w ill be based on clinical judgement). Adolescent patients will receive a maximal dose of 4 mg/day. If a patient withdraws from the study prior to the randomization visit (Visit 6), the CRF for the patient's last visit will be marked as ""Not Continuing"" and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded.

Although compliance in children and adolescents treated with antipsychotics is substantially higher than in adults, ranging from approximately 74% to 88% ( Pogge et al 2005, Yazdi et al 2008 ), LAIs may be considered for patients with confirmed schizophr enia and with risk factors for medication non -adherence: history of non-adherence, severe symptoms, comorbid substance use, cognitive impairment, ambivalence or negative attitudes towards medication, and poor insight ( Ferrin et al 2016 ).

The principal investigator at each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation is defined as an y change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures defined in the protocol. I mportant protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that might signif icantly affect the completeness, accuracy , and/or reliability of the study data or that might significantl y affect a subject's rights, safet y, or well -being. For example, important protocol deviations might include enrolling subjects in violation of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a specific subject population or failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as these may compromise the scientific value of the trial. All protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. When an important protocol deviation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval from the medical expert. The decis ion will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrit y of the study. A noncompliant patient may continue taking the stud y treatment only if this does not jeopardize the patient’s safety . The sponsor will assess each protocol d eviation and decide whether any of these noncompliances should be reported to the Regulatory Authorit y as a serious breach of Good Clinical Practice ( GCP) and the protocol. Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y the sponsor. If the investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol deviation. A dev iation from the eligibility criteria will alway s result in study drug discontinuation in case the patient has not been dosed. In case a patient who was wrongly randomized has already started taking the study drug, a risk/benefit evaluation has to take plac e, and a strong clinical justification must be provided in case the patient is not withdrawn from the study drug. If such patient has alread y completed the study or has withdrawn early, no action will be taken, but the deviation will be recorded. For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix N.

BIRTH CONTROL METHODS AN D PREGNANCY TESTING Contraception recommendations and pregnancy testing should encompass all investigational medicinal product (IMPs) as well as non -IMPs, eg, background therap y, and the measures to be followed should be based on the medicinal product with highest risk. Assessment of likelihood of possible interaction between IMP or concomitant medications and hormonal contraception should be conducted. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the IMP, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method, eg, cytochrome P4504A inducers. In case of suspected interaction, hormonal contraceptive alone may not be sufficient. In the absence of clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study data in IMPs with demonstrated or suspected human te ratogenicity /fetotoxicity , recommendation for use of hormonal contraceptives should be thoroughl y justified by the sponsor. Additional contraceptive methods, including supplementary barrier methods, may be considered. Women/girls of childbearing potential are defined as: not surgically (documented hy sterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy ) or congenitally sterile not postmenopausal Postmenopausal women are defined as: 1year postmenopausal (no menses for 12 months without an alternati ve medical cause plus an increased concentration of follicle stimulating hormone [FSH] of more than 35 U/L) in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y Recommendations for application of birth control methods: IMP with possibl e human teratogenicit y/fetotoxicity Highl y effective method of contraception Contraception during treatment and until the end of relevant sy stemic exposure Additional pregnancy testing to be considered; as a minimum, at the end of relevant s ystemic exposur e In each case of delayed menstrual period (over 1 month between menstruations) confirmation of absence of pregnancy is strongly recommended. This recommendation also applies to women of childbearing potential with infrequent or irregular menstrual cycles. Description of highly effective birth control methods: Highl y effective birth control methods are methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly . Such methods include the following: Combined estrogen and progestogen hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least"
234,page_234,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 2347days (for I MPs without suspected teratogenicit y/genotoxicity ) and 1 month (for IMPs pot entially teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first dose of IMP. Progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least 7 days (for IMPs without suspected teratogenicity /genotoxicity ) and 1 month (for IMPs potentially teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first dose of IMP. Intrauterine device and intrauterine hormone-releasing s ystem need to be in place at least 2 months before screening. Bilateral tubal occlus ion Vasectomized partner provided that he is the sole sexual partner and has received medical assessment of the surgical process Sexual abstinence is only considered a highl y effective method if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the de fined period. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation met hods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception (according to Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency , MHRA). Male contraception: Male patients must alway s use a condom. Vasectomy: Use of contraceptive methods applies also to vasectomized men, because of the risk associated with transfer of a drug via seminal fluid. Pregnant female partners of male study participants: Male study participants must use condoms during intercou rse if their female partners are pregnant."

For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints invol ving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply ) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center In the event that the pro duct complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide the following information, as available: investigational center number and principal investigator name name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint clinical protocol n umber patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable product name and strength for open -label studies patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label studies product available for return (y es/no)"
242,page_242,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 242product was taken or used according to protocol (y es/no) description or nature of complaint associated serious adverse event (y es/no) clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) [yes/no] date and name of person receiving the comp laint Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delay ed even if not all the required information can be obtained immediately . Known information must be reported immediately . The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain an y outstanding information. Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s) The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. If it is determined that the investigational cent er must return all I MP, the sponsor will provide the information needed to handle the return. The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section 7.1.5.3 of the protocol , respectivel y). Documenting a Product Complaint The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint and an y actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the invest igator, if necessary , an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product. Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be detected, documented, and reported b y the investigator throughout the study."

Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directl y to the CRF. If data are processed from other institutions or by other means (eg, clinical laboratory , central image center, electronic diary data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). The medical experts, study monitors, auditors, Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB), and inspectors from competent authority (CA) (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that pat ient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements. The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a at all times. The investigator must maintain a confidential patient ide ntification list that allows the unambiguous identification of each patient. Data Collection Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study . The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part11 (USA) and documents of other concerned CAs. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated, and all users will receive training on the s ystem and study -specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual sy stem access rights. Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who p rovided informed consent. Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central image center, electronic diary data, electronic patient -reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronicall y to the sponsor (or or ganization performing data management). All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directly to the CRF."

Data Quality C ontrol Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality , completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study . Oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. Day -to-day data management tasks for this study are delegated to a contract organization, and these functions may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical st udies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed b y the sponsor before the start of data management activities. Data will be verified b y the study monitor using the data source and reviewed by Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. Data identified as erroneous or data that are missing will be referred to the investigational center for resolution through data queries. Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the information available in the CDMS and an y discrepancies will be queried. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study . At the conclusion o f the study , the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further additions or corrections. Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured and confirmed as accurate. All data collected will be approved by the investigator at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents Sponsor Responsibilities The original CRFs will be archived b y the sponsor. I nvestigational center -specific CRFs will be provided to the respective investigational centers for archiving. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, not es, rep orts, and data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country , state/province, or national and local laws, including, but not limited to : full case histories signed informed consent forms patient identification lists CRFs for each patient on a per -visit basis data from other sources (eg, central laboratory , bioanal ytical laboratory , central image center, electronic diary ) safet y reports financial disclosure reports/forms"
245,page_245,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Schizophrenia Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV46000- CNS -30072 245reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the IMPs copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IEC/I RB, and an y CA The investigator will retain all records related to the study and any additional records required, as indicated b y the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, un til the contract research organization or sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destro yed. If, after 25 years from study completion, or earlier in the case of the investigational center closing or going out of business, the invest igator reasonabl y determines that study record retention has become unduly burdensome, and the sponsor has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may submit a written request to the sponsor at least 60 days before an y plann ed disposition of study records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements for appropriate archival or disposition, including requiring that the investigator deliver such records to the sponsor. The investigator shall notify the spon sor of any accidental loss or destruction of study records."

The changes will be effective for the period of the COVID- 19 pandemic and when the situation at specific sites/countries allow s the return to regular study activities, this appendix will be void for those countries/site s. The follow ing sections of the protocol are affected: Section 3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram; Section 3.5. Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments In the event of an emergency situation (eg, the Coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVID -19] pandemi c), in case a patient cannot return to the clinic for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient's concern, or closure of the site clinic), remote assessment of efficacy and safet y scales via TC and/or videoconference (VC), with VC being the preferred method, may be allowed. The results of the scale rating will be directly entered into the eCRF per the usual process;o therwise, subject status should be NOT COMPL ETED DUE TO: 'Other' 'COVID -19 logistical reasons prevented patient's continuation in the study '. Ifthe patient does not continue in the study due to site closure, the subject status should be NOT COMPL ETED DUE TO: 'Other' 'COVID -19 logistical reasons prevented patient's continuation in the study '. In the event that a patient completes the oral stabilization stage (Stage 1) but cannot come to the site for the baseline visit for randomization (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient's concern or closure of the site clinic), it may be possible to extend the duration of Stage 1 on a case -by-case basis, following discussion between the investigator and the sponsor stud y physician. In addition, the test and placebo IMP (as applicable) may be administered according to the schedule outlined in the protocol by unblinded study personne l, or home care service providers trained according to study specifications, via visits to the patient's place of residence. The patient's consent to the home visit will be collected in advance, where possible, by phone and documented in the patient’s char t. The IMP will be transported, prepared , and administered in a blinded fashion per the conditions specified in the pharmacy manual and the injection instructions , provided that proper barrier precautions can be effectivel y implemented to minimize any risk of exposure, and that site staff follow CDC guidelines and local health authority procedures . Modifications to other procedures and assessments (ECG, lab sample collection, pharmacokinetic sampling, etc) will be performed per implemented contingency measures according to sponsor instructions and the corresponding manual. For example, if central lab samples cannot be collected for safet y assessments, sites may have patients visit a local reference lab to perform the assessments. At-home nursing visits may be used to perform safet y assessments such as ECG, laboratory sample collection, vital signs, an d nursing assessments to determine an y new adverse events."

Pharmacokinetic Assessment If pharmacokinetic samples cannot be c ollected due to limitations in ability to carry out the procedure, an at -home nursing vendor or site personnel could perform the sample collection, processing and shipment to the CRO (I CON) central lab via appropriate courier. The samples should be collect ed and processed as described in supporting documentation provided to the vendor or site nurses as applicable. Section 9.5.4.2. Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity and supplementary anal yses will be conducted to evaluate the impact of the change to remote monitoring (VC visits) and the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the impending relapse and rating scales. The anal ysis will include subgroup anal ysis (eg, pre, during and post COVID -19 pandemic outbreak, where each patient will be classified into one of t he levels), a multivariate model (eg ,Cox model with time dependent covariate for COVID -19), and/or imputation methodology for patients' attrition due to the COVID -19 pandemic ,as appropriate and if data permit. Details of the supplementary and sensitivity analyses will be presented in the statistical analy sis plan or addendum thereof, following a blinded review meeting prior to database lock. Section 10. Quality Control and Quality Assurance Deviations from the study conduct due to emergency situations (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), including implemented contingency measures and their impact ( eg, patient discontinuation from treatment with investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safet y and/or efficacy data, etc ), will be described in the appropriate sections of the CSR as applicable. Appendix C. Quality Control and Quality Assurance Protocol Deviations Deviations from the study conduct due to emergency situations (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), including implemented contingency measures and their impact ( eg, patient discontinuation from treatment with investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical safet y and/or efficacy data, etc) , will be described in the appropriate sections of the CSR as applicable. Study Monitoring In case of an emergency situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), monitors may not be able to access the investigational centers for on -site visits in a timely manner.
