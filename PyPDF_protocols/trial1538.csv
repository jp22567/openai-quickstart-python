Study Design: This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study in adult male and female subjects with active PsA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to biologic disease -modify ing anti-rheumatic drug (bioDMARD) treatment. The study consists of two parts, the Main Study : Screening through Week 16(inclusive) , and the L ong Term Extension (L TE): after Week 16 for2years. After all subjects have completed the Week 16 Visit or have permanentl y discontinued the study prior to Week 16, the treatment assignments will be unblinded to the Sponsor only .The subjects and investigators will remain blinded to individual level treatment assignment . Part 1 –Main Study (Screening t hrough Week 16): Approximately 390 subjects will be ran domized in a 1:1:1 ratio to oneof 3dosing groups as outlined below. Randomization will be stratified b y geographic region, concurrent use of conventional s ynthetic DMARD(s) ( csDMARDs )and/or apremilast at randomization (yes or no), and prior use of bioDMARD(s) (o neprior bioDMARD or >1 prior bioDMARD use). Subjects will be permitted, but are not required, to continue stable doses of background csDMARD( s), apremilast, and/ or non- steroidal anti-inflammator ydrugs (NSAI Ds) . Every effort should be made to maintain stable background therap y for PsA treatment through the completion of the Week 16 Visit. I nstructions for rescue therap y are detailed in Section 5.3. Dosing groups in the Main Study : Filgotinib 200 mg group: filgotinib 200 mg once daily + placebo to match ( PTM) filgotinib 100mg once dail y Filgotinib 100 mg group: PTM filgotinib 200 mg once daily +filgotinib 100 mg once daily Placebo control group: PTM filgotinib 200 mg once dail y + PTM filgotinib 100 mg once daily"

Study drug interruption and discontinuation considerations are outlined in Section 3.5. All subjects who permanentl y discontinue study drug should continue to receive standard of care treatment for their PsA includ ing additional therapies, if required. Discontinuation of Study Participation If a subject is unable to complete the study through the Week 16 Visit, and has received at least one dose of stud y drug, the subject will complete an Earl y Termination (ET) Visit at the time of study discontinuation. Subjects will also complete a post- study follow - up visit approximately 4weeks later (Safet y Follow -up Visit). After the Week 16 Visit, subjects who permanently discontinue study drug for an y reason are to discontinue the study . Subjects who exit the study early, regardless of dosing duration, are to complete an ET Visit and a Safet y Follow -up Visit."

The graphical a pproach to sequentially rejective multiple test procedures ( Appendix 6and Appendix 7) will be used to control a family -wise ty pe I error rate at 5% (i.e. α =0.05). Within each filgotinib dosing regimen, the primary hypothesis will be first tested at α/2. If the primary hypothesis is rejected, then the next secondary hypothesis in the same filgotinib dosing regimen will be tested at α/2. Testing of the h ypotheses happens sequentiall y in the same filgotinib dosing regimen. Once all hy potheses within the same filgotinib dosing regimen are rejected, then the respective α/2 can be passed on to the other regimen’s h ypotheses, that is, all hypotheses in the other filgotinib dosing regimen will be tested at α level. Two safet y estimands, treatment policy and while on treatment, will be applied for the safety anal ysis."

Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis and characterized b y heterogeneous musculoskeletal phenotypes that involve multiple domains including the peripheral joints, axial skeleton, tendon and ligament insertion sites (enthesitis) and digits (dact ylitis). PsA occurs in approximately 30% of psoriasis patients {Gladman 2005}. In the majority of cases (75%) psoriasis precedes joint disease, but in some cases (15%) the onset is synchronous and in 10% arthritis precedes psoriasis. I n the latter, unrecognized psoriasis may be found or there may be a history of widespread guttate psoriasis in childhood or a strong famil y history {Ritchlin 2017 }. PsA occurs with equal frequency in males and females. The arthritis in PsA commonly involves distal joints and has the tendency to distribute in a ray pattern where all the joints of a single digit are more likely to be affected. The presence of erythema over affected peripheral joints, asymmetrical spinal involvement, and enthesitis are also ty pical features of PsA {Gladman 2005} . PsA belongs to the group of spondy loarthropathies with spondy litis being present in up to 40% of patients. The extra- articular features observed in PsA are similar to other spondy loarthropathies including mucous membrane lesions, iritis, urethritis, diarrhea and aortic root dilatation, and association with Human L eukocy te Antigen B27 ( HLA -B27) {Gladman 2005} . First-line treatment traditionally consists of NSAIDs and csDMARDs such as sulfasalazine (SSZ), methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF). These drugs remain a mainstay of therap y where there is limited access to biol ogical agents {Gossec 2012}. The arrival of anti- tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) agents over a decade ago dramaticall y increased the treatment armamentarium for PsA leading to improve d outcomes for both skin and joint disease {Gladman 2007, Mease 2006 }. Neve rtheless, anti - TNF agents do not work in all patients and response may diminish over time, partl y because of immunogenicit y {Mease 2013 }. Novel biologic agents with different mechanisms of action that target the interleukin(IL) -23 and IL- 17pathway s that promote skin and joint inflammation as well as or al agents including janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and the phosphodiesterase E4 inhibitor, apremilast, have recentl y become available as therapeutic options for PsA as well {Ritchlin 2016 }. Several key cytokines in the IL - 23 /IL-17 pathway s promote skin and joint inflammation through signaling via the JAK pathway . Activated JAKs recruit and activate signal transducer and activator of transcription (STATs) which in turn drive gene transcription {O'Shea 1997}. In December 2017, tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) became the first JAK inhibitor to receive Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) approval for the treatment of adult patients with PsA. Tofacitinib is a small molecule, has strong binding affinity for JAK1 and JAK3, and weaker affinity for JAK2. The extensive pre - clinical and clinical development programs demonstrated its mechanis ms of action via anti- inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. The drug proved to be efficacious in treating the signs and symptoms of PsA. However, the observed side effects and risk profile of tofacitinib are similar to those of several existing anti- rheumatic agents with cy topenias, elevated"

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 17 April 2020levels of liver function enzy mes, increased total cholesterol levels, with increase in LDL typicall y exceeding those for HDL, and increased risk for infections including serious and opportunistic infections. At higher doses, tofacitinib treatment was associated with anemia, which is thought to be linked to inhibition of JAK2 {Gladman 2017, Mease 2017}. While the pan- JAK inhibitor tofacitinib has shown an earl y onset of ac tion and long -term efficacy in PsA, limitations of therap y include side effects potentiall y mediated b y its effect on JAK2 and JAK3. This highlights the need for more selective and targeted therapies with improved immunomodulatory and hematologic effects. JAK1 is thought to be an integral part of PsA pathogenesis due its role in transmitting inflammatory cytokine signaling. Hence, targeted inhibition of JAK1 has great potential for the treatment of PsA with an improved safety and side effect profile. 1.2. Filgot inib 1.2.1. General Information Janus kinases are intracellular cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases (TYKs) that transduce cy tokine signaling from membrane receptors through STAT to the nucleus of cells. JAK inhibitors block the signaling of various cytokines, growth fac tors, and hormones, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL -6. Four different types of JAKs are known, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 which co- interact with different sets of membrane receptors. Inhibition of JAKs is a promising therapeutic option for a ran ge of inflammatory conditions including RA, ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD). Filgotinib (GS -6034, formerly GLPG0634) is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1. The compound has shown good preliminary efficacy inPsA {Mease 2018 },anky losing spondy litis {van der Heijde 2018 }, RA and CD patients in Phase 2(filgotinib IB) . In a Phase 3 RA study with subjects who failed prior biologic therap y,filgotinib achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints {Genovese 2018 }.Additionally , filgotinib is currently under assessment in ongo ing Phase 3 RA, UC, CD studies (clinicaltrials.gov). In humans, filgotinib is metabolized to form one major active metabolite GS -829845 (formerl yG254445). Though the potency of this metabolite is lower than the parent molecule, theoverall exposure and peak plasma concentration in humans is higher than seen in all tested animal species. As a consequence, dedicated pharmacology and toxicology studies have been performed with GS -829845. Results from pharmacody namics (PD) testing in he althy volunteers suggest that the clinical activity of filgotinib could result from the combination of the parent molecule and the metabolite. For further information on filgotinib, refer to the current investigator’s brochure (IB) for filgotinib."
19,page_19,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 17 April 20201.2.2. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Filgotinib and its metabolite, GS -829845 have been extensively characterized in nonclinical studies. This program includes cellular assay s demonstrating potency and selectivity of the compound against JAK1; efficacy studies in rats and mice; repeat dose toxicity studies (up to 26weeks in the rat and 39 weeks in the dog), in vitro and in vivo safet y pharmacology and genetic toxicology studies, and reproductive toxicology studies in rats and rabbits. Additional toxicol ogy studies conducted include phototoxicity studies and dose -range finding studies in support of a definitive rat juvenile toxicity study and a 6 month carcinogenicity study in transgenic (TgrasH2) mice. A 2 -year rat oral carcinogenicity study as well as t he pre -and post-natal development toxicity study in rats were completed . 1.2.2.1. Primary and Secondary Pharmacology Filgotinib is an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of JAK1. I t is highl y selective for inhibition of JAK1 over 451 other kinases evaluated in vitro. In cellular assay s, it inhibits JAK /STAT -driven processes with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values from 179 nM onwards . In human whole blood, JAK1 is inhibited by filgotinib with an I C50 of 629nM and exhibits approximately 30-fold selectivity over JAK2. Filgotinib demonstrated significant efficacy in the rat collagen -induced arthritis (CI A) model as well as in the mouse dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) - induced colitis model. Metabolite GS -829845 exhibits a similar JAK1 selectivity profile but is approximately 10 to 20-fold less potent than the parent filgotinib in in vitro assay s. GS - 829845 was as effective as filgotinib in the rat CIA model, but at doses that required a 10 -fold higher exposure. 1.2.2.2. Safety Pharmacology Filgotinib and GS -829845 had no effects on the respiratory system and central nervous s ystem (CNS )up to respectivel y 40-and 5 -fold the exposure in RA subjects g iven filgotinib 200 mg once dail y . Filgotinib and GS -829845 had no relevant effects on cardiovascular parameters (human ether -a-gogo related gene [hERG] and dog telemetry studies), apart from a slight non- adverse increase in heart rate and arterial pressur e with GS -829845 at exposures 7- fold that of the C max in subjects with RA treated with 200 mg once daily filgotinib. There were no relevant effects on (ECG) and QT. 1.2.2.3. Nonclinical Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion ( ADME ) Filgotinib demonstrates good oral bioavailability in mice, rats, dogs, and minipigs but less in monkey s. Plasma protein binding is low (<70%) in all species, including humans. The PK of filgotinib is generall y dose proportional without gender differences. No accumula tion occurs with repeated dosing. The mean terminal half -life after oral administration is 4 and 5 hours (h) in rats and dogs, respectively."
20,page_20,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 17 April 2020In the rat, filgotinib showed a rapid and even distribution throughout the body . High concentrations were observed only in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and urinary bladder. Filgotinib does not penetrate into CNS tissues. The distribution of filgotinib indicates some affinity for melanin- containing tissues. Excretion is nearly complete within 72 h (mouse), 24 h (rat) and 48 h (dog) post -dosing. In the mouse, an average of 54.0 and 37.7% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in feces and urine, respectivel y. In the rat, fecal and urinary excretion accounted for 40% and 59% of the administered dose, respectivel y. In bile -duct cannulated rats bile secretion of about 15%. In the dog, fecal excretion was the primary route of excretion, accounting for 59% of the administered dose, with urinary excretion accounting for 25%. In vitro metabolism studies in all species revealed one major metabolite (GS -829845). The formation of GS -829845 is mediated by carbox ylesterases (CES) and is not dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP). In vitro experiments have shown that drug- drug interactions with filgotinib and GS -829845 are unlik ely. There is no inhibition or induction of CYPs or uridine 5’ -disphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), and no relevant inhibition of key drug transporters, including the organic anion transporters (OATs) involved in the renal elimination of MTX, by filgotinib or GS-829845. 1.2.2.4. Nonclinical Toxicology In repeat oral dose toxicity studies in both rats and dogs, the primary target tissues identified for filgotinib were the l ymphoid tissues which areexpected based on the pharmacology of JAK inhibition. Additional filgotinib -related findings were observed in the male reproductive organs of both species, and in the incisor teeth of rats only. Effects on the l ymphoid sy stem were full y reversible. Testicular toxicity demonstrated partial reversibility ; however, sperm counts remained low. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical area under the curve ( AUC )of 2.80 μg∙h /mL, which represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when considering the mean AUC in male dogs at the no - observed- effect -levels (NOELs) in the 26 week and 39 week chronic toxicity studies, and the 39 week targeted exposure toxicity study , respectivel y. GS- 829845 related findings in general repeat dose toxicity studies were similar to those of the paren t filgotinib ; however, no testicular toxicity was noted following administration of GS-829845. Filgotinib and GS -829845 were non -genotoxic when evaluated in the bacterial mutagenicit y assay , the in vitro mouse ly mphoma mutagenicit y assay , and the rat bone marrow micronucleus assay ."

Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 17 April 2020In embry ofetal development studies, filgotinib and GS -829845 caused embry olethalit y and teratogenicit y in rats and rabbits at exposures similar to the human exposure at 200 mg once daily of filgotinib in subjects with RA. Administration of filgotinib did not affect female fertility , but impaired fertility was observed in male rats at exposures approximately 15 -fold the human exposure at 200 mg of filgotinib in subjects with RA. GS- 829845 did not have an y effects on fertility param eters in either male or female rats. In an in vitro phototoxicity study in 3T3 cells, the metabolite GS -829845 was positive for phototoxic potential and results with filgotinib were equivocal. A follow -up in vivo rat phototoxicity assay revealed a lack of phototoxic potential for both compounds. 1.2.3. Clinical Trials of Filgotinib Comprehensive data from the Phase 1 and 2 programs are available to support development into Phase 3. An overview of exposure and clinical studies conducted with filgotinib is available in the IB. Phase 2 Filgotinib PsA Study GLGP0634 -CL-224 (EQUATOR) The EQUATOR study was a randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 trial that enrolled adults with active moderate to severe PsA fulfilling Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis ( CASPAR ), active or documented history of plaque psoriasis, and an inadequate response or intolerance to at least one csDMARD. Subjects were randomized to receive either placebo or filgotinib 200 mg once dail y for 16 weeks. The primary objective o f the stud y was to evaluate efficacy of filgotinib compared to placebo at Week 16. The percentage of ACR20 responders was statistically significantl y higher in filgotinib group at Week 16 compared to placebo. Subjects with previous TNFi therapy had a similar ACR20 response compared to the rest of the stud y population. The percentage of ACR50 and 70responders was also statistically significantl y higher at Week 16 compared to placebo. A dose response was observed for all three parameters. Starting at Week 1 response was observed for ACR20 and ACR50 in the filgotinib group and remained statistically significantl y superior to placebo through Week 16. Subjects receiving filgotinib also demonstrated significantly higher clinical efficacy compared to placebo at We ek16 with additional PsA assessments including Disease Activity in Psoriatic Arthritis ( DAPSA ) score, Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria ( PsARC )response, PASDAS, and SPARCC Enthesitis I ndex. The filgotinib group achieved improvement in skin manifestat ions of disease as demonstrated by the PASI75 score and the pruritus numeric rating scale, both of which were statistically significantl y better than placebo at Week 16. Patient reported outcomes including the HAQ -DI, FACI T -Fatigue, and PsA related pain intensit y also improved with filgotinib at Week 16 compared to placebo."

Sixsubjects had an event that was grade 3 or 4. The most frequently occurring events were nasophary ngitis and headache, occurring at similar proportions in each group. One serious treatment -emergent AE was reported in each group (pneumonia [filgotinib] a nd hip fracture after a fall [placebo]). The SAE of pneumonia was a fatal event. No gastric perforations, malignancies, ly mphomas, venous thromboembolic events, opportunistic infections, or cases of active tuberculosis (TB) were reported. There was one cas e of herpes zoster confined to a single dermatome in the filgotinib group. The incidence of infections was similar between the two groups. Phase 3 Filgotinib RA Study GS -US-417-0302 (FINCH 2) FINCH 2 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, add -on, Phase 3 study in adult male and female subjects with active RA despite csDMARD(s) therap y (i.e.MTX, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide) who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to at least 1 bioDMARD. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either once dail y filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks all in the context of a stable dose of permitted csDMARD(s). The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an ACR20 response at Week 12. At Week 12, an ACR20 response was achieved by significantl y more subjects receiving filgotinib 200 mg or 100 mg than placebo (66.0, 57.5 and 31.1%, respectively ; both p<0.001). The reduction from Baseline in HAQ -DI at Week 12 was greater in the filgotinib 200 mg and 100mg groups compared to the placebo group ( -0.55 and -0.48 vs - 0.23, respectivel y; both p<0.001). Other key secondary endpoints, including SF -36v2 and FACIT -Fatigue, were also met at both filgotinib doses. The safet y profile was consistent with d ata from the Phase 2 studies with filgotinib. AE rates were similar for filgotinib 200 mg, filgotinib 100 mg and placebo groups (69.4% and63.4% vs 67.6%, respectively ) as were rates of serious adverse event s(SAEs) (4.1%, 5.2% and3.4%, respectivel y). The re were 4 cases of uncomplicated herpes zoster (2ineach filgotinib group). There was one non -serious AE of retinal vein occlusion in the filgotinib 200 mg group; no other venous thrombotic events were reported. Two adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE s) were reported: one subarachnoid hemorrhage in the placebo group and one my ocardial ischemia in the filgotinib 100 mg group. There were no cases of opportunistic infection /active TB, malignancy , GI perforation or death. 1.3. Ratio nale for This Study Therapeutic options for the treatment of PsA have increased dramatically over the past 15 years resulting in markedly improved outcomes for skin and joint disease {Gladman 2017, Mease 2017}. The arrival of anti -TNF agents represented a major treatment advance because these therapies are very effective for skin and all of the musculoskeletal domains of PsA. Despite of significant uptake in the use of anti -TNF agents, tolerability due to allergic and autoimmune reactions, loss of response due to immunogenicity and increased risk of infections / opportunistic infections remain problematic {Mease 2013 }. Agents with different mechanisms of action that"
23,page_23,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 17 April 2020target the IL -23 / IL-17 pathway s have recentl y become available. Use of these biological parenterall y administered agents has led to marked skin clearance, while musculoskeletal symptoms improvement, t he effect observed is similar to that with anti- TNF agents. Apremilast, an oral inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) offers modest response in the skin and joint symptoms with few safety signals. Therefore, there is still a need for simple, orall y admin istered agents with novel and targeted mechanisms of action that can effectively improve PsA outcome in all of its domains, and which are well -tolerated and have an acceptable safet y profile. Tofacitinib, an orall y administered JAK1 /JAK3 inhibitor, is ap proved for use in patients with PsA based on the data from two Phase 3 studies in subjects with PsA. I n the Phase 3 study evaluating tofacitinib versus placebo in subjects with active PsA and previous inadequate response to TNF inhibitors, the ACR20 responses were 50% with the 5 mg dose of tofacitinib as compared with 24% with placebo (p<0.001) after 3 months of treatment. In the Phase 3 study evaluating tofacitinib versus placebo and adalimumab in patients with active PsA and inadequate response to csDMARD s, the ACR20 response rate at month 3 was 50% in the 5mg tofacitinib group as compared with 33% in the placebo group (p = 0.01). Safet y results were similar across the two studies in regards to the number and category of AEs. Both studies reported cases o f herpes zoster, serious infections and malignancy in the subjects exposed to t ofacitinib {Gladman 2017, Mease 2017 }. The JAK1 selective inhibitor filgotinib targets an intracellular t yrosine kinase dy sregulated in subjects with inflammatory disorders including PsA. Filgotinib is a small molecule for oral dail y administration that demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating the signs and symptoms of active PsA in a Phase 2 study as well as other inflammatory disorders including RA. 1.3.1. Rationale for Study Design Study GS-US-431-4567 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of filgotinib administered once daily in subjects with active PsA, with prior inadequate response or intolerance to bioDMARDs (bioDMARD- IR). The study consists of 2parts: Part1: The Main Study is from Screening through the Week 16 V isit Part2: LTE immediatel y follows Part 1 and starts after the Week 16 Visit continuing for 2years Total study duration is ~ 2.25 years. The objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of filgotinib compared to placebo on the signs and s ymptoms, physical function, quality of life, and preservation of joint structure in PsA. Safety and tolerability of filgotinib will also be assessed."

The effect of filgotin ib on the arthr itis component is expected to be fast (in prev ious studies with filgotin ib in RA, ACR20 plateaued at Week 8). However, the effect on enthes itis and dacty litis requ ires longer duration of treat ment as observed in recently published studies with other compounds . The duration of placebo will be limited. All subjects in the placebo ann will be reallocated in a blinded maimer 1: 1 to 100 mg or 200 mg of filgotinib at Week 16. Given the slowly progress ive nature of PsA 16 weeks of placebo on accepted background therapy is cons idered both clinically and ethica lly appropr iate and allows an acceptab le time period in which to assess initial response to therapy . The use of placebo is critical in evaluating subject reported and subject ive outco mes, which can be highly variable and influenced by placebo therapy .

Rationale for Dose Selection Enrolled subjects will be randomized to receiv e filgotinib (100 mg or 200 mg)or placebo. The doses of filgotinib chosen for evaluation in this s tudy, 100 mg and 200 mg once dail y, are supported by a combination of safet y and efficacy data from Phase 1 and 2 studies in the clinical development program, and the known dose- pSTAT1 inhibition relationship of filgotinib. In two Phase 2a studies in subj ects with RA (Study GLPG0634- CL-201 and -202), dosing with filgotinib was well tolerated and achieved a high level of efficacy at a 200 mg dail y dose (ACR20 response of 75 -92% at Week 4). Administration of a higher filgotinib dose (300 mg) did not demonstrate greater efficacy , therefore, the highest dose to be tested in this study will be 200mg once dail y.In two Phase 2b studies, filgotinib at daily doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200mg, administered in addition to a background therap y with MTX (GL PG0634-CL-203) or as monotherap y (GLPG0634 -CL-204) was shown to be safe and efficacious in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active RA who had an inadequate response to MTX alone. In the Phase 2 PsA study (GLPG0634- CL-224 ), filgotinib 200 mg once dail y wa s well tolerated and achieved a high level of efficacy at a 200 mg dail y dose as well (ACR20 response rate of 80% at Week 16). Exposure -response anal ysis based on data from all Phase 2 studies indicated a dose -dependent increase in efficacy (ACR20 / 50 / 70, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28 ) [C-reactive protein (CRP )]), with a plateau at the 200 mg total daily dose on the dose -response curve. Additionall y, in Study GLPG0634 -CL-203, no statistically significant difference in efficacy was observed at 200mg da ily dose, administered as 200 mg once daily or 100 mg twice daily . These results are consistent with the relationship observed between filgotinib exposures and pSTAT1 activation (ex-vivo) following single and multiple filgotinib doses, where maximal inhibi tion of pSTAT1 (~78%) was achieved at or above 200 mg total daily dose and intermediate inhibition (~47%) at 100mg {Namour 2015}. Safety data collected across Phase 2 clinical studies showed no dose -dependent trends in the incidence of AEs or SAEs, including infections, or laboratory abnormalities with the exception of a numerical increase in select gastrointestinal AEs (eg, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and upper abdominal pain). This numerical increase wa s observed in the 200 mg compared to the 100mg dose. However, the overall frequency was low and clinical relevance is unknown. Filgotinib, administered at a dose of 100 mg or 200 mg dail y ,was found to be safe and well tolerated. The safet y profile was consistent with that observed for an immunomodulatory compound administered to subjects with RA. Overall, the 100 mg and 200 mg once dail y dos ingregimens have been proposed based on the known dose -pSTAT1 inhibition relationship of filgotinib and the clinica l experience (safet y and efficacy ) with PsA and RA subjects in Phase 2 studies. Inclusion of two doses in the proposed Phase 3 trials will enable establishment of an appropriate nominal dose for the treatment of PsA and determine the regimen with the most favorable risk / benefit profile in these populations."
26,page_26,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 17 April 20201.4. Risk /Benefit Assessment for the Study As of June 2018, 6605 subjects have received filgotinib either as single doses or multiple doses, and 1278 subjects have received daily filgotinib for > 1year. In general, filgotinib has been safe and well tolerat ed in all populations studied. In addition to PsA, large phase 3 programs in RA, CD and UC are currently ongoing as well. Nonclinical studies in rats and dogs identified the testes and ly mphoid tissue as target organs for filgotinib in long term repeat- dose toxicity studies. I n both species, histopathological changes in the testes included germ cell depletion and degeneration, with reduced sperm content and increased cell debris in the epididy mis and reduction in fertility in rats. The dog was determined to be the most sensitive species. A dose of 200 mg/day of filgotinib results in an estimated mean clinical AUC of 2.8 μg∙h / mL, which represents an exposure margin of 2.3, 1.8, and 3.4-fold when conside ring the mean AUC in male dogs at the NOELs in the 26 week and 39week chronic toxicity studies, and the 39 week targeted exposure toxicity study , respectivel y. Decreased l ymphocy tes observed in nonclinical studies have not been shown in clinical studies. Filgotinib has shown an increased risk of embry ofetal malformations at exposures similar to human doses; the use of highl y effective contraception in the subject population will be implemented in the study to mitigate this risk. No clinically relevant impa ct on cardiovascular parameters (including vital signs and ECG), respiratory or neurologic function has been observed in Phase 1 and 2 trials of filgotinib, including a dedicated Phase 1 study to evaluate the effect of filgotinib on the QT /QTc interval in healthy subjects. The QT study evaluated filgotinib at doses of 200 mg and 450 mg; neither dose led to prolongation in the QTc interval or was associated with clinically significant ECG changes. In Phase 2 trials in RA, filgotinib was well tolerated. In the RA studies (including the open label extension DARWIN 3), infections were reported more commonly in the filgotinib groups, including serious infections leading to hospitalization, and even death. The most common sy stem organ classes with AEs were infec tions and infestations, and GI disorders. Dose dependent decreases in the Phase 2b studies were observed in mean neutrophil counts and platelet counts (but mean changes in both remained within normal laboratory reference ranges) and there were no decreases in lymphocy tes or l ymphocyte subsets. Hemoglobin levels slightl y improved (increased) with filgotinib treatment, confirming that no anemia was induced. Mild and clinically insignificant serum creatinine increases were noted in both Phase 2b studies, with stabilization by Week 24. Neutrophil decreases (in the RA population) and a potential increased risk of infection may be considered risks consistent with the mechanism of JAK inhibition. Overall clinical findings and laboratory changes are consistent with selective JAK1 inhibition and based on Phase 2 data the expected benefit of using filgotinib as proposed in this study is considered to outweigh any associated risks."

Randomization, Blinding and Treatment Codes Final Amendment2 An Interact ive Voice/ Web R espo nse System (IXRS) will be used to mana ge subject randomization and treatment assignments. It is the respons ibility of the investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible for the study prior to enro llment. Randomization scheme for each Main Study's transit ion to the LTE is outlined in Section 3.2. Study drug assigmnents either at Baseline or at LTE will be maintain ed in a blinded fashion within the IXRS. Subjects and Investigators will be kept blinded to the results of the CRP test at all visits. Sponsor will be blinded to CRP results in the Main Study only, except the Day 1 Visi t. T and B lymphocyte and natura l killer (TBNK ) results will be blinded to subjects and Investigators at all visits. Individual s in Clinical Packa ging and Labeling or Clinical Supply Mana gement who have an Unblind ed Inventory Mana ger role in the IXRS syste m for purposes of study drug inventory mana gement, and individ uals in Phannaco vigilance and Epidemiolo gy (PYE) respons ible for safety signal detect ion, and / or expe dited report ing of suspecte d unexpecte d serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) to regu latory author ities may be m1blinded to individual case data and / or group level smmnari es. Contract research organ ization (CRO) biostat istician s and progra1mners will be unblinded for the DMC data reviews. 5.1.1. Procedures for Breaking Treatment Codes In the event of a medi cal emergency where break ing the blind is required to prov ide medi cal care to the subject, the invest igator may obtain treatment assigmnent directly from the IXRS syste m for that subject. Gilead reco1mnends, but does not require, that the investigator contact the Gilead Medi cal Monitor or designee before break ing the blind. Treatment assigmnent shou ld remain blinded unless that knowle dge is necessary to detennine subject emergency medi cal care. The rationale for unblinding must be clearly explained in source documentat ion and on the electro nic case report fonn ( eCRF), along with the date on which the treatment assigmnent was unblinded. The invest igator is requeste d to contact the Gilead Medi cal Monitor or designee promptly in case of any treatment unblinding. If a subject's treatment assigmnent is dis closed to the investigator due to a medi cal emergency, the subject will have study treatment discontinu ed. CON FIDENT IAL Page 46 17 April 2020"

After the Week 16Visit , subject's dose of concomitant medications fo r PsA can be reduced or tapered based on investigator judgement. The dose may be adjusted back up as needed but should not exceed the stable dose identified on Day 1. Please note that certain PsA concomitant medications such as antimalarial drugs, s ystemic corticosteroids, and NSAIDs, as well as certain non -PsA related medications such as beta blockers, lithium, and ACE inhibitors, can cause dermatitis or exacerbate psoriasis. 5.3.1.1. PsA Rescue Therap y Investigators should perform an ongoing assessment of a subjec t’s need for rescue therapy beginning at the Week 16 Visit through the completion of the study .Sites will be assist edwith this by receiving a one -time alert at the Week 16 Visit for s ubjects with <20% improvement from Day 1 in the TJC68 or SJC66 (these s ubjects are referred to as inadequate responders) . At that time, it will be required to modify thesubject’s concomitant medication(s) by adjusting the dose of existing medication(s) and / or introducing new medication(s) based on investigator judgement along with consideration of the subject’s medical history (e.g. comorbidities, history of concomitant medications, etc.). After the Week 16 Visit investigators will not receive an alert for subjects with <20% improvement; however, clinical judgement should be used to decide if the subject is not clinically improving and requires rescue therap y. The following medic ations are recommended as rescue therap y options to add or modify after Week 16: NSAI Ds, opiate analgesics, csDMARDs, corticosteroids, and bioDMARDs. Subjects must discontinue study at the time of bioDMARD initiation. Starting at the Week 24Visit, subje cts who have <10% improvement from Day 1 in the TJC68 or SJC66 at two consecutive visits despite stable background PsA therap y should discontinue both study drug and study and adjust any PsA treatment as deemed appropriate by the investigator. Sites willbeassist ed with this by receiving a discontinuation of study alert when subjects reach this threshold at any time from the Week 24 Visit through the end of the study . In cases where a subject has had recent modification of PsA therap y requiring time for further assessment, t he investigator should use clinical judgement to decide if subjects should continue study drug and stud y despite receiving the discontinuation alert . Subjects who discontinue study drug at any point during the LTE should also exit the study . 5.3.1.2. Special Circumstances for Corticosteroids , Hyaluronate Therap y,and Biologics At any time during the study if there is a need for the use of ad ditional corticosteroids (oral, parenteral, inhaled or other) for the treatment of an AE (e.g. asthma exacerbation, allergy , or anaph ylaxis reaction, etc.), it should be discussed with the Gilead Medical Monitor or its designee in advance, as much as possible, as well as the possible discontinuation of study drug and/or the study .

Assessments that need specific attention are described in the text that follows. The investigator must document an y deviation from protocol procedures and notify the Sponsor or designee. 6.1. Part1 –Main Study (Screening through Week 16 Visit) 6.1.1. Screening Visit Entry into screening does not guarantee enrollment into the study . In order to manage the total trial enrollment, Gilead, at its sole discretion, may suspend screening and /or enrollment at an y site or trial -wide at any time. Subjects will be screened ≤28daysbefore randomization to determine eligibility for participation in the st udy. Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Procedures Table (Appendix 2). Prior to any assessments being performed ,a written consent must be obtained. Subjects meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will return to the clinic ≤ 28 day s after screening for randomization into the study . 6.1.2. Day 1Visit Study assessments will be completed as specified in the Study Procedures Table ( Appendix 2). At the end of the visit, subjects will be randomized. Refer to Appendix 7for how day s of treatment are numbered. Subjects will be randomly allocated to a dosing group according to a pre -specified randomization scheme prepared b y an independent statistician. Once confirmed eligible for the study, subjects will be randomized using a computerized IXRS system. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, con current use of csDMARDs and / or apremilast at randomization (yes or no), and prior use of bioDMARD(s) (one prior bioDMARD or >1prior bioDMARDs use). For each subject at each visit, the clinic will contact the IXRS sy stem and for the appropriate kit numbe r to be dispensed. The kit will contain the relevant study drugs for the period until the next dispensation visit. Females of child bearing potential will be provided at -home pregnancy tests for use at the Safet y Follow -up Visit or as needed."

Definitions of Adverse Events, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse Events 7.1.1. Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal product ,which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with th e treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and / orunintended sign, sy mptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre -or post-treatment complicati ons that occur as a result of protocol specified procedures, lack of efficacy , overdose, drug abuse /misuse reports , or occupational exposure . Pre-existing events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE does not include the following: Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy , tooth extraction, andtransfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be reported Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before the Screening Visit that do not worsen Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g.hospitalization for elective surgery, social a nd /or convenience admissions) Overdose without clinical sequelae (see Sectio n7.7.1 ) Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not an AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history e CRF. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following: Death Life-threatening ( NOTE : The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the ev ent; it does not refer to an event that h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)"
63,page_63,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 17 April 2020In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y A congenital anomal y /birth defect A medicall y important event or reaction: such events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes constituting SAEs. Med ical and scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is a reportable under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; and development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal product will be considered a medicall y important event an d subject to expedited reporting requirements. 7.1.3. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance are not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities (e .g.clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis) that require medical or surgical intervention or lead to study drug interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. I n addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiogram, X-rays, vital signs) that are associated with signs and /or sy mptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a sy ndrome, record th e syndrome or diagnosis (e .g. anemia), not the laboratory result (i .e.decreased hemoglobin). For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities in this study , please refer to Section 7.5. 7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments. 7.2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drugs and Procedures The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug therapy using clinical judgment and the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug . For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e .g. pre -existing condition, underl ying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medicati on). Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational medicinal product."
64,page_64,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 17 April 2020It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y related in the context of AE reporting. The rela tionship to study procedures (e.g. invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) should be assessed using the following considerations: No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure. Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures, (e .g. veni puncture ) 7.2.2. Assessment of Severity The severit y of AEs will be graded using the modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ), version 5.0. For each episode, the highest grade attained should be reported. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the investigator should use the grade or adjectives: Grade 1(mild), Grade 2(moderate), Grade 3 (severe), Grade 4 (life-threatening) or Grade 5(fatal /death ) to describe the maximum intensity of the adverse event. For purposes of consistency with the CTCAE, these intensity grades are defined in Table 7-1below. Table 7-1. Grading of Adverse Event Severity Grade Adjective Description Grade 1 MildAsymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2 ModerateLocal or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL * Grade 3 SevereSevere or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL** Grade 4 Life-threatening Urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Fatal/ Death Fatal/ Death related AE Activities of Daily Living (ADL) * Instrumental ADL refer to opening preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. ** Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R eference_8.5x11.pdf The only modificati on to the CTCAE criteria is the addition of a Grade 1 upper respiratory infection outlined in Table 7-2below."

Refer to S ection 7.3and the eCRF completion guidelines for full instructions on the mechanism of pregnancy reporting. The pre gnancy itself is not considered an AE nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reasons. Any premature termination of pregnancy (e. g. a spontaneous abortion, an induced therapeutic abortion due to complications or other m edical reasons) must be reported within 24 hours as an SAE. The underl ying medical reason for this procedure should be recorded as the AE term. A spontaneous abortion is alway s considered to be an SAE and w ill be reported as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2. F urthermore, an y SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy outcome post study must be reported to Gilead PVE . The subject should receive appropriate monitoring and care until the conclusion of the pregnancy . The outcome should be reported to Gilead PVE using the pregnancy outcome report form. If the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been completed, the outcome should be reported directl y to Gilead PVE . Gilead PVE contact information is as follows: Email: and Fax: Pregnancies of female partners of male stud y subjects exposed to Gilead or other study drugs must also be reported and relevant information should be submitted to Gilead PVE using the pregnancy and pregnancy outcome forms within 24 hours. Monitoring of the subject should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy .

Data Handling Conventions Values for missing safety laboratory data will not be imputed. If no baseline laboratory value is available, the baseline value will be assumed to be normal (i.e. no grade [Grade 0]) for the summary of graded laboratory abnormalities. If the safet y laboratory results for a subject are missing for an y reason at a time point, the subject will be excluded from the calculation of summary statistics for that time point. Laboratory data that are continuous in nature but are less than the lower limit of quantitation or above the upper limit of quantitatio n will be imputed to the value of the lower or upper limit minus or plus one significant digit, respectivel y (e.g. if the result of a continuous laboratory test is <20, a value of 19 will be assigned; if the result of a continuous laboratory test is <20.0, a value of 19.9 will be assigned). 8.4. Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline measurements will be summarized using standard descriptive methods – 8- number summary (n, mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and the number and percentage of subjects per category for categorical variables. Demographic summaries will include sex, race, ethnicity and age. Baseline characteristics will include randomization stratification factors, serum CRP, joint counts, HAQ -DI, and other variables of interest. 8.5. Efficacy Analysis All continuous efficacy endpoints will be summarized using 8 -number summary (n, mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum) by treatment group. All categorical efficacy endpoints will be summarized with the number and percentage of subjects who meet the endpoint or category definition by treatment group. Besides the efficacy analy ses specified in the protocol, sensitivity anal yses may be performed for the efficacy assessments.

Primary Estimand The primary estimand corresponding to the treatment policy strategy is defined by the 4attributes below: 1)Population: subjects in the FAS 2)Variab le/endpoint: binary ACR20 response variable at Week 12indicating if a subject meets the ACR20 response criteria at Week 12. 3) Accounting for intercurrent events: include all on- study data regardless of protocol violations, use of rescue medication, change in background medication, and study drug discontinuation. 4)Population -level summary: the treatment difference in the percentage of subjects meeting ACR20 response criteria between each filgotinib group and the placebo group. 8.5.1.2. Main Estimator A logistic regre ssion analy sis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model will be used to anal yze the primary endpoint. For subjects who do not have sufficient measurements to establish efficacy at Week 12, their data will be imputed using multiple imputation assuming that missing data are missing at random (MAR) . Sensitivity analy ses to evaluate the robustness of results to violations of any assumptions made regarding the data missingness mechanisms will be specified in the SAP. 8.5.2. Secondary Analyses 8.5.2.1.

Thekey secondary endpoints are listed in Section 3.1.2. For the binary endpoints, the population -level summary is the treatment difference in the percentage of subjects meeting specified criteria for response between each filgotinib group and the placebo group. For the continuous endpoints, the population -level summary is the mean treatment difference between each filgotinib group and the placebo group. 8.5.2.2. Estimator For a superiorit y test of each filgotinib group compared to the placebo group on a binary efficacy endpoint, a logistic regression analy sis with treatment groups and stratification factors in the model will be used."

Pregnancy Precautions, Definition for Female of Childbearing Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements The administration of filgotinib in embry o-fetal animal development studies resulted in decreased numbers of viable rat fetuses, increased resorptions, and visceral and skeletal malformations. Similar effects wer e noted in the rabbit. A safet y margin relative to human exposure has not been identified. Pregnancy is contraindicated during use of filgotinib. For participation in this study , all subjects of childbearing potential must agree to the use of highly effective contraception as outlined below. In addition, women of childbearing potential should have a urine pregnancy test every 4weeks during the stud y. 1)Definitions a.Definition of Childbearing Potential For the purposes of this study , a female born subject is considered of childbearing potential following the initiation of pubert y (Tanner stage 2) until becoming post -menopausal, unless permanentl y sterile or with medically documented ovarian failure. Wome n are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are >54years of age with cessation of previously occurring menses for >12 months without an alternative cause. In addition, women of an y age with amenorrhea of >12months may also be considered postmenopausal if their follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level is in the postmenopausal range (as defined b y central laboratory reference ranges) and they are not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y. Permanent sterilization include s hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectom y, or bilateral salpingectomy in a female subject of an y age. Bilateral tubal ligation is not considered permanent sterilization. Women who do not meet below criteria for being post -menopausal, are not permanentl y steri le, or do not have medically documented ovarian failure must have pregnancy testing as outlined by the protocol. Investigator and the Sponsor may re-evaluate asubject’s childbearing potential during the study (including the use of FSH values if appropriat e). b.Definition of Male Fertility For the purposes of this study , a male born subject is considered fertile after the initiation of puberty unless permanently sterile b y bilateral orchidectomy or medical documentation of permanent male infertility. Vasectom y alone is not considered permanent sterilization."
96,page_96,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 17 April 20202)Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects a.Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception Filgotinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as there is a possibility of human teratogenicit y /fetotoxicity in early pregnancy based on non- clinical data. Data from a drug -drug interaction study of filgotinib and hormonal contraceptives demonstrated that filgotinib does not alter the pharmacokinetics of representative hormonal contraceptives levonorgest rel/ethiny l estradiol. For male subjects, male condom should be used; for their female partners of childbearing potential, an accepted contraceptive method should also be considered. Details are outlined below. Please refer to the latest version of the f ilgotinib investigator’s brochure for additional information. b.Contraception for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highl y effective contraceptive measures. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on the Day 1 Visit prior to randomization. Pregnancy tests will be performed at monthly intervals thereafter. In the event of a delay ed menstrual period (>one month between menstruations), a pregnancy test must be performed to rule out pregnancy . This is true even for women of childbearing potential with infrequent or irregular periods. Female subjects must agree to use one of the following methods from Screening until 35days following the last dose of study drug. Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential (e.g. heterosexual intercourse). Abstinence is an acceptable method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual lifesty le. Or Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below (asapproved and available per local standards): Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year Tubal sterilization Essure micro- insert system (provided confirmation of success 3 months after procedure) (Not approved in Japan) Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and had confirmation of surgical success at least 3 months after procedure, with documentation of sperm- free ejaculate)"
97,page_97,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 98 17 April 2020These above described methods are considered preferred methods of highly effective contraception in this protocol. Female subjects who wish to use a hormonall y based method must agree to use it in conjunction with a barrier method (used either b y the female subject or b y her male partner) . Female subjects who utilize a hormonal contraceptive as one of their birth control methods must have consistently used the same method for at least three months prior to study dosing . Hormonally -based contraceptives and barrier methods permitted for use in this protocol are as follows: Hormonal methods (subject must agree to use with a barrier method, preferably , with a male condom) Oral contraceptives (either combined estrogen / progestin or progesterone only ) Injectable progesterone (Not approved in Japan) Subdermal I mplants of levonorgestrel (Not approved in Japan) Transdermal contraceptive patch (Not approved in Japan) Contraceptive vaginal ring Barrier methods (subject must agree to use with a hormonal method) Male or female condom (with or without spermicide) Diaphragm with spermicide (Not approved in Japan) Cervical cap with spermicide (Not approved in Japan) Sponge with spermicide (Not approved in Japan) All female subjects must also agree to refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization during study participation and for at least 35 daysafter the last study drug dose. 3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects It is theoreticall y possible that a relevant s ystemic conce ntration may be achieved in a female partner from exposure to the male subject’s seminal fluid. Therefore, male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use condoms during study participation and for 90days after the last stud y drug dose. Female partners of male stud y subjects should consider using one of the above methods of contraception as well. Male subjects must also agree to refrain from sperm donation during treatment and until at least 90 days after the end of dosing."
98,page_98,"Filgotinib Protocol GS -US-431-4567 Final Gilead Sciences, Inc. Amendment 2 CONFIDENTIAL Page 99 17 April 20204) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides onl y, and lactational amenorrhea metho d (LAM). Female condom and male condom should not be used together. 5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy Subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator if they become pregnant at any time during the study , or if they become pregnant within 35 days of last study drug dose. Subjects who become pregnant or who suspect that they are pregnant during the st udy must report the information to the investigator and discontinue all the study drugs immediately . These subjects will be asked to continue in the study without taking stud y drug through the completion of the main study . Male subjects whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is pregnant during the study or up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug are to report the information to the investigator. Instructions for reporting pregnancy , partner pregnancy , and pregnancy outcome are outlined in Section 7.7.2.1. 6)Pregnancy Testing All females of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy testing every 4weeks during the dosing period through the Safet y Follow -up Visit (28 -35days after their last dose of study drug). During the periods where study visits are every 6-8weeks, women should continue to have pregnancy tests every 4weeks, using home pregnancy urine tests that will be provided to them. The site will call the subject every 4weeks to obtain results of these pregnancy tests and will record the in formation in the source documents and eCRF .If a positive urine pregnancy test is reported, the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for a confirmatory serum pregnancy test."

Acute dactylitis has been shown to be a clinical indicator of disease severity in PsA; conversely, chronic, non-tender diffuse dactylitic swelling may be less clinically significant (2) Dactylitis is due to inllammation in the maJority of tissues in the digit- the tendon sheaths, Joints, bones and soft-tissues in between (3). Recurrent dactylitis, often in the same digit(s), may be the only clinical manifestation of PsA The only validated tool for assessing dactylitis is the Leeds Dactylometer (4). The validity of this instrument has been assessed using the OMERACT filter . The instrument and tool ave demonstrated good evidence of respons· , ess in a clinical trial (5) In addition, the instrum t incorporates a definition of dactyliti s: J a 10% difference In the ratio of circumfere ?e o Fie affected digit to the contralateral digit}.

How to use the Leeds Dacty""lom eter The fingers and toes are visually inspected by the examiner. Those digits which look dactylitic are measured 2 Slip the loop of the Dactylometer around the base of the digit adjacent to the web space Pull the indicator strip tight so that the base of the digit blanches slightly (see illustration) The collar of the device should be finnly pressed againstthe base of the digit, as illustrated. 3. Record the circumference in mm on the Dactyl om eter record sheet 4 Repeat the procedure on the contral ateral digit 5 If both ipsilateral and contralateral digits are thought to be dact,1ilic then use the reference range (given at the foot or the sheet) as the comparator Only record the digits with a 10% difference in circumference 7.
