Study Population Number of Patients : Approximately 150 patients will be randomized at approximately 20 centers in the United States . Condition/Disease : Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM- 5) criteria for IED. Key Inclusion Criteria : Diagnosis of current IED according to the DSM- 5 criteria, as solicited by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5, Clinical Trials Version (SCID-5-CT). Patients must have at least 3 IED days (at least 1 IED episode each day , as recorded by the patient using the ) per week for the 2 consecutive weeks directly preceding baseline with 70% compliance during that time frame , as assessed by the investigator. Patients must have a score ≥ 12 on the Life History of Aggression scale at screening, a score ≥ 6 on the Overt Aggression Scale – Modified (OAS- M) Total Irritability at screening and baseline, and a score ≥ 4 on the modified Clinical Global Impressio n of Severity for IED (mCGI -S) at screening and baseline. Key Exclusion Criteria: Patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder within 6 months of screening, patients with significant symptoms of a depressive disorder or with a Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ-9) score ≥ 10 at screening, and patients who meet only the DSM-5 A2 criterion for IED will be excluded. Patients with a lifetime history of sc hizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, antisocial personality disorder, neurocognitive disorder, or mental retardation (DSM- 5 criteria) will be excluded; patients with recurrent IED episodes that are better explained by another mental dis order or attributable to another medical condition (e.g., head trauma, Alzheimer’s disease) or to the physiological effect of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) will be excluded (DSM- 5 criteria). A complete list of inclusion/exclusion criter ia is presented in Section 4 of the protocol. Study Design Structure: This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled parallel design study with 2 treatment groups (AVP-786 and placebo). Duration: Randomized p atients will participate in the study for approximately 17 weeks, with a screening period up to 4 weeks and a 12-week double-blind treatment period. All patients will receive a safety follow -up telephone contact 7 days after the last dos e of study drug. Study Treatment: The investigational product is AVP -786 (deudextromethorphan hydrobromide [d6-DM]/quinidine sulfate [Q]) capsules. Dosing will start with d6 -DM 28 mg/Q 4.9 mg (AVP-"
9,page_9,"AVAN IR Pharmaceuticals Protocol 17- AVP-786-206 AVP-786 Version 1.2 IND 133049 10 786-28/4.9) that will be titrated over a 2-week period to d6-DM 42.63 mg /Q 4.9 mg (AVP-786- 42.63/4.9) twice daily (BID). Control: Placebo capsules appearing identical to AVP-786 will be used as the control. Randomization: Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 to receive AVP -786 or placebo (1:1 ratio stratified by study site ) for 12 weeks. Dose Regimen : Patients randomized to receive AV P-786 will be titrated up to a dose of AVP- 786-42.63/4.9 BID by Day 15. On Day 1 after all predose assessments have been completed, the first dose of study drug will be ingested in the clinic, in the presence of study site personnel. Beginning on Day 1, patients randomized to AVP-786 will ingest a dose of A VP-786-28/4.9 and a dose of placebo for 7 days. Beginning on Day 8, patients will ingest a dose of AVP -786-28/4.9 capsules BID for 7 days, and beginning on Day 15, patients will ingest a dose of AVP -786- 42.63/4.9 BID for the remaining 10 weeks of treatment. If the patient cannot tolerate AVP -786- 42.63/4.9 BID, a one- time down titration to AVP-786-28/4.9 BID will be allow ed between Days 16 and 43; these patients will remain at the AVP-786-28/4.9 BID dose for the remainder of the study. Patients randomized to receive placebo will ingest placebo BID for 12 weeks. Patients requiring a dose- adjustment between Days 16 and 43 w ill return to the study site for an unscheduled visit to perform safety assessments. The patient should ingest study drug orally BID with water, 1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening approximately 12 (± 4) hours apart. The time of dosing should be consistent throughout the study and must be recorded on the study drug diary. Assessments and Visits Patients will attend clinic visits at scre ening, baseline ( Day 1), and Days 15 (Week 2), 29 (Week 4), 43 (Week 6), 57 (Week 8), 71 (Week 10), and 85 ( Week 12). On Day 8 (Week 1), a safety telephone contact will be performed to assess adverse events ( AEs) and query regarding concomitant medications . A safety follow -up telephone contact, to assess AEs, will be performed 7 days after the last dose of study drug. During screening and double- blind treatment, patients will record information regarding their IED episodes using the . Study procedures will be performed at each visit as outlined in the Schedule of Evaluations and Visits (Table 1). Response Measures Primary Efficacy Measure: OAS -M - Total Aggression Secondary Efficacy Measures : • OAS-M - Total Irritability • OAS-M - individual items for Aggression and Irritability • – IED days, IED episodes, IED severity, and patient’s distress"

Pregnancy tests will be conducted for females of childbearing potential only. Pharmacokinetics Plasma concentrations of d6- DM, Q, and certain metabolites will be measured; General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses Analysis P opulations Three analysis populations will be evaluated including the modified intent- to-treat (mITT), per - protocol (PP), and safety populations. mITT – The mITT population will include all patients who ingest at least 1 dose of study medication and have at least 1 postbaseline primary efficacy assessment; this population will be used for all efficacy analyses. Patients in the mITT population will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of the treatment received. PP – The PP population will include all patients with no significant protocol deviation that may impact the efficacy evaluations. Patients in the PP population will be included in the treatment group based on the actual treatment received. Safety – The safety p opulation part of the safety analyses will include all patients who ingest study medication . Patients in the safety population will be included in the treatment group based on the actual treatment received and all the safety measures will be analyzed and s ummarized by treatment group."
11,page_11,"AVAN IR Pharmaceuticals Protocol 17- AVP-786-206 AVP-786 Version 1.2 IND 133049 12 Efficacy Analysi s The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline to Week 12 in the OAS- M Total Aggression score. The treatment effect will be analyzed using a likelihood -based linear mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) on observed data. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, baseline -by-visit interaction, and baseline value. The OAS -M Total Aggression scores are highly skewed and, in general, not normally-distributed; a log -transformation will be applied first before using the MMRM. T he analysis on the original scale will be the sensitivity analysis. Detailed analyses will be specified in the statistical analysis plan prior to unblinding the stu dy. The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the change from baseline to Week 12, and will be analyzed in a similar manner to the primary endpoint or as appropriate. Sample Size Calculation Sample size calculation was performed bas ed on the results of a 12- week study of fluoxetine vs. placebo in patients with IED.1 The observed OAS- M aggression score effect size was approximate 0.45 taking into account a 45% discontinuation rate. For the current study, the planned sample size of 150 patients (75 per group) will have approximately 80% power to detect a treatment effect size of 0.45 in the comparison of AVP-786 vs. placebo with a 2- sided type I error α=0.05. If the effect size is assumed to be 0.50, the power is approximately 85%."

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Samples of the efficacy and safety scales and questionnaires to be used during double-blind treatment are attached as Appendices . The proper and consistent administration of the rating scales is critical to the study objectives. In order to ensure the collection of high quality data, all study raters will receive training in the proper administration of the rating scales. In addition to training, raters must be certified in order to administer the L ife History of Aggression, SCID-5-CT, OAS-M, mCGI-S and mCGI- C rating scales. Training and certification will be documented and updated as necessary. Raters must be approved by the sponsor or designee before administering the scales. Ongoing surveillance and remediation will be conducted to ensure that rater competenc y and consistency is maintained throughout the study. Whenever possible, each patient should have the rating scales administered by the same raters throughout the study, for consistency of ratings. Patients will provide written consent to allow audio recordings of the applicable study assessments ( at any time, the patient may withdraw consent to allow these recordings); all efforts will be taken to maintain confidentiality of the patient. 6.1. Screening Assessments CTSdatabase and Subject Database Authorization: Clinical trial registries, such as CTSdatabase, seek to reduce duplicate enrollment by identifying duplicates before randomization. At the time of providing the Informed Consent for the study, the Investigator or designee will explain the IR B-approved Subject Database Authorization to the patient and witness the signature. During screen, site staff that have received training and login information access to www.ctsdatabase.com will enter the patient study ID and authorized patient identifiers. An immediate report detailing matches will be generated and should be printed for source documentation. The report will specify either (1) no matches found, (2) a match was found with a subject participating in another study within 30 days or (3) the pa tient matches with a subject who has pre- screened at another site. At the last patient contact, CTSdatabase staff will automatically close out subjects ( early termination or completer) based on IW RS. Life History of Aggression Scale: This is a 5-item scale (Appendix 3) to assess aggression, consequences/antisocial behavior and self-directed aggression, rated on a 6-point scale (0 to 5). 15 The Life History of Aggression Scale total score is considered a reliable and valid measure of a life history of overt aggr ession. Patients must have a score ≥ 12 on this scale at screening to continue study participation. A trained, certified clinician will administer the scale at screening only. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9): The PHQ -9 is a 9-item, patient self-rated questionnaire (Appendix 4) that is specific to depressio n.16 The PHQ-9 will be used, in the current study, as a screening assessment to exclude patients with significant depressive symptoms; those with a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 points at screening will be excluded from further study participation. The questionnaire will be completed by the patient (administered by a trained rater) at screening only."

Efficacy Assessments 6.2.1. Overt Aggression Scale - Modified (OAS -M) The OAS -M is a clinical -administered instrument ( Appendix 6) that was designed to assess various manifestations of aggressive behavior in outpatients.18 The version used in the current study was designed to evaluate the severity, type, and frequency of aggressive behavior and was adapted from 2 established instruments (Overt Aggression Scale, a scale used to assess single episodes of aggression in hospitalized psychiatric patients, and the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia). T he OAS-M evaluates 2 domains – aggression and irritability. The OAS -M aggression domain includes the following 4 items: verbal assault, assault against objects, assault against others, and assault a gainst self. Each response will be scored using a 6-point scale (0 = no events within that category to 5 = most severe form of assault within that category). The rater determines the frequency of each response (item) during the past week and the frequency of each item is multiplied by the severity level (0 to 5) that produces a raw score; this raw score is multiplied by a severity weight for that item (verbal assault x 1, assault against objects x 2, assault against others x 3, and assault against self x 3). The weighted individual item scores are added to obtain the OAS -M Total Aggression score. The severity weights were added to reduce the influence of lower severity aggressive behaviors on an overall assessment of aggression. The OAS -M irritability domain includes the following 2 global assessment items: global subjective irritability and global overt irritability. Each response will be scored using a 6-point scale (0 = not at all to 5 = extreme). The 2 scores are added to create the OAS -M Total Irritability score (score range = 0 to 10). Patients must have a n OAS-M Total Irritability score ≥ 6 at screening and baseline to qualify for randomization (at least a moderate degree of subjective irritability and overt irritability). The OAS-M includes information regarding the number of DSM-5 A1 aggressive episodes and the number of DSM-5 A2 aggressive episodes experienced by the patient during the past week. The number of discrete IED episodes will be calculated after an interview with the patient and will be defined in accordance with t he definition provided in DSM-5 2 and OAS -M Manual. Episodes identified as discrete must be separated by at least 30 minutes; episodes separated by less than 30 minutes will be considered a single ep isode, as defined in the OAS- M Manual. The OAS -M will be administered by a trained, certified clinician at screening and baseline (predose on Day 1), and Days 15 (Week 2), 29 (Week 4), 43 (Week 6), 57 (Week 8), 71 (Week 10), and 85 ( Week 12) or early termination . This scale should be administered by the"

The will be reviewed by the clinician before the OAS -M is scored, in order to ensure that the rating s reflect a thorough assessment of the patient’s IED symptoms . 6.2.3. Modi fied Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scales The CGI was developed to provide a brief, stand- alone assessment of the clinician’s view of the patient’s global functioning prior to and afte r initiating a study medica tion.19 The Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit version of the CGI is the most widely used format of this validated tool, and asks that the clinician rate the patient relative to their past experience with other patients with the same diagnosis, with or without collateral information .20 The CGI scales are quick to administer, provided that the clinician knows the patient well. Reliability and validity of CGI have been tested in multiple studies, including patients with dementia, schizophrenia, and affective disorders .21,22 Overall, CGI showed high correlation (r: ~90%) with other assessment instruments, and it has also shown positive significant relationships and concurrent validity with other clinician’s rating. In addition, the scale has good sensitivity to change over time . Patients with IED have marked impairment in aggression, anger, and irritabili ty, and global assessments may not be sensit ive to specific changes in these symptoms . In this study, t he CGI scales have been modified for IED , and the clinician is explicitly instructed to rate the severit y (mCGI-S) or change (mCGI -C) in the patient’s IED symptoms, aggression, anger and irritability, to ensure that the global ratings specifically evaluate the target symptoms."

Modified Clinical Global Impression of Severity for IED (mCGI-S) The mCGI-S (Appendix 8) is a modified version of the CGI- S scale that provides a global evaluation of the patient’s IED symptoms (e.g., aggression, anger, and irritability).19 The mCGI-S is used to measure severity of the patient’s symptoms from the clinician’s perspective in the context of other patients with IED. The mCGI -S responses will be scored on a 7- point scale (1 = normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the most extremely ill patients ). The mCGI -S will be administered by a trained, certified clinician at screenin g, baseline (predose on Day 1), and Days 43 (Week 6) and 85 ( Week 12) or early termination . At these visits, the OAS-M will be administered (when applicable) will be reviewed before this scale is scored, in order to ensure that the rating reflects a thorough assessment of the patient’s IED symptoms . The patient must have a mCGI -S score ≥ 4 (at least moderately ill) at screening and baseline to qualify for randomization. 6.2.3.2. Modified Clinical Global Im pression of Change for IED (mCGI-C) The mCGI-C (Appendix 9) is a modified version of the CGI- C scale.19 The clinician will rate the overall global change in the patient’s IED symptoms (e.g., aggression, anger , and irritability ) from baseline at the sch eduled double-blind visits. The mCGI-C responses will be scored using a 7-point scale (1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worse; 6 = much worse; 7 = very much worse). The mCGI -C will be complete d by a trained, certified clinician on Days 43 (Week 6) and 85 (Week 12) or early termination . At these visits, the OAS -M will be administered and the will be reviewed before this scale is scored, in order to ensure that the rating reflects a thorough assessment of the patient’s IED symptoms. 6.2.4. Modified Patient Global Impression of Severity for IED ( mPGI-S) The mPGI -S (Appendix 10) is a single-question scale that will ask patients to rate the overall global severity of their IED symptoms (e.g., aggression, anger, and irritability) using a 7-point scale (1 = normal, no symptoms ; 2 = borderline symptoms ; 3 = mild symptoms ; 4 = moderately bad symptoms ; 5 = markedly bad symptoms ; 6 = severely bad symptoms ; 7 = extremely bad symptoms ). The mPGI-S will be completed by the patient (administered by a trained rater ) at baseline and Days 43 and 85 ( Weeks 6 and 12) or early termination. 6.2.5. Modified Patient Global Impression of Change for IED (mPGI- C) The mPGI -C (Appendix 11) is a single-ques tion scale that will ask patients to rate the overall global change in their IED symptoms (e.g., aggression, anger, and irritability) from baseline at the scheduled double-bl ind visits. The mPGI-C responses will be scored using a 7 -point scale (1 = very much improved; 2 = much improved; 3 = minimally improved; 4 = no change; 5 = minimally worse; 6 = much worse ; 7 = very much worse)."

Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) The SDS (Appendix 12) i s a 3-item, patient -rated questionnaire , used to evaluate impairments in the domains of work/school , social life or leisure activities, and family life or home responsibility.23 The patient will rate the degree of impairment in work/school, social life or leisure activities, and family life or home responsibility as a result of IED symptoms using a visual analogue scale (0 = no impairment; 1, 2, 3 = mildly; 4, 5, 6 = moderately; 7, 8, 9 = markedly; 10 = extremely ). The SDS will be completed by the patient (administered by a trained rater ) at baseline (predose, Day 1), Day 43 (Week 6), and Day 85 (Week 12) or early termination. 6.2.7. Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey (SF -12) The SF-12 (Appendix 13) is a 12-item, patient self-rated questionnaire that measures general health status and quality of life.24 The SF-12 is a shorter version of the SF-36 that was designed for the Medical Outcomes Study, a multi-year study of patients with chronic conditions. The SF - 12 is an extensively validated instrument with normative data from large numbers of individuals from both clinical samples and the general population. The SF -12 includes 12 questions that will measure the effects of health on physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perception, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. These questions when combined, scored, and weighted, will result in 2 scales of mental and physical functioning and overall health- related quality of life. The SF-12 will be completed by the patient (administered by a trained rater ) at baseline (predose, Day 1) and Days 43 and 85 ( Weeks 6 and 12) or early termination. 6.2.8. State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory -2 (STAXI -2) The STAXI-2 (Appendix 14) is a 57-item, patient self -rated scale that measures the intensity o f anger as an emotional state (state anger) and the disposition to experience angry fe elings as a personality trait (trait a nger). 25 The STAXI -2 includes a measure of state anger, trait anger, anger expression -out, anger expression-in, anger control-out and anger control, and the anger expression index (overall measure of the expression and control of anger). The state anger items will be scored using a 4 -point scale (1 = not at all to 4 = very much so) to assess the intensity of anger feeling s at a particular moment. The other scales will be scored using a 4 -point scale to assess how frequently angry feeling are experienced, expressed, suppressed, or controlled (1 = almost never to 4 = almost always). The STAXI -2 will be completed by the patient (administered by a trained rater) at baseline (predose, Day 1) and Days 43 and 85 ( Weeks 6 and 12) or early termination."

Procedures for the collection, storage and shipping of samples for anal ysis will be provided to the study sites by the sponsor at the time of study initiation. 6.5. Safety Assessments 6.5.1. Adverse Events 6.5.1.1. Definitions An AE is any untoward medical occurrence or unintended change (i ncluding physical, psychiatric [e.g., depression], or behavioral) from the time the ICF is signed , including inter-current illness, which occurs during the course of a clinical trial after treatment has started, whether considered related to treatment or not. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Changes associated with normal growth and development that do not vary in frequency or magnitude from that ordinarily anticipated clinically are not AEs (e.g., onset of menstruation occurring at a physiologically appropriate time). Any concerning symptoms of depression will be discussed with the inves tigator, who is also a psychiatrist , and refer the patient to their primary physician, if necessary . Clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms when possible (e.g., cold, seasonal allergies, instead of “runny nose”). An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than specified in the protocol and higher than known therapeutic doses. It must be reported irrespective of outcome even if toxic effects were not observed. Adverse events will be gr aded on a 3-point scale and reported in detail as indicated on the eCRF: Mild: Event easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with normal everyday activities"
36,page_36,"AVAN IR Pharmaceuticals Protocol 17- AVP-786-206 AVP-786 Version 1.2 IND 133049 37 Moderate: Event sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities Severe: Event that is incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities The relationship of each AE to study medication should be determined by the investigator using the following explanations: Not related : Event is clearly related to other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient Unlikely related : Event is most likely produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient; and does not follow a known response pattern to the study medication Possibly related : Event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration; and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication ; but could have been produced by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient Related: Event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug administration; and follows a known response pattern to the study medication ; and cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as the patient’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the patient 6.5.1.2. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse e vent (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 1. Death 2. Life-threatening experience (one that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., it does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) 3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 4. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, or be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. The terms “cancer” and “overdose” are not considered to be SAEs, but if a patient experiences cancer or overdose, they are still reportable as AEs."
37,page_37,"AVAN IR Pharmaceuticals Protocol 17- AVP-786-206 AVP-786 Version 1.2 IND 133049 38 Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or an SAE, unless a complication occurs that m eets the requirements for an AE or SAE , but must be reported on a pregnancy report form. Females who are pregnant or likely to become pregnant are excluded from this study. In the event a patient becomes pregnant during the study, study medication must be discontinued, a pregnancy report form must be completed to capture potential drug exposure during pregnancy, and the pregnancy must be reported within 24 hours of notice. Any pregnant patient must be followed until the outcome of her pregnancy is known (i.e., normal delivery, abnormal delivery, spontaneous/voluntary/therapeutic abortion). The pregnancy (i.e., mother and fetus) must be followed-up through delivery with regard to outcome. A pregnancy report form must also be completed in the event that a fem ale partner of a male patient becomes p regnant within 30 days after the last dose of study drug or study completion, whichever is greater. The term ‘severe’ is a measure of intensity; thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious. For example, nausea of several hours duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 6.5.1.3. Reporting Patients will be queried regarding AEs at each study visit after screening . The investigator will assess and record all reported AEs. Any AE reported after the last dose of study drug will be followed-up until 30 days. Patients will receive a safety follow -up telephone c all 7 days after the last dose of study drug to query regarding any AEs experienced since that visit. A death occurring during the study, or which comes to the attention of the investigator within 30 days after the last dose of study drug whether considered treatment -related or not, must be reported to the sponsor. For all SAEs, including an abnormal laboratory test value assessed as clinically significant , the investigator should consult with the sponsor ’s medical monitor or designated representative as needed and report any SAE by fax/email form as detailed below no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event. Subsequently, the SAE must be assessed for the following details: seriousness of the event, start date, stop date, intensity, frequency, relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, any treatment required, and outcome to date. These detai ls must be recorded on the clinical study AE report form that is provided. This form should be transmitted by fax and the details given by telephone to the contact numbers below. SAE reporting by FAX or e-mail correspondence FAX: E-ma SAE hot line (24-hour/7 days a week) Phone: Such preliminary reports will be followed by detailed descriptions later, which may include copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other related documents when requested."

Physical and Neurological Examinations Physical and neurological examinations will be performed at screening (Day -28 to Day -1), and Day 85 (Week 12). The physical examination will include assessments of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lymph nodes, skin, extremities, res piratory, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems. The neurological examination will include assessments of mental status, cranial nerves, motor system, reflexes, coordination, gait and station, and sensory system. The physical and neurological examinations should be performed by the same person each time, whenever possible. Physical and neurological examination abnormalities determined by the investigator to be clinically significant at s creening should be recorded as medical history. Any clinically significant changes in physical and neurological examination findings from the screening examination should be recorded as AEs. 6.5.3. Vital Signs Measurements Vital sign measurements, including orthostatic blood pressure and pulse rate , respiratory rate (breaths/minute) (recorded only sitting) , and body temperature (ºF) (recorded only sitting ), will be recorded at each study visit. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after a patient has been sitting for at least 5 minutes (each me asurement will be taken twice in the same position and recorded) and after approximately 3 minutes of standing. Weight will be recorded at baseline ( predose, Day 1) and Day 85 (Week 12) only. 6.5.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests Clinical laboratory tests will be analyzed by a central laboratory that will provide laboratory kits and instructions to the study sites at the time of study initiation . Specimens will be appropriately processed by the central laboratory and laboratory reports will be made available to the investigator in a timely manner to ensure appropriate clinical review. The laboratory test battery will include both screening and routine laboratory tests. The following clin ical laboratory assessments will be performed at the specified visits . Screening Tests • Thyroid function tests – Thyroid dysfunction will be detected by measuring t hyroid- stimulating hormone (TSH) at screening. If the TSH results are abnormal, reflex triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) tests will be performed . If the thyroid function tests results are judged clinically significant by the investigator, the patient will be excluded from further study participation. Routine Clinical Laboratory Tests The routine clinical laboratory tests will be performed non -fasting during the screening period, Day 57 (Week 8), and Day 85 (Week 12) (within 3 hours postdose) or early termination."

The ECG assessment will be recorded at the study center and will include general findings, including heart rate (beats/minute), QRS complex and PR and QTc intervals. Results will be provided by the central reader to the i nvestigators within 24 hours ; ECG data will be transferred automatically from the central reader into the sponsor ’s database monthly. Any ECG abnormality present at screening will be recorde d as medical history. Any changes from the ECG status at screening that are deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator should be captured as AEs. Any clinically significant abnormal ECG should be discussed with the medical monitor and, if necessary , the ECG should be repeated within approximately 1 week. In addition, any patient with a QTc F interval > 500 msec (unless due to ventricular pacing) or a QTcF interval increase from the predose baseline ECG ( Day 1) > 60 msec at any time after random ization, will be withdrawn from the study. 6.5.7. Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S -STS) A measurement of suicidality, a term referencing suicidal ideas or suicidal behaviors, is required by regulatory agencies in psychiatric patients participating in clinical studies. The S-STS (Appendix 15) is a measure of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviors, and will serve as an ongoing assessment of suicidality (i.e., suicidal thinking and behavior) during this study. The S-STS is a pros pective scale that assesses treatment -emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Each item of the S -STS is scored by the clinician using a 5 -point scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little; 2 = moderately; 3 = very; 4 = extremely) .26 The S-STS can be analyzed as individual item scores, suicidal ideation subscale score, suicidal behavior subscal e score, or total score. The S-STS takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to administer. At screening, the timeframe for the items will be ‘in the past 6 months’ and for all other visits, the timeframe will be ‘since the last visit’. The S-STS will be completed by a trained clinician at each study visit or early termination . Whenever possible, the same rater should administer the S-S TS at these visits. Any change in the S-STS score indicating the presence of suicidality should be evaluated by the investigator and reported to the medical monitor . The investigator, who is also a psychiatrist, must provide necessary intervention to manag e suicidal ideation and refer the patient to their primary physician. 6.6. Schedule of Evaluations and Procedures A schedule of evaluations and procedures is provided in Table 1 . 6.6.1. Description of Study Procedures At each study visit, a member of the study staff will be required to enter information into the IWRS regarding patient data and pre-defined study assessment results. Further instructions will be provided in the IWRS Site Manual."

Data Collection The sponsor or designated representative (e.g., CRO) will perform the data management activities in accordance with the data management plan (DMP). The DMP will outline the systems and procedures to be used in the study. Clinical study data will be reported (captured) by study site personnel on eCRFs. An eCRF must be completed for every patient enrolled in the study. The eCRF data will be entered by trained study site personnel and then reviewed for completeness and accuracy and electronically signed by the investigator or designee. All study site personnel must use a password- protected user account to enter, revie w, or correct study data. Electronic signature procedures shall co mply with the CFR Title 21 Part 11. Passwords will be strictly confidential. All eCRF data will be exported from the electronic data capture (EDC) system and transferred to the sponsor or re presentative. The sponsor or representative will also receive electronic transfers of non-eCRF data such as laboratory data from the central laboratory, ECG data from the central ECG reader, as well as other data from third -party vendors as appropriate. The electronic data format of all transfers will be agreed upon with the sponsor or representative and documented in the DMP or vendor data transfer requirements document as appropriate. The clinical monitoring staff will perform source data verification o f the data recorded in the EDC system with source documents at the clinical study sites according to the data management plan and clinical monitoring plan. The data will be subjected to consistency and validation checks within the EDC system with supplemen tal data reviews performed outside of the EDC system. Medical h istory and adverse events will be coded using a current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and concomitant medications using a current version of the World Healt h Organization Drug Dictionary. The sponsor or representative will perform a medical safety review of the coding. Completed eCRF images with a date - and time -stamped electronic audit trail indicating the user, the data entered, and any reason for change (i f applicable) will be archived at the investigator’s site and at the sponsor’s site. 7.2. Electronic Clinical Outcomes Assessment Data This study will use electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOA) to capture questionnaire data. The data will be transmitted electronically to a centralized database at the eCOA vendor. Data may be reviewed by site staff via secure access. Upon study completion, the eCOA data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will be archived. The investigator will receive quest ionnaire data for the site that must be kept with the study records as source data.

Analysis Populations Three analysis populations will be evaluated including the modified intent- to-treat (mIT T), per-protocol (PP), and safety populations, as defined below: mITT - patients who ingest at least 1 dose of study medication and have at least one postbaseline primary efficacy assessment ; this population will be used for all analyses of efficacy. Patients will be included in the treatment group to which they were randomized regardless of treatment received. PP - patients with no significant protocol deviation that may impact the efficacy evaluation s. Patients in PP will be included in the treatmen t group based on the actual treatment received . Safety - patients who ingest study medication; this population will be used for the safety analyses. Patients will be included in the treatment group based on the actual treatment received. 8.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics . 8.3. Efficacy Analysis 8.3.1. Study Endpoints Primary efficacy endpoint: The primary effica cy endpoint will be the change from baseline to Week 12 in the OAS -M Total Aggression score. Secondary efficacy endpoints: The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the change from baseline to Week 12 in the following measures (raw score for mCGI-C and mPGI-C): • OAS-M Total Irritability • OAS-M - individual items for the Aggression and Irritability • - IED days, IED episodes, IED severity, and patient’s distress • IED days - investigator assessment • OAS-M - number of discrete IED episodes • mCGI-S • mCGI-C • mPGI-S • mPGI-C"

Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary effica cy endpoint will be the change from baseline to Week 12 in the OAS -M Total Aggression score, using the mITT population. For the primary efficacy endpoint, the null hypothesis is that there is no treatment effect and will be tested against the alternative that there is a treatment effect. The treatment effect will be analyzed using a likelihood- based linear mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) on observed data. The model will include fixed effects for treatment, visit, treatment- by-visit interaction, baseline- by-visit interaction, and baseline value. The OAS -M Total Aggression scores are highly skewed and, in general, not normal ly-distributed; a log -transformation will be applied first befor e using the MMRM. The analysis on the original scale will be the sensitivity analysis. 8.3.3. Secondary Efficacy Analyses Secondary efficacy endpoints include the change from baseline to Week 12 for the secondary efficacy measures described above, and will be analyzed in a similar manner to the primary endpoint or as appropriate. Detailed analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP ) prior to unblinding the study. 8.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plasma concentrations of d6- DM, Q, and certain metabolites will be measured and results will be summarized descriptively overall . Plasma concentration results will be used to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of d6- DM, Q, and certain metabolites. Additional pharmacokinetic correlations may also be performed. Additional details will be described in the SAP. 8.6. Safety Analysis Safety will be assessed by the following measurements: AEs , physical and neurological examination, vital sign s including orthostatic measurements, urine pregnancy test, c linical laboratory assessments (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), resting 12- lead ECG , concomitant medications, and S- STS. Safety analys is will consist of data summaries and tabulated by treatment group."

The percentages of patients experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by treatment, system organ class (SOC) , deaths, non- fatal SAEs, AEs, AEs resulting in study discontinuation, and treatment- emergent AEs (TEAE). A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurred after the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose. 8.6.2. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms Summary statistics of absolute values and percentage change from baseline for blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) , heart rate, respiratory rate, and ECG parameters will be provided. All values outside a pre-defined normal range will be highlighted in the individual patient data listings. 8.6.3. Clinical Laboratory Values Laboratory parameters will b e summarized using descriptive statistics. Shift tables showing the pattern of change in the normal range value between screening and end of treatment as increased, decreased, or no change will be produced. 8.7. Data and Safety Monitoring Board The sponsor will appoint a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the periodic review of available study data to monitor the safety of all patients randomized into this study . The DSMB will include an independent group of experts that advises the sponsor and the stud y investigators. The members of the DSMB will each serve in an individual capacity and provide their expertise and recommendations. The primary responsibilities of the DSMB are to (1) periodically review and evaluate the accumulated study data for pa rticipant safety, study conduct, and progress, and (2) make recommendations to the sponsor concerning the continuation, modification, or termination of the study. The DSMB will consider study- specific data as well as relevant background knowledge about the disease, test agent, or patient population under study. The DSMB is responsible for defining its deliberative processes, including event triggers that would call for an unscheduled review, stopping guidelines, unmasking, and voting procedures prior to initiati ng any data review. The DSMB is also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its internal discussions and activities as well as the contents of reports provided to it. 8.8. Interim Analysis An interim analysis may be performed and will be prespecified in the SAP . 8.9. Sample Size Calculation Sample size calculation was performed based on the results of a previous 12- week study of fluoxetine vs. placebo in patients with IED ; the observed OAS- M aggression score effect size was approximate 0.45 taking into account a 45% discontinuation rate.1 For the current study, the"

Institutional Review Board Approval The IRBs must meet the guidelines set out by the FDA and conform to local laws and customs where appropriate. Written IRB approval for the protocol and the signed ICF must be obtained and transmitted to Avanir Pharmaceuticals or representative before the study can be initiated. The IRB must be informed of and approve all protocol amendments. The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with local laws and according to Na tional and State laws (Appendix 16 Investigator Responsibilities). The complete text of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki is provided in Appendix 17. 9.2. Informed Consent Form The ICF will follow the principles outlined in the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki. Signed informed consent must be obtained from each patient (if the patient is capable in the judgment of the investigator to provide informed consent) or their legally authorized representative prior to patient entry into the study; no screening procedure will be conducted until the informed consent is signed. The patient will be properly informed of the purpose of the study and alerted to any anticipated AE that may be encountered with the study medication. The patient will be provided with a copy of their signed ICF. 9.3. Study Drug Diary The study drug diary will be reviewed at each double- blind study visit after baseline by clinical study personnel for confirmation of the number of capsules taken and the time of study drug dosing. The study personnel are responsible for ensuring that (1) patients properly record study drug dosing data into the study drug diary and (2) transcribing the study drug diary recordings into the eCRF. The study drug diary will be collected at each study visit after baseline , and the originals will be maintained at the site as source documents. 9.4. Electronic Case Report Forms For each patient enrolled who has provided informed consent, an eCRF must be completed and electronically signed by the investigator to certify that the data within each eCRF are complete and correct. This also applies to those patients who fail to complete the study. If a patient is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment -limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to document the outcome. Any site personnel delegated responsibility for data entry, query resolution, or eCRF approval must complete training prior to accessing the eCRF. The EDC vendor will provide user- specific access to the live (p roduction) eCRF once training completion has been confirmed and the account has been approved by the sponsor. Any data changes in the EDC system once the data have been initially saved will be tracked via audit trail and will require a reason for the change. The audit trail will also include who made the change and a date/time stamp."

All investigators will be provided with copies of the completed eCRFs for their site on a CD-ROM at the end of the study. 9.5. Quality Assurance 9.5.1. Documentation For each process, evaluation, or test that generates study data but is not described in the protocol or eCRF, a written description of the data generation procedures shall be retained in the quality assurance section of the study files. In the case of routine clinical diagnostic procedures, only a copy of the relevant certification document is required . 9.5.2. Monitoring Throughout the study, the study monitor will make frequent contacts with the investigator. This will include telephone calls and on- site visits. The study will be routinely monitored to ensure compliance with the study protocol and the overall quality of data collected. During the on- site visits, the eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness and adherence to the protocol. As part of the data audit, source documents will be made available for review by the study monitor. The study monitor may periodically request review of the investigator study file to assure the completeness of documentation in all respects of clinical study conduct. The study monitor will verify that each patient has proper consent documentation from the patient and/or the patient’s legally authorized representative for study procedures and for the release of medical records to th e sponsor, FDA, other regulatory authorities, and the IRB. The investigator or appointed delegate will receive the study monitor during these on -site visits and will cooperate in providing the documents for inspection and respond to inquiries. In addition, the investigator will permit inspection of the study files by authorized representatives of the regulatory agencies. On completion of the study, the study monitor will arrange for a final review of the study files after which the files should be secured f or the appropriate time period. 9.6. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the sponsor , the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, e.g. , CRFs and hospital records), all original signed ICFs, copies of all e CRFs, SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence ( e.g., letters, meeting minutes, tele phone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement, whichever is longer."
57,page_57,"AVAN IR Pharmaceuticals Protocol 17- AVP-786-206 AVP-786 Version 1.2 IND 133049 58 If the investigator is unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), the sponsor should be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to the sponsor , such as another investigator, another institution, or the sponsor. The i nvestigator must obtain written permission from the sponsor before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met. 9.7. Source Data The documents that will form the source data for the clinical study (e.g., patient charts, laboratory reports) must be defined and documented in the in-house study master file prior to the start of the study. Data on the eCRFs, which will be checked against source data during monitoring visits , must also be defined and documented in the in-house study ma ster file including the percentage of each of the source data to be verified and the percentage of patients’ eCRFs to be monitored. 9.8. Data Handling Data collected on the eCRFs will be entered into EDC system by trained site staff. Any queries arising from data entry will be checked with the investigator and changes approved. 9.9. Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice Standards for GCP must be adhered to for all study- based procedures. 9.10. Conditions for Amending the Protocol Protocol modification to ongoing studies t hat could potentially adversely affect the safety of patients or which alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosages, duration of therapy, assessment variables, the number of patients treated, or patient selection criteria must be made only after appropriate consultation between an appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator. Protocol modifications must be prepared by a representative of the sponsor or the investigator, and reviewed and approved by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB in accordance with local requirements, before the revised edition can be implemented. Modifications which eliminate an apparent immediate ha zard to patients do not require pre-approval by the IRB. 9.11. Conditions for Terminating the Study Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at the site at any time. Should this be necessary, the procedures to effect study t ermination will be arranged after review and consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the sponsor and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests."

Confidentiality of Study Documents and Patient Records The investigator must assure that the patient’s anonymity will be maintained. On eCRFs or other documents, including audio recordings, submitted to the sponsor, patients should not be identified by their names but by an identification code. The investigator should keep a separate log of patient’s codes, names, and addresses. Documents not for submission to the sponsor, for example, patients’ signed ICFs, should be maintained by the investigator in strict confidence. 9.13. Publications It is anticipated that a report of this study will be published in the scientific literature by the sponsor. The investigator will not seek to arrange for publication of any of the information or results from the study in any scientific journal, or other p ublication or by way of lecture without the sponsor’s prior review and written consent. 9.14. Audits/Inspections The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified pers onnel or designee from the sponsor or to health authority inspectors after appropriate notification. The verification of the eCRF data may be by direct inspection of source documents (where permitted by law) or through an interview exchange. The inspector from the regulatory authority will be especially interested in the following items: • Visits from the sponsor’s representatives • IRB approval • Study medication accountability • Study protocol and amendments • ICFs of the patient (if capable of providing ICF, according to the investigator) or patient’s legally authorized representative • Medical records supportive of eCRF data • Reports to the IRB and the sponsor • Record retention The sponsor will be available to help investigators prepare for an inspection."
