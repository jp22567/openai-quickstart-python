8,page_8,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 9 of 57 1.0 Introduction 1.1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a relatively new brain imaging modality. Rather than imaging parts of the brain that are activated when performing certain tasks, TMS non - invasively stimulates an area of the brain, and when evoki ng a response, establishes a causal relation between brain activation and behavio ur. TMS when given in form of pulse trains (rTMS) can be used modulate cortical activity by either up -regulating or down -regulating cortical excitability depending on rTMS p arameters used. The motor cortices in the left and right hemispheres of human brain are strongly interconnected, with each side naturally inhibiting the activity of the other side – and achieving a natural balance. If one side is lesioned as in stroke, how ever, its activation is decreased and its inhibition to the other side is reduced, leading to increased activation in the non-lesioned side. Additionally, the non-lesioned side still provides inhibitory signals to the lesioned side, even more than in the prior healthy balance situation. This mismatch leads to a condition where the lesioned hemisphere cannot easily deliver action potentials to the lower motor neuron and the c orresponding muscles. As result, the ability to participate in motor training which is necessary for recovery of function is severely challenged. Still, there is ample evidence that rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task practice (task -oriented therapy) results in long -term functional recovery . Both animal models (Kleim and Jones, 2008) and human clinical trials ( Leipert 2000, Wolf 2006) support a use - dependent relationship between task-oriented therapy, neuroplasticity and functi onal performance. Unfortunately, despite the growing utilization of task -oriented therapy approaches in clinical rehabilitation, functional recovery of arm and hand function is limited to about 50% of persons with stroke and full recovery is achieved in l ess than 20% (Kwakkel G 2003) . Adjuvant treatments that enhance response to task -oriented motor training are needed. A recent discovery is to use repetitive TMS to modulate regional excitability of the motor cortex (Hummel and Cohen, 2006). Two potentia l roles have been described for rTMS in stroke recovery: (1) inhibit, i.e., down -regulate, the non-lesioned side (using 1 Hz rTMS), or (2) excite the lesioned side (using 10 Hz rTMS). In the present study 1Hz rTMS will be utilized to down - regulate the non-lesioned hemisphere with the goal of improving response to motor training by reducing interhemispheric inhibition and potentially facilitating activity in the lesioned hemisphere. Previously at least 27 studies on effects of contralesional 1Hz rTMS targeting the primary motor cortex on motor function utilizing varying rTMS protocols have been performed in 2598 patients with stroke in 2005 -2016 [Boggio PS 2006, Mally J and Dinya E,2008, Dafotakis M 2008, Fregni F 2006, Khedr EM 2008, Kirton A 2008, Liepert J 2007, Mansur CG 2005, Nowak DA 2008, Takeuchi N 2005, Takeuchi N 2008(a), Takeuchi N 2008(b), Khedr EM 2009, Emera T, 2010, Kakuda W 2011 (a), Kakuda W 2011 (b), Thielig S 2011, Kakuda W 2011 (c), Kakuda W 2012, Sung W 2013, Abo M 2013 , Higgins 2013, Kim, 2014. Rose 2014 Cha H 2015, Zheng C 2015, Kakuda W 2016 ]."
9,page_9,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 10 of 57 Further, in a recent meta -analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials including a total of 392 patients, rTMS therapy was found to have a positive effect on motor function in patients with stroke (Hsu, 2012) . This meta -analysis found a significant effect size of 0.55 for motor outcome (95% CI, 0.37 –0.72). Further subgroup analyses demonstrated more prominent effects for subcortical stroke (mean effect size, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.44 –1.02) and in studies that applied low-frequency (1Hz) rTMS (mean effect size, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.42 –0.95). The meta - analysis concluded that rTMS has a positive effect on motor recovery in patients with stroke, especially for those with subcortical stroke. However, the studies have not been designed to demonstrate clinically relevant efficacy and only some of them combined rTMS with specific rehabilitation training. Importantly, all previous studies have been performed with investigational TMS devices without the aid of neuronavigation. Thus , therapy delivery has been performed “blindly” relying on observed motor responses. The device operator has not been able to confirm targeting of stimulation to a specific neuroanatomic site corresponding to the motor cortex and, importantly, has not been able to keep the location of therapy delivery constant during the delivery lasting several minutes. Nexstim has developed a Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) system that uses TMS with a software based Navigational System that provide spatial accuracy for targeting stimulation to specific areas in motor cortex . The system integrates individual patient’s head MRI pictures with navigation software allowing online targeting of the TMS and the induced electric field to specific cortical areas. An integrated E MG allows online detection of MEPs caused by TMS. As an end -result the motor cortical areas commanding a certain muscle or muscle group can be targeted and the possible presence of a functioning corticospinal tract detected. The high a ccuracy of the Nexs tim’s NBS has been validated in studies comparing NBS to intraoperative direct electrocortical stimulation (DCS) in patients underg oing neurosurgery . The mean di stance between NBS and DCS has been 6 mm in 81 patients reported in 6 publications [Takahashi, 2013] . Nexstim’s NBS technology is FDA approved for pre - procedural localization of functional motor and language cortex and routinely used by leading Departments of Neurosurgery in the U.S. Nexstim’s NBS system overcomes the problems of targeting and repeatability associated with non-navigated rTMS in post -CNS injury therapy. In healthy subjects and in patients with chronic stroke the effects of 1Hz rTMS were greater when NBS was used to targ et an optimal cortical location [ Bashir 2010a and Bashir 2010b ]. Further, in a 30 patient Phase II clinical trial, 84% of patients with sub -acute stroke receiving 1Hz contralesional NBS -guided -rTMS as adjunct to task -oriented rehabilitation attained clinic ally important improvement of at least 5 points on the upper extremity Fugl -Meyer scale while in the sham -rTMS group 50% did the same [ Harvey 2014 ]. The mean point increase was 13.8 and 7.1 in patients receiving active NBS -rTMS and sham -rTMS, respectively. The results are superior to any other technology previously published. Further, no serious adverse events have occurred with NBS -rTMS. In addition , in a 199 subject multi -center trial (NICHE trial, NCT02089464 ) performed with the same NBT trial device as in the present trial , similar trial protocol and in a patient population otherwise identical to that of the present trial protocol, with the exception that NICHE trial enrolled patients with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke while the present trial is"
10,page_10,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 11 of 57 limited to patients with ischemic stroke only, 66% of subjects (gained clinically important improvement of motor function (>5 points) on UEFM [Harvey, RL et al, manuscript in preparation]. In the NICHE trial there were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between the active NBT -rTMS (67% of all subjects , 72% of subjects with ischemic stroke improved at least 5 points on UEFM) and sham -rTMS (65% improved) trial arms. The mean improvement on UEFM was 8.1 points. The clinical results in both trial arms exceed those expected based on literature and by the NICHE site principal investigators by a factor of 2. In an analysis of the potential reasons for lack of separation, Nexstim has concluded that the sham coil used in NICHE may well have been acti ve and lead to a situation where in addition to the active rTMS group, the control group has also received active stimulation, albeit through a different mechanism of action than the active group. The present trial aims to determine whether 1Hz NBT - rTMS targeting the motor representation areas of hand muscles on the non -lesioned hemisphere has a beneficial effect on the motor recovery of the corresponding stroke -affected muscles when combined with standardized task -oriented motor rehabilitation. The stud y is being conducted with a new and different sham coil design that ensures true sham rTMS delivery to the control group. The present trial is also aimed to enroll patients with ischemic stroke only as they were most likely to improve in the NIC HE trial (o verall 72 % of subjects with ischemic stroke gained at least 5 point on UEFM in NICHE active group )."
11,page_11,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 12 of 57 1.2. DEVICE DESCRIPTION In the present trial t he Nexstim Navigated Brain Therapy (NBT) System is used for rTMS delivery. The NB T system is CE-marked for adjunct therapy for upper extremity rehabilitation in patients with stroke in the European Union . The Nexstim NBS technology provides navigational accuracy for the NBT system . NBS technology is FDA approved for localization of primary motor cortex [K091457] and language function [K112881]. The Nexstim NBS Technology consists of three subsystems. The NBS technology is integrated into the TMS software. 1) TMS Stimulator 2) NBS Technology 3) EMG TMS Stimulator : The TMS stimulator provides non -invasive stimulation of the central nervous system (CNS). The stimulation can be delivered as single pulses, or repetitive TMS (in trains). The stimulator provides precise stimulation as the design of the Coil and electroni c components enable focal bipulse delivery. The stimulator is designed to allow the practitioner to have precise control of the stimulus location and strength. It also enables the practitioner to accurately record and review which structures have been st imulated, and the level of stimulation delivered. The Nexstim TMS Stimulator will be used in the study to perform the rTMS -therapy in 1Hz rTMS mode and the diagnostic evaluations using single -pulse TMS paradigms. Both paradigms are considered to have a n on-significant risk associated with the use of the device (see section 2.2) . NBS Technology The Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) technology provides navigational accuracy. The software uses structural MRI images to control strength and location of TMS s timuli. The software presents the predicted reactions of various brain areas when stimulated with TMS pulses. NBS technology is non -invasive and poses no risk to the patients. EMG Technology Surface EMG has been designed for simultaneous use with TMS equipment. Amplifiers are protected from the magnetic pulse by a dedicated design. The software allows free transport of data between integrated EMG and NBS software."
12,page_12,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 of 57 2.0 Benefits/risks 2.1. BENEFITS Navigation -guided TMS used in the present study enables accurate targeted delivery of long trains of stimulation and modulation of neuronal activity in the brain. The system also makes possible the stimulation of the exactly same cortical location on different days. The beneficial effects of 1Hz rTMS ob served in previous studies are hypothesized to be enhanced by the increased accuracy and repeatability made possible by the NB T system. Combining NB T-rTMS to an established task - oriented rehabilitation therapy treatment may result in improved functional ou tcomes for the patients. For a summary of previous and supporting investigation, see section 1.0 above. 2.2. RISKS Single -pulse TMS Localization of the muscle representation area which will be subsequently the target location for delivering 1Hz rTMS therapy will be performed using the NB T device in a single pul se mode. Single pulse TMS has been studied extensively and been established to be safe in practically all subjects [Bridgers 1991; Bridgers and Delaney 1989] . It was judged by a panel of experts with FDA representation at an NIH Consensus Conference in June 1996 to be a non- signifi cant risk application [Hallett et al. 1999; Wassermann 1996]. No serious adverse events related to single -pulse stimulation have been reported to Nexstim by any user of the study device or earlier product generation. 1Hz rTMS In the report of the NIH Consensus Conference cited above [Wassermann 1996] rTMS was recognized to be associated with potentially more frequent (although still rare) adverse effects than single -pulse TMS. The frequency of adverse effects was noted to increase in parallel with the frequency (Hz) and intensity (% of motor threshold) of the rTMS trains used. The workshop issued safety guidelines where for 1Hz rTMS trains of >1800 pulses given at 100 or 110% of motor threshold were considered safe . These guidelines have been reassessed and updated with no change to the evaluation of safety of the 1Hz rTMS paradigm [Rossi 2009] . In the present study 1 Hz trains of 900 pulses at 110% of motor threshold targeting the healthy brain hemisphere will be utilized in patients at least 3 months from stroke . The protocol fall s within the safety guidelines. In the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of rTMS paradigms similar to the one used by the NBT in the patients with stroke , no serious adverse events have been reported in the 27 studies in 2598 patients with stroke in 2005 -2016 (Boggio 2006 Mally J and Dinya E,2008, Dafotakis M 2008, Fregni F 2006, Khedr EM 2008, Kirton A 2008, Liepert J 2007, Mansur CG 2005, Nowak DA 2008, Takeuchi N 2005, Takeuchi N 2008(a), Takeuchi N 2008(b), Khedr EM 2009, Emara T, 2010, Kakuda W 2011 (a), Kaku da W 2011 (b), Thielig S 2011, Kakuda W 2011 (c) , Kakuda W 2012, Sung W 2013, Abo M 2013 , Higgins 2013, Kim, 2014. Rose 2014 Cha H 2015, Zheng C 2015, Kakuda W 2016). Further, no serious adverse events have occurred in the studies where NBS -guided rTMS has been used (a total of 3813 rTMS sessions in 224 patients with stroke) [Bashir S 2010 (b), Harvey RL ,"
13,page_13,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 57 2013 , Harvey RL, manuscript in preparation ].This includes the use experience in the NICHE multicentre trial in which no device related SAE occurred in the 3448 therapy sessions performed in 199 patients using the same trial device and protocol as the present trial. In addition, the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) monitoring the NICHE trial identified no safety related concerns during the trial. Based on the fact that the rTMS train used in the present clinical trial falls comfortably and with a wide margin (50%) within the consensus safety guidelines and the lack of side -effects in the relatively extensive literature specific to the study population in the present trial the rTMS paradigm of the present study can be considered a non -significant risk application. Potential adverse effe cts There are, however, potential risks of seizures, hearing loss, immunological and neuropathological changes, as described below. Microvascular Changes Studies of prolonged exposure to TMS were performed in animal models. Microvascular changes in the c ortex were found in rats exposed to over 100 pulses at 2.8 Tesla, but these findings were not evident in rabbits exposed to 100 - 200 pulses per day at 2.4 Tesla over 30 - 42 days [Nishikiori 1996] , nor were they seen in rabbits exposed to 1000 pulses at 2.0 Tesla over a period of months [Counter 1993] . Furthermo re, rats exposed to 50 -60 1.9 - Tesla pulses delivered over 15 minutes had no significant changes in blood -brain barrier permeability [Ravnborg et al. 1990] . Seizure Activity Seizure activity is a theoretical risk of TMS. Althou gh, single pulse TMS has not caused seizure activity in healthy volunteers, seizures have been produced by single -pulse TMS in several patients with large cerebral infarcts or other structural lesions [Fauth et al. 1992; Homberg and Netz 1989; Kandler 1990] . Epilepsy patients without gross lesions may also be at a minor degree of risk from single pulse TMS. For example, in a se ries of studies by Hufnagel and colleagues, single -pulse TMS was occasionally able to induce seizures or activate epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) foci [Hufnagel et al. 1990a; Hufnagel et al. 1990b; Hufnagel et al. 1990c] . In this study slow frequency trains of stimulation were used. In the current study we propose to use single pulse stimuli with a variable interstimulus interval. However, these results may not apply in patients in whom epilepsy is medically controlled. To wit, Tassinari et al [Tassinari et al. 1990] found that TMS did not incite seizure activity in a cohort of patie nts receiving anti -epileptic therapy. Subjects with a personal history of epilepsy will be excluded from this study. rTMS has been reported to cause seizures in at least 7 individuals in whom frequencies of 3Hz or higher have been utilized [Wassermann 19 96]. In the clinical trials investigating the efficacy and safety of rTMS paradigms similar to the one used by the NBT in the patients with stroke, no seizures have been reported in the 27 studies in 2598 patients with stroke in 2005 -2016 (Boggio 2006 Mally J and Dinya E, 2008, Dafotakis M 2008, Fregni F 2006, Khedr EM 2008, Kirton A 2008, Liepert J 2007, Mansur CG 2005, Nowak DA 2008, Takeuchi N 2005, Takeuchi N 2008(a), Takeuchi N 2008(b), Khedr EM 2009, Emara T, 2010, Kakuda W 2011 (a), Kakuda W 2011 (b), Thielig S 2011, Kakuda W"
14,page_14,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 57 2011 (c), Kakuda W 2012, Sung W 2013, Abo M 2013, Higgins 2013, Kim, 2014. Rose 2014 Cha H 2015, Zheng C 2015, Kakuda W 2016). Further, no seizures ha ve occurred in the studies where NBS -guided rTMS has been used (a total of 365 rTMS sessions in 25 patients with stroke) [Bashir S 2010 (b), Harvey RL , 2013 , Harvey , RL, manuscript in preparation ]. Similarly, no seizures occurred in the NICHE multicentre trial in the 3448 therapy sessions performed in 199 patients using the same trial device and protocol as the present trial. Auditory Changes During TMS there is a loud clicking sound from the coil (up to 120 -130dB). Single -pulse TMS induces permanent increases of the auditory threshold [Counter et al. 1990] in animals and transient increases in humans [Pascual -Leone et al. 1992], but these changes can be prevented with the use o f foam earplugs [Pascual -Leone et al. 1993]. Immunological Changes Single -pulse stimulation may induce changes in T lymphocyte subset [Wassermann 2000]. In general, these changes have been short -lived (<48 hours) and comparable to changes seen with stress, menstruation or circadian cycles [Wassermann 2000]. Psychiatric changes Treatment -emergent mania has been reported for low and high frequency rTMS in patients with uni - and bipolar depression [ Xia 2008, Rossi 2009] after stimulation of the left prefrontal cortex. Mania has not been reported in any patients or subjects in whom motor cortex has been stimulated as in the present study. Neurocognitive Changes A number of studies have examined the effect of TMS on cogni tive function. In general, both transient and short -term studies of TMS have failed to demonstrate consistent effects on cognitive function following TMS [Pascual -Leone et al. 1993; Little et al 2000; Wassermann et al. 1996]. TMS can produce desired and u ndesired, usually within the frame of the experimental design but potentially long lasting, changes. Such effects, which generally follow a single application of rTMS, can be produced by random neural noise or brain signal suppression (Harris 2008), are sm all and, are considered not to raise particular safety issues by published consensus statement on the safety of rTMS (for review see Rossi et al., 2007c and Rossi 2009). EMG There may be a small amount of irritation of the skin from the electrode paste (less than 5% chance). There is no known risk involved in recording EMG activity from these sensors and electrodes. Headaches Another risk that has been cited is a higher frequency of experiencing mild headaches, which resolve soon after the procedure. I t is speculated that the headaches may be a result of maintaining a fixed position of the head and neck for the duration of the procedure. Risk of cardiovascular responses to restful sitting"
15,page_15,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 of 57 Given that many potential subjects have cardiovascular disease and hypertension, there is potential for symptomatic reduction in blood pressure with restful sitting in the study chair during the procedures in those subjects taking antihypertensive medications. In some cases this may be associated with feelings of nau sea. Maintaining hydration and repositioning in the chair should resolve these problems. All efforts will be made to minimize these risks by using only trained personnel who are experienced and skilled in using the devices. Moreover, all TMS sessions will be performed in a medical setting with access to a skilled medical team and life -support equipment."

Quality of life outcomes: In addition to the other secondary outcome measures above the patients’ quality of life will be assessed using the EQ-5D questionnaire. The change on this scale between baseline and 6 months post -treatment will be determined for both therapy groups and the groups compared to each other to establish effects of therapy on quality of life. Assess ment of safety : To assess safety of study device use, all Serious Adverse Events , Unanticipated Adverse Device Events and Device Related Adverse Events will be recorded and compared between therapy groups.. ."

INFORMED CONSENT All potential subjects will give written informed consent prior to any study related procedures. The background of the proposed study and the benefits and risks of the procedures and study must be explained to the subject. The subject must sign the Insti tutional Review Board (IRB) approved informed consent document prior to participation. Failure to provide informed consent renders the subject ineligible for the study. 5.0 study procedure s 5.1 BLINDING AND SHAM -CONDITION . 5.1.1. Blinding Blinding is achieved as follows:"
19,page_19,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 57 Study staff: only the person responsible for randomization and the person (s) administering rTMS at the study site(s) will be aware of whether the patient is receiving NBS -rTMS or sham - rTMS. Neither of these persons is all owed to discuss randomization with the patient or study staff. Neither of these persons will direct or perform task -oriented rehabilitation with the patient nor will they perf orm any outcome measure testing thus ensuring that these tasks are not influenced by knowledge of randomization. All other members of the study staff will be unaware of randomization. The reason for the person administering rTMS is unblinded is that since a supra -motor threshold protocol of rTMS is delivered to the patients healthy m otor cortex, this will cause muscle activation and visible muscle movement in the patients hand which the person administering rTMS can not avoid to observe. Since sham rTMS condition by definition will not lead to muscle activation the person administerin g the rTMS would become unblinded by observing the patient undergoing rTMS. Patients: Each individual patient will be blinded to randomization by the fact that (s)he has no prior experience of rTMS and therefore can’t assess whether an active or sham cond ition rTMS (through the use of sham coil for rTMS) has been used in her treatment. Further, of the staff that the patient meets only the person administering rTMS will be aware of the randomization. Since that person will be explicitly forbidden to discuss that issue, the patient will be unable to obtain information on randomization. The effectiveness of the blinding will be assessed at the end of the study asking the patient what group they thought they were in. 5.1.2 Sham condition: Sham condition will b e delivered by using the NB T system to navigate and localize a sham TMS coil to the same position on the patients head as the active TMS coil would be located if active NB T-rTMS would be delivered. The sham coil will cause an auditory sensation and a mecha nical scalp sensation similar to the active TMS coil but will not induce an intracranial electric field capable inducing neuromodulation . The s ham coil will be used to deliver an rTMS train of equal frequency and length as the active coil (900 pulses at 1H z). The study will consist of 24 study visits with the possible addition of 5 additional visits as needed to complete outcome assessments. 5.2. VISIT SCHEDULE The study will be performed over 24 to 29 sessions: 1) Visit 1(Screening visit): Baseline = 3-12 months after the stroke. The purpose of this visit is to obtain informed consent for the study (if not previously obtained) and to screen subjects for inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2) Visit 2: Baseline assessment . The purpose of this visit is to es tablish the baseline of injury, motor status and NBS parameters (Localization of cortical motor representation area of the target muscle to which therapeutic rTMS will be subsequently delivered , see appendix A). Subjects will also undergo a structural MRI . The subject will then be randomized to either rTMS or to sham treatment. The baseline visit may if necessary take place on 2 separate days."
20,page_20,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 57 3) Visits 3-20: During these visits the patient will undergo standardized task -oriented motor rehabilitation of the hand. In addition the patient will receive the rTMS therapy according to the protocol of the group she/he was randomized into during visit 1. The visits will take place during a 6 week period, three visits per week. During each week the visits will take p lace each on a separate day and a maximum of two visits will take place on consecutive days. 4) Visit 2 1: End of the task -oriented motor rehabilitation. The purpose of the visit is to establish the extent of recovery that has occurred during the rehabilitati on. The visit will take place 5-10 days after the last rTMS/rehabilitation session and includes functional motor testing ).1-2 visits may be needed to complete assessment. 5) Visit 2 2: 1month (+5 days) after the end of the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of the visit is to determine whether any changes in motor function have occurred within 1 month of ending therapy. The assessment includes functional motor testing . 1-2 visits may be needed to complete assessment. 6) Visit 23 : 3 months (+5 days) after end o f the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of this visit is to determine whether any changes in motor function or NBS parameters have occurred within 3 month of ending therapy. The assessment includes functional motor testing . In patients experienc ing a new stroke, only the data prior to the event will be used in the analysis. 1-2 visits may be needed to complete assessment. 7) Visit 24: 6 months (+5 days) after end of the rehabilitation therapy. The purpose of this visit is to determine the long -term reha bilitation success. The assessment includes functional motor testing . In patients experienc ing a new stroke, only the data prior to the event will be used in the analysis. 1 -2 visits may be needed to complete assessment. 5.2.1 Screening and informed consent Eligibility will be confirmed through a series of steps as follows (see inclusion/exclusion criteria for details).  Medical history and medications.  The Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) assessed by interview will used to determine functional ability prior to the stroke.  The Modified mini mental exam (MMSE) [Teng and Chui 1987] is a series of questions (approximately 5 minutes) to assess orientation (e.g. date, place) and ability to follow commands.  Spasticity will be measured using the Modified Ash worth Spasticity (MAS) Scale [Bohannon and Smith 1987]. The MAS is a 6 -point ordinal rating scale for measuring muscle tone, with ratings from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (limb rigid in flexion or extension).  The National Institutes of Health Stroke Sc ale (NIHSS) is a measure of neurological functioning, with higher scores reflectin g greater deficit (maximum 42).  Chedoke -McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA) [Gowland et al. 2003] includes an impairment inventory and an activity inventory. The Impairment i nventory includes staging assessments of shoulder pain, postural control, recovery of arm and hand, and recovery of leg and foot. Only arm and hand impairment will be assessed which stages each between 1 and 7 with higher score indicating better motor per formance  The possible presence and severity of depression will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (P HQ9) [Graves & Bobardier 2008]. The P HQ9 has nine inquiries about the frequency of symptoms associated with depressed mood over the"
21,page_21,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 57 previous 2 weeks, each scored between 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The maximum score is 27 points. Scores that equal 10 or greater are associated with clinical depression. The P HQ9 has been tested and validated in stroke populations with good sensitivity for detecting depression [de Man -van Ginkel, et al. 2012; Janneke, et al. 2012]. Structural MRI Unless already existing, a n MRI will be acquired using a high resolution (1.5T or more) T1 weighted image of the subject’s brain on any standard magnetic resonance system. MRI acquisition parameters and instructions are shown in the NBT System User manual. The subject’s structural MRI sliced images will be loaded into the Nexstim NBT system . 5.2.2 Baseline assessment The following functional tests will be administered by an experienced researcher . Training and certification of the researchers to perform these tests is described in a separate Outcome Assessment Training and Certification Plan  The Fugl Meyer (FM) will measure functional movement. The FM offers impressive test-retest reliability (total=.98 -.99; subtests=.87 -1.00), and construct validity [Duncan et al. 1983; DiFabio and Badke 1990]. The upper extremity (UE) FM movement scale is a measure of upper li mb function, with higher scores reflecting greater function.  The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) [Lyle 1981] is used to determine whether fine motor skill changes occurred in the affected hand and fingers . The ARAT is a 19 -item test divided into four cat egories (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement), with each item graded on a 4 -point ordinal scale (0=can perform no part of the test; 1=performs test partially; 2=completes test but takes abnormally long time or has great difficulty; 3=performs test norma lly) for a total possible score of 57. The test is hierarchical in that, if the patient is able to perform the most difficult skill in each category, he/she will be able to perform the other items within the category and, thus, they need not be tested. The ARAT has high intrarater ( r = .99) and retest ( r = .98) reliability and validit y [Lyle 1981; Van der Lee et al. 2001]  The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) will be repeated at baseline visit.  EQ-5D The EQ -5D questionnaire is a standardized, well validated instrument for assessing patients ’ health and quality of life. The questionnaire will be utilized to establish the overall impact of stroke on the patients ’ quality of life and used to assess possible changes during the trial p eriod. Diagnostic NBS -TMS session :  motor mapping of the healthy hemisphere, and determination of motor threshold and the optimal cortical representation area of the muscle of interest"
22,page_22,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 of 57 (m.Extensor Digitorum Communis, m.EDC) , The N BS protocol is described in detail in appendix A. 5.2.3 Randomization Randomization will occur using a random number generator programmed to randomize patients to rTMS vs Sham TMS in a 1:1 ratio such that approximately 30 patients will be randomized to treatment and 30 patient s randomized to sham . Randomization will be done separately for each participating site so that the 1:1 ratio for treatment arms will be attained at each participating s ite. In addition, for each site the randomization will be performed in randomly occurring blocks of 3 to 6 patients. Further, patients who have suffered a stroke 3 to 6 months before the trial will be randomized separately from those who have suffered stroke more than 6 months (maximum 1 2 months) earlier. The groups differ only as to the rTMS protocol they receive during the study. The groups are : sham rTMS (900 pulses at 1Hz frequency) , and active NBS -rTMS (900 pulses at 110% of motor threshold , 1Hz frequency ). 5.2.4 Treatment Visits The visits will last approximately 3 hours and will consist of the following . (For detailed description see appendix B ) 1. Review with subject any new medical problems, medication changes or symptoms occurring since last visit (e.g. headache, changes in hearing, seizure) 2. 20 minutes of pre -functional activities ( For detailed description see appendix B ) 3. 10 minute rest 4. 1Hz navigation guided rTMS (For detailed description see appendix A) For patients randomized to receive rTMS , the stimulation will be delivered in a single pulse train 900 pulses given at 110% of motor threshold . The motor threshold will be determined at each visit. The train will be targeted on the motor representation of the m.EDC on the healthy brain hemisphere determined at the basel ine visit (NOTE: the rTMS delivery location will thus be the same at each visit). OR Sham rTMS For patients randomized to receive Sham rTMS , the sham stimulation will be delivered in a single 1Hz pulse train of 900 pulses given using a Sham coil. The train will be targeted on the motor representation of the m.EDC on the healthy brain hemisphere determined at the baseline visit (NOTE: the rTMS delivery location will thus be the same at each visit)."
23,page_23,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 of 57 5. 5-15 minute rest 6. 60 minutes of Task -oriented moto r rehabilitation of the arm and hand (For detailed description see appendix B). 5.2.5 Outcome Assessments The visits will take place 5-10 days , 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the completion of the study treatment visits. The vis its will last approximately 3 hours and consist of the following functional tests which will be performed at each and every outcome assessment visi t:  The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)  Fugl Meyer (FM) o The Fugl -Meyer test is the primary outcome measure fo r the trial.  ARAT  EQ-5D 5.2.6 Occupational therapy, physiotherapy and home exercise program during the active treatment and follow -up periods of the trial Occupational therapy: During the 6 weeks active treatment period of the trial (visits 3-20) the patients are not allowed any other occupational therapy except that provide in the trial. After the active treatment period during the 6 month follow -up period of the trial, patients are allowed occupational therapy. The hours of therapy will be documented. Patients will be queried once every 2 weeks until the final outcome assessment visit at 6 months after end of active trial treatment, either when they visit the study site or they will be called and queried . Physical therapy: Patients are allow ed participation in physical therapy for the full trial duration including during the active treatment period of the trial (visits 3 -20). However, the hours of therapy and time of use of t he affected upper extremity in treatment sessions will be documented . Patients will be queried once every 2 weeks until the final outcome assessment visit at 6 months after end of active trial treatment, either when they visit the study site or they will be called and queried. Home exercise program: During the 6 weeks active treatment period of the trial (visits 3 -20) the patients are not allowed an upper limb home exercise program prescribed by therapists other than the study therapist. The study therapist will provide an upper limb home exercise program for the active treatment period of the trial . The study therapist will also provide an upper limb home exercise program for the post -active treatment period of the trial. However, this home exercise program for the post -active treatment period can be modified by the patient’s own therapist based on her/his assessment of the patient’s clinical needs. The hours of therapy will be documented. Patients will be queried once every 2 weeks until the final outcome assessment visit at 6 months after end of active trial treatment, either when they visit the study site or they will be called and queried"
24,page_24,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 25 of 57 6.0 ANALYSIS PLAN The results of functional motor tests at end of rehabilitation (5-10 days post treatment) and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the end of rehabilitation will be compared to the results obtained at baseline to determine the functional recovery if any that has occurred. The results of patients randomized into separate groups will be compared to each other to dete rmine the effect of rTMS. The primary analysis population will be the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. In addition, a separate analysis will be conducted on the per protocol (PP) population. Primary outcome measure for the trial is the Upper -extremity F ugl-Meyer score. The beneficial effect of 1Hz NBS guided rTMS will be established if a statistically signi ficantly greater proportion of patients receiving NBS -rTMS attain clinically important improvement in the primary outcome measure than patients rece iving sham -rTMS between baseline and 6 months post -treatment. The size of the treatment effect will be measured by the odds ratio parameter which is defined as ) 1/() 1/( REF REFTRT TRT P PP POR where TRTP and REFP denote the proportion of subjects with clinically significant change from baseline in Fugl-Meyer score, in the treatment and reference groups respectively. The null hypothesis is 1 :0ORH and the two -sided alternative hypothesis is 1 :1ORH . The proportion of responders in each treatment group will be summarized, along with the estimated odds ratio, the 95% confidence interval for OR, and the Wald Chi -square test p - value. The primary analys is will be performed on the ITT, and on the PP pop ulation as a sensitivity analysis. Secondary outcome measures for the trial are ARAT test, , NIHSS, and EQ -5D. Descriptive statistics will be summarized by treatment and visit. Absolute difference (in points) in improvement will be summarized for both treatment groups between baseline and 5 - 10 days and 1, 3 and 6 month follow -up visits and the treatment groups compa red via a two - way ANOVA. 6.1 POWER ANALYSIS AND BORROWING DATA FROM NICHE -TRIAL ACTIVE TRIAL ARM RES ULTS"
25,page_25,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 57 In a pilot study of 30 patients of whom 20 were randomized to active NBS -rTMS and 10 to sham -rTMS, 8 4% of the active NBS -rTMS group and 50% of th e sham rTMS group attained clinically significant improvement of at least 5 points on the Fugl -Meyer score [Harvey RL 2009, Harvey RL, unpublished]. Similarly, in the completed multi -centre trial (NICHE -trial, NCT02089464 ) of 199 subjects using the same trial device but different sham coil design, 72% of subjects with ischemic stroke receiving active NBT -rTMS attained clinically significant improvement of at least 5 points on the Fugl -Meyer score [Harvey RL, manuscript in preparation] while the average expectation of NICHE trial site principal investigators of subjects improving was 36%. Based on this data and sample size calculations utilizing significance level of 0.05 for p, we estimate that enrolling 60 patients need to be recruited to the present study to rule out the null hypothesis that there is no difference between active NB T-rTMS and sham -rTMS with 81% power. This assumption is based on the pilot study finding of 33% difference in responder rate between groups i n favour of the NBS -rTMS group and 36% difference in the actual vs expected responder rate in patients with ischemic stroke in NICHE . However, since the active treatment arm of the present trial and the active trial arm of NICHE are treated in a completely identical manner (the same NBT device, same active rTMS protocol, the same standardized occupational therapy protocol as in NICHE, the same number of therapy sessions in the same schedule at the same trial sites, etc) this allows pooling of the data obtai ned in the NICHE active trial arm to the data obtained in the active trial arm in the present trial. As in NICHE there were 88 subjects with ischemic stroke receiving active NBT -rTMS. Combining their data with that of the present trial will lead into a tri al population of approximately 118 subjects receiving active treatment (88 from NICHE + 30 from the present trial) and approximately 30 subjects receiving sham treatment (all from the present trial). The study power in this population is sufficient to rule out the null hypothesis with 96% power. The statistical analysis of the present trial will be performed in two phases. The Bayesian analysis of the E -FIT data combined with data borrow ed from the active trial arm of the previously completed NICHE trial (NCT02089464) will be the primary efficacy analysis. Non-Bayesian analysis of the E -FIT trial data only will be performed to demonstrate robustness of the result. Detailed methodology for the analyses is described in a separate statistical analysis plan (Document NX103 391 EFIT Statistical Analysis Plan, version 1.0, dated 06 August 2018 ). 6.2 ANALYSIS SCHEDULE No interim analyses will be performed for efficacy. Final analysis including analysis of safety and efficacy will be performed once 60 subjects have completed the trial (completed visit #24). 6.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population The ITT population will consist of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the ITT population will be summarized and analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized, regardless of the treatment they actually received."
26,page_26,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 57 Per Protocol (PP) Population The PP population will consist of all subjects who were randomized, received study treatment, and had no major protocol vio lations. If a subject suffers a new stroke during the trial and the new stroke affects the motor function of the limb being treate d in the study, only the outcome assessment data collected prior to the new stroke will be used for PP Popu lation analysis. The sponsor will review the new strokes and determine if it affects the motor function of the limb. Safety Population The Safety population will consist of all subjects who received study treatment. Subjects in the safety population will be summarized and analyzed according to the treatment they actually received, regardless of whether or not they were randomized to receive that treatment. 6.4 STRATA AND COVARIATES The primary efficacy analysis will be stratified by length of time after stroke (3 -6 months vs. 6 -12 months). Additional covariate analyses will model the primary endpoint (a binary response of UEFM score improvement ) , absolute changes (in points) in the tests of motor function (UEFM, and ARAT ) using hours of occupational therapy outside the trial and overall hours of therapy (occupational, physical, and home exercise ) as covariates during treatment phase and over the entire 6 months of follow -up. All covariate analysis will be performed for both ITT and PP population. 6.5 SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analyses will be conducted with a significance level (α) of 0.05 and utilize two-sided testing. Since the ARAT test has potential to be used for labelling purposes, a Bonferroni adjustment will be employed. A significance level (α) of 0.025 will be used for th is secondary analysi s only. All other secondary analyses will use α = 0.05 as they are not to be used for any labeling purpose. 6.6 DATA HANDLING METHODS 6.6.1 Missing Data 6.6.1.1 Date Values In cases of incomplete dates (e.g., AE, concomitant medication, medical history start and/or stop dates), the missing component(s) will be assumed as the most conservative value(s)"
27,page_27,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 57 possible. For example, if the start date has a missing day value, the first day of the month will be imputed for study day computations (i.e., treatment -emergent status, etc.) unless it is the same month and year (only day missing) or year (day and month missing) as the start date of treatment. In this case, start date of treatment will be used, which assumes treatment emergence. If day is missing for an end date, the last day of the month will be imputed . A similar imputation will be used for missing month dates. Date imputation will only be used for computational purposes e.g., treatment -emergent status, etc. Actual data values as they appear in the original CRFs will be shown in the data listings. 6.6.1.2 Non-Date Values Every effort will be made to obtain the protocol -required data for all study assessments that are scheduled for each visit for all enrolled subjects. Missing values for the primary endpoint of Fugl -Meyer scores for post -baseline visi ts will be imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) for ITT analyses. Subjects with a six -month Fugl - Meyer score but no baseline score will have their six -month Fugl -Meyer score imputed backwards to serve as their missing baseline Fugl -Meyer s core. Subjects with no baseline or six -month Fugl -Meyer score will have the mean baseline Fugl -Meyer score for their treatment arm imputed for both their baseline and six -month score. These same imputation methods will be used for secondary endpoints as w ell. 6.7 SAFETY ANALYSES The Safety Population will be used for all analysis, summaries, and listings of safety data. Adverse Events All reported terms (investigator descriptions) for AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA v16.0) and summarized with frequencies and percentages by treatment group, system organ classific ation, and preferred term. Note that subjects experiencing AEs are counted at most one time per preferred term and at most one time per system organ class, at the highest recorded severity and causality. Events without recorded relationship or causality are summarized as severe or definitely related. The number and percentage of subjects in the following categories will be summarized by group and overall: subjects with AE, TEAE, SAE, TESAE, UADE, DRAE, TEAE resulting in study discontinuation, and deaths. The following tables will also be presented: - All TEAEs - SAEs and TESAEs - TEAEs by severity - TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation of study treatment. Separate data listings will be presented for all AEs and SAEs."

All UADEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. A listing of UADEs will also be provided. Device -Related Adverse Events (DRAE) A DRAE is defined as any AE that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study device. All DRAEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. A listing of DRAEs will also be provided. 6.7.1 Primary Safety Analysis The use of study treat ment will be considered safe if the proportion of SAEs in the active rTMS group is not statistically significantly higher than that in the sham group. Number of subjects with SAEs and TESAEs will be summarized by group and compared using a Chi Square test. 6.7.2 Use of Safety results in future labeling A summary of SAE, UADE and DRAE will be included in future labelling of the NBT device. 6.8 ASSESSMENT OF BLINDIN G SUCCESS Subject blinding Success The patients will be asked at the end of the baseline visit (Visit 2), at the end of the first treatment visit (Visit 3), at the end of the last treatment visit (Visit 20 and at the 6 month follow - up visit (Visit 24) whether they think they were in the active group or in the sham group. The data will be summarized with frequency and percentage by actual treatment received. Chi - square test will be used for this assessment of subject blinding success. Outcome Assessmen t Therapist Blinding Success Outcome assessment therapists will be asked at the first follow -up visit (Visit 21) and at the 6 month outcome assessment visit (Visit 24) whether they think the subject was in the active rTMS group or in the sham rTMS group or they didn’t know. The data will summarized with frequency and percentage by treatment group received. Chi -square test will used for assessment of outcome assessment therapist blinding success. In addition, the therapists will be asked if the study staf f revealed group randomization and if the subject told them what group they believed they were in. The data will be summarized for those therapists who don’t know which group the subject was in and those who think the subject was in either the active or sh am rTMS group separately. The data will used for background information to explain the results of assessment of therapist blinding success."

At this visit and all monitoring visits, the Cli nical Monitor will compare the data entered onto the CRF's with the hospital or clinic records (source documentation). At a minimum, source documentation must be available to substantiate proper informed consent procedures, adherence to protocol procedure s, adequate reporting and follow -up of AEs. Findings from the review of CRFs and source documents during a monitoring visit will be discussed with the PI. Completed pages of the CRFs will be collected for evaluation at each visit. The dates of the monit oring visit will be recorded in a Log to be kept at the clinical site. During monitoring visits, the Sponsor expects that the study coordinator and the PI will be available (as needed), the source documentation will be available, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of Study related documents. Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board The study will be performed under the supervision of an Independent Data Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will consist of clinician who are not I nvestigator(s) in the study, and one independent statistician."
30,page_30,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 57 Details of the DSMB composition and operational activities will be described in detail in a separate DSMB charter. Briefly, the DSMB responsibilities are to: • evaluate the progress of the trial, including assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome; • consi der factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial; • protect the safety of the study participa nts; • report on the safety and progress of the trial; • make recommendations to the Sponsor , the PI, and, if required, to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Institutional Review Board (IRB) concerning continuation, termination or other modif ications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study; • • ensure the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring; and, • assist Sponsor by commenting on any problems with study conduct, enrollment, and sample size and/or data collection. All subjects will be monitored by a member of study staff during the study visits. All cases performed during a calendar month will be reviewed at the end of that month to monitor for any poten tial adverse effects from the subjects’ participation in the study. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTI NG GUIDELINE Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and the sponsor verbally within 24 hours, followed by a full written report within 10 working days. All other adverse events will be summarized in the progress report at Continuing Review by IRB and evaluated by DSMB . All adverse events will be assessed for their relationship to the study device or procedure by DSMB . Throughout the study, adverse eve nts and concomitant medications will be monitored and recorded. All Serious Adverse Events will be captured and assessed. All Serious Adverse Events will be reported as event and patient based count. ADVERSE EVENT An adverse event (AE) is any undesirab le clinical experience (any sign, symptom, illness, abnormal laboratory value or other medical event) that occurs in a subject (or an event that worsens during the course of the study) and that could possibly be associated with the investigational product, procedure or medications required by this protocol. An adverse event may result from a device failure if an undesirable clinical event occurs. In this study, subjects should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously."
31,page_31,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 32 of 57 Adverse event information will be c ollected throughout the study. Data collection will include event type, date of onset severity relationship to the procedure and investigational device, and event resolution, if any, at the conclusion of the study. All events will be followed for the duration of the study until they are resolved or their status at study conclusion is explained. Serious Adverse Event Each study investigator must decide whether an adverse event meets the definition of a “serious” adverse event. The regulatory definition o f a serious adverse event (SAE) is an event that is fatal or life -threatening, results in persistent or significant disability, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment, results in hospitalization (or prolongation of a hospitalization) or resu lts in congenital anomaly or malignancy. Any serious adverse event or subject death occurring during the study follow -up period must be reported within one working day after the investigator learns of the event. Device Failure, Malfunctions and Near Incidents Investigators are instructed to report all possible device failures, malfunctions or near incidents observed during the course of the trial. These incidents will be documented in the case report form provided as follows: Device Failure: A dev ice failure has occurred when the device is used in compliance with the study protocol , but does not perform as described in device manual and also negatively impacts treatment of the study subject. Device Malfunction: A device malfunction occurs when an unexpected change to the device that is contradictory to the device manual is observed, which may or may not affect device performance. Device Misuse: Any use of the investigational device by an investigator that is contradictory to the application described in the study protocol will be categorized as device misuse."

37,page_37,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 38 of 57 Appendix A NBT PROCEDURES GENERAL For the navigated TMS session with NBT , the subject will undergo the MRI to head registration and Motor Threshold and TMS procedures. Each TMS imaging session will begin with aligning the MRI images to the subject’s head via the MRI to head co -registration. Subjects will then undergo TMS mapping of the hand motor areas as set out below to localize optimal the motor representation area of hand muscles including the muscle of interest, m.EDC. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY EMG leads must be connected to m.EDC and m.APB to facilitate accurate mapping of the m.EDC motor representation area s: 1. Abductor Pollicis Brevis (APB) 2. Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC) NOTE: The target muscle(s) should be at rest at all times. Monitor involuntary muscle activity at all times during the examination. MRI TO HEAD CO-REGISTRATION Using the nasion and the crus of hel ix of the ear s, landmarks that are visible on both the subject’s MRI and the head, the 3D -locations of landmark are measured using a digitizing pen with an optical tracking system. This registration will allow real time monitoring of the coil position wit hout restraining the subjects head during the TMS experiment. The optical tracking system uses a camera to measure the 3D -location of infrared reflectors attached to the coil and subject’s head. BASELINE , TREATMENT VISITS The motor mapping of the healthy hemisphere will be done during the baseline visit and this location will be utilized in determining the motor threshold and therapy intensity during each treatment visit when rTMS is administered. Motor mapping of the lesioned hemisphere will not be perfo rmed. The following list illustrates which procedures are done during the first and subsequent visits. The details of the steps are described in the following sections. 1) Healthy hemisphere a) Baseline visit i) Hand area motor mapping (1) Initial motor mapping (2) Initial motor threshold (3) Refined mapping ii) Therapy dose determination (1) Refined motor threshold iii) Offline analysis b) Following visits i) Therapy dose determination (1) Refined motor threshold"
38,page_38,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 39 of 57 ii) Therapy delivery iii) rTMS stimulation iv) Offline analysis HEALTHY HEMISPHERE HAND AREA MOTOR MAPPING Localization of the cortical representation area for m.EDC at rest is described here . Attach mapping c oil (Nexstim Focal Coil) Mapping of the motor cortical representation areas and determination of motor thresholds will be done usi ng the Nexstim Focal Coil. Attach the coil to the system if not already connected. Identifying the rough location of hand motor area This identification of the rough location of hand motor area is used in determination of the initial motor threshold and as a referenc e for the actual motor mapping. 1) Identify the hand knob at pri mary motor cortex, if possible. a) Peel the 3D head to a depth where the gyral patterns of neuroanatomy are clearly visible (approximately 20 -25 mm ) b) For reference utilized during mapping place a stimulation target on the motor cortex. The position of the marker is on the medial end of the so called “motor knob” on the central sulcus. 2) Set initial stimulation intensity a) Adjust stimulator output so that the software displays stimulation intensity between 80 and 100 V/m (at 25 mm peeling depth). b) Give a preparing stimulus pulse on the marker and check the response of the target muscle m.EDC c) Give two stimuli are on the target and check m.EDC response latencies (normal 15 - 25ms) and amplitudes . i) IF YOU GET EMG RESPONSE >500uV : Lower the stimulation intensity 1 – 2 % of stimulator output and repeat stimulation until the m.EDC peak -to-peak response is in the range of 100 -500uV. ii) IF YOU GET EMG RESPONSE <100uV : Increase the intensity of stimulus u ntil the m.EDC amplitude is 100 -500uV. 3) Using the intensity defined in the previous step, continue stimulation by following the central sulcus towards the central fissure so that the stimulus orientation is always perpendicular to the central sulcus and dir ection frontal. Stimulation is ended when there is no response. This is most likely to happen about 2 cm from the marker. NOTE: Make sure that you stimulate also directly over the precentral gyrus. Return to the marker and continue stimulation by following the central sulcus towards the Sylvian fissure so that the stimulation direction is always perpendicular to the central sulcus. Expand the stimulated area until MEP’s disappear. 4) Select the largest m.EDC response and set is as Repeat S timulus."
39,page_39,"CONFIDENTIAL Page 40 of 57 5) Testing coil orientations: a) The first stimulus is given on the repeat stimulus target. This is the zero degree position. Check the EMG response amplitude which is now the reference. Turn off location controlled stimulation. Using the aiming tool to repeat stimulus on the marker, the stimulation on the marker is continued so that after each stimulus the coil is turned 20 degrees left. The m.EDC response amplitude (µV) is checked after each given stimulus. The stimulation is terminated when the response is less than 100µ V. b) Return to the original orientation on the marker and continue stimulation on the marker so that after every stimulus the coil is turned 20 degrees right. After every stimulus the response amplitude (µV) is checked. Stimulation is terminated when t he response is less than 100µV. c) The coil orientation giving the best motor response is selected for defining the motor threshold. Initial motor threshold measurement for defining intensity for motor mapping : The motor threshold (MT) is defined as the lowest stimulation intensity producing a response in the target muscle (m.Extensor Digitorum Communis, m.EDC) at least in 50% of trials. The presumption is that the motor threshold varies due to the functional state of the brain which may be altered by lesions or medications. 1) Start the MT determination tool from the stimulus defined in the previous step. 2) Stimulate guided by the Aiming Tool as many times as suggested by the software, leaving 3-5 seconds between each stimulus . 3) In the end of the iteration, the software displays the patient’s motor threshold value as a percentage of the maximum stimulator output. Mapping of hand motor area and localization of m.EDC hotspot Mapping of the cortical representation area of the hand area is now repeated using a stimul ator intensity that generates ~ 100 -300µV MEPs repeatably at the location where resting motor threshold is determined. Typically this is 110% of the resting motor threshold. The overall goal is to find a stimulation location, on or near the motor strip, t hat elicits the largest amplitude EDC MEP during mapping with other relatively large EDC MEPs elicited at the same location or at nearby locations. 1) Set the stimulator output to 110% of the motor threshold defined previously 2) Once the stimulation intensit y is determined, the rMT determining location should be set as the active stimulation t arget to overlay a stimulation G rid on cortex."

Mapping should proceed with 3 stimuli per grid location, deli vered with 3 -4s between pulses, until stimulation at locations around the “rim” or outer edge of the map do not produce reproducible MEPs (=at least 2/3 stimuli to location do not elicit a MEP >50 µV). 4) Expand the stimulated area as long as reproducible motor responses emerge. 5) Identify the location giving rise to the largest m.EDC EMG response - the target for rTMS 5.1 Rank the EDC MEPs by amplitude 5.2 Select the MEP with highest amplitude that fills as many of the following criteria as possible 5.2.1 Background EMG was quiet during this stimulation 5.2.2 The location is on or near the motor strip 5.2.3 The other two MEPs generated at this location are also large 5.2.4 There is also a clear resting MEP in APB 5.2.5 The adjacent locations al so have strong, repeatable MEPs. 5.3 NOTE: The location chosen may not be the absolute highest amplitude MEP from the mapping. We are trying to find a location that represents the strong center of activation for hand and finger muscles, shown by large repeatable MEPs. We want to avoid selecting an isolated a ctivation center for EDC far from M1, or one that represents a transient high fluctuation in cortical excitability. 6) Test coil orientations in this location as done in initial mapping and select the best motor response is for defining the refined motor threshold The location defined in the refined mapping including coil orientation testing is considered the hotspot of m.EDC and will be used as the target location for subsequent MT determinations and delivering 1 Hz rTMS therapy. THERAPY DELIVERY For rT MS delivery the best coil orientation giving rise to the largest m.EDC response from refined mapping will be used as the coil orientation during rTMS delivery. The rTMS delivery will be performed at 110% of the motor threshold determined at this location in the previous step."

Attach the TMS coil appropriate for the subject’s randomization group (Nexstim Trial Coil) Motor threshold measurement for defining intensity for rTMS therapy. The location defined in the refined mapping including coil orientation testing is considered the hotspot of m.EDC and will be used as the target location for subsequent MT determinations a nd delivering 1 Hz rTMS therapy. 1) Start the MT determination tool from the stimulus defined in the previous step. 2) Stimulate guided by the Aiming Tool as many times as suggested by the software, leaving 3-5 seconds between each stimulus . For subjects randomized to receive sham stimulation, alternatively accept and reject the results suggested by the NBT software. 3) In the end of the iteration, the software displays the patient’s motor threshold value as a percentage of the maximum stimulator output. RTMS stimulation 1) Select the stimulus corresponding to the largest m.EDC response from refined motor mapping (same stimulus as used as reference during refined M T determination) and set it as Repeat Stimulus 2) Position therapy coil using coil positioning holder to location guided by Aiming Tool 3) Select rTMS sequence containing 900 stimuli at 1 Hz (15 minute duration) 4) Check that the intensity corresponds to 110 % of t he refined m.EDC MT defined in previous step 5) Start rTMS sequence and monitor coil position OFF-LINE ANALYSIS 1) From details of the therapy rTMS sequence review statistics for accuracy of pulses in relation to the reference pulse / first pulse of sequence, i. e. how well the coil stayed in place during the sequence run. 2) From motor mapping, identify optimal m.APB and EDC locations (the stimulus location evoking the largest EMG responses, respectively). 3) Define coil coordinates, coordinates on the chosen stimula tion surface (3D -MR image), and coordinates at fixed depth (25 mm from the scalp surface). Review MEP traces and correct the amplitudes and latencies if needed. 4) Capture all stimuli eliciting muscle responses with normal latencies and greater than or equal to 50 µV in relaxed muscles."

The level of confidence on the 10 point confidence scale of performance sh ould be 5 or less for these tasks. These will be the target functional tasks addressed during the therapy program during the last 30 minutes of therapy daily. In any given therapy session, none, one or both of the tasks may be practiced with emphasis on advancing skill and use of the involved upper limb. The therapist and subject together will problem solve on how to perform the activities using the impaired arm and hand . The activities of daily living should not be graded by using the easiest possible compensatory method. Rather, the activities should be therapeutic for the subject as well as functional with the goal to advance skill on the task . Therapeutic, in this case, refers to facilitating greater use of the involved upper limb. The first section below is a list of possibilities for utilizing the upper extremity during the any of the ADLs. The next section lists a selected number of ADLs and describe possibilities for activity grading. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. These or other ac tivities may be adapted by changing the position, objects, task requirements, or motor patterns of the subject. NOTE: THE THERAPIST DOES NOT NEED TO FOLLOW THESE SUGGESTIONS AS THEY ARE MEANT ONLY AS GUIDELINES. IN ADDITION THE THERAPIST AND SUBJECT MAY SELECT OTHER FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES NOT LISTED, BUT WHEN DOING SO THEY SHOULD USE A SIMILARLY DESIGNED TASK - ORIENTED APPROACH.
