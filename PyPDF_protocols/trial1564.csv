Study Design This is a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study. Up to a pproximately 114 subjects with small fiber neuropathy will be randomized 1:1 to VX -150 or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by sex and diagnosis of diabetes. Subjects with diabetes will not exceed approximately 60% of the total number of subjects. Subjects with diabetes and HbA1c ≥8% and <11% at screening will not exceed approximately 20% of the total number of subjects. This study will include: • A 7-day Run- in Period to establish the baseline NRS pain score • A 6-week Treatment Period • A 28 -day Safety Follow -up Period Assessments Efficacy : NRS, DSIS, PGIC, Safety: AEs, C -SSRS, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations (PEs). PK: Plasma PK parameters of VRT -1207355 and VRT -1268114 Statisti cal Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11 -point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a within -group treatme nt comparison in the VX- 150 treatment group. The analysis will be conducted using a mixed -effects model fo r repeated measures (MMRM). The between -group treatment comparison will also be generated using the same MMRM. The model will include the change fro m study baseline in the weekly average of daily NRS pain score as the dependent variable; treatment, sex, diagnosis of diabetes, week, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; and baseline pain intensity score as a covariate. In the model, week will be treated as a class variable, and an unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed to model the within- subject variability. The estimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for VX -150 will be provided for the within- group ch ange. The CI will first be used to facilitate the comparison with 0; this will be followed by a comparison with 0.8. In addition, the estimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for the between -group difference will be provided ."

It is a protective mechanism designed to prevent tissue injury. When pain persists beyond its usefulness, it becomes pathological and can prove debilitating. Current pain therapies suffer from poor efficacy and have a high risk of adverse events (AEs). For example, lidocaine (a nonselective sodium channel blocker) may effectively reduce pain, but its utility is limited because of prominent side effects when given at dose levels required for pain relief. 1 Opioid pain medications have a high abuse liability with approximately 16,000 annual deaths in the US and between 10,000 and 20,000 annual deaths in Europe due to overdose. 2, 3 In addition, opioid- induced hyperalgesia also limits the long-term use of opioids. While the incidence of opioid-induced hyperalgesia is not known, it is encountered regularly in clinical practice and creates significant challenges in pain management. 4 The limited treatment options for pain, particularly chronic pain indications, combined with a growing awareness of the risks of the current standards of care underscore the need for new pain management therapies. Voltage-gated sodium channel s (Na v) play a critical role in pain signaling based on both nonclinical and clinical evidence. Evaluation of the role these channels play in normal physiology and the pathological states arising from mutations in sodium channel genes and animal models, as well as the pharmacology of known sodium channel modulating agents, all point to the critical role of Na vs in pain sensation.5-7 The Na v1.8 channel is primarily rest ricted to peripheral neurons that sense pain (e.g., dorsal root ganglia) and is known to mediate pain sensation and chronic pain. For example, Na v1.8 gain-of-function mutations are thought to directly cause chronic pain in some patients with painful small fiber neuropathy.8-10 This channel has been identified as a target for analgesia11 and selective Na v1.8 blockers, which have the potential to treat pain indications where the primary mechanism for pain is nociceptor hyperexcitability. VX-150, an orally bioavailable prodrug that rapidly converts in vivo to the active moiety VRT -1207355, is being developed for the treatment of pain. VRT-1207355 is a Na v1.8 blocker that is highly selective for Na v1.8 relative to the other sodium channel subtypes. To date, 4 Phase 1 clinical studies have been compl eted with VX-150. One Phase 2a study has completed dosing; Study VX15 -150-101 (Study 101) is a proof of concept study to evaluate efficacy in patients with osteoarthritis pain . Overall, VX-150 has been well tolerated without any safety concerns. Additional details of the VX -150 development program are available in the VX -150 Investigator’s Brochure .12 Small fiber n europathy is a distinct clinical condition caused by diseases affecting peripheral small nerve fibers (Aδ - and C-fibers). Common symptoms include burning pain in the feet and"
17,page_17,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 18 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated evoked pain (e.g., pressure and touch allodynia). Diagnosis is defined as possible, probable, and definite based on the combination of symptoms, signs, evidence of large sensory nerve fiber function integrity by nerve conduction studies (NCS) and abnormal skin biopsy or quantitative sensory testing. 13, 14 By inhibiting Na V1.8 in the peripheral nerve fibers, VX-150 has the potential to treat pain caused by hyperexcitability of the damaged or diseased nerves. Study VX16 -150-102 is a proof of concept study that will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of VX-150 in the treatment of neuropathic pain in subjects with small fiber neuropathy. 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 6.1 Prima ry Objective To evaluate the efficacy of VX -150 for the treatment of pain caused by small fiber neuropathy 6.2 Secondary Objectives • To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-150 • To evaluate the PK of VRT-1207355 and the metabolite VRT-1268114 7 STUDY ENDPOINTS 7.1 Primary Endpoint Change from baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11- point numeric rating scale (NRS), as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6 7.2 Secondary Endpoints • Proportion of subjects with ≥30% reduction in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6 • Proportion of subjects with ≥50% reduction in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6 • Change from bas eline in the Daily Sleep Interference Scale (DSIS) at Week 6 • Proportion of subjects categorized as improved at Week 6 on the patient global impression of change (PGIC) assessment • Change from baseline in pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported at study visits, at Week 6 • Plasma PK parameters of VRT -1207355 and the metabolite VRT-1268114 • Safety and tolerability based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS), incidence and type of AEs, changes from baseline in clinically significant labo ratory test results, vital signs, and ECGs at each visit"

Up to a pproximately 114 subjects with small fiber neuropathy will be randomized 1:1 to VX-150 or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by sex and diagnosis of diabetes. Subjects with diabetes will not exceed approximately 60% of the total number of subjects. Subjects with diabetes and HbA1c ≥8% and <11% at screening will not exceed approximately 20% of the total number of subjects. This study will include: • A 7-day Run- in Period to establish the baseline NRS pain score • A 6-week Treatment Period • A 28 -day Safety Follow-up Period Figure 9-1 Schematic of Study Design D: Day; qd: daily; W: Week 9.1.1 Screening Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1. Screening will occur within 28 days before administration of study drug. The Screening Visit can occur between Days - 28 and -8. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee a t the study site) will obtain informed consent from each subject. To prepare for study participation, subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions (Section 9.4). During screening, subjects will discont inue their current pain treatments as outlined in Section 9.4.1. Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen as needed (prn), following the guidelines in Section 9.4.1. Subjects will be instructed during screening on appropriate expectations around their participation in a clinical study and the importance of consistently and accurately reporting their pain throughout the study (e.g., “Participating in a Research Study” and “Reporting Your Pain”, Analgesic Solutions, Natick, MA). Review of these educational materials may be repeated for"
21,page_21,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 22 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated some or all subjects depending on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain score variability is increased on a su bject or site level). Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened, with the following exceptions, all of which require medical monitor approval: • Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g., upper respiratory infection with fever) in the 5 days before the first study drug dose that was properly evaluated and which resolved fully • Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation within the allotted scree ning window • Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to commit to all study procedures • Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but are not randomized for administrative reasons (e.g., interactive web or voice response system [IXRS] is temporarily inaccessible or nonfunctional, or study drug is not available at the study site) Any subject granted approval by the medical monitor for any of the exceptions listed above may have the screening window extended by 1 week before needing to undergo any rescreening assessments. If more than 35 days have elapsed from screening before first dose of study drug, all screening assessments, except skin biopsy and NCS, need to be repeated. Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, unless there is clear evidence of a laboratory error (e.g., hemolysis of sample). In all cases, the medical monitor must authorize retesting. 9.1.2 Run-in Period Run-in Period assessments are listed i n Table 3-2 and will occur from Day -7 through Day -1 during screening. During the Run- in Period, subjects will report their average pain as described in Section 11.5 to establish the baseline NRS pain score. Subjects will follow the pain treatment restrictions outlined in Section 9.4.1. Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen prn, following the guidelines in Section 9.4.1, as a rescue medication for intermittent pain. 9.1.3 Treatment Period Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table 3-2. All study periods will be conducted as described previously in Section 9.1. Dosing details are given in Section 9.3.2. During the Treatment Period, subjects will follow the pain treatment restrictions outlined in Section 9.4.1. Subjects will be permitted to take acetaminophen prn, following the guidelines in Section 9.4.1, as a rescue medication for intermittent pain. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit, and complete assessments for all study visits, as described in Section 9.1.5. 9.1.4 Follow -up Subjects will have a Safety Follow-up Visit 28 (± 7) days after the last study drug dose. Safety Follow- up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2."
22,page_22,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 23 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.1.5 Early Termination of Treatment If the subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject decides to terminate study drug treatment. Subjects who prematurely disco ntinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days (± 7) days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in Table 3-2. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required. If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified randomization vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the production of the final randomization list, which will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician who is not a member of the study execution team (SET). 9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of VX -150 for treatment of pain in subjects with small fiber neuropathy. The randomized, double-blind study design will limit observer bias, minimize carryover effect and reduce the possibility for unblinding. The pote ntial for a carryover effect is due either to the potential subjective nature of pain measurements and/or the effect of treatment with VX -150. For the primary endpoint, daily NRS pain scores will be averaged over a weekly period to reduce the impact on the analyses of individual high or low pain scores. 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration The VX-150 dose selected for this study will be 1250 mg qd administered under fasting conditions using a capsule formulation."
23,page_23,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 24 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.3.3 Rationale for Study Assessments 11-point NRS: Pain intensity is the FDA -recommended efficacy endpoint for studies of pain drugs .16, 17 This evaluation is a standard pain assessment scale used in many pain registration studies. The 11 -point scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain). The minimum clinically important difference for an individual is considered to be a 1-point change from baseline, approximately equivalent to 15% to 20% improvement. Changes of 2 points are considered equivalent to approximately 30% to 36% improvement (i.e., meaningful improvement); and changes of ≥4 points are considered equivalent to ≥50% improvement (i.e., substantial improvement). 17, 18 DSIS: Pain frequently interferes with sleep and sleep is important to quality of life. The FDA recommends evaluating the effect of analgesics on sleep. 16, 17 DSIS is commonly used in neuropathic pain studies and is assessed on an 11 -point NRS. The 11- point scale ranges from 0 (none) to 10 (severe). PGIC: The PGIC is commonly used in neuropathic pain studies, and the IMMPACT group recommends it as a core outcome measure for chronic pain studies .17 There is some evidence that PGIC may be more sensitive in neuropathic pain studies than pain intensity assessments because it may assess additional quality of life measures.18 The assessment consists of a single item on a 7-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). C-SSR S: The FDA recommends the evaluation of suicidality in clinical studies. The C- SSRS evaluates this through a series of questions about suicidal thoughts and behaviors."
24,page_24,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 25 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated NCS: NCS are a standard assessment for the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. Normal NCS are part of the diagnostic criteria for small fiber neuropathy. NCS will be performed to rule out large nerve fiber involvement. Skin biopsy : Punch skin biopsy will be performed at screening to confirm the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy based on the epidermal nerve fiber density. Skin biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy. 9.4 Study Restrictions Study restrictions are summarized in Table 9-1.

At the Day 7 clinic visit, 1 PK sample will be collected before the dose of study drug, and 1 PK sample will be collected 1 to 4 hours after the dose of study drug. 9.6 Dose Modification for Toxicity If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing ( Section 9.1.5). 9.7 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study proc edures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent. Subjects who discontinue study treatment early should continue to retur n for safety assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.5. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be mad e to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow- up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.5) , and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. Vertex may re tain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.8 Replacement of Subjects Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment period may be replaced at Vertex's discretion."

Study drug labeling will be in compliance with applicable local and national regulations. Additional details regarding packaging, labeling, and dispensing for VX-150 will be included in the Pharmacy Manual. 10.3 Study Drug Supply, Storage, and Handling The investigator, or an authorized designee (e.g., a licensed pharmacist), will ensure that all investigational product is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. To ensure adequate records, all study drugs will be accounted for via the drug accountability forms as instructed by Vertex. Table 10-1 lists the storage conditions for the capsules. Table 10-1 Study Drug Drug Name Formulation/ Route Dosage Packaging VX-150 Capsule/Oral 1250 mg, qd Supplied as 250 -mg capsules VX-150 placebo Capsule/Oral None Supplied as capsules 10.4 Drug Accountability The pharmacist or designated study site staff will maintain information regarding the dates and amounts of (1) study drug received; (2) study drug dispensed to the subjects; and (3) study drug returned by the subjects. Subjects will be instructed to return all unused mater ials associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee until inventoried by the study monitor. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. 10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. At the end of the study, the study monitor will provide instructions as to the disposition of any unused investigational product. If the study monitor authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance Drug accountability will be assessed at each clinic visit by counting returned dosage units. Discrepancies will be discussed with the subject and recorded in the source documents. If subjects demonstrate continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts,"

This indivi dual, however, will not be a member of the SET, and will not interact with the clinical research unit (CRU) or study personnel. In addition, a Vertex Clinical Pharmacologist will be partially unblinded to help in management of the PK workspace and ensure t hat only the blinded PK data set is being provided for preliminary analysis. This individual, however, will not be a member of the SET, and will not interact with the CRU or study personnel. Masked IDs will be used for these analyses. 10.7.2 Unblinding At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of the individual subject's treatment by the investigator will be limited to medic al emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact th e medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding."
29,page_29,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 30 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medica l monitor. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. If a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject's study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and wi ll not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time. 11 ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Timing of Assessments The timing of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight. 11.3 Pharmacokinetics 11.3.1 Blood Sampling For the evaluation of plasma concentrations of VRT -1207355 and VRT-1268114, blood samples will be collected from all subjects according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 3-2). These samples may also be used for evaluations of VX -150, metabolites of VRT -1207355, for further evaluation of the bioanalytical method, and for analyses that provide information on the metabolic pathways used by or affected by VX-150 and VRT-1207355. Blood samples collected from subjects administered placebo will not be routinely analyzed.

From Day -7 through Week 6, subjects will report their average daily pain during the last 24 hours on the NRS via electronic diary. At study visits , subjects will also report their average pain during the last 24 hours on the NRS. The NRS scores from the daily diary will be used in the primary endpoint analysis, and the proportion of subjects with ≥30% and ≥50% reduction in weekly average scores as reported in the daily diary and at study visits will be used in the secondary endpoint analyses. DSIS: The DSIS will be completed each morning in an electronic diary to describe how pain interfered with the subject’s sleep. PGIC: The PGIC will be completed at study visits to quantify the change in subjects’ overall status. 11.6 Safety Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, clinical evaluation of vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations (PEs), and the C- SSRS."

Levels will be within the laboratory’s range for postmenopausal levels for subjects to be considered of non-childbearing potential. • Serology includes testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV 1/HIV 2). • HbA1c (for subjects with diabetes only) • Thyroid function test • Methylmalonic acid • Vitamin B12 Clinical laboratory assessments from screening will have no clinically significant findings that preclude participation in the study, as judged by the investigator, for a subject to receive study drug on Day 1. Pregnancy testing for female subjects of childbearing potential (as defined in Section 11.6.6.1 ): Pregnancy test results must be negative for female subjects of childbearing potential to receive study drug. During treatment, if a urine or serum pregnancy test is positive, all study drug dosing will stop and the pregnancy will be confirmed with a serum β -hCG test. If confirmed, the pregnancy will be reported and the subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as discussed in Section 11.6.6.2. If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section 11.6.6.2 will be followed. Drug and alcohol testing: Opiates, methadone, amphetamines/methamphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, and benzodia zepines will be assessed by a urine test. Alcohol will be assessed by a blood, urine, or breath test. Subjects may undergo random drug and alcohol testing if deemed appropriate by the investigator. Drug and alcohol test results must be negative for all subjects to receive study drug. Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For purposes of study conduct, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE o n the local laboratory value ."

The neurological component of the Day 1 complete PE includes the bedside sensory testing kit (BSTK) for the purpose of standardized assessment and phenotyping of subjects’ pain, using the usual components of the neurological examination. Included in the BSTK are standard tools used in assessment of the neurological system, including a turning fork, foam brushes, von Frey fiber, and safety pins. A focused neurological examination will be performed at all other visits after the Day 1 Visit. The focused neurological examination includes: testing of strength via the Medical Research Council (MRC) rating scale, reflexes, sensation to light touch, and pin prick. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (ora l), pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest in the seated or supine position. 11.6.4 Electrocardiograms Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1 and Table 3-2) . Additional standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines: • The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG performed. • The ECG will be performed before any procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood sampling. The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site at the Screening Visit and Safety Follow- up Visit. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow- up Visit will be recorded as AEs. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshol d value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. A subject with a QTcF value above the threshold valu e will discontinue dosing."

Male subjects must also not donate sperm from the first study drug dose through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements. The contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following: • True abstinence for the subject, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. • If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through examination of a semen specimen. • If the female is of non-childbearing potential. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, the female m ust meet at least 1 of the following criteria: o Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 2 years and a serum follicle- stimulating hormone level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females o Documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or hyste rectomy • Same sex relationships Unique situations that may not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the sponsor’s medical monitor or designee on an individual basis."

If a subject or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the subject’s (or partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Safety Information Collection Form. If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed for safety (adverse events) until the end of the pregnancy and similarly, the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for this protocol.

The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be a within -group treatment comparison in the VX-150 treatment group. The 95% CI for the within -group change will be used to evaluate if there is any significant change from baseline ( within -group change against 0). Additional analyses will include an evaluation of this within -group change against 0.8, an expected change from the placebo group, and a 95% CI for the between-group comparison of change from baseline. Assuming a within -group change of 0.8 for placebo and a bet ween -group treatment difference of 1.25 22-24, the expected within-group change for VX-150 is 2.05. W ith an SD of 2.08, the power for the 95% CI for the within -group change to rule out 0 or 0.8 is summarized in Table 12 -1 for 25, 35, or 45 evaluable subjects per group. The power for the 95% CI for the between-group treatment difference to rule out 0 is also provided . In order to allow for withdrawal of up to 20% of randomized subjects over 6 weeks of treatment, the study will enroll and randomize a minimum of approximately 62 subjects (25 evaluable subjects per group) and up to approximately 114 subjects (45 evaluable subject s per group) in total.

The All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who have been randomized or have received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used in subject listings and disposition summary table, unless otherwise specified. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS is to be used in efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group and not to the treatment they actually received. The Safety Set is defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set is to be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received and not according to their randomized treatment group.

This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses of efficacy and safety. The Vertex Biometrics department will analyze the data derived from this study. Statistical Analysis System Version 9.2 or higher will be used to generate all statistical outputs (tables, figures, listings, and data sets). Statistical analysis and presentation details will be provided in the SAP. 12.3.1 General Considerations All individual subject data for all individual subjects randomized or exposed to study drug will be presented in data listings. Continuous data will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, SE, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages. Baseline value for the NRS daily diary scores and the DSIS will be defined as the average score from Day -7 to Day - 1. For all other variables baseline will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement collected before the initial administration of study drug. 12.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The disposition summary will be based on the All Subjects Set. The number and percentage of subjects in each of the following disposition categories will be summarized based on the FAS: completed treatment, prematurely discontinued the treatment and the reason for discontinuation, completed study (i.e., completed Safety Follow- up Visit), and prematurely discontinued study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation. 12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group based on the FAS: sex, age, race, ethnicity, weight, height, BMI, diagnosis of diabetes, and pain in the Run-in Period. No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment groups. 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications taken 28 days before the Screening Visit and up to the Safety Follow- up Visit will be summarized by Preferred Name using the World Health Organization -Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO- DDE) for the FAS as frequ ency tables in 2 parts: 1. Prior medication: Medication that started before the first dose of study drug, regardless of when dosing of the medication ended. 2. Concomitant medication: Medication received at or after the first dose of study drug, medication that was received before initial dosing and continued after initial dosing of study drug, or medication with missing stop date."

Medications with a missing start date will be considered to have a start date before the first dose of study drug. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Exposure to study drug (i.e., duration of treatme nt) will be summarized for the FAS in terms of duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day minus the first day of study drug plus 1. Dosing compliance will be summarized for the FAS, and is calculated as the actual number of dosing occasions at which study drug was administered, as a percentage of the planned number of dosing occasions. Duration of treatment and dosing compliance will be summarized by means of descriptive summary statistics. 12.3.3 Efficacy Analysis Assessment of efficacy of VX -150 is the primary objective of this study. All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed based on the FAS. 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Variable The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be a within-group treatment comparison in the VX-150 treatment group. The analysis will be conducted using a mixed- effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The between -group treatment comparison will also be generated using the same MMRM. The model will include the change from study baseline in the weekly average of daily pain intensity score as the dependent variable; treatment, sex, diagnosis of diabetes, week, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects; subject as a random effect; and baseline pain intensity score as a covariate. In the model, week will be treated as a class variable, and an unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed to model the within -subject variability. The denominator degrees of freedom for the F- test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. The e stimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for VX-150 will be provided for the within - group change . The CI will first be used to facilitate the comparison with 0; this will be followed by a comparison with 0.8. In addition, the e stimated mean and corresponding 95% CI for the between -group difference will be provided. 12.3.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables Secondary endpoints are: • Proportion of subjects with ≥30% reduction in the weekly average of daily pain intensity on the 11-point NRS, as reported in the daily diary, at Week 6.

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments in cluding laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: • Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment"
42,page_42,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 43 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention • A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life- threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points: • For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of consent) • For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow- up Visit: th rough the Safety Follow-up Visit • For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow- up Visit, the earliest of o 35 days after the last dose of study drug, or o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug (see Secti on 9.1.5) All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: • Description of the event • Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” • Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) • Severity • Causal relationship to study drug(s) • Action taken • Outcome • Concomitant medication or othe r treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), V ersion 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed August 2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” The severity of"
43,page_43,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 44 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effo rt will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2 . Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigati onal study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of th e investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in r esponse to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicabl e Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt , or withdraw treatment is possible."
44,page_44,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 45 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/Resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae Reso lution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not Recovered/Not Resolved (Continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least po ssibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: • Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during p articipation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions) • Congenital anomaly or birth defect • Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to"
45,page_45,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 46 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on su bject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) usi ng a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be as sessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is r esponsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: Email: (preferred choice) Fax: Contact Telephone: 13.1.2.4 Expedited Reporting and Investigator Safety Letters Vertex, as study sponsor, is responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse reactions involving the study drug(s) to all regulatory authorities and participating investigators in accordance with ICH Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements, as applicable.

Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will r equire IRB/IEC notification before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities. When circumstan ces require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the protocol, the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If possible, contact will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures from the protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log. 13.2.4 Access to Records The investigator will make the office and/or hospital records of subjects enrolled in this study available for inspection by Vertex or its rep resentative at the time of each monitoring visit and for audits. The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol. 13.2.5 Subject Privacy To maintain subject confidentiality and to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will"

As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study is being conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. For sites participating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and associated regulations (“HIPAA”) an executed HIPAA authorization shall be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’s personally identifiable health information, authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA, and other parties requiring access under the protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long. 13.2.6 Record Retention The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP guidelines and/or applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and Vertex will be notified. 13.2.7 Study Termination At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this s tudy at any particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs may terminate the study at their center. Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited to: • Subje ct or investigator noncompliance • Unsatisfactory subject enrollment • Lack of adherence to protocol procedures • Lack of evaluable and/or complete data • Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects • Decision to modify drug development plan • Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required."
48,page_48,"Protocol VX16 -150-102, Version 5.0 Page 49 of 54 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.3 Data Quality Assurance Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex will have read -only access to site-entered clinical data in the EDC application. Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database. 13.4 Monitoring Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On-site checking of the CR Fs/SAE Forms for completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a represe ntative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. 13.5 Electronic Data Capture Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct information in the CRFs on the subjects for which they are responsible. A CRF will be c ompleted for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator's responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject's CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subjec t's participation in the study and will document the dates and details of study procedures, AEs, other observations, and subject status. The investigator, or designated representative, will complete the CRF as soon as possible after information is collecte d. The audit trail entry will show the user's identification information and the date and time of any correction. The investigator will provide formal approval of all the information in the CRFs, including any changes made to the CRFs, to endorse the final submitted data for the subjects for whom the investigator is responsible. Vertex will retain the CRF data and corresponding audit trails. A copy of the final archival CRF in the form of a CD or other electronic media will be placed in the investigator's study file."
