In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with type 2 diabetes, in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 4,5. Despite the availability of several oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) and insulin, a significant proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes do not achieve the recommended blood glucose target levels 6-9. In addition to the need for new effective and safe glucose lowering agents, it is important to establish the benefits of the available marketed glucose lowering agents in order to optimise the individual treatment in the best possible way. 3.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone secreted from the L-cells in the small intestine. An incretin hormone is a gut-derived peptide with important physiological function in augmenting post-prandial insulin secretion in response to ingestion of a meal. GLP-1 has a glucose- dependent stimulatory effect on insulin- and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets (i.e. when plasma glucose levels are above normal) 10,11. Both these effects are considered of importance for the glucose lowering effect of GLP-112. Physiologically GLP-1 has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying13. This effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure to GLP-114,15. GLP-1 also lowers body weight due to a decreased energy intake induced by a lowered appetite16. Patients with diabetes have a decreased incretin effect17-20). However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower blood glucose is preserved in subjects with type 2 diabetes when administered at supra physiological levels21. The mechanism of action makes GLP-1 a potent blood glucose lowering agent22and thus an attractive pharmacological tool for treatment of type 2 diabetes23-25. However, the very short CONFIDENTIAL"

Clinical trials have revealed that 24-hour infusion of endogenous GLP-1 would be necessary to achieve satisfactory glycaemic control. Therefore, to benefit from the potentials of GLP-1 in treatment of diabetes it has been necessary to develop GLP-1 receptor agonists with longer half-life. 3.3 Semaglutide Semaglutide is a potent human GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) for once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. It is structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza Â®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. For the semaglutide molecule the principal mechanism of protraction is albumin binding facilitated by a large fatty acid derived chemical moiety attached to the lysine in position 26. The specific modifications in the molecule are: 1) a modification in position 8 (Alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone in order to further increase stability against DPP-4, and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine in order to only have one lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic linker between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty di-acid with a terminal acidic group. The latter two contribute to increased albumin binding which results in decreased renal clearance. In addition to slowed degradation in plasma and decreased renal clearance, delayed absorption from subcutis also contributes to a prolonged half-life of approximately 160 hours making semaglutide suitable for once-weekly s.c. administration. In vitro receptor studies have shown that semaglutide is a potent and selective GLP-1 RA, and animal studies using non-diabetic rats, non-diabetic pigs and diabetic mice have shown lowering of blood glucose and inhibition of food intake. 3.3.1 Non-clinical data The non-clinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M327guideline to support the clinical development. The standard non-clinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified.CONFIDENTIAL"

Early C-cell changes were also identified in repeated dose toxicity studies with semaglutide in mice. However, this was not the case in other species including a 52-week repeat dose study in non-human primates at exposure levels up to 36-fold above the expected clinical exposure. The observed pattern of effects in mice and rats (thyroid C-cell proliferation preceded by increase in serum calcitonin) and lack of these effects in the non-human primate and in man suggest that the mechanism by which semaglutide acts on the thyroid C-cells in rodents is the same as has been demonstrated for other GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide. The relevance for human subjects is unknown. 3.3.1.2 Teratogenicity in rats Semaglutide has been concluded teratogenic in rats, with exposure at no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) below expected human exposure. This effect is regarded to be caused by impairment of nutrient supply to the embryo across the inverted yolk sac with placental function which is specific to rats. Non-human primates and humans do not depend on a yolk sac with placental function to supply nutrients to the embryo early in pregnancy. The effect on rat embryo-foetal development is therefore not likely to be relevant to humans. Preliminary and main embryo-foetal development (EFD) and pre- and postnatal development (PPND) studies with doses corresponding to 12-15 fold expected clinical exposure in cynomolgus monkeys have been finalised. In the main EFD study sporadic abnormalities were reported across all dose groups and in the PPND study a dose-dependent increase in early pregnancy losses were observed. The findings observed across the three studies in cynomolgus monkeys are not indicative of a teratogenic potential of semaglutide in this species. The increase in early pregnancy losses is indicative of embryo-toxicity, which may be related to the maternal effect of semaglutide (marked body weight loss). A developmental toxicity NOAEL was determined at an exposure 1- to 2 fold the expected clinical exposure (1 mg/week). A risk for the developing human embryo or foetus cannot be definitely ruled out, but the absence of findings indicative of teratogenicity in the EFD and PPND studies in cynomolgus monkey decrease the level of concern. A comprehensive review of results from the non-clinical studies can be found in Investigatorâs Brochure, semaglutide (NN9535) (subcutaneous administration), Type 2 Diabetes and any updates hereof 28. 3.3.2 Clinical data As of 09 January 2014, 5 clinical pharmacology trials (Trials 1820, 3679, 3633, 3616 and 3819) and 1 phase 2 trial (Trial 1821) have been completed with semaglutide.

In the completed trials 525 subjects have been exposed to semaglutide: 164 healthy subjects (both single and multiple dosing), 313 subjects with T2DM (up to 12 weeks of treatment) and 48 subjects (four subjects had T2DM) with varying degrees of renal impairment (single dosing). In addition, 22 healthy subjects were exposed to semaglutide (s.c.) in the oral semaglutide administration project (Trials NN9924 3691 and NN9924 3692). 3.3.2.1 Pharmacokinetics Results from one single dose trial (NN9535-3616) and from 1 multi-dose trial (NN9535-3819) based on the LC-MS/MS assay confirm that semaglutide has pharmacokinetic (PK) properties compatible with once-weekly administration, with a median time to maximum concentration (t max) of 24-36 hours post dosing and an elimination half-life (t Â½) in the range of 166-184 hours (~7-8 days). Overall, the PK properties of semaglutide appear similar in Caucasian and Japanese subjects, and also in healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes. In a trial with subjects with different degrees of renal impairment (NN9535-3616), data suggested that subjects with severe renal impairment had a slightly higher exposure compared to subjects with normal renal function. Area under curve (AUC 0-â) increased by approximately 22% in subjects with severe renal impairment, whereas subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment and subjects on haemodialysis had exposure similar to subjects with normal renal function. No safety signals were identified in either of the renal groups, and tolerability profiles appeared similar across renal groups; thus, a dose- reduction in subjects with severe renal impairment does not appear to be warranted. Interaction with oral contraceptives was assessed at semaglutide 1.0 mg steady-state exposures in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes (NN9535-3819). Steady-state exposures (AUC0-24h) of ethinylestradiol (EE) and levonorgestrel (LN) were slightly increased, with bioequivalence established for EE but not for LN; the increase was seen when oral contraceptives were co- administered with semaglutide compared to oral contraceptives alone. Bioequivalence was demonstrated for C maxof both EE and LN. These data indicate that semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives, and suggest that no adjustments of oral contraceptive dose are warranted for women of childbearing potential using a low-dose oral contraceptive. 3.3.2.2 Efficacy As of 06 April 2013, efficacy of semaglutide in the target population - subjects with type 2 diabetes has been investigated in one phase 2 dose range finding trial (NN9535-1821). The trial was a 12- week, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trial in which 411 adults with type 2 diabetes received once-weekly subcutaneous ( c) injection of 1 of 5 semaglutide dose levels (0.1- 1.6 mg) once-daily s.c. injection of open-label liraglutide (1.2 mg or 1.8 mg) or once-weekly placebo.

Changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) from baseline was up to -1.19 % (placebo adjusted estimated treatment difference). Dose-dependent improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and postprandial plasma glucose were also observed. The improvement in glycaemic control was accompanied by weight loss for semaglutide doses of 0.8 mg and above (placebo adjusted estimated treatment difference up to -3.64 kg). 3.3.2.3 Safety From the clinical trials conducted so far the following safety observations have been made. Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, common adverse events (AEs) included nausea and vomiting; most of them were mild to moderate in intensity. Hypoglycaemia has occurred in subjects receiving semaglutide and these events have mainly been minor. An increase in heart rate has been observed in subjects exposed to semaglutide in line with the increase seen with other GLP- 1 analogous. The implications of this increase are unknown. As is the case with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. Few allergic reactions have been reported in connection with semaglutide. These have mainly been mild and transient however, more generalised reactions may occur, including urticaria, rash, pruritus and a single case of angioedema which have been observed. Injection site reactions have been infrequently reported. These have mainly been mild and transient in nature. Please see Investigatorâs Brochure, semaglutide (NN9535) (subcutaneous administration), Type 2 Diabetes and any updates hereof28. 3.4 Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class suitable for once-daily oral administration. It was developed and marketed by Merck & Co as sitagliptin phosphate under the trade name JanuviaÂ® Sitagliptin works by inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the incretin hormones GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). By preventing GLP-1 and GIP inactivation, secretion of insulin is increased and release of glucagon is suppressed. The obvious advantage with a convenient route of administration is however counterbalanced by a significantly lower effect of the DPP-4 inhibitors on glycaemic control and body weight as compared to GLP-1 RAs. This has also been demonstrated for sitagliptin when compared to liraglutide (NN2211-1860). Adverse reactions reported in >5% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache.

(For more information see label29) 3.5 Risk and benefits assessment This assessment is based on the safety and efficacy data for semaglutide and sitagliptin presented above as well as potential risk identified as drug class effects. 3.5.1 Semaglutide risks and precautions The nonclinical safety programme of semaglutide reveals no identified safety issues for humans based on conventional studies of safety phar macology, repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity (see section 3.3.1 ). The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents described in section 3.3.1.1 is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action for induction of C-cell tumours with GLP-1 analogues. However, as a precaution subjects with a family or personal history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or medullary thyroid carcinoma, and subjects with a screening calcitonin â¥50 ng/L will be excluded from trial. During the trial calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis and guidance for investigators of further evaluation and action on elevated plasma calcitonin concentrations will be carried out by an independent group of thyroid experts, the Calcitonin Monitoring Committee (CMC). This will ensure appropriate and consistent handling of elevated calcitonin levels across trials. Semaglutide has been concluded teratogenic in rats as described in section 3.3.1.2 . The mechanism resulting in this effect is not considered relevant for humans. However as a risk for the developing foetus cannot be completely ruled out, subjects fulfilling the following exclusion criteria will be excluded: females of childbearing potential who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant and females who are not using adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local law or practice) throughout the trial including the 5 week follow-up period. Safety data from clinical trials are consistent with findings from other GLP-1 RAs. The most frequently reported AEs in the clinical trials with semaglutide thus far have been gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). A new dose escalation regiment was tested in a phase 1 trial (NN9535-3819) in order to further improve GI tolerability. As the GI tolerability profile was substantially improved this regimen will be implemented in future clinical trials with semaglutide. As it is the case with all protein based pharmaceuticals subjects treated with semaglutide risk developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. These may include localised reactions or CONFIDENTIAL"

Severe allergic reactions such as anaphylactic reactions could potentially also pose a risk for subjects treated with semaglutide. As the mode of action of GLP-1 is glucose dependent10,11the risk of development of hypoglycaemic event is low. Ho wever, hypoglycaemia has occurre d in subjects receiving semaglutide and experience from the GLP-1 RA drugs class warrants special caution when semaglutide is combined with sulfonylureas. Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class two potential risks have been found relevant. Firstly untoward effects of volume depletion including acute renal failure resulting from nausea, vomiting and dehydration have been observed in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs. Semaglutide is not metabolised by the kidneys, and treatment has not been associated with impaired renal function in preclinical or clinical studies. However, as a precaution serum creatinine is measured regularly. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. If semaglutide and metformin are co-administered, investigator should evaluate subjects with prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, monitor serum creatinine, if clinically indicated and withhold metformin until resolution of the renal dysfunction. Secondly acute pancreatitis, including reports of severe necrotising and haemorrhagic forms, has been associated with other GLP-1 RAs. However data from observational studies suggest an increased frequency of pancreatitis among diabetics and a relationship between pancreatitis and GLP-1 RAs can neither be established nor excluded30,31. However, as a precaution subjects with a history of acute idiopathic or chronic pancreatitis will be excluded from clinical trials with semaglutide. Subjects will be monitored for elevated levels of amylase and lipase and be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. 3.5.2 Sitagliptin risk and precautions Sitagliptin is generally considered to be well tolerated. The most commonly reported side effect is upper respiratory tract infection and headache. Some of the potential risk associated with GLP-1 RA treatment has also been associated with treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitors as sitagliptin i.e. pancreatitis, acute renal impairment, hypersens itivity reactions and h ypoglycaemia (US prescribing information32and Chinese prescribing information33) 3.5.3 Benefits In this trial subjects in all treatment arms will be treated within a regimen anticipated to be more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of randomisation into the trial. It is expected that subjects will benefit from the trial treatment with respect to optimised glycaemic control, a reduced risk of long-term diabetic complications and a potential weight loss.

Doses â¥0.8 mg brought more subjects to target with regards to HbA 1cand FPG and provided a greater weight loss than liraglutide 1.8 mg. Sitagliptin has in phase 3 trials where sitagliptin has been given in combination with metformin proven to provide significant improvements in HbA 1cand FPG34. All subjects in this trial will receive active treatment and will receive trial drug and auxiliary free of charge. Furthermore it is expected that all subjects participating in the trial will benefit from participation through close contact with the study site and close follow-up of their type 2 diabetes. Such careful medical examination will most likely result in an intensified management of their diabetes. 3.5.4 Risk and benefit conclusion It is concluded that the potential benefits from participating in the trial outweigh the potential risks. The safety profile of semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. Sitagliptin is already a marketed drug in the 100 mg dose and approved for the use in type 2 diabetic patients. It is concluded that the risk to the subjects in this trial is low and acceptable in view of the benefits a long-acting GLP-1 analogue would provide to subjects with type 2 diabetes. 3.6 Rationale for the trial The currently available treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes are still not satisfactory and there is still a large proportion of patients not reaching the treatment targets despite a high level ofcompliance with the treatment regimens. Furthermore, there is a segment of patients where either compliance with once-daily treatment regimens is an issue resulting in sub-optimal glycaemic control, or where there is a wish for a more convenient treatment regimen. The rationale for this trial is to compare the efficacy of semaglutide versus sitagliptin in subjects with type-2 diabetes in terms of glycaemic control, weight loss and other efficacy parameters. Furthermore the trial is designed to address and compare safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction.

Doses must not be changed during the trial after the maintenance dose has been reached. Semaglutide injections should be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, and should be taken on the same day of the week during the trial. Both semaglutide and sitagliptin can be taken any time of day irrespective of meals. If necessary, the trial product may be discontinued for safety reasons. In case trial product is discontinued, subjects will not be withdrawn from trial but should continue to follow scheduled visits to the extent possible (see section 6.5.1 ). Trial product will be add-on in subjects failing on metformin monotherapy. Subjects must not be prescribed other GLP-1 RA in the period between V9 and V10 or V9A and V10A. 5.3.1 Missed dose If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours). If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer a dose until the next scheduled dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing day of the week. 5.3.2 Background medication Subjects should upon inclusion continue pre-trial background medication throughout the entire trial. The background medication should be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and frequency during the whole treatment period unless rescue medication is needed (see section 6.4). Metformin is considered background medication (non-investigational medicinal product) and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S (except for Brazil where Metformin will be provided by Novo Nordisk FarmacÃªutica do Brasil Ltda). Metformin should be used in accordance with standard of care in the individual country at the discretion of the investigator and the daily dose should be unchanged throughout the trial unless the rescue criteria is met. However the maximum approved dose in the individual country must not be exceeded. Treatment with metformin extended/slow release formulations is allowed. 5.3.3 Treatment after end of trial When discontinuing trial products the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. (Brazil: After the study ending, if the investigator decides that the study medication is the best treatment option for the subject, the access to the study medication will be assured by the trial sponsor at no costs, according to the current regulations of Brazilian National Council of Health and Health Authority).

The doses of 0.5 mg and 1.0 mg once- weekly has been chosen based on careful evaluation to strike a satisfactory balance of efficacy and safety that would satisfy the majority of patients. Hence duration and the dose of the randomised treatments are considered adequate for obtaining meaningful information on efficacy and safety in accordance with the trial objectives. Subjects will enrol for a treatment period of 30 weeks in order to be able to evaluate full effect as well as durability of the primary and secondary endpoints as well as a reasonable safety assessment.

However in case of a safety concern or unacceptable intolerability the trial product may be discontinued at the investigatorâs discretion. Trial product must be discontinued in case of: !included in the trial in violation of any of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria !Pregnancy !Intention to become pregnant For procedure to be performed in case of discontinuation of trial product (see section 8.1.6.2 ). In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis (see section 8.8.1.4 ). Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely should continue with the scheduled site contact. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after discontinuation of trial product. As minimum these subjects should be asked to attend the visits end of treatment (V9) and follow up (V10) at the time of the scheduled completion of the trial. Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely will be called in for an end of treatment â premature discontinuation visit (V9A), as soon as possible after discontinuation of trial product, and for a follow-up - premature discontinuation visit (V10A) five weeks after last dose of trial product (see section 2and 8.1.6.2 ). Subjects discontinued from trial product should be prescribed alternative therapy at the investigatorÂ´s discretion. However subjects must not be prescribed other GLP-1 RA in the period between V9 and V10 or V9A and V10A. 6.5.2 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw at will at any time. Please see section 8.1.7 for procedure to be performed in case of subject withdrawal. Subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments, trial product discontinuation due to AE (see section 6.5.1 ), unwillingness to cope with injection regimen, development of co-morbidities or clinical outcomes.CONFIDENTIAL"

Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial, and hence do not agree to report information which is relevant for the assessments of cardiovascular outcomes and/or other trial end-points at the end of trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial. 6.6 Subject replacement Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced. 6.7 Rationale for trial population This trial will be carried out in China and several other countries. The aim is to include a broad diabetes population, hence the limited number of exclusion criteria. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy will be included in the trial.

A recruitment strategy will be developed in corporation with the participating countries to secure sufficient number of subjects from China and the other participating countries. Recruitment will be monitored on an on-going basis by sponsor. Prior to FPFV all sites should have a recruitment strategy in place detailing how many subjects they can recruit within a certain period. If a site has not enrolled the number of subjects according to the recruitment strategy, the remaining subjects may be reallocated. The screening and randomisation rate will be followed closely via IV/WRS in order to estimate when to stop screening. All investigators will be notified immediately when the enrolment period comes to an end, after which no subjects must be screened, and the IV/WRS will be closed for further screening. All subjects included in the screening period by the time of IV/WRS closure and eligible for randomisation will be randomised.

These are also included in the flow chart (see section 2). The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one list and may be generated from the IV/WRS. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site at the time of delegation of tasks. 8.1.1 Screening visit 1 (V1) For procedures and assessments performed at screening, please see flow chart (see section 2). The IV/WRS must be contacted to register the subject as screened (see section 10). Subject will be assigned a unique number (lowest available number allocated to site) which is maintained throughout the trial. It must be stated in the medical record that the subject is participating in the current trial. At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. The subjects should be reminded to show the card to other health care providers, as applicable. Once all data relating to screening V1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed by the investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible to continue the trial. Ability and willingness to self-inject can be tested by administration of injection(s) with a test pen (containing semaglutide placebo) for subjects who do not have prior experience with self-injection. 8.1.1.1 Screen failures For screening failures the screening failure form must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the case report form eCRF. Follow-up of SAEs must be carried out according to section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IV/WRS. The case book must be signed in eCRF.CONFIDENTIAL"

Fasting is defined as having consumed only water since midnight. Glucose lowering agents and trial product cannot be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken. An exception from this is the follow-up visit (V10) and follow-up premature discontinuation visit (V10A) where fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last two hours prior to the visit. If the subject is not fasting as required, the subject should be called in for a new visit within the visit window to have the fasting procedures done. 8.1.3 Randomisation V2 For procedures and assessments performed at randomisation (see section 2). Visit 2 will take place two weeks (Â±7 days) after screening V1. Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of four treatment arms. The IV/WRS will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. Trial product will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent with different intervals during the trial. Subject will be instructed in administration of sc injection of trial product and the investigator must document that a direction for use (DFU) is given orally and/or in writing at each dispensing visit. Date, time and dose of first administration of trial product will becaptured in the eCRF. Please see section 9for further information about the trial product. 8.1.4 Visits For visit numbers, timing of site visits, phone contacts and visit windows during the trial period, please refer to the flow chart (see section 2).

Subjects will be invited for the next scheduled visit according to visit schedule. If a subject is unable or unwilling to attend the subsequent visit(s) the investigator should aim to at least have the subject attending the end of treatment visit and follow-up visit as these two visits should be performed for all subjects regardless of compliance with the protocol and adherence to the treatment (see section 8.1.6 ). If a subject attends the clinic for a visit not described in the protocol, an unscheduled visit form must be completed. This only applies if assessments are done, hence not for the purpose of re-test of blood- or urine sampling, or re-supply of trial product. In case of re-supply a dispensing session should be made in the IV/WRS selecting additional medication. Re-scheduling of fasting visit samples is not considered as an unscheduled visit. 8.1.6 End of treatment (V9/9A) and Follow-up (V10/10A) 8.1.6.1 Subjects completing the treatment period as per protocol An end of treatment visit (V9) should be scheduled when the subject has completed the treatment period as described per protocol and a follow-up visit (V10) should be performed at least 5 weeks after (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). The follow-up visit serves to collect AEs, technical complaints, hypoglycaemic episodes, ECG, concomitant medication and blood sampling for anti-semaglutide antibodies . 8.1.6.2 Subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product For subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely the visit end of treatment â premature discontinuation (V9A) should be scheduled shortly after subject has discontinued trial product. The visit follow-up â premature discontinuation ( V10A) should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after discontinuation of trial product (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely should continue with the scheduled site contacts. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after discontinuation of trial product. However, as a minimum these subjects will be called in for end of treatment (V9) and follow-up (V10) at the time of the scheduled completion of the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

Fifteen minutes outside the indicated range is negligible, and should not be recorded as a deviation. Trial products stored outside the temperature range are not to be used and must be stored separately within allowed temperature range until after evaluation of condition. Evaluation will be performed by Novo Nordisk. Trial products that have been stored improperly must not be dispensed to any subject before it has been re-evaluated and approved for further use by Novo Nordisk. Returned trial products (unused, partly used or used including empty packaging material) must be stored separately from non-allocated trial products. The temperatures during storage should be monitored by a calibrated and stationary system. A temperature log must be kept to document storage within the right temperature interval and storage facilities should be checked frequently. Investigator must take appropriate action to avoid recurrence of the detected temperature deviation. 9.4 Drug accountability and destruction The trial products will be dispensed to each subject as required according to treatment group. The IV/WRS will allocate trial product to the subject at each dispensing visit, starting at the randomisation visit. The correct DUN(s) must be dispensed to the subject. The investigator or delegated person is responsible for ensuring that: !Trial products are not dispensed to any person not included in the trial !Drug accountability is performed using the IV/WRS drug accountability module !Subjects are instructed to return all used, partly used and unused trial product including empty packaging material at each dispensing visit and at End of Treatment visit !All returned trial products (used/partial used and unused including empty packaging material) is kept and stored separately from non-allocated trial products Destruction of trial products will be done according to local law after accountability is finalised at site and reconciled by monitor.

A randomisation session will be carried out for all subjects by using the IV/WRS. At the randomisation visit subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive one of four parallel treatments groups: !Semaglutide 0.5 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (0.5) mg once-weekly !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (1.0) mg once-weekly Randomisation will be stratified by country. 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes If the trial site needs to break the code, Novo Nordisk should if possible, be contacted before the code is broken. The IV/WRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the code break confirmation notification generated by the IV/WRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. If the code has been broken, the subject should be discontinued from trial product but be asked to continue in the trial (see section 8.1.6.2 ). If the code has been broken the subject must be discontinued from trial product but be asked to continue in the trial. A treatment discontinuation session should be completed in IV/WRS. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IV/WRS is not accessible at the time of code break monitor should be contacted and if monitor cannot get access the IV/WRS vendor helpdesk should be contacted.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, ie an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should notbe reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening procedures (pre- existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form (see section 8.4.2 ). The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity assessment âMild - no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities. âModerate - marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities. âSevere - considerable interference with the subject's daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality assessment The following terms are used when assessing the relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): âProbable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. âPossible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. âRecovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. âNot recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. âFatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as ""recovered/resolved"", ""recovering/resolving"", ""recovered/resolved with sequelae"" or ""not recovered/not resolved"". An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. âUnknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product must always be considered an SAE. a. The term ""life threatening"" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.CONFIDENTIAL"

The term ""hospitalisation"" is used when a subject: â Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or â Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hours Medical judgement must always be exercised, and when in doubt, the hospital contact should be regarded as a hospitalisation. Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c. A substantial disruption of a subject's ability to conduct normal life functions (eg following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life). d. For example intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasiasis or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.Medical event of special interest A medical event of special interest (MESI) is an event which, in the evaluation of safety, has a special focus. A MESI is an AE (SAE or non-serious AE) which fulfils one or more of the below defined MESI criteria. 1. Medication errors concerning trial products: â Administration of wrong drug. â Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous. â Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (eg suicide attempt). â Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. That is a dose of semaglutide 10% lower or higher than 1.0 mg week (Â± 24h) or of sitagliptin that is lower or higher than 100 mg/day; however the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extend where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although not necessarily did happen. 2.

Any event confirmed or suspected to be a MESI must be reported as such. In case the sponsor identifies potentially missed MESIs through predefined review of available data, the investigator will be asked to reconsider if this is a MESI. However, MESIs should not be reported for screening failures. For further information regarding definitions of MESIs and an overview of which events that should undergo adjudication, please refer to Appendix A. Technical complaint A technical complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges product (medicine or device) defects. The technical complaint may be associated with an AE, but does not concern the AE itself. Examples of technical complaints: !The physical or chemical appearance of trial products (eg discoloration, particles or contamination) !The packaging material (eg leakage, cracks, rubber membrane issues or errors in labelling text) !Problems related to devices (eg to the injection mechanism, dose setting mechanism, push button or interface between the pen and the needle) 12.2 Reporting of adverse events All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and reported. This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (see section 2).

If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a safety information form must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one safety information form can be used to describe all the SAEs. MESIs, regardless of seriousness, must be reported using both the AE form and the safety information form and a MESI form. The MESI form is a form tailored to collect specific information related to the individual MESI. For MESIs qualifying for event adjudication, an event adjudication document collection form (adjudication form) will also have to be completed in the eCRF. The event adjudication document collection form is a check list of clinical data to be provided from the site. The investigator should provide relevant medical documentation within 4 weeks of event identification. The AE form for a non-serious AE should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial. Timelines for initial reporting of AEs: The investigator must complete the following forms in the eCRF within the specified timelines: !SAEs : The AE form within 24 hours and the safety information form within 5 calendar days of the investigator's first knowledge of the SAE.

Follow up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs : All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is ""recovered/resolved"", ""recovered/resolved with sequelae"" or ""fatal"", and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome ""recovering/resolving"" or ""not recovered/not resolved"". Cases can be closed with the outcome of ""recovering/resolving"" when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow-up information should only include new (eg corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator's first knowledge of the information.

Events of nausea, vomiting and headache have been reported in connection with accidental administration of up to 4.0 mg semaglutide. No symptoms of hypoglycaemia have been reported in connection with overdose of semaglutide. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the subjectâs clinical signs and symptoms. For other precautions, please see section 3.5.1 . Sitagliptin During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 CONFIDENTIAL"

In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis. For other precautions, please see section 3.5.2 . 12.7 Committees related to safety 12.7.1 Novo Nordisk safety committee Novo Nordisk has constituted an internal semaglutide safety committee to perform ongoing safety surveillance. The semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An external event adjudication committee is established to perform qualitative or quantitative validation of selected AEs according to pre-defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Adjudication will be completed based on a review of data collected from the sites. The provided data will be anonymised for subject identifiers. The events are reviewed by the event adjudication committee in an independent and blinded manner. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The role of the EAC is solely to adjudicate events in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities, and work processes of the committee. The events will be adjudicated according to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator should provide medical documentation within 4 weeks of event identification. The supplier of EAC can evaluate an event not initially reported as a MESI for adjudication to be adjudicated. In this case the investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when receiving a request from Novo Nordisk or the supplier. The assessment made by the EAC will be included in the CTR as well as assessments made by the investigator. However, the adjudication made by an EAC, given its independence and in-depth analysis of each event, will be attributed with greater importance of the two. The outcomes of adjudication will be kept in the clinical trial database.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FPFV or FSFV and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the CRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 8 weeks. The intervals between monitoring visits can be shorter. Factors to be considered in this determination may include objective, endpoints, purpose, design, complexity, blinding, number of subjects and expected recruitment rate. The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (eg by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the CRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Considering the electronic source data environment, it is accepted that the earliest practically retainable record should be considered as the location of the source data. Therefore transcription to the diary from the blood glucose meter is considered the source document for BG values. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data, if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original diaries and PROs are considered as source data and must not be removed from the trial site. The monitor will ensure that the CRFs are completed on an on-going basis within the agreed timelines. The monitor must ensure that all required eCRF forms for screening failures are completed, (e.g. screening failure form and the case book sign of (affirmation statement) is electronically signed by the investigator).CONFIDENTIAL"

The SAP will be finalised before database lock. Results from the statistical analysis will generally be presented by two-sided confidence intervals with a confidence level of 95%. Superiority will be formulated and tested as one-sided hypotheses at a 2.5% significance level. Non-inferiority between two treatments will be evaluated by comparing the upper limit of the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference with the pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Handling of missing data In the case of missing data no general imputation will be performed for the analyses, unless otherwise specified. If an assessment has been made both at screening and randomisation, the value from the randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. If the value measured at the randomisation visit is missing and the assessment also has been made at screening, then the screening value will be used as the baseline value. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to Â½ LLOQ. The primary analysis model will be the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM), see section 17.3 for further details. One of the assumptions behind (MMRM) is that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR). This means that given the observed data, the mechanism generating missing values is independent of the unobserved data that is the missing data. The MMRM and the negative binomial model both rely on the MAR assumption for generating unbiased estimates of treatment differences. Based on previous semaglutide trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes, the withdrawal rate from randomised treatment is expected to be about 20%. The treatments in this trial should be effective, given the historical documentation, and this should minimise withdrawals due to ineffective therapy. The main reasons for withdrawal are expected to be AEs, ineffective therapy and non- eligibility (subjects randomised although not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria). Withdrawal due to non-eligibility can be regarded as missing completely at random (MCAR), i.e. it does not depend on the observed or missing data values. This category of missing data is not expected to introduce bias in the estimated treatment differences. Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy is expected to be reflected in the observed data obtained prior to the withdrawal from randomised treatment, and the corresponding missing data can therefore be assumed as MAR to some extent. Missing data due to AEs is expected to be similar between groups except for, potentially, a slightly higher incidence in the semaglutide treatment group due to gastrointestinal side effects. Together with potential CONFIDENTIAL"

Several different sensitivity analyses will be used to investigate whether the results from the MMRM approach are robust towards deviations from the assumption of MAR. 17.1 Sample size calculation The primary objective is to compare the effect of two dose levels of semaglutide once-weekly treatment (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) with sitagliptin 100 mg on the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA 1c after 30 weeks of treatment. In the calculations determining the sample size it is presumed that in the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between endpoints and placebo volume. In total 1050 subjects will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner. Assuming 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment, and further taking the assumption that these subjects are excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis set, 280 subjects in each group are expected to be included in the PP analysis set. The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg and HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. The two hypothesis tests are assumed to be independent and for each of the hypothesis the power calculation is based on a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5%. Using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%, and assuming a true HbA 1cdifference (semaglutide minus sitagliptin) of 0% and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%, a total of 280 subjects per group in the PP analysis set will give 90% marginal power to conclude HbA 1c non-inferiority for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. Assuming the same HbA 1ceffect for the two dose levels of semaglutide, the overall power to demonstrate HbA 1c non-inferiority for the two dose levels of semaglutide vs. sitagliptin will be at least 80%. For change in body weight, the power calculation is based on the assumptions of a true difference of -1.5 kg and a SD of 4.0 kg. In addition, 50% efficacy retention is assumed for the anticipated 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment giving an expected treatment difference of -1.35 kg, which is the number used in the power calculation. With the above assumptions, a total of 350 subjects per group in the full analysis set (FAS) will give more than 99% marginal power to conclude superiority in body weight for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg.CONFIDENTIAL"

Full Analysis Set (FAS): includes all randomised subjects who have received a dose and have any post randomisation data. The statistical evaluation of the FAS will follow the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle and subjects will contribute to the evaluation âas randomisedâ. Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set: Includes all subjects in the FAS who fulfil the following criteria: !have not violated any inclusion criteria !have not fulfilled any exclusion criteria !have a non-missing HbA 1cmeasurement at screening and /or randomisation !have at least 23 weeks actual treatment weeks of expose !have at least one non-missing HbA 1c measurement after 23 actual weeks of expose Subjects in the PP Analysis Set will contribute to the analysis âas treatedâ. Safety Analysis Set (SAS): includes all subjects exposed to at least one dose of randomised semaglutide or stigliptin. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation âas treatedâ. Before data are locked for statistical analysis, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the internal study group. Exclusion of data from analyses will be used restrictively and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion must be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the CTR. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 30 weeks of treatment. In the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between HbA 1cchange after 30 weeks and placebo volume. The primary endpoint will be analysed by MMRM where all post baseline HbA 1cmeasurements obtained at planned visits before discontinuation from randomised treatment or initiation of rescue treatment enter as the dependent variables, and visit, treatment, and country are included as fixed factors and baseline HbA 1cas covariate. Furthermore, interaction terms of visit by treatment, visit by country and visit by baseline HbA 1c will be included.

At week 30 the estimated differences between each semaglutide dose level and sitagliptin and corresponding two sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals will be presented. In order to preserve the overall type 1 error the conclusion of non-inferiority and superiority with treatment of each semaglutide dose versus sitagliptin after 30 weeks will be evaluated hierarchically according to the sequence below, and starting with the first. In this testing sequence it is necessary to fulfil the test criteria, which is to reject the corresponding null hypothesis in order to go to the next step. If the corresponding null hypothesis is not rejected, the testing will stop and no further conclusions will be drawn. The following ordering in the statistical test sequence will be used: 1. Non-inferiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 2. Non-inferiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 3. Superiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 4. Superiority in change in body weight for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 5. Superiority in change in body weight for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 6. Superiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin Non-inferiority will be concluded if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference in HbA 1cbetween semaglutide and sitagliptin is less than 0.3%. Superiority for either change in HbA 1cor change in body weight will be claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference is below 0% or 0 kg respectively. When establishing non-inferiority the analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) and supplemented by an analysis with the per protocol population as supportive evidence.

These analyses will investigate the sensitivity of the results due to the impact of missing values. The primary analysis regarding non-inferiority of the primary endpoint change in HbA 1cafter 30 weeks will also be performed separately based on the data in the PP analysis set only. The primary endpoint and the secondary confirmatory endpoint will be evaluated in the following sensitivity analyses: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be analysed with imputation of missing values according to the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. The model will include terms for treatment, country, and the corresponding baseline value as a covariate. The response variable will be the last available value obtained within the 30 weeks period of the trial !The MMRM will be analysed based on all data record after randomisation using also data from subjects who discontinued randomised treatment and /or initiated rescue treatment. !The MMRM will be analysed based on data only from subjects that completed the trial without receiving rescue treatment. A pattern mixture model approach mimicking an ITT scenario where withdrawn subjects are assumed to be switched to a treatment inferior to the control treatment after withdrawal will be performed for evaluation of non-inferiority for the primary endpoint change in HbA 1c at 30 weeks. !In the first step intermittent missing values are imputed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, in order to obtain a monotone missing data pattern. This imputation is done for each treatment group separately and 100 copies of the dataset will be generated. !In the second step, for each of the 100 copies of the dataset, an analysis of variance model with the same factors as the primary model, and baseline HbA 1cand HbA 1cat 4 weeks (V3) as covariate is fitted to the change in HbA 1cfrom baseline to 8 weeks (V5) for the sitagliptin group only. The estimated parameters, and their variance, from this model are used to impute missing value at 8 weeks for subjects in all treatment groups, based on country and HbA 1cat baseline and 4 weeks. !In the third step, for each of the 100 copies of the dataset, missing HbA1c values at 12 weeks (V6) are imputed in the same way as for 8 weeks.

Classification of Hypoglycaemia Treatment emergent: hypoglycaemic episodes will be defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurs on or after the first day of trial product administration, and no later than the follow-up visit. Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes: are episodes with time of onset between 00:01 and 05:59 both inclusive. Hypoglycaemic episodes are classified according to the Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia and the ADA classification of hypoglycaemia (see Figure 17â1 ). Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia In normal physiology, symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur below a plasma glucose level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL)42. Therefore, Novo Nordisk has included hypoglycaemia with plasma glucose levels below this cut-off point of hypoglycaemia. In this trial Novo Nordisk use the following classification in addition to the ADA classification (see Figure 17â1 ): !Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that is severe according to the ADA classification38or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value <3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.

All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation in regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. Subjects will be treated within a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the treatment they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Subjects will have to spend some extra time, as additional assessments and visits to the clinic are required. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2013 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes43, or any updates thereof. It is concluded that the potential benefits from participating in the trial outweigh the potential risks. The safety profile of semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of once weekly doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. It is concluded that the risk to the subjects in this trial is low and acceptable in view of the benefits a long-acting GLP-1 analogue would provide to people with type 2 diabetes (please see 3.5) The trial products may be associated with AEs, but relevant precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. These precautions include thorough information regarding the correct administration of the trial products and gradual dose adjustment. Furthermore, subjects are fully informed about possible AEs and inconveniences and will be instructed to contact the investigator in case of any concerns regarding the trial participation. When treatment with trial products ends, the subject and investigator will decide on the best available treatment. 18.1 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2. Before any trial-related activity, the investigator must give the subject verbal and written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject can read and understand. The subjects must be fully informed of their rights and responsibilities while participating in the trial as well as possible disadvantages of being treated with the trial products.CONFIDENTIAL"

A voluntary, signed and personally dated informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any trial-related activity. The responsibility for seeking informed consent must remain with the investigator, but the task may be delegated by the investigator to a medically qualified person, in accordance with local requirements. The written informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the person who seeks the informed consent before any trial-related activity. If information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject's willingness to continue participating in the trial, the investigator must inform the subject in a timely manner, and a revised written subject information must be provided and a new informed consent must be obtained. In case a subject undergoes a thyroidectomy a separate informed consent will be obtained for collection of thyroid tissue sample and genetic testing (see section 8.8.1.2 and 8.8.1.3 ). 18.2 Data handling If the subject is withdrawn from the trial or lost to follow up, then the subject's data will be handled as follows: !Data already collected and data collected at the end-of-trial visit will be retained by Novo Nordisk, entered into the database and used for the trial report. !Safety events will be reported to Novo Nordisk and regulatory authorities according to local/national requirements. If data is used, it will always be in accordance with local regulations and IRBs/IECs. 18.3 Information to subject during trial The site will be offered a communication package to the subject during the conduct of the trial. The package content is issued by Novo Nordisk. The communication package will contain the letters intended for distribution to the subjects. The letters will be translated and adjusted to local requirements and distributed to the subject by discretion of the investigator. The subject may receive a âwelcome to the trial letterâ and a âthank for your participation letterâ at the end of the trial. Further the subject may receive trial letters during the trial period. All information to the subjects will be submitted to the health authorities and IECs/IRBs for approval according to local regulations.CONFIDENTIAL"

No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. One principal investigator will be appointed to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications44. 23.1 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication.

Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors44(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria). At the end of the trial, one or more publications (abstracts, posters, manuscripts) will be prepared for submission to scientific congresses and peer-reviewed journals in collaboration between Novo Nordisk and investigator(s) appointed by Novo Nordisk. These investigator(s) must meet the ICMJE authorship criteria to be named authors on publications. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission for publication of such primary policy will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database.

In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Type 2 diabetes Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with type 2 diabetes, in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 4,5. Despite the availability of several anti-diabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes do not achieve the recommended blood glucose target levels 6-9. 3.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incr etin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets10, 11. Subjects with T2D have a decreased response to GLP-112-15. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower BG levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels16. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight17. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation and food intake18, 19. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure 17-19. These mechanisms of action make glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2D20-22. Due to the very short half-life of <1.5 minutes after i.v. administration, native GLP-1 is not suitable for therapeutic use. To realise the full therapeutic potential of GLP-1, the pharmacokinetic and hence the pharmacodynamic effect needs to be protracted. 3.3 Semaglutide Semaglutide is a potent human GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) for once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. It is structurally similar to liraglutide (VictozaÂ®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The extended half- life of the semaglutide molecule is primarily obtained due to binding to albumin, which is facilitated CONFIDENTIAL"

The specific modifications in the molecule are: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty diacid with a terminal acidic group23, 24. The spacer and the fatty acid both contribute to increased albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance resulting in a prolonged half-life of approximately 1 week, making semaglutide suitable for once-weekly s.c. administration. 3.3.1 Non-clinical data The non-clinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 25guideline to support the clinical development. The standard non-clinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified. 3.3.1.1 Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Thyroid C-cell neoplasia was seen in mice and rat 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Proliferative C cell changes in rodents are a known effect following GLP-1 receptor activation by GLP-1 receptoragonists. The finding in rodents is caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. Recently published data have shown that the GLP-1 receptor is not expressed in the normal human thyroid, and accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low 26. 3.3.1.2 Embryo âfoetal development toxicity Semaglutide adversely affected embryo âfoetal development in the rat by a GLP-1 receptor mediated impaired function of the inverted yolk sac placenta during a period of gestation when the rat embryo is entirely dependent on the inverted yolk sac placenta for its nutrient supply. In primates, the yolk sac does not invert to fully enclose the embryo, and it does not come in direct contact with the uterine wall to form a placenta as in rodents. Accordingly, the mechanism by which semaglutide adversely affects embryo-foetal development in the rat, is not likely to be of relevance to humans. Studies in cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that maternal dosing of semaglutide does not affect embryo âfoetal development in this species. However, the initial maternal body weight loss caused by the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early pregnancy loss in one of three studies. In cynomolgus monkeys, the overall developmental no observable adverse CONFIDENTIAL"

A comprehensive review of results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the current edition of semaglutide (NN9535) investigatorâs brochure (IB)27, or any updates hereof. 3.3.2 Clinical data As of 1 August 2016, 16 clinical pharmacology trials (trials NN9535-1820, 3679, 3633, 3616, 3819, 4010, 3789, 3652, 3685, 3634, 3687, 3817,3818, 3684, 3651 and 3635), 1 phase 2 trial (NN9535- 1821) and 8 phase 3a trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625,3626, 3627, 3744, 4091, 4092) have been completed with semaglutide s.c. once-weekly. Clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects, in subjects with T2D, in subjects with obesity and in subjects with renal- and hepatic impairment. The phase 2 dose-finding trial was conducted in subjects with T2D. The semaglutide phase 3a programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population and covered the continuum of T2D care. The programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy with anti-hyperglycaemic therapies and compared semaglutide with the most important comparators at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme. In addition, the phase 3a programme included a long-term (104-week) cardiovascular outcomes trial (trial 3744) in a T2D population at high risk of cardiovascular events. 3.3.2.1 Pharmacokinetics The results from the completed clinical pharmacology trials confirm that semaglutide has PK properties compatible with once-weekly administration, having a flat concentration profile overtime, with a median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 1 â3 days post-dosing and an elimination half-life (tÂ½) of approximately 1 week. The PK properties of semaglutide appear comparable between healthy subjects, subjects with T2D and subjects with renal failure. Results from drug-interaction studies with warfarin, metformin, atorvastatin and digoxin indicate that no dose adjustment of the co-administered drugs is warranted when administered together with semaglutide. In addition, semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives and hence, is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. 3.3.2.2 Efficacy Based on results from the clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide treatment reduced both fasting and postprandial glucose compared to placebo, by improving multiple aspects of Î²-cell function and by reducing both fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations, all in a glucose dependent manner. The weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue and was considered to be explained by lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, and lowered energy intake. In addition, semaglutide improved control of eating and reduced food cravings. Similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying.CONFIDENTIAL"

In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA1c and body weight of up to 1.85 %-point and 6.42 kg, respectively, were obtained with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Significantly more subjects with semaglutide versus comparators reached the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)-defined treatment target of an HbA1c <7% and â¤6.5%, respectively, and weight loss responses of â¥5% and â¥10%. The superior and clinically relevant beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycaemic control as estimated by HbA1c were substantiated by improvements in secondary glycaemia-related supportive endpoints28-31. 3.3.2.3 Safety Data from the 5 global phase 3a clinical trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627) showed that the safety and tolerability of semaglutide at doses up to 1.0 mg per week and administered for up to 56 weeks of treatment were consistent with other GLP-1RAs. Commonly AEs included nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. The escalation regimen utilized was associated with good tolerability and low numbers of discontinuation due to AEs. Accordingly, the most frequently reported AEs in subjects with T2D were gastrointestinal (e.g., nausea and vomiting), as were the most frequent AEs leading to premature treatment discontinuation. Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently in subjects receiving semaglutide and the events were mainly non-severe. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to semaglutide. As with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. However, only few subjects administered semaglutide experienced allergic reactions and injection site reactions. These have mainly been mild and transient of nature; however, more generalised reactions may occur. The effect of semaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was evaluated in a T2D population at high risk for CV events, in the cardiovascular outcome trial, SUSTAIN 6 (NN9535- 3744)32. SUSTAIN 6 trial achieved its primary objective by showing non-inferiority of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes; moreover, s.c. semaglutide statistically significantly reduced cardiovascular risk versus placebo 32. In addition, results from the recently completed LEADERÂ® trial (EX2211-3748) showed that treatment with the once daily liraglutide does not increase the risk of MACE as compared to placebo. In fact, treatment with liraglutide reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome consisting of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo 32. The overall safety profile of semaglutide in the SUSTAIN 6 trial (NN9535-3744) was consistent with previous CONFIDENTIAL"

However, in this trial, the diabetic retinopathy complications were reported more frequently in the semaglutide-treated subjects compared with placebo. Please see the current edition of semaglutide s.c. (NN9535) IB or any updates hereof for further details27. 3.4 Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class suitable for once-daily oral administration. It was developed and marketed by Merck & Co as sitagliptin phosphate under the trade name JanuviaÂ® Sitagliptin works by inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the incretin hormones GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). By preventing GLP-1 and GIP inactivation, secretion of insulin is increased and release of glucagon is suppressed. The obvious advantage with a convenient route of administration is however counterbalanced by a significantly lower effect of the DPP-4 inhibitors on glycaemic control and body weight as compared to GLP-1 RAs. This has also been demonstrated for sitagliptin when compared to liraglutide 33-35. Adverse reactions reported in >5% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycaemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with sitagliptin compared to placebo 36. 3.5 Risk and benefits assessment This assessment is based on the safety and efficacy data for semaglutide and sitagliptin presented above as well as potential risk identified as drug class effects. 3.5.1 Semaglutide risks and precautions The nonclinical safety programme of semaglutide has not revealed any safety issues precluding use in humans. The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Diabetic retinopathy complications A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive anti-diabetic treatment37. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in BG may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression 38, 39even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening40. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy complications in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 41. 3.5.3 Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post marketing data that GLP-1- based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of Î²-cells and suppression of Î±-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions and injection site reaction As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include localized injection site reactions or generalized reactions, including urticaria, rash and pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with SU or insulin. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a background medication in this trial, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current, approved labels.CONFIDENTIAL"

Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed according to flowchart in Section 2 and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, or as required by local law. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation in regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial enrolment. There are also strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial (see Section 6.4). If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes42, 43(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes44. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for semaglutide (NN9535) 27, or any updates thereto. 3.5.5 Sitagliptin risk and precautions Sitagliptin is generally considered to be well tolerated. The most commonly reported side effect is upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. Some of the potential risk associated with GLP-1 RA treatment has also been associated with treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitors as sitagliptin i.e. pancreatitis, acute renal impairment, hypersensitivity reactions and hypoglycaemia (US prescribing information45and Chinese prescribing information46) 3.5.6 Benefits In this trial subjects in all treatment arms will be treated within a regimen anticipated to be more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of randomisation into the trial. It is expected that subjects will benefit from the trial treatment with respect to optimised glycaemic control, a reduced risk of long-term diabetic complications and a potential weight loss.

Furthermore, data from two cardiovascular outcomes trials investigating treatment with GLP-1 RAs compared to placebo have indicated a beneficial effect of these drugs on cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard of care in subjects with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events (see Section 3.3.2.3 ). Sitagliptin has in phase 3 trials where sitagliptin has been given in combination with metformin proven to provide significant improvements in HbA 1cand FPG47. All subjects in this trial will receive active treatment and will receive trial drug and auxiliary free of charge. Finally, it is expected that all subjects participating in the trial will benefit from participation through close contact with the study site and close follow-up of their type 2 diabetes. Such careful medical examination will most likely result in an intensified management of their diabetes. 3.5.7 Risk and benefit conclusion It is concluded that the potential benefits from participating in the trial outweigh the potential risks. The safety profile of semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. Sitagliptin is already a marketed drug in the 100 mg dose and approved for the use in type 2 diabetic patients. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits semaglutide will provide to subjects with T2D. 3.6 Rationale for the trial The currently available treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes are still not satisfactory and there is still a large proportion of patients not reaching the treatment targets. In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA1c and body weight with semaglutide was superior to sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine demonstrating semaglutide as a highly efficacious treatment option. The rationale for this trial is to compare the efficacy of semaglutide versus sitagliptin in subjects with type-2 diabetes in terms of glycaemic control, weight loss and other efficacy parameters. Furthermore the trial is designed to address and compare safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction. This trial is designed to resemble the main trial NN9535-3626 (SUSTAIN 2) in the global CONFIDENTIAL"

Doses must not be changed during the trial after the maintenance dose has been reached. Semaglutide injections should be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, and should be taken on the same day of the week during the trial. Both semaglutide and sitagliptin can be taken any time of day irrespective of meals. If necessary, the trial product may be discontinued for safety reasons. In case trial product is discontinued, subjects will not be withdrawn from trial but should continue to follow scheduled visits to the extent possible (see section 6.5.1 ). Trial product will be add-on in subjects failing on metformin monotherapy. Subjects must not be prescribed other GLP-1 RA in the period between V9 and V10 or V9A and V10A. 5.3.1 Missed dose If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours). If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer a dose until the next scheduled dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing day of the week. 5.3.2 Background medication Subjects should upon inclusion continue pre-trial background medication throughout the entire trial. The background medication should be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and frequency during the whole treatment period unless rescue medication is needed (see section 6.4). Metformin is considered background medication (non-investigational medicinal product) and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S (except for Brazil where Metformin will be provided by Novo Nordisk FarmacÃªutica do Brasil Ltda). Metformin should be used in accordance with standard of care in the individual country at the discretion of the investigator and the daily dose should be unchanged throughout the trial unless the rescue criteria are met.

These are also included in the flow chart (see section 2). The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one list and may be generated from the IWRS. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site at the time of delegation of tasks. 8.1.1 Screening visit 1 (V1) For procedures and assessments performed at screening, please see flow chart (see section 2). The IWRS must be contacted to register the subject as screened (see section 10). Subject will be assigned a unique number (lowest available number allocated to site) which is maintained throughout the trial. It must be stated in the medical record that the subject is participating in the current trial. At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. The subjects should be reminded to show the card to other health care providers, as applicable. Once all data relating to screening V1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed by the investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible to continue the trial. 8.1.1.1 Screen failures For screening failures the screening failure form must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the case report form eCRF. Follow-up of SAEs must be carried out according to section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed in eCRF.CONFIDENTIAL"

Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit.. Glucose lowering agents and trial product cannot be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken. An exception from this is the follow-up visit (V10) and follow-up premature discontinuation visit (V10A) where fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last two hours prior to the visit.

Visit 2 will take place two weeks (Â±7 days) after screening V1. Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of four treatment arms. The IWRS will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. Trial product will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent with different intervals during the trial. Subject will be instructed in administration of sc injection of trial product and the investigator must document that a direction for use (DFU) is given orally and/or in writing. Date, time and dose of first administration of trial product will be captured in the eCRF.Please see section 9for further information about the trial product. 8.1.4 Visits For visit numbers, timing of site visits, phone contacts and visit windows during the trial period, please refer to the flow chart (see section 2). Planned visits can be re-scheduled within the allowed visit window. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all site visits and phone contacts occur according to the flow chart ( 2). 8.1.5 Missed visits and unscheduled visits If a visit is missed and it is not possible to re-schedule, every effort should be made to ensure information is collected at a telephone contact. Subjects will be invited for the next scheduled visit according to visit schedule.CONFIDENTIAL"

If a subject attends the clinic for a visit not described in the protocol, an unscheduled visit form must be completed. This only applies if assessments are done, hence not for the purpose of re-test of blood- or urine sampling, or re-supply of trial product. In case of re-supply a dispensing session should be made in the IWRS selecting additional medication. Re-scheduling of fasting visit samples is not considered as an unscheduled visit. 8.1.6 End of treatment (V9/9A) and Follow-up (V10/10A) 8.1.6.1 Subjects completing the treatment period as per protocol An end of treatment visit (V9) should be scheduled when the subject has completed the treatment period as described per protocol and a follow-up visit (V10) should be performed at least 5 weeks after (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). The follow-up visit serves to collect AEs, technical complaints, hypoglycaemic episodes, ECG, concomitant medication and blood sampling for anti-semaglutide antibodies . 8.1.6.2 Subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product For subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely the visit end of treatment â premature discontinuation (V9A) should be scheduled shortly after subject has discontinued trial product. The visit follow-up â premature discontinuation (V10A) should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after discontinuation of trial product (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely should continue with the scheduled site contacts. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after discontinuation of trial product. However, as a minimum these subjects will be called in for end of treatment (V9) and follow-up (V10) at the time of the scheduled completion of the trial. 8.1.7 Withdrawals Subjects who consider withdrawing from the trial should as a minimum be encouraged to have procedures performed according to the end of treatment visit (V9) as soon as possible and the follow up visit (V10) at least 5 weeks after but not more than 6 weeks after, if possible. If a subject has already prematurely discontinued from trial product and previously attended visit V9A and visit V10A, no further visits should be attended.CONFIDENTIAL"

Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing from a trial, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for not completing the trial must be specified on the end-of-trial form in the CRF (see section 6.5). 8.1.8 Investigatorâs assessment Review of diaries, patient reported outcomes (PROs), laboratory reports, ECGs, eye examination (fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy), physical examination etc. must be documented either on the front page of the documents and/or in the subject's medical record. The signed documents must be retained at the site as source documentation. For ECGs, physical examinations and eye examinations the evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal â Was the result clinically significant? (No/Yes) For laboratory report values outside the reference range, the investigator must specify whether the value is clinically significant or clinically non-significant. All laboratory printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator on the day of evaluation. The signed laboratory report is retained at the site as source documentation. In case of abnormal clinical significant findings found as a result of screening procedures conducted at V1 or assessments revealing baseline conditions at V2 the investigator must state a comment in the subjectsâ medical record and record this in the concomitant illness form in the eCRF. At subsequent visits any clinically significant changes or new clinically significant findings must be reported as an AE according to section 12.

A SMPG value â¤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or hypoglycaemic symptoms must be recorded in the diary at the hypoglycaemic episode form by the subject. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms will by default be considered as one hypoglycaemic episode until a succeeding SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved. One hypoglycaemic episode form is to cover these measurements and/or symptoms. In case of several low SMPG values within the hy pogly caemic episode, the lowest value is the one that will be reported as the SMPG value for th e hypoglycaemic episode but the start time of the episode will remain as the time for the first SMPG value and/or symptom.

Results of a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation. If the subject had a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, the investigator may base their evaluation upon the results of that examination. However, the examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the subject did not have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, such examination must be performed by the investigator or other qualified health care professional prior to randomisation. If the applicable fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. In addition, fundus photography /dilated fundoscopy must be performed at V9. In the case of premature discontinuation, the assessments must be performed both at V9A and at V9. The assessments at V9A and V9 can be performed in the period between V9A and V10A and between V9 and V10, respectively, but the results should be available no later than at V10A and V10, respectively. The investigator should indicate whether the outcome of the eye examination was normal or abnormal, and, if abnormal, indicate whether clinically significant. Relevant findings as a result of this screening procedure must be recorded as diabetes history and diabetes complications or concomitant illness/medical history in accordance with Section 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 respectively. 8.5 Laboratory assessments For laboratory analysis of efficacy and safety parameters will be drawn during the 37 weeks of the trial. The laboratory analyses will be performed by a central laboratory except for anti-semaglutide antibodies and IgE antibodies where a special laboratory will be used. In the situation of suspicion of acute pancreatitis or severe hypersensitivity described in appendix B, a local laboratory will be used. Laboratory samples comprise both urine and blood samples.

Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. When using blood glucose meters the measurement is performed with capillary blood calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values i.e. the measurement is performed on blood while the value is reported as plasma. It is important to be aware of this difference throughout the protocol. Only the blood glucose meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the protocol.

A randomisation session will be carried out for all subjects by using the IWRS. At the randomisation visit subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive one of four parallel treatments groups: !Semaglutide 0.5 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (0.5) mg once-weekly !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (1.0) mg once-weekly Randomisation will be stratified by country. 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes If the trial site needs to break the code, Novo Nordisk should if possible, be contacted before the code is broken. The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the code break confirmation notification generated by the IWRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. If the code has been broken the subject must be discontinued from trial product but be asked to continue in the trial (see section 8.1.6.2 ). A treatment discontinuation session should be completed in IWRS. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break monitor should be contacted and if monitor cannot get access the IWRS vendor helpdesk should be contacted.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, ie an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should notbe reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening procedures (pre- existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form (see section 8.4.4 ). The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity assessment âMild - no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities. âModerate - marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities. âSevere - considerable interference with the subject's daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality assessment The following terms are used when assessing the relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): âProbable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. âPossible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. âRecovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. âNot recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. âFatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as ""recovered/resolved"", ""recovering/resolving"", ""recovered/resolved with sequelae"" or ""not recovered/not resolved"". An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. âUnknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.1 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a. The term ""life threatening"" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b. The term ""hospitalisation"" is used when a subject: â Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or â Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hoursCONFIDENTIAL"

Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c. A substantial disruption of a subject's ability to conduct normal life functions (eg following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life). d. For example intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasiasis or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following adverse events must always be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: !suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product !risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Additional assessments should be made for events meeting the criterion of Hyâs law as stated above (see appendix B). 12.1.2 Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 12.1.3 Medication errors Medication errors concerning trial products are defined as: â Administration of wrong drug. Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error. â Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous. â Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (eg suicide attempt) misuse or abuse of trial product. â Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. The administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extend where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur. Medication errors must be reported on an AE form and a specific event form, see Section 8.4.2 .CONFIDENTIAL"

This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (see section 2). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12â1 During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: ""Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?"" All AEs, either observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the Investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a safety information form must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one safety information form can be used to describe all the SAEs. For all non-serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest.

No symptoms of hypoglycaemia have been reported in connection with overdose of semaglutide. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the subjectâs clinical signs and symptoms. For other precautions, please see section 3.5.1 . Sitagliptin During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical studies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.

The semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external event adjudication committee is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre-defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre- defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities, and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in section 12.1.4 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to Standardized Definitions57. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication package (for example X-ray, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports, and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when receiving a request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor.

This system and support services to the system will be supplied by a vendor. Ensure that all relevant questions are answered, and that no empty data field exists. If a test or an assessment has not been done and will not be available, or if the question is irrelevant (eg is not applicable), indicate this according to the data entry instructions. The following will be provided as paper CRFs: !Pregnancy forms In addition paper AE forms and safety information forms will be provided. These must be used when access to the eCRF is revoked. The investigator must ensure that all information is consistent with the source documentation. By electronically signing the case book in the eCRF, the investigator confirms that the information in the eCRF and related forms is complete and correct. 13.1 Corrections to case report forms Corrections to the CRF data may be made by the investigator or the investigator's authorised staff. An audit trail will be maintained in the CRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the correction.

Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for data verification and validation purposes. At the end of trial the investigator must ensure that all remaining data have been entered into the eCRF no later than 3 days after the last subjectâs last visit at the site in order to ensure the planned lock of the database.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FPFV or FSFV and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the CRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site. The intervals between monitoring visits can be shorter. Factors to be considered in this determination may include objective, endpoints, purpose, design, complexity, blinding, number of subjects and expected recruitment rate. The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (eg by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the CRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Considering the electronic source data environment, it is accepted that the earliest practically retainable record should be considered as the location of the source data. Therefore transcription to the diary from the blood glucose meter is considered the source document for BG values. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data, if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original diaries and PROs are considered as source data and must not be removed from the trial site. The monitor will ensure that the CRFs are completed on an on-going basis within the agreed timelines. The monitor must ensure that all required eCRF forms for screening failures are completed, (e.g. screening failure form and the case book sign of (affirmation statement) is electronically signed by the investigator).CONFIDENTIAL"

The SAP will be finalised before database lock. Results from the statistical analysis will generally be presented by two-sided confidence intervals with a confidence level of 95% and associated p-value. Superiority will be formulated and tested as one-sided hypotheses at a 2.5% significance level. Non-inferiority between two treatments will be evaluated by comparing the upper limit of the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference with the pre-defined non-inferiority margin. Handling of missing data In the case of missing data no general imputation will be performed for the analyses, unless otherwise specified. If an assessment has been made both at screening and randomisation, the value from the randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. If the value measured at the randomisation visit is missing and the assessment also has been made at screening, then the screening value will be used as the baseline value. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to Â½ LLOQ. The primary analysis model will be the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM), see section 17.3 for further details. One of the assumptions behind (MMRM) is that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR). This means that given the observed data, the mechanism generating missing values is independent of the unobserved data that is the missing data. The MMRM and the negative binomial model both rely on the MAR assumption for generating unbiased estimates of treatment differences. Based on previous semaglutide trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes, the treatment discontinuation rate from randomised treatment and trial withdrawal is expected to be about 20%. The treatments in this trial should be effective, given the historical documentation, and this should minimise treatment discontinuation due to ineffective therapy. The main reasons for treatment discontinuation are expected to be AEs, ineffective therapy and non-eligibility (subjects randomised although not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria). Treatment discontination due to non-eligibility can be regarded as missing completely at random (MCAR), i.e. it does not depend on the observed or missing data values. This category of missing data is not expected to introduce bias in the estimated treatment differences. Treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy is expected to be reflected in the observed data obtained prior to the discontinuation from randomised treatment, and the corresponding missing data can therefore be assumed as MAR to some extent. Missing data due to AEs is expected to be similar between groups except for, potentially, a slightly higher incidence in the semaglutide treatment group due to gastrointestinal side effects. Together with potential CONFIDENTIAL"

Several different sensitivity analyses will be used to investigate whether the results from the MMRM approach are robust towards deviations from the assumption of MAR. 17.1 Sample size calculation The primary objective is to compare the effect of two dose levels of semaglutide once-weekly treatment (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) with sitagliptin 100 mg on the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA 1c after 30 weeks of treatment. In the calculations determining the sample size it is presumed that in the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between endpoints and placebo volume. In total 1050 subjects will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner. Assuming 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment, and further taking the assumption that these subjects are excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis set, 280 subjects in each group are expected to be included in the PP analysis set. The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg and HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. The two hypothesis tests are assumed to be independent and for each of the hypothesis the power calculation is based on a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5%. Using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%, and assuming a true HbA 1cdifference (semaglutide minus sitagliptin) of 0% and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%, a total of 280 subjects per group in the PP analysis set will give 90% marginal power to conclude HbA 1c non-inferiority for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. Assuming the same HbA 1ceffect for the two dose levels of semaglutide, the overall power to demonstrate HbA 1c non-inferiority for the two dose levels of semaglutide vs. sitagliptin will be at least 80%. For change in body weight, the power calculation is based on the assumptions of a true difference of -1.5 kg and a SD of 4.0 kg. In addition, 50% efficacy retention is assumed for the anticipated 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment giving an expected treatment difference of -1.35 kg, which is the number used in the power calculation. With the above assumptions, a total of 350 subjects per group in the full analysis set (FAS) will give more than 99% marginal power to conclude superiority in body weight for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg.CONFIDENTIAL"

Safety Analysis Set (SAS): includes all subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation based on the trial product received for the majority of the period they were on treatment. This will be referred to as contributing to the evaluation âas treatedâ. Before data are locked for statistical analysis, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the internal study group. Exclusion of data from analyses will be used restrictively and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion must be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the CTR.

The in-trial observation period starts at randomisation (as registered in IWRS) and ends at the date of: !The last direct subject-site contact, which is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after planned last dose of trial product at a follow-up visit !Withdrawal for subjects who withdraw their informed consent !The last subject-investigator contact as defined by the investigator for subjects who are lost to follow-up !Death for subjects who dies before any of the above For subjects not randomised but exposed to trial product the in-trial periods starts at the date of first dose of trial product On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered treated with trial product. The observation period is a sub-set of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately according to the flow chart.

The visit window for the follow-up visit is + 7 days, which is the reason for the 42 days specified in the bullet above. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are exposed. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product + 7 days in accordance with trial flow chart and assessment times.

Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are treated. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a sub-set of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications.

Safety will be evaluated based on the in-trial and the on-treatment observation periods unless otherwise specified. For subjects who have no post-baseline scheduled assessments available in the on-treatment without rescue period, the baseline value will be carried forward to the first scheduled visit for the associated endpoint to ensure that all randomised subjects will contribute to the statistical analysis. Data points collected outside an observation period will be treated as missing in the analysis. Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. For adjudicated events, the onset date will be the EAC adjudicated onset date. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 30 weeks of treatment. In the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between HbA 1cchange after 30 weeks and placebo volume. The primary endpoint will be based on FAS using data from the âon-treatment without rescue medicationâ observation period in a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM). A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) will be used. The model will include all post baseline HbA 1c measurements collected at scheduled visits up to and including week 30 data as dependent variables. The independent effects included in the model will be treatment and country as fixed effects and baseline response as covariate, all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix will be employed for measurements within the same subjects, assuming that measurements across subjects are independent. Regarding missing data this analysis approach relies on the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR).

If the corresponding null hypothesis is not rejected, the testing will stop and no further conclusions will be drawn. The following ordering in the statistical test sequence will be used: 1. Non-inferiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 2. Non-inferiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 3. Superiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 4. Superiority in change in body weight for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 5. Superiority in change in body weight for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 6. Superiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin Non-inferiority will be concluded if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference in HbA 1cbetween semaglutide and sitagliptin is less than 0.3%. Superiority for either change in HbA 1cor change in body weight will be claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference is below 0% or 0 kg respectively. When establishing non-inferiority the analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) and supplemented by an analysis with the per protocol population using the data from the âon treatment without rescue medicationâ observation period as supportive evidence. The FAS population will be used in the analysis when concluding superiority. Sensitivity analysis To investigate the sensitivity of the main results, complimentary and separate analyses for primary endpoint and the confirmatory secondary endpoint will be performed, using the FAS only, except for HbA 1c, where the PP analysis set will be used in a sensitivity analysis regarding the non- inferiority evaluation. These analyses will investigate the sensitivity of the results due to the impact of missing values. The primary analysis regarding non-inferiority of the primary endpoint change in HbA 1cafter 30 weeks will also be performed separately based on the data in the PP analysis set only. The primary endpoint and the secondary confirmatory endpoint will be evaluated in the following sensitivity analyses: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be analysed with imputation of missing values according to the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. based on the FAS CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator is accountable for the conduct of the trial at his/her site. If any tasks are delegated, the investigator must maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated specified significant trial-related duties. The investigator must ensure that there is adequate training for all staff participating in the conduct of the trial. It is the investigator's responsibility to supervise the conduct of the trial and to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. A qualified physician, who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial, must be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. The investigator must ensure adequate supervision of the conduct of the trial at the trial site. The investigator will follow instructions from Novo Nordisk when processing data. The investigator is responsible for filing essential documents (ie those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced) in the investigator's trial file. The documents should be kept in a secure locked facility, so no unauthorized persons can get access to the data. The subject identification code list must be kept securely and separate from the personal data. The investigator will take all necessary technical and organisational safety measures to prevent accidental or wrongful destruction, loss or deterioration of data. The investigator will prevent any unauthorised access to data or any other processing of data against applicable law. The investigator must be able to provide the necessary information or otherwise demonstrate to Novo Nordisk that such technical and organisational safety measures have been taken. During any period of unavailability, the investigator must delegate responsibility for medical care of subjects to a specific qualified physician who will be readily available to subjects during that time. If the investigator is no longer able to fulfil the role as investigator (eg if he/she moves or retires), a new investigator will be appointed in consultation with Novo Nordisk. The investigator and other site personnel must have sufficient English skills according to their assigned task(s).CONFIDENTIAL"

All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection with this trial shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential information. No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. One principal investigator will be appointed to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications62. 23.1 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators' and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication.CONFIDENTIAL"

Novo Nordisk maintains the right to be informed of plans by any investigator to publish and to review any scientific paper, presentation, communication or other information concerning the investigation described in this protocol. Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors62(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria). At the end of the trial, one or more publications (abstracts, posters, manuscripts) will be prepared for submission to scientific congresses and peer-reviewed journals in collaboration between Novo Nordisk and investigator(s) appointed by Novo Nordisk. These investigator(s) must meet the ICMJE authorship criteria to be named authors on publications. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission for publication of such primary policy will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own research subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must agree to archive the documentation (this includes both electronic and paper- based records) pertaining to the trial in an archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial if not otherwise notified. The investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission from Novo Nordisk. If the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, Novo Nordisk can refer the investigator to an independent archive provider that has a system in place to allow only the investigator to access the files. The investigator must be able to access his/her trial documents without involving Novo Nordisk in any way. Site-specific CRFs and other subject data (in an electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) will be provided to the investigator before access is revoked to the systems and/or electronic devices supplied by Novo Nordisk. These data must be retained by the trial site. If the Novo Nordisk provided data (eg the CD-ROM) is not readable during the entire storage period, the investigator can request a new copy. A copy of all data will be stored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk will maintain Novo Nordisk documentation pertaining to the trial for as long as the product is on the market plus 20 years. The files from the investigator site/institution must be retained for 15 years after the completion of the trial, or longer if required by local regulations. The deletion process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 24.2 Retention of human biospecimens Antibody samples may be stored until market authorisation in case Health Authorities requests further characterisation of the antibody response. (For Brazil: the laboratory samples for BR subjects will be destroyed at the latest at the completion of the CTR, including samples for anti-semaglutide antibody analysis. No sample will be stored after the completion of CTR). None of the data will be identified by name. Antibody samples and thyroid tissue will be identified only by a subject number, a visit number and a trial identification number. The trial staff is responsible for maintaining a code list which links to the subject number. The code list must be kept for at least 15 years. The code list may be reviewed by Novo Nordisk staff including auditors or representatives from regulatory authorities, but no copies will be made of this list.CONFIDENTIAL"

Subjects who have discontinued trial produc t prematurely should also attend V9 and V10 according to their initially scheduled week 30 and Week 35 visits. x2Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely will be asked to attend two additional visits to undergo assessments: End of T reatment-premature discontinuation (V9A) and Follow Up -premature discontinuation (V10A). V9A should be scheduled at discontinuation of the trial product. V10A should be scheduled 5 weeks after discontinuation of trial product (+ 7 days visit window). x3Fundus photography/dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days before visit 2 is acceptable if results are available for evaluat ion at the visit 2 and no deterioration in visual function since last assessment. x4Antibody sampling should preferably be done pre-dose. For fasti ng and non-fasting visit, where the injection takes place on the day of site visit, trial product must not be taken before blood sampling. For visit 9 and 10: Not applicable if taken at a premature discontinuation visit x5For women of child bearing potential: For all site visits a serum pregnancy test must be performed. Urine pregnancy test should be performed at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, or as required by local law. x6At V10 and V10A collect diary only. x7Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit. Glucose lowering agents and trial pr oduct cannot be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken. x8For the follow-up visit (V10/V10A) attend fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 2 hours prior to the visit. x9If premature discontinuation occurs, End of Treatment form must be filled-in when the discontinuation happens and End of Trial f orm at scheduled V10. If a subject completes both the treatment and the trial at scheduled time, the End of Treatment form must be filled at V9 and End of Trial form to be filled in at V10. In case of subject withdrawal, both End of Treatment form and End of Trial form must be filled-in at the time they withdra w from the trial."

The pathogenesis is not fully understood but seems to be heterogeneous, involving environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver 3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with type 2 diabetes, in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia4,5. Despite the availability of several anti-diabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with type 2 diabetes do not achieve the recommended blood glucose target levels 6-9. 3.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory  effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets10, 11. Subjects  with T2D have a decreased response to GLP-112-15. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 andthus, the ability to lower BG levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels16. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight17. GLP-1is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation and food intake18, 19. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure17-19. These mechanisms of action make glucagon- like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2D20-22. Due to the very short half-life of <1.5 minutes after i.v. administration, native GLP-1 is not suitable for therapeutic use. To realise the full therapeutic potential of GLP-1, the pharmacokinetic and hence the pharmacodynamic effect needs to be protracted. 3.3 Semaglutide Semaglutide is a potent human GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) for once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. It is structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza Â®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The extended half- life of the semaglutide molecule is primarily obtained due to binding to albumin, which is facilitated CONFIDENTIAL"

The specific modifications in the molecule are: 1) a modification in position 8 (alanine to 2-aminoisobutyric acid) of the peptide backbone to increase stability against dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), and a change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine to limit the options for acylation to the one remaining lysine in the sequence; 2) a large hydrophilic spacer between the lysine in position 26 and the gamma glutamate whereto the fatty acid is attached; 3) a C18 fatty diacid with a terminal acidic group23, 24. The spacer and the fatty acid both contribute to increased albumin binding, which results in decreased renal clearance resulting in a prolonged half-life of approximately 1 week, making semaglutide suitable for once-weekly s.c. administration. 3.3.1 Non-clinical data The non-clinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M325guideline to support the clinical development. The standard non-clinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnataldevelopment toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide is generally well tolerated with expected GLP-1 effects on food intake and body weight being dose limiting in mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Two potential safety issues have been identified. 3.3.1.1 Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Thyroid C-cell neoplasia was seen in mice and rat 2-year carcinogenicity studies. Proliferative C  cellchanges in rodents are a known effect following GLP-1 receptor activation by GLP-1 receptor  agonists. The finding in rodents is caused by a non-genotoxic, specific GLP-1 receptor-mediated  mechanism to which rodents are particularly sensitive. Recently published data have shown that the  GLP-1 receptor is not expressed in the normal human thyroid, and accordingly, the risk of GLP-1  receptor mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low 26. 3.3.1.2 Embryo âfoetal development toxicity Semaglutide adversely affected embryo âfoetal development in the rat by a GLP-1 receptor mediated impaired function of the inverted yolk sac placenta during a period of gestation when the rat embryo is entirely dependent on the inverted yolk sac placenta for its nutrient supply. In primates, the yolk sac does not invert to fully enclose the embryo, and it does not come in direct contact with the uterine wall to form a placenta as in rodents. Accordingly, the mechanism by which semaglutide adversely affects embryo-foetal development in the rat, is not likely to be of relevance to humans. Studies in cynomolgus monkeys confirmed that maternal dosing of semaglutide does not affect embryo âfoetal development in this species. However, the initial maternal body weight loss caused by the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early pregnancy loss in one of three studies. In cynomolgus monkeys, the overall developmental no observable adverse CONFIDENTIAL"

A comprehensive review of results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the current edition of semaglutide (NN9535) investigatorâs brochure (IB)27, or any updates hereof. 3.3.2 Clinical data As of 1 August 2016, 16 clinical pharmacology trials (trials NN9535-1820, 3679, 3633, 3616, 3819, 4010, 3789, 3652, 3685, 3634, 3687, 3817,3818, 3684, 3651 and 3635), 1 phase 2 trial (NN9535- 1821) and 8 phase 3a trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625,3626, 3627, 3744, 4091, 4092) have been completed with semaglutide s.c. once-weekly. Clinical pharmacology trials were conducted in healthy subjects, in subjects with T2D, in subjects with obesity and in subjects with renal- and hepatic impairment. The phase 2 dose-finding trial was conducted in subjects with T2D. The semaglutide phase 3a programme evaluated the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in a broad T2D population and covered the continuum of T2D care. The programme evaluated mono- and combination therapy with anti-hyperglycaemic therapies and compared semaglutide with the most important comparators at the time of initiating the phase 3a programme. In addition, the phase 3a programme included a long-term (104-week) cardiovascular outcomes trial (trial 3744) in a T2D population at high risk of cardiovascular events. 3.3.2.1 Pharmacokinetics The results from the completed clinical pharmacology trials confirm that semaglutide has PK properties compatible with once-weekly administration, having a flat concentration profile overtime, with a median time to maximum concentration (tmax) of 1 â3 days post-dosing and an elimination half-life (tÂ½) of approximately 1 week. The PK properties of semaglutide appear comparable between healthy subjects, subjects with T2D and subjects with renal failure. Results from drug-interaction studies with warfarin, metformin, atorvastatin and digoxin indicate that no dose adjustment of the co-administered drugs is warranted when administered together with semaglutide. In addition, semaglutide does not decrease the exposure of oral contraceptives and hence, is not anticipated to decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. 3.3.2.2 Efficacy Based on results from the clinical pharmacology trials, semaglutide treatment reduced both fasting and postprandial glucose compared to placebo, by improving multiple aspects of Î²-cell function and by reducing both fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations, all in a glucose dependent manner. The weight loss observed with semaglutide was primarily from fat tissue and was considered to be explained by lowered appetite, both in the fasting and postprandial state, and lowered energy intake. In addition, semaglutide improved control of eating and reduced food cravings. Similar to other GLP-1 receptor agonists, semaglutide caused a minor delay of early postprandial gastric emptying.CONFIDENTIAL"

In the 5 global phase 3a trials(3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA1c and body weight of up to 1.85 %-point and6.42 kg, respectively, were obtained with semaglutide 1.0 mg. Significantly more subjects with  semaglutide versus comparators reached the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American  Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)-defined treatment target of an HbA1c <7% and  â¤6.5%, respectively, and weight loss responses of â¥5% and â¥10%. The superior and clinically  relevant beneficial effects of semaglutide on glycaemic control as estimated by HbA1c were  substantiated by improvements in secondary glycaemia-related supportive endpoints 28-31. 3.3.2.3 Safety Data from the 5 global phase 3a clinical trials (NN9535-3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627) showed  that the safety and tolerability of semaglutide at doses up to 1.0 mg per week and administered for  up to 56 weeks of treatment were consistent with other GLP-1RAs. Commonly AEs included  nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. The escalation regimen  utilized was associated with good tolerability and low numbers of discontinuation due to AEs.  Accordingly, the most frequently reported AEs in subjects with T2D were gastrointestinal (e.g.,  nausea and vomiting), as were the most frequent AEs leading to premature treatment  discontinuation. Hypoglycaemia occurred infrequently in subjects receiving semaglutide and the events were mainly  non-severe. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined  with sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart  rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to  semaglutide. As with all protein based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide may  develop immunogenic and allergic reactions. However, only few subjects administered semaglutide experienced allergic reactions and injection site reactions. These have mainly been mildand transient of nature; however, more generalised reactions may occur. The effect of semaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was evaluated in a T2D population at high risk for CV events, in the cardiovascular outcome trial, SUSTAIN 6 (NN9535-3744) 32. SUSTAIN 6 trial achieved its primary objective by showing non-inferiority of once-weekly s.c. semaglutide versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes; moreover, s.c. semaglutide statistically significantly reduced cardiovascular risk versus placebo32. In addition, results from the recently completed LEADERÂ® trial (EX2211-3748) showed that treatment with the once daily liraglutide does not increase the risk of MACE as compared to placebo. In fact, treatment with liraglutide reduced the risk of the primary composite outcome consisting of death from cardiovascular causes, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke by 13% versus placebo32.The overall safety profile of semaglutide in the SUSTAIN 6 trial (NN9535-3744) was consistent with previousCONFIDENTIAL"

However, in this trial, the diabetic retinopathy complications were reported more frequently in the semaglutide-treated subjects compared with placebo. Please see the current edition of semaglutide s.c. (NN9535) IB or any updates hereof for further details27. 3.4 Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is an oral antihyperglycemic agent of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class suitable for once-daily oral administration. It was developed and marketed by Merck & Co as sitagliptin phosphate under the trade name Januvia Â® Sitagliptin works by inhibition of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4). This enzyme breaks down the incretin hormones GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). By preventing GLP-1 and GIP inactivation, secretion of insulin is increased and release of glucagon is suppressed. The obvious advantage with a convenient route of administration is however counterbalanced by a significantly lower effect of the DPP-4 inhibitors on glycaemic control and body weight as compared to GLP-1 RAs. This has also been demonstrated for sitagliptin when compared to liraglutide 33-35. Adverse reactions reported in >5% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycaemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with sitagliptin compared to placebo 36. 3.5 Risk and benefits assessment This assessment is based on the safety and efficacy data for semaglutide and sitagliptin presented above as well as potential risk identified as drug class effects. 3.5.1 Semaglutide risks and precautions The nonclinical safety programme of semaglutide has not revealed any safety issues precluding use in humans. The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation  mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation  with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Diabetic retinopathy complications A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive anti-diabetic treatment37. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in BG may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression 38, 39even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening40. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy complications in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy pe rforme d be fore enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 41. 3.5.3 Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A . Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post marketing data that GLP-1- based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of Î²-cells and suppression of Î±-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions and injection site reaction As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include localized injection site reactions or generalized reactions, including urticaria, rash and pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when semaglutide is combined with SU or insulin. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. SGLT-2 inhibitors, a background medication in this trial, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current, approved labels.CONFIDENTIAL"

Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed according to flowchart in Section 2and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed,  or as required by local law. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation in regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial enrolment. There are also strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial (see Section 6.4). If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes 42, 43(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes44. Further details with regards to safety of trial product are described in the current edition of the IB for semaglutide (NN9535)27, or any updates thereto. 3.5.5 Sitagliptin risk and precautions Sitagliptin is generally considered to be well tolerated. The most commonly reported side effect is upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. Some of the potential risk associated with GLP-1 RA treatment has also been associated with treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitors as sitagliptin i.e. pancreatitis, acute renal impairment, hypersensitivity reactions and hypoglycaemia (US prescribing information 45and Chinese prescribing information46) 3.5.6 Benefits In this trial subjects in all treatment arms will be treated within a regimen anticipated to be more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of randomisation into the trial. It is expected that subjects will benefit from the trial treatment with respect to optimised glycaemic control, a reduced risk of long-term diabetic complications and a potential weight loss.

Furthermore, data from two cardiovascular outcomes trials investigating treatment with GLP-1 RAs compared to placebo have indicated a beneficial effect of these drugs on cardiovascular outcomes when added to standard of care in subjects with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular events (see Section 3.3.2.3 ). Sitagliptin has in phase 3 trials where sitagliptin has been given in combination with metformin proven to provide significant improvements in HbA 1cand FPG47. All subjects in this trial will receive active treatment and will receive trial drug and auxiliary free of charge. Finally, it is expected that all subjects participating in the trial will benefit from participation through close contact with the study site and close follow-up of their type 2 diabetes. Such careful medical examination will most likely result in an intensified management of their diabetes. 3.5.7 Risk and benefit conclusion It is concluded that the potential benefits from participating in the trial outweigh the potential risks. The safety profile of semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of once-weekly doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. Sitagliptin is already a marketed drug in the 100 mg dose and approved for the use in type 2 diabetic patients. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits semaglutide will provide to subjects with T2D. 3.6 Rationale for the trial The currently available treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes are still not satisfactory and there is still a large proportion of patients not reaching the treatment targets. In the 5 global phase 3a trials (3623, 3624, 3625, 3626 and 3627), reductions in HbA1c and body weight with semaglutide was superior to sitagliptin, exenatide ER and insulin glargine demonstrating semaglutide as a highly efficacious treatment option. The rationale for this trial is to compare the efficacy of semaglutide versus sitagliptin in subjects with type-2 diabetes in terms of glycaemic control, weight loss and other efficacy parameters. Furthermore the trial is designed to address and compare safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction. This trial is designed to resemble the main trial NN9535-3626 (SUSTAIN 2) in the global CONFIDENTIAL"

The trial includes a 2-week screening period followed by a 30-week randomised treatment period and a 5 week follow-up period. A planned total of 1050 subjects will be randomised whereof approximately 792 subjects will be from China. Randomisation will be stratified by country. 5.2 Rationale for trial design Parallel treatment groups and a randomised double-blind double dummy controlled design have been chosen in accordance with trial objectives and to avoid bias in the trial. Treatment duration of 30 weeks is considered adequate in terms of assessing efficacy of semaglutide treatment versus sitagliptin treatment on change in HbA 1c. Furthermore, 30 weeks is considered sufficient for addressing and comparing the safety, tolerability and patient satisfaction profiles.CONFIDENTIAL"

Doses must not be changed during the trial after the maintenance dose has been reached. Semaglutide injections should be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, and should be taken on the same day of the week during the trial. Both semaglutide and sitagliptin can be taken any time of day irrespective of meals. If necessary, the trial product may be discontinued for safety reasons. In case trial product is discontinued, subjects will not be withdrawn from trial but should continue to follow scheduled visits to the extent possible (see section 6.5.1 ). Trial product will be add-on in subjects failing on metformin monotherapy. Subjects must not be prescribed other GLP-1 RA in the period between V9 and V10 or V9A and V10A. 5.3.1 Missed dose If a semaglutide dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as noticed, provided the time to the next scheduled dose is at least 2 days (48 hours). If a dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is less than 2 days (48 hours) away, the subject should not administer a dose until the next scheduled dose. A missed dose should not affect the scheduled dosing day of the week. 5.3.2 Background medication Subjects should upon inclusion continue pre-trial background medication throughout the entire trial. The background medication should be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and frequency during the whole treatment period unless rescue medication is needed (see section 6.4). Metformin is considered background medication (non-investigational medicinal product) and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S (except for Brazil where Metformin will be provided by Novo Nordisk FarmacÃªutica do Brasil Ltda). Metformin should be used in accordance with standard of care in the individual country at the discretion of the investigator and the daily dose should be unchanged throughout the trial unless the rescue criteria are met. However the maximum approved dose in the individual country must not be exceeded.

These are also included in the flow chart (see section 2). The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one list and may be generated from the IWRS. In addition, the investigator must keep a log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and delegation of task(s) at site at the time of delegation of tasks. 8.1.1 Screening visit 1 (V1) For procedures and assessments performed at screening, please see flow chart (see section 2). The IWRS must be contacted to register the subject as screened (see section 10). Subject will be assigned a unique number (lowest available number allocated to site) which is maintained throughout the trial. It must be stated in the medical record that the subject is participating in the current trial. At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. The subjects should be reminded to show the card to other health care providers, as applicable. Once all data relating to screening V1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed by the investigator to ensure that the subject is eligible to continue the trial. 8.1.1.1 Screen failures For screening failures the screening failure form must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the case report form eCRF. Follow-up of SAEs must be carried out according to section 12.

Fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last 6 hours prior to the visit.. Glucose lowering agents and trial product cannot be taken until after blood sampling has been performed but other prescribed medication should be taken. An exception from this is the follow-up visit (V10) and follow-up premature discontinuation visit (V10A) where fasting is defined as having consumed only water within the last two hours prior to the visit. If the subject is not fasting as required, the subject must be called in for a new visit within the visit window to have the fasting procedures done. 8.1.3 Randomisation V2 For procedures and assessments performed at randomisation (see section 2). Visit 2 will take place two weeks (Â±7 days) after screening V1. Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of four treatment arms. The IWRS will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. Trial product will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent with different intervals during the trial. Subject will be instructed in administration of sc injection of trial product and the investigator must document that a direction for use (DFU) is given orally and/or in writing.

If a subject attends the clinic for a visit not described in the protocol, an unscheduled visit form must be completed. This only applies if assessments are done, hence not for the purpose of re-test of blood- or urine sampling, or re-supply of trial product. In case of re-supply a dispensing session should be made in the IWRS selecting additional medication. Re-scheduling of fasting visit samples is not considered as an unscheduled visit. 8.1.6 End of treatment (V9/9A) and Follow-up (V10/10A) 8.1.6.1 Subjects completing the treatment period as per protocol An end of treatment visit (V9) should be scheduled when the subject has completed the treatment period as described per protocol and a follow-up visit (V10) should be performed at least 5 weeks after (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). The follow-up visit serves to collect AEs, technical complaints, hypoglycaemic episodes, ECG, concomitant medication and blood sampling for anti-semaglutide antibodies . 8.1.6.2 Subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product For subjects who discontinue trial product prematurely the visit end of treatment â premature discontinuation (V9A) should be scheduled shortly after subject has discontinued trial product. The visit follow-up â premature discontinuation (V10A) should be scheduled at least 5 weeks after discontinuation of trial product (+7 days visit window). Please see the flow chart for details (section 2). Subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely should continue with the scheduled site contacts. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after discontinuation of trial product. However, as a minimum these subjects will be called in for end of treatment (V9) and follow-up (V10) at the time of the scheduled completion of the trial. 8.1.7 Withdrawals Subjects who consider withdrawing from the trial should as a minimum be encouraged to have procedures performed according to the end of treatment visit (V9) as soon as possible and the follow up visit (V10) at least 5 weeks after but not more than 6 weeks after, if possible.

Results of a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation. If the subject had a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, the investigator may base their evaluation upon the results of that examination. However, the examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the subject did not have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed within 90 days prior to randomisation, such examination must be performed by the investigator or other qualified health care professional prior to randomisation. If the applicable fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented in the medical records that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. In addition, fundus photography /dilated fundoscopy must be performed at V9. In the case of premature discontinuation, the assessments must be performed both at V9A and at V9. The assessments at V9A and V9 can be performed in the period between V9A and V10A and between V9 and V10, respectively, but the results should be available no later than at V10A and V10, respectively. The investigator should indicate whether the outcome of the eye examination was normal or abnormal, and, if abnormal, indicate whether clinically significant. Relevant findings as a result of this screening procedure must be recorded as diabetes history and diabetes complications or concomitant illness/medical history in accordance with Section 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 respectively. 8.5 Laboratory assessments For laboratory analysis of efficacy and safety parameters will be drawn during the 37 weeks of the trial. The laboratory analyses will be performed by a central laboratory except for anti-semaglutide antibodies and IgE antibodies where a special laboratory will be used. In the situation of suspicion of acute pancreatitis or severe hypersensitivity described in appendix B , a local laboratory will be used. Laboratory samples comprise both urine and blood samples.

Laboratory samples may be drawn at another day than on the day of the actual visit as long as it is within the visit window outlined in the flow chart (see section 2).Please note that a laboratory sample pertaining to a specific visit must always be reported to that visit. For some of the samples drawn during the trial it is required for the sensitivity of the analysis that the subject is fasting. The laboratory equipment may provide analyses not requested in the protocol but produced automatically in connection with the requested analyses according to specifications in the laboratory standard operating procedures. Such data will not be transferred to the trial database, but abnormal values must be reported to the investigator. For Brazil: All laboratory results will be communicated to the investigators. Central laboratory will provide laboratory results to the investigator on an on-going basis and the investigator must review all laboratory results for signs of concomitant illness and AEs and report these according to section 12. An exception to this is that anti-semaglutide antibody result will not be available to the investigator during the trial. However these results will be provided to the investigator upon request after the completion of the clinical trial report (CTR). All laboratory samples will be destroyed on an on-going basis after analysis and no later than CTR, except for samples taken for anti-semaglutide antibody samples, which will be kept until market authorisation approval or rejection of file. (For Brazil: the laboratory samples for Brazilian subjects will be destroyed at the latest at the completion of the CTR, including samples for anti-semaglutide antibody analysis. No sample will be stored after the completion of CTR). The investigator should ensure that the last samples are shipped to the central laboratory within 24 hours after the last subject visit last at the site. 8.5.1 Laboratory assessments for efficacy Blood samples must be drawn according to flow chart (see section 2) and analysed at the central laboratory to determine levels of the following efficacy laboratory parameters:CONFIDENTIAL"

Sites should, as necessary, repeat the directions for use to the subject at subsequent visits. The blood glucose meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. When using blood glucose meters the measurement is performed with capillary blood calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values i.e. the measurement is performed on blood while the value is reported as plasma. It is important to be aware of this difference throughout the protocol. Only the blood glucose meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value.

Positive anti-semaglutide antibody samples will be further characterised for cross reactivity to native GLP-1 (see section 2). Samples taken at follow-up which are positive for anti-semaglutide antibodies will be further characterised for in vitro neutralising effect towards semaglutide. In addition, samples taken at follow-up which are positive for cross-reactivity against native GLP-1 will be further analysed for in vitro neutralising effect towards native GLP-1.

A randomisation session will be carried out for all subjects by using the IWRS. At the randomisation visit subjects meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner to receive one of four parallel treatments groups: !Semaglutide 0.5 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly + sitagliptin placebo once-daily !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (0.5) mg once-weekly !Sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily + semaglutide placebo (1.0) mg once-weekly Randomisation will be stratified by country. Whe n grouping or analysing data by country, subjects from Hong Kong and Taiwan will be grouped with Chinese subjects if not otherwise specified. 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes If the trial site needs to break the code, Novo Nordisk should if possible, be contacted before the code is broken. The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the code break confirmation notification generated by the IWRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. If the code has been broken the subject must be discontinued from trial product but be asked to continue in the trial (see section 8.1.6.2 ). A treatment discontinuation session should be completed in IWRS. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break monitor should be contacted and if monitor cannot get access the IWRS vendor helpdesk should be contacted.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, ie an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and isof a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should notbe reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening procedures (pre- existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form (see section 8.4.4 ). The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity assessment âMild - no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities. âModerate - marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject's daily activities. âSevere - considerable interference with the subject's daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality assessment The following terms are used when assessing the relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): âProbable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. âPossible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. âRecovered/resolved with sequelae - The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. âNot recovered/not resolved - The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. âFatal - This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as ""recovered/resolved"", ""recovering/resolving"", ""recovered/resolved with sequelae"" or ""not recovered/not resolved"". An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. âUnknown - This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.1 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a. The term ""life threatening"" in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b. The term ""hospitalisation"" is used when a subject: â Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or â Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hoursCONFIDENTIAL"

Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c. A substantial disruption of a subject's ability to conduct normal life functions (eg following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life). d. For example intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasiasis or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following adverse events must always be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: !suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product !risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Additional assessments should be made for events meeting the criterion of Hyâs law as stated above (see appendix B ). 12.1.2 Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 12.1.3 Medication errors Medication errors concerning trial products are defined as: â Administration of wrong drug. Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error. â Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of subcutaneous. â Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (eg suicide attempt) misuse or abuse of trial product. â Accidental administration of a lower or higher dose than intended. The administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extend where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur. Medication errors must be reported on an AE form and a specific event form, see Section 8.4.2 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The technical complaint may be associated with an AE, but does not concern the AE itself. Examples of technical complaints: !The physical or chemical appearance of trial products (eg discoloration, particles or contamination) !The packaging material including labelling !Problems related to devices (eg to the injection mechanism, dose setting mechanism, push button or interface between the pen and the needle) 12.2 Reporting of adverse events All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and reported. This includes events from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (see section 2). The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12â1 During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: ""Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?"" All AEs, either observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the Investigator on an AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms. For SAEs, a safety information form must be completed in addition to the AE form. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one safety information form can be used to describe all the SAEs. For all non-serious AEs, the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. Some events will undergo event adjudication by the Event Adjudication Committee (EAC), please refer to Section 12.7.2 .

No symptoms of hypoglycaemia have been reported in connection with overdose of semaglutide. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the subjectâs clinical signs and symptoms. For other precautions, please see section 3.5.1 . Sitagliptin During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 800 mg sitagliptin were generally well tolerated. Minimal increases in QTc, not considered to be clinically relevant, were observed in one study at a dose of 800 mg sitagliptin. There is no experience with doses above 800 mg in clinical studies. In Phase I multiple-dose studies, there were no dose-related clinical adverse reactions observed with sitagliptin with doses of up to 600 mg per day for periods of up to 10 days and 400 mg per day for periods of up to 28 days. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy if required. Sitagliptin is modestly dialysable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5 % of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialysable by peritoneal dialysis.

The semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external event adjudication committee is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre-defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities, and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in section12.1.4have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to Standardized Definitions 57. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication package (for example X-ray, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports, and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when receiving a request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor.

This system and support services to the system will be supplied by a vendor. Ensure that all relevant questions are answered, and that no empty data field exists. If a test or an assessment has not been done and will not be available, or if the question is irrelevant (eg is not applicable), indicate this according to the data entry instructions. The following will be provided as paper CRFs: !Pregnancy forms In addition paper AE forms and safety information forms will be provided. These must be used when access to the eCRF is revoked. The investigator must ensure that all information is consistent with the source documentation. By electronically signing the case book in the eCRF, the investigator confirms that the information in the eCRF and related forms is complete and correct. 13.1 Corrections to case report forms Corrections to the CRF data may be made by the investigator or the investigator's authorised staff. An audit trail will be maintained in the CRF application containing as a minimum: the old and the new data, identification of the person entering the data, date and time of the entry and reason for the correction. If corrections are made by the investigator's authorised staff after the date the investigator has signed the case book, the case book must be signed and dated again by the investigator. 13.2 Case report form flow 13.2.1 Electronic case report form flow The investigator must ensure that data is recorded in the eCRF as soon as possible, preferably within 5 days after the visit. Once data has been entered, it will be available to Novo Nordisk for data verification and validation purposes. At the end of trial the investigator must ensure that all remaining data have been entered into the eCRF no later than 3 days after the last subjectâs last visit at the site in order to ensure the planned lock of the database.

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FPFV or FSFV and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the CRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site. The intervals between monitoring visits can be shorter. Factors to be considered in this determination may include objective, endpoints, purpose, design, complexity, blinding, number of subjects and expected recruitment rate. The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (eg by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the CRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Considering the electronic source data environment, it is accepted that the earliest practically retainable record should be considered as the location of the source data. Therefore transcription to the diary from the blood glucose meter is considered the source document for BG values. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data, if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original diaries and PROs are considered as source data and must not be removed from the trial site. The monitor will ensure that the CRFs are completed on an on-going basis within the agreed timelines. The monitor must ensure that all required eCRF forms for screening failures are completed, (e.g. screening failure form and the case book sign of (affirmation statement) is electronically signed by the investigator).CONFIDENTIAL"

The SAP will be finalised before database lock. Results from the statistical analysis will generally be presented by two-sided confidence intervals with a confidence level of 95% and associated p-value. Superiority will be formulated and tested as one-sided hypotheses at a 2.5% significance level. Non-inferiority between two treatments will be evaluated by comparing the upper limit of the associated two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference with the pre-defined non-inferiority margin. When grouping or analysing data by country, subjects from Hong Kong and Taiwan will be grouped with Chinese subjects if not otherwise specified. Handling of missing data In the case of missing data no general imputation will be performed for the analyses, unless otherwise specified. If an assessment has been made both at screening and randomisation, the value from the randomisation visit will be used as the baseline value. If the value measured at the randomisation visit is missing and the assessment also has been made at screening, then the screening value will be used as the baseline value. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be set to Â½ LLOQ. The primary analysis model will be the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM), see section 17.3 for further details. One of the assumptions behind (MMRM) is that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR). This means that given the observed data, the mechanism generating missing values is independent of the unobserved data that is the missing data. The MMRM and the negative binomial model both rely on the MAR assumption for generating unbiased estimates of treatment differences. Based on previous semaglutide trials in subjects with type 2 diabetes, the treatment discontinuation rate from randomised treatment and trial withdrawal is expected to be about 20%. The treatments in this trial should be effective, given the historical documentation, and this should minimise treatment discontinuation due to ineffective therapy. The main reasons for treatment discontinuation are expected to be AEs, ineffective therapy and non-eligibility (subjects randomised although not fulfilling inclusion/exclusion criteria). Treatment discontination due to non-eligibility can be regarded as missing completely at random (MCAR), i.e. it does not depend on the observed or missing data values. This category of missing data is not expected to introduce bias in the estimated treatment differences. Treatment discontinuation due to lack of efficacy is expected to be reflected in the observed data obtained prior to the discontinuation from randomised treatment, and the CONFIDENTIAL"

Missing data due to AEs is expected to be similar between groups except for, potentially, a slightly higher incidence in the semaglutide treatment group due to gastrointestinal side effects. Together with potential withdrawals from trial due to the own will of the subject, the MAR assumption may be less adequate for this category of drop-outs. Several different sensitivity analyses will be used to investigate whether the results from the MMRM approach are robust towards deviations from the assumption of MAR. 17.1 Sample size calculation The primary objective is to compare the effect of two dose levels of semaglutide once-weekly treatment (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) with sitagliptin 100 mg on the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HbA 1c after 30 weeks of treatment. In the calculations determining the sample size it is presumed that in the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between endpoints and placebo volume. In total 1050 subjects will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner. Assuming 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment, and further taking the assumption that these subjects are excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis set, 280 subjects in each group are expected to be included in the PP analysis set. The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg and HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. The two hypothesis tests are assumed to be independent and for each of the hypothesis the power calculation is based on a t-statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5%. Using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3%, and assuming a true HbA 1cdifference (semaglutide minus sitagliptin) of 0% and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%, a total of 280 subjects per group in the PP analysis set will give 90% marginal power to conclude HbA 1c non-inferiority for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. Assuming the same HbA 1ceffect for the two dose levels of semaglutide, the overall power to demonstrate HbA 1c non-inferiority for the two dose levels of semaglutide vs. sitagliptin will be at least 80%. For change in body weight, the power calculation is based on the assumptions of a true difference of -1.5 kg and a SD of 4.0 kg. In addition, 50% efficacy retention is assumed for the anticipated 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment giving an expected treatment difference of -1.35 kg, which is the number used in the power calculation. With the above assumptions, a total of 350 subjects per group in the full analysis set (FAS) will give more than 99% marginal power toCONFIDENTIAL"

Safety Analysis Set (SAS): includes all subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product. Subjects in the SAS will contribute to the evaluation based on the trial product received for the majority of the period they were on treatment. This will be referred to as contributing to the evaluation âas treatedâ. Before data are locked for statistical analysis, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the internal study group. Exclusion of data from analyses will be used restrictively and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion must be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the CTR.

The in-trial observation period starts at randomisation (as registered in IWRS) and ends at the date of: !The last direct subject-site contact, which is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after planned last dose of trial product at a follow-up visit !Withdrawal for subjects who withdraw their informed consent !The last subject-investigator contact as defined by the investigator for subjects who are lost to follow-up !Death for subjects who dies before any of the above For subjects not randomised but exposed to trial product the in-trial periods starts at the date of first dose of trial product On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered treated with trial product. The observation period is a sub-set of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately according to the flow chart. For adjudicated events, ECGâs and AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the follow-up visit (V10) !the follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (V10A) !the last date on trial product + 42 days !the end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of subcutaneous semaglutide. The visit window for the follow-up visit is + 7 days, which is the reason for the 42 days specified in the bullet above. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are exposed.

This ascertainment window corresponds to the dosing interval and will be used to avoid attenuation of a potential treatment effect on endpoints for which the effect is reversible shortly after treatment discontinuation. Hence, for those assessments this period reflects the period in which subjects are treated. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a sub-set of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !the last dose of trial product +7 days !initiation of rescue medication The âon-treatment without rescue medicationâ observation period will be the primary observation period for efficacy evaluations. The in-trial observation period will be considered supportive for efficacy evaluation. Safety will be evaluated based on the in-trial and the on-treatment observation periods unless otherwise specified. For subjects who have no post-baseline scheduled assessments available in the on-treatment without rescue period, the baseline value will be carried forward to the first scheduled visit for the associated endpoint to ensure that all randomised subjects will contribute to the statistical analysis. Data points collected outside an observation period will be treated as missing in the analysis. Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. For adjudicated events, the onset date will be the EAC adjudicated onset date. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA 1cafter 30 weeks of treatment. In the analysis the two sitagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between HbA 1cchange after 30 weeks and placebo volume. The primary endpoint will be based on FAS using data from the âon-treatment without rescue medicationâ observation period in a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM). A restricted maximum likelihood (REML) will be used. The model will include all post baseline HbA 1c measurements collected at scheduled visits up to and including week 30 data as dependent variables. The independent effects included in the model will be treatment and country as fixed effects and baseline response as covariate, all nested within visit.

In order to preserve the overall type 1 error the conclusion of non-inferiority and superiority with treatment of each semaglutide dose versus sitagliptin after 30 weeks will be evaluated hierarchically according to the sequence below, and starting with the first. In this testing sequence it is necessary to fulfil the test criteria, which is to reject the corresponding null hypothesis in order to go to the next step. If the corresponding null hypothesis is not rejected, the testing will stop and no further conclusions will be drawn. The following ordering in the statistical test sequence will be used: 1.

Superiority in change in body weight for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 6. Superiority in change in HbA 1cfor semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin Non-inferiority will be concluded if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference in HbA 1cbetween semaglutide and sitagliptin is less than 0.3%. Superiority for either change in HbA 1cor change in body weight will be claimed if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the estimated difference is below 0% or 0 kg respectively. When establishing non-inferiority the analysis will be based on the full analysis set (FAS) and supplemented by an analysis with the per protocol population using the data from the âon treatment without rescue medicationâ observation period as supportive evidence.

These will therefore be referred to as âon-treatment AEsâ hereafter. On-treatment adverse events are summarised descriptively in terms of the number of subjects with at least one event (N), the percentage of subjects with at least one event (%), the number of events (E) and the event rate per 100 years (R). These summaries are replicated by outputs including all âin-trialâ adverse events (i.e., adverse events with onset date [or increase in severity] during the âin- trialâ observation period). Adverse events with onset after the end of the âin-trialâ observation period will be reported in a listing. The development over time in gastrointestinal AEs will be presented graphically. The most frequent adverse events will be defined as preferred terms (PTs) that are experienced by at least 5% of the subjects in any of the treatment arms. All AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding. Pulse Pulse will be analysed separately using an analysis similar to the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. However this analysis will be based on FAS using the data from the on-treatment observation period but with the pulse value at baseline as a covariate. Laboratory assessments Amylase and lipase will be analysed separately with the same type of methods as for pulse with the corresponding baseline assessment as a covariate.

Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia In normal physiology, symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur below a plasma glucose level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL)60. Therefore, Novo Nordisk has included hypoglycaemia with plasma glucose levels below this cut-off point of hypoglycaemia. In this trial Novo Nordisk use the following classification in addition to the ADA classification (see Figure 17â1 ): !Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia: An episode that is severe according  to the ADA classification51or BG confirmed by a plasma glucose value <3.1 mmol/L (56  mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.CONFIDENTIAL"

All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation in regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. Subjects will be treated within a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the treatment they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Subjects will have to spend some extra time, as additional assessments and visits to the clinic are required. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2013 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 61, or any updates thereof. It is concluded that the potential benefits from participating in the trial outweigh the potential risks. The safety profile of semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of once weekly doses of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. It is concluded that the risk to the subjects in this trial is low and acceptable in view of the benefits a long-acting GLP-1 analogue would provide to people with type 2 diabetes (please see 3.5) The trial products may be associated with AEs, but relevant precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. These precautions include thorough information regarding the correct administration of the trial products and gradual dose adjustment. Furthermore, subjects are fully informed about possible AEs and inconveniences and will be instructed to contact the investigator in case of any concerns regarding the trial participation. When treatment with trial products ends, the subject and investigator will decide on the best available treatment. 18.1Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP 1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2. Before any trial-related activity, the investigator must give the subject verbal and written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject can read and understand.

The signatory investigator will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications 62. 23.1Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial.

At the end of the trial, one or more publications (abstracts, posters, manuscripts) will be prepared for submission to scientific congresses and peer-reviewed journals in collaboration between Novo Nordisk and investigator(s) appointed by Novo Nordisk. These investigator(s) must meet the ICMJE authorship criteria to be named authors on publications. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission for publication of such primary policy will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database.

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood.

A blood sample will be drawn at pre-specified trial visits for measurement of calcitonin. In case a subject has an calcitonin value â¥10 ng/L the algorithm outlined below (see Section 2.1to 2.4) should be followed. The algorithm applies for all calcitonin values including screening values. All calcitonin values â¥20 ng/L will be submitted to an independent Calcitonin Monitoring Committee (CMC) of thyroid experts, together with relevant supplementary data, ie subjectâs demographics, diabetes history, concomitant medical history, concomitant medications, smoking status as well as information about relevant adverse events reported during the trial. The CMC will provide recommendations to the investigators with regards to further investigation and treatment of the individual subject. The CMC will be blinded to trial treatment. The summary for the rationale for the use of specific calcitonin values to trigger medical evaluation is provided in section 2.1 to 2.4. 2.1 Calcitonin values â¥100 ng/L The value will be submitted to the CMC and the subject should be discontinued from trial product. If the value is a screening value the subject cannot be randomised and the subject must be referred to a thyroid specialist. These values were found in 0.15% of the population published by Costante et al1 and in one subject (on active comparator) in the liraglutide development program. For a calcitonin value of â¥100 ng/L, the subject should be assumed to have significant C-cell disease and a high likelihood of having medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Diagnostic evaluation should consist of thyroid ultrasound, fine needle aspiration of any nodules >1 cm and potentially surgery with neck dissection. Family history of MTC or MEN 2 should be evoked and a RET proto-oncogene analysis should be performed. 2.2 Calcitonin values â¥50 and <100 ng/L The value will be submitted to the CMC and the investigator will receive guidance from the CMC with regards to continuation of trial product.

Subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation tests will be considered to undergo surgery. In the US where pentagastrin is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information informing the need for surgery. 2.3 Calcitonin values â¥20 and <50 ng/L The value will be submitted to the CMC. If the subject is a screen failure the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. These values are expected to be found in up to 1% of subjects. Based on data from Costante et al1, the predictive value calcitonin levels â¥20 and <50 ng/L clinically significant C-cell disease begins to fall. However, up to 25% of these subjects had a positive pentagastrin stimulation test. The likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. 2.4 Calcitonin values â¥10 and <20 ng/L Confounding factors should be evaluated. If drugs potentially affecting calcitonin can be discontinued safely, calcitonin measurement can be repeated after a washout period. Gastrin levels return to the normal range by ~ 10 days after stopping proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). 2No further actions are needed during the trial if the next calcitonin values remain below 20 ng/L. If the subject is a screening failure or if the value is the last one taken in the trial, the subject should preferably be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. These values may be found in ~ 2.5 to 4% of the trial population. Costante et al1had 216 patients in this category. One out of 216 patients had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin of 33 ng/L, and had C-cell hyperplasia at surgery, a lesion of unknown clinical significance.

Since the preparation of the trial protocol in 2014, new information regarding the trial products is known and also some of the Novo Nordisk standards and processes have evolved and updated, which are the primary reasons for preparing the amendment and updating the protocol. Secondly, this is in accordance with the feed-back received from CFDA, refer to below text copied from the approval letter, optimisation of the protocol is allowed: âBefore the clinical trial, clinical research organization should further refine and optimize the protocol, pay attention to the exposed and potential safety risk of the product, and make a risk management plan.â While amending the protocol, special attention has been on patient safety and reporting, data quality and GCP compliance. This means, that minor refinements have been made throughout the protocol with the purpose of improving data quality and clarifying issues, where applicable. In this protocol amendment: !Any new text is written in italics. !Any text deleted from the protocol is written using strike through. 2 Changes 2.1 Minor editorial changes throughout the protocol due to new naming standards and/or changes in the protocol template Rationale: Since the approval of this protocol the protocol template has been extensively updated included improved explanation of several procedures. Accordingly throughout the protocol changes have been made in order to incorporate some of these changes 2.2 Flow chart updates (section 2) Rationale: flow chart has been updated to align to the CDISC terminology. Clarification on the completion of end of trial and end of treatment forms in eCRF. Eye examination has been updated to also taken at end of treatment visit(s) V9 and V9A in line with FDA recommendations. Training in trial product and pen handling has been amended to coincide with dose escalation. Fasting definition has been updated to project standard definition.CONFIDENTIAL"

Impact: If for any reason you are scheduled to have an operation to remove your thyroid gland or part of it during the trial, you need to inform your trial doctor well in advance. You will be asked to consent to another subject information form to allow for additional safety assessment to be made. Samples of the removed thyroid tissue will be investigated. Such tissue samples are routinely made after operations of the thyroid gland of the hospital where the operation is performed. The tissue samples will allow specialists at your hospital to examine the thyroid cells under the microscope in order to determine the exact diagnosis. The tissue samples will be sent to another expert for a second opinion. When the tissue samples have been examined they will be sent back to the hospital where you had your operation. Your trial doctor will be informed about the findings of both the hospital specialist and the expert and you will be able to discuss the results with him/her. 3.8 Information about the treatment procedure Rationale: Test pens will not be provided.

In rats, bone and blood vessel abnormalities were observed in the offspring at doses below a normal human dose. In rabbits and monkeys, a possible link between an excessive weight loss of the pregnant animal and observations of early pregnancy loss and foetal abnormalities could not be excluded. The potential risk for an unborn human child is unknown and therefore pregnancy should be avoided when taking semaglutide. The effect of semaglutide on fertility and foetal development has been investigated in rats and monkeys. In both species exposure to semaglutide caused reduction of the amount of food eaten and weight gained by the mother during pregnancy. The monkey studies gave no reason to suspect an effect of semaglutide on foetal development in monkeys, but there was a possible link between the motherâs loss of body weight and an increased risk for early pregnancy loss. In rats, bone and major blood vessel abnormalities were observed in the offspring at doses below a normal human dose. The potential risk to humans is unknown and therefore pregnancy should be avoided when taking semaglutide. 4.2 Informed consent form Rationale: To allow a legally acceptable/authorised representative to consent for the subject.

The semaglutide phase 3a results showed significant reductions in HbA 1cand body weight versus all comparators that were larger than assumed, why a r econsideration of the sample size in this trial seems appropriate. The aim is to ensure a sample size that is sufficient to show efficacy for region China (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan). The number of subjects in trial NN9535-4114 can be reduced without compromising the efficacy and safety evaluationRe-estimating the sample size in this trial is acceptable as it is based on blinded data, thus the integrity of the trial will be maintained. Reducing the sample size is also considered relevant from an ethical standpoint, and the trial integrity will not be compromised. The number of planned randomised subjects is suggested to be reduced from a total of 1050 subjects to 858 subjects . This mainly affects region China, where the number of planned randomised subjects will be reduced from 792 to 600. Additionally, minor refin ements have been made.

In the power calculations below determining the sample size it is presumed that in the analysis the two si tagliptin/semaglutide placebo groups will be pooled assuming no correlation between endpoints and placebo volume. At the time of finalising the first version of the protocol, the regulatory guidance in China was to have 300 subjects in region China treated with semaglutide. To ensure an adequate and robust evaluation of safety and efficacy in the subjects from China 300 subjects completing treatment with semaglutide is used. In the following, subjects from Hong Kong and Taiwan will be grouped with the Chinese subjects and referred to as region China. Assuming a treatment discontinuation rate of 25% in this region and considering the 2:2:1:1 randomisation, this means that 600 subjects need to be randomised in region China. Trial NN9535-4114 is a multi-regional clinical trial, and 258 subjects are planned to be randomised outside region China as has already been approved by local authorities for these countries. For some countries the allocated subject number is required to support local NDA submissions. In total, 858 subjects are planned to be randomised In total 1050 subjects will be randomised in a 2:2:1:1 manner. Assuming that20% of all randomised subjects discontinuing discontinue randomised treatment, and further taking the assumption that these subjects are excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis set, 280 228 subjects in each group are expected to be included in the PP analysis set. The sample size calculation is based on demonstrating HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 0.5 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg and HbA 1cnon-inferiority for semaglutide 1.0 mg vs. sitagliptin 100 mg.CONFIDENTIAL"

The two six hypothesis tests are assumed to be independent and for each of the hypotheses the power calculation is based on a t- statistic under the assumption of a one-sided test of size 2.5%. Using a non-inferiority margin of 0.3% -point , and assuming a true HbA 1cdifference (semaglutide minus sitagliptin) of 0% and a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1% -point and a total of 280 228 subjects per group in the PP analysis set will give 90% marginal power to conclude HbA 1cnon- inferiority for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg if the true HbA 1c treatment difference (semaglutide minus sitagliptin) is as low as -0.03 %-point .Thereby, Assuming the same HbA 1ceffect for the two dose levels of semaglutide, the overall power to demonstrate HbA 1cnon-inferiority for the two dose levels of semaglutide vs. sitagliptin will be at least 80%, even if the true treatment difference for the low dose comparison is as low as -0.03 %-point. With 286 subjects per group in the full analysis set (FAS), a marginal power of at least 90% for demonstrating HbA 1csuperiority, for any dose of the two dose level comparisons, is obtained if the true treatment difference is as low as -0.30%-point. For change in body weight, using a SD of 4 kg and 286 subjects per group, a marginal power of at least 90% for demonstrating superiority for the comparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg is obtained if the true treatment difference is as low as -1.09 kg body weight. For change in body weight, the power calculation is based on the assumptions of a true difference of -1.5 kg and a SD of 4.0 kg. In addition, 50% efficacy retention is assumed for the anticipated 20% of subjects discontinuing randomised treatment givi ng an expected treatment difference of -1.35 kg, which is the number used in the power calculation. With the above assumptions, a total of 350 subjects per group in the full analysis set (FAS) will give more than 99% marginal power to conclude superiority in body weight for the co mparison of a semaglutide dose vs. sitagliptin 100 mg. In SUSTAIN 2, the mother trial of NN9535-4114, semaglutide showed marked and significant reductions in HbA 1cand body weight vs sitagliptin at week 56. The change over time in HbA 1cand body weight in SUSTAIN 2 showed marked reductions in both endpoints already at week 30 which supports that the above mentioned true treatment differences for trial NN9535-4114. 2.6 Retention of human biospecimens (section 24.2) Rationale: A typographical error was made when âthyroid tissueâ was not removed from the previous version of the protocol. Impact: None of the data will be identified by name. Anti body samples and thyroid tissue will be identified only by a subject number, a visit numbe r and a trial iden tification number.CONFIDENTIAL"
