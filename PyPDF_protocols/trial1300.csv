Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 10 STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Analysis Populations All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed u sing the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) will be used only for the analysis of the selected endpoint s to examine the robustness of the primary analysis. Safety and tolerability will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. Safety Analysis Set : The Safety Analysis Set comprises all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Full Analysis Set : The FAS comprises the subset of the Safety Analysis Set who have a baseline and post-baseline efficacy evaluation . Per Protocol Analysis Set : The PPAS comprises the subset of subject s from the FAS who are treated according to the protocol without any major dev iations. A full list of inclusion criteria will be decided and assessed prior to database lock and unblinding. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set : The PK Analysis Set comprises the subset of the Safety Analysis Set who provide evaluable PK assessments. Efficacy Analysis Primary Efficacy Analysis : The 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints are the mean change in the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and the mean change in severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12. For each of the 4 co -primary efficacy endpoints, an analysis of covariance model will be used with treatment group , pooled cent er, and smoking status as factor s, with baseline weight and baseline measurement as covariate s. Pairwise comparisons between the active doses and placebo will be calculated based on least -squares mean contrasts using a 2 -tailed 95% confidence interval (CI). For subject s in the efficacy analysis populations with missing primary efficacy endpoints, multiple imputation by fully conditional specification methods will be used. The imputation model will use subject demographics (age, sex, race, baseline weight, and smoking status ) and baseline and post-baseline mean number and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Sensitivity analyses will be performed with other multiple imputation methods and mixed model for repeat measurement s. Since the study design requires the comparison of 7 active dose group s with placebo for 4 co-primary efficacy variables, a two -tier closed testing procedure will be used to control the family -wise error. A step -down tes ting procedure will be followed . The following testing order of doses wil l be employed: a. Placebo versus 90 mg BID (daily dose 180 mg) , b. Placebo versus 60 mg BID (daily dose 120 mg), c. Placebo versus 120 mg QD (daily dose 120 mg), d. Placebo versus 30 mg BID (daily dose 60 mg), e. Placebo versus 60 mg QD (daily dose 60 mg), f. Placebo versus 15 mg BID (daily dose 30 mg), and g. Placebo versus 30 mg QD (daily dose 30 mg)."

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 11 The 4 co -primary efficacy endpoints will be compared at each dose level. Only when ESN364 is proved to be significantly better than placebo at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 for all 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints will this dose level be claimed to be superior to placebo. A failure to prove the significance for 1 or more co -primary efficacy endpoints will lead to a failure to claim superiority to placebo at this dose level, and th e other dose levels after this one in the sequence will not be tested. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS. A supportive analysis will be carried out for the co -primary efficacy variables based on the PPAS to examine the impact of premat ure dropouts and/or major protocol deviations. Secondary Efficacy Analysis : Efficacy will be further assessed based on the secondary endpoints described above using the FAS. Safety Analysis Safety will be assessed by examining the incidence of adverse even ts, physical examination findings , C-SSRS, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests , and bone density marker concentrations over time using the Safety Analysis Set. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: A total of 352 subje cts are planned to be randomized, 44 subjects in each treatment arm . This is based on the observed data for severity and frequency of moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms from the Phase 2a study . Sample size calculations from statistical analysis software were based on 2 -sample t -tests, assuming 2 -sided 5% alpha and power of >90% for expected effect sizes.

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 21 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Background Information 1.1.1 Vasomotor Symptoms (Hot F lashes) Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) are the most common complaint amo ng women entering menopause and , for many women , may continue to occur for up to 5 years (although about 20% of women may have them for up to 15 years) .1–3 Approximately 75% of peri -menopausal women will experience vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) , with 10% to 20% of those enduring severe symptoms .4 Today, more than 25 million women in the United States alone experience symptoms of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) , and 4 million women report severe symptoms .5 Vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life and are therefore a major reason for menopausal women to seek medical attention. Despite the vast numbers of individuals affected , the physiology of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) is not fully understood ; although , a disturbance in normal thermoregulatory function is thought to be the main underlying cause. The primary symptom of vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) is a subjective and transient sensation of heat , flushing, a nd sweating that usually lasts 4 to 10 minutes and may be accompanied by palpitations, feelings of anxiety, irritability, and in rare occurrence, panic .4 The most effective and commonly used pharmacological treatment for vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes) is hormone replacement therapy (HRT), but a Women’s Health Initiative study raised questions about the long -term safety of this treatment. Current guidelines recommend a limited duration of HRT due to associated risks of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke , and thromboembolism .1,6 Furthermore, the current safety data do not support the use of HRT in many patients (e g, patients with breast/endometrial cancer or liver disease). The perceived limitations of HRT coupled with the lack of efficacy and the adverse effects observed with non -hormonal therapies h ave led clinicians to search for other treatment options for vasomotor symptoms . Recent studies of venlafaxine and fluoxetine in women with a prior history of breast cancer have suggested that certain antidepressants with the ability to inhibit serotonin reuptake may significantly reduce vasomotor symptoms of me nopause .7–9 However, t he clinical benefit of these antidepressants is not as great as that observed for estrogen . 1.1.2 Introduction to ESN364 (International Nonproprietary Name : Fezolinetant) ESN364 is an orally -available , potent , and selective small molecule neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R ) antagonist shown to s ignificantly modulate the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal (HPG) axis to lower the circulating levels of sex hormones in nonclinical studies and in clinical trials. The mechanism -of-action of ESN364 is to decr ease the luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency, a response indicative of a decrease in the gonadotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH ) pulse frequency .10 Moreover, the finding that the drug action selectivel y affected LH but not follicle -stimulating hor mone (FSH) provides additional evidence that ESN364 does not block GnRH signaling but merely decreases the GnRH pulse frequency. The selective effect of ESN364 to lower L H but not FSH is consistent in rat s, sheep, monkey s, and male and female humans .10,11"
21,page_21,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 22 Recent advances in the field have demonstrated that the GnRH pulse frequency is modulated by the Kisspeptin/neurokinin B (NKB) /dynorphin ( KNDy ) neurons (also known as “KiSS Neuron” ) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus .12 Neuroanatomical studies have shown that these neurons are sensitive to NKB /NK3R signal .13 These data support the hypothesis that ESN364 antagonism of NK3R on the KNDy neuron decreases the GnRH pulse frequency as the basis of the downstream e ffects observed on LH, FSH , and the sex hormones. The schematic of the neurokinin 3 (N K3) modulatory role on GnRH neurons to inhibit GnRH release and consequent release of sex hormones is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. NK3 Modulatory Role on GnRH Neurons Select abbreviations: FSH = follicle -stimulating hormone; Gn RH = gonadotr opin -releasing hormone; KiSS = kisspeptin/n eurokinin B/dynorphin ; LH = luteinizing hormone; NK3 = neurokinin 3. Source: Investigator ’s Brochure14 Furthermore, the proposed pharmacological action of ESN364 is consistent with the findings of a landmark publication revealing that a human population identified to have a l oss-of-function mutation in NK3R presents a phenotype of reduced circulating levels of sex hormones, but with the important distinction that the levels of these hormones are above castration levels in women .15 A follow -up article demonstrates this point clearly by showi ng that patients with a loss -of-function mutation in NK3 p resent very low levels of LH but that FSH levels are not significantly altered. In contrast, patients expressing a GnRH receptor loss -of-function mutation exhibit castration levels of both LH and FSH .16 Luteinizing hormone and FSH function independently to stimulate estradiol (E2) release from the ovaries. In total, these human mutant studies predict th at ESN364 antagonism of NK3R will diminish levels of E2 due to redu ction of the LH pulse frequency but will not affect FSH levels. T herefore , there is a natural safety margin in place that protects against over -inhibition of E2 and the attenuation side effects of chemical castration such as the maintenance of bone density as well as maintenance of a normal, healthy sex life. This safety margin is based on the NK3 -selective modulation of LH, but not FSH, and this is the anticipated advantage of ESN364 over the existing GnRH p roducts currently prescribed (eg , Lupron®, Zoladex®, etc.). In addition to the precede nt established by the human population study, an additional clinical precedence has been established by the historic testing of NK3 antagonists in clinical studies by various pharmaceutical companies. The therapeutic goal at the time was the treatment of schizophrenia , wherein all compounds failed due to lack o f convincing efficacy in Phase 2 studies. Importantly, these development programs report dose -related changes in LH, testosterone , and various reproductive organs (testes, epididymis, and prostate) in male dog s and a"
22,page_22,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 23 testosterone -lowering effect in male volunteers .17 This history indicates that NK3 antagonism is a target concept for drug development with clinical precedence to reversibly lower sex hormones. As described above, the KNDy neurons are sensitive to NKB/NK3R signaling that is susceptible to pharmacological blockade by ESN364 to decrease KNDy neuron activity. I mportantly, estro gen also acts directly on the alpha estrogen receptor expressed on KNDy neurons to similarly decrease KNDy neuron activity .18,19 Thus, ESN364 and estrogen have common pharmacological effects to decrease KNDy neuron activity. In physiological situations where there is a change towar d lower estrogen levels, such as in menopause or in the case of therapies used to lower estrogen to treat estrogen -dependent cancers, estrogen feedback control of KNDy neuron activity is lost. The KNDy neuron is known to synapse at 2 sites: (1) the GnRH neuron, as explained earlier, and (2) the median preoptic nucleus which is an area of the brain critical for autonomic thermoregulation .20 Furthermore, additional evidence linking NK3R signali ng on KNDy neuron activity to vasomotor symptom /thermoregulation includes the observations that (1) administration of NKB (NK 3R agonist) provoked vasomotor symptoms in premenopausal women ,21 (2) administration of ESN364 (NK3 antagonist) prevented body temperature changes in ovarie ctomized ewe ,10 and (3) the demonstration of a significant association between risk of vasomotor symptom s and genetic variation in tachykinin receptor 322 (see Figure 2).

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 24 1.2 Summary of Nonclinical Studies A series of non -Good Laboratory Practice ( GLP) and GLP nonclinical studies were carried out in order to define the pharmacodynamics (PD) , pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity of the test product ESN364. Compound affinity to human NK3 R and to rat and monkey NK3 R orthologs were confirmed via in vitro studies. R eceptor -ligand affinity for ESN 364 has been confirmed as essentially equipotent for t he human and monkey NK3 R orthologs. Also, the metabolic stability of the test item was determined to be similar in human and monke y liver microsomes . These preliminary studies justified the use of rat and monkey species in nonclinical testing. Since castra te animals exhibit high and stable levels of plasma LH, castrated rats and monkeys were used as the animal model of choice to measure the PD response to ESN364 in the modulation of plasma LH. Rats and monkeys were used for GLP toxicity studies , and monkeys , as the most sensitive species, were used to define the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and to determine the starting dose in the Phase 1 clinical study. In the nonclinical toxicology studies in rats and monkeys, ESN 364 was well tolerated and the NOAEL was considered to be 25 mg /kg/day in Cynomolgus monkeys, the most relevant species; drug exposure ( ie, AUC) at this dose level in C ynomolgus monkey was similar to drug exposure levels measured in premenopausal women dosed at 540 mg/day. The main events that were observed in the nonclinical studies were considered to be rel ated to the pharmacology of ESN 364, including reduction of the ovarian activity in female monkeys. Adverse events were only observed at the very high doses used in the noncl inical studies. The NOAEL exceeded the intended clinical doses by a factor of 20 . In monkeys, high doses of ESN 364 resulted in weight loss and histopathological changes such as hyperplasia of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, spleen , and lung, as well as perivas cular inflammation in the kidney. In addition, a reduction in platelet counts considered to be due to decreased production in bone marrow resulted in observations of hemorrhage and regenerative anemia; these effects were recoverable with discontinuation of dosing. In rats, very high dose levels were associated with death and marked clinical signs (including lethargy, reduced activity, labored respiration , and staggering), and body weight loss during the first few days of treatment. In a 3 -month toxicology s tudy in rats, convulsive episodes were reported with no dose - or time-dependent trend s or concu rrent ESN364 exposure. Convulsive episodes were reduced significantly by changing the handling procedures. In an independent assessment of the convulsive episode s in this study, it was concluded that the event was not linked to the test dr ug ESN364, but rather a stress -and-fear reaction (expert report from Brunner Naga Health Science Consulting, Switzerland, available upon request). In order to evaluate the potent ial of ESN364 to produce seizures in rats, a long -term central nervous system toxicity study was conducted. In this study, no seizures were detected throughout the st udy based on review of video -electroencephalogram records. In addition, no convulsions wer e observed in a subsequent 6 -month study in rat conducted at exactly the same dose levels (NOAEL of 200 mg/kg/d). Therefore, it was concluded that the convulsive episodes observed in the 3 -month study were unlikely to be related to ESN364 administration. N otably, no signs of convulsive activity were observed in 3 -month and 9 -month toxicology studies in non human primates, nor in any of the clinical studies conducted. Reproductive toxicology studies on both rats and rabbits demonstrated significant litter los s in both animal species at high dose levels; however , the surviving embryos did not show any adverse effect on development. The litter loss in this case is to be regarded as a pharmacologic effect on the"

A fertility and e arly embryonic development study was also completed in rat without any reported adverse events (NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/d). For more detailed information on ESN364 and the nonclinical toxicology studies, see the current Investigator’s Brochure .14 1.3 Clinical Studies 1.3.1 Summary of Clinical Studies A second P hase 1 clinical trial exploring the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ESN364 in healthy female and healthy male volunteers has been recently completed ( ESN-364-CPK -102). Dose ranges between 180 mg and 900 mg have been tested as single doses. Doses up to 720 mg have been given in a multiple dose fashion for 7 consecutive days. It was decided that 900 mg ESN364 was to be the MTD because of the occurrence of headache and facial paresthesia (a feeling of numbness around the mouth and face). This complaint was reported at 540 mg (reported start times around 40 minutes postdose). The reported paresthesia tended to become more pronounced and prolonged with increa sing doses. The apparent dose -dependent nature of the event, together with the occurrence of some moderate headaches, led to the decision to stop further escalation. The subsequent 7 -day multiple dose part was conducted using 540 mg and 720 mg of ESN364 once daily ( QD) in healthy female volunteers. These dose levels were well tolerated and safe. Three P hase 2a trials (proof -of-concept) have been initiated in 3 separate therapeutic indications : polycystic ovary syndrome (ESN -364-PCO -201), heavy menstrual ble eding due to uterine fibroids (ESN -364-UF-02), and Based on the collected clinical and nonclini cal safety data, it can be concluded that doses up to 360 mg/day can be safely administered over a 3 -month dosing period. Dose ranges that cover an appropriate 10-fold range between 20 mg/day and 180 mg/ day will allow exploration of a dose response in the patients .

The results of these Phase 2 clinical trials are not yet available . Please see the most current version of the Investigator’s Brochure for additional details. 1.4 Rationale ESN364 has been selected as the development candidate molecule based on its superior PK profile, oral bioavailability , and selective target potency. The summary of clinical studies supports the rationale for the current trial to refine both the d ose-level and dosing regimen in order to define the minimal effective dos e level of fezolinetant to treat moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms. 1.5 Risk/Benefit ESN364 is being developed for the treatment of women’s health disorders such as menopausal vasom otor symptoms , endometriosis, p olycystic ovarian syndrome , and uterine fibroids. The compound may also be developed for sex hormone disorders affecting men, such as benign prostate hyperplasia . Due to recent advances in science, there are reasons to believ e that ESN364 can be an effective treatment for the symptoms and morbidity associated with menopause. A key feature of NK3 antagonism is the selective decrease of LH secretion without compromising FSH secretion by decreasing the firing rate of the KNDy neu ron. When given to normally cycling healthy women, ESN364 is capable of altering the menstrual cycle and decreasing the circulating levels of E2, LH, progesterone (P4), and testosterone. Since this study aims to includ e postmenopausal volunteers, these eff ects will become of less importance because of the physiological changes that happen in the climacterium (anovulation with loss of P4 and E2 production, and consequently increase of LH/FSH). In terms of hormonal changes, a mild to moderate decrease of the already elevated LH and FSH plasma levels is anticipated . There are no known r isks associated with this decrease of the gonadotropins in menopause. CCI"

Adverse effects that can be expected are those adverse events that presented in ESN364 clinical trials in healthy male and female volunteers as well as in menopausal women. Details of the adverse event profile from the proof -of-concept study are presented in Section 1.3. All recorded treatment -related TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. All adverse events resolved spontaneously without sequelae . The reported palpitations were short -lived and were not accompanied by other signs/symptoms of cardiac involvement (vital signs and electrocardiogram [ECG ] findings were normal). Current knowledge of the side effect pro file of ESN364 is still limited. Indirectly , subject s could benefit from participating in this clinical trial because of the intense medical follow -up demanded by the protocol for the duration of the trial. CCI"

This study will consist of a screening period (Days -35 to -1, including the screening visit [Visit 1] and a minimum 7 -day c ollection of baseline vasomotor symptom frequency and severity assessments), a 12 -week treatment period (Day 1 [Visit 2] to Week 12 [Visit 5], including safety visits at Week 2 [Visit 2A], Week 6 [Visit 3A], and Week 10 [Visit 4A]), and a follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug, for a total of 9 visits. The study will be performed on an ambulatory basis. The screening vis it (Visit 1) will occur up to 35 days prior to randomization. Eligibility will be assessed via physical examination, clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, ECG , Pap smear, mammography, and endometrial biopsy. Subjects will receive an electronic diary in which to record daily vasomotor symptoms during the duration of the screening perio d. Subjects must have 7 consecutive days of vasomotor symptom recordings to participate in the study. Subjects are encouraged to continue recording for the duration of the whole screening period. The electronic diary will be reviewed by study site staff o n Day 1 (Visit 2) to confirm study eligibility. Subjects may be rescreened 1 time upon approval of the medical monitor (see Section 6.2). A total of 352 subjects will be enrolled in the study . Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups (ie, 4 4 subjects in each arm). Subjects and study personnel will be blinded to the tr eatment (placebo or ESN364), dosage (30 mg, 60 mg, etc .), and dosing regimen (QD or twice daily [BID] ).

Interrupt study drug administration for any subject who also experiences any symptoms of abdominal pain, worsening or new fatigue, anorexia, nausea, rash, vomiting, or diarrhea. If prompt evaluation is not possible , then drug administration should be interrupted until this investigation has been done. Once the subject has been evaluated ph ysically and liver function tests have returned to normal or baseline values , study drug can be restarted and the normal follow -up should be installed. If a subject requires to stop study drug for more than 7 days, this should be discussed with the medical monitor and/or sponsor with regards to re -starting study drug treatment. 4.4 Withdrawal Criteria Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, including personal reasons. A subject can withdraw without giving a reason. This w ill not affect the subject’s future care. The Investigator should , however , try to find out why a subject has withdrawn from the study and document the reason for withdrawal in the source documents and on the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). A subject must be withdrawn from the study or treatment for any of the following reasons : • Withdrawal of informed consent; • Lost to follow -up; • If, for safety reasons, including meeting the requirement for interruption of study drug, it is in the best interest of the su bject that she be withdrawn, in the Investigator’s opinion; • Development of a medical condition that requires concomitant treatment with a prohibited therapy (see Section 5.6); • Development of seizures or other convulsive disorders; • Breaking of the randomization code during administration of the study drug by the Investigator or by a member of the site staff. If th e code is broken by the Sponsor for safety reporting purposes or early timepoint analysis , the subject may remain in the study; • Confirmed decrease in platelets below 7 5,000 mm3, which does not normalize after 7 days; • ALT or AST >8  ULN; • ALT or AST >5  ULN for more than 2 weeks;"

See Appendix D and Section 9.14 for the procedure to follow in case of suspected drug-induced liver injury (DILI) . In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study drug, the Medical M onitor and Sponsor or designee should be informed. In the event of withdrawal due to a serious adverse event ( SAE), the Sponsor should be notified within 24 hours (for details on adverse event reporting see Section 9.3). In the event of withdrawal for other reasons, the Sponsor or designee should be notified within 2 days of the event. Subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion of the scheduled stu dy procedures for any reason (adverse event , withdrawal of consent, etc.) sho uld be invited to complete the ET assessments (see Section 6.5). As long as the subject consents, all relevant assessments of the day on which the subject withdrew from the study should be completed (at a minimum those related to safety) and the subject should return for a safety follow -up visit approximately 3 weeks after the last intake of study d rug. As long as the subject consents, she will be asked to continue the c ompletion of the eDiary up to the safety follow -up visit. In case of an adverse event , the appropriate follow -up will be done. Subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. Study drug assigned to a withdrawn subject must not be assigned t o another subject."

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 37 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 5.1 Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups in an equal ratio (see Table 1). Table 1. Treatment Groups Dose, Regimen, Route Number of Subjects Total E SN364 Daily Dose ESN364 15 mg BID, oral 44 30 mg ESN364 30 mg BID, oral 44 60 mg ESN364 60 mg BID, oral 44 120 mg ESN364 90 mg BID, oral 44 180 mg ESN364 30 mg QD + placebo QD, oral 44 30 mg ESN364 60 mg QD + placebo QD, oral 44 60 mg ESN364 120 mg QD + placebo QD, oral 44 120 mg Placebo BID, oral 44 N/A BID = twice daily; N/A = not applicable; QD = once daily. 5.2 Rationale for Dosing Luteinizing hormone secretion is a surrogate for the activity of the KNDy neuro n. In the first-in-human Phase 1 study , the mid -range dose of ESN364 (60 mg/day ) was demonstrated to be associated with a submaximal LH suppression, and thus a submaximal suppression of the KNDy neuron. ESN364 gi ven as a dose of 180 mg/day was also tested in the first -in-human Phase 1 study and was demonstrated t o be safe and well tolerated . Luteinizing hormone suppression was maximal with this dose level . Hence, the expectation is that the 180 mg dose represents the dose associated with maximal suppression of the KNDy neuron. During menopause, the negative feedback by E2 does not occur due to the cessation of estrogen production in the ovaries. The loss of negative E2 feedback causes the KNDy neuron to become hyperactive in an attempt to restore the needed E2 levels via the increased release of LH/FSH. When the KNDy neuron is in the hyperactive state, as it is presumed to be in th e postmenopausal period, a QD morning dose of ESN364 is unlikely to yield the desir ed suppression of KNDy at night to prevent night sweats. For this reason, a high dose of ESN364 (total daily dose of 180 mg ) given as 90 mg BID will be tested to investigate the possibility of completely suppressing LH secretion . The other doses are based on their ability to significantly decrease LH levels in healthy female volunteers, . The aim is to demonstrate an ESN364 dose response using BID dosing as well as QD dosing in the morning and to select the optimal dose for Phase 3. Placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude of changes in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment . Placebo control will be used to maintain blinding as well as to investigate the placebo effect that is widely seen in vasomotor symptom trials. CCI"

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 38 5.3 Randomization and Blinding In total, 352 subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups in an equal ratio. Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the likelihood that known an d unknown subject attributes (eg , demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment arm s, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment arms. Subjects and study personnel will be blinded to the tr eatment (placebo or ESN364), dosage (30 mg, 60 mg, etc.), and dosing regimen (QD or BID) . Randomization will be based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared by Medpace, Inc. Biostatistics using SAS® software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) prior to the start of the study. The randomization will be balanced using randomly permuted blocks across the treatment arms. The randomization list will be retained by Medpace Biostatistics until the end of the study (database lock). A copy will be sent in a sealed envelope to the bioanalytical laboratory responsible for plasma drug and serum hormone determination bef ore the start of the study as applicable. Because of a planned early timepoint analysis (see Section 10.2.3 ) and because PK/PD modeling will start prior to databas e hard -lock, specific assigned Sponsor staff involved in these activities (or delegates, if outsourced to an external vendor) will be unblinded after recruitment has been completed. Details of the unblinding will be documented in a separate charter to ensu re the direct study team remains blinded and that unblinded results are restricted to a very small group independent of the study team . Subjects will be assigned a randomization number from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system upon enrollment. The randomization list will be uploaded into the IRT system. Based on this randomization list, the study drug will be packaged and labeled. Medication numbers will be preprinted on the study drug labels. The study team, including those involved in data management, clinical, medical, or statistical review of the study data, will also be blinded during the study as they will not have access to the randomization list. Medpace, the Contract Research Organization (CRO) performing data management and statistical activities, will receive a copy of the randomization list at database lock. The study drug administered to a subject can be identified by the IRT system. The IRT system will allow rapid access to the treatment allocation codes when relevant for site or CR O personnel. 5.4 Breaking the Blind The randomization list will not be available to the Investigator or other employees of the study site, subjects, monitors, or blinded Medpace and Sponsor personnel before unblinding of the data, unless in case of emergency. Blinding will be maintained unless unblinding is considered mandatory because of a life -threatening situation for management of medical treatment. In such case, the date at which breaking of the code occurs, the person who breaks the code, and the reason why the code is broken will need to be documented in the subject’s file. Sites will use IRT to break the blind. The Medpace IRT team will supply a passcode (6 digits) in a sealed envelope for each site in order to break the blind in the IRT system. Site per sonnel should inform the Medical Monitor immediately. If the Investigator accidentally breaks the code, the Medical Monitor and the Clinical Trial Manager must be also informed as soon as possible. If the code is broken by the Investigator or by someone of his/her clinical staff, the subject must be withdrawn from the study and must be"
38,page_38,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 39 followed as appropriate. If the code is broken by the Sponsor or designee for safety reporting purposes or the planned early timepoint analysis , the subject may remain in the study. Because of a planned early timepoint analysis (see Section 10.2.3 ) and because PK/PD modeling will start prior to database hard -lock, specific assigned Sponsor staff involved in these activities (or delegates, if outsourced to an external vendor) will be un blinded after recruitment has been completed. Details of the unblinding will be documented in a separate charter to ensure the direct study team remains blinded and that unblinded results are restricted to a very small group independent of the study team. 5.5 Drug Supplies 5.5.1 Formulation and Packaging ESN364 and placebo will be manufactured, packaged, and labeled under the responsibility of Ogeda S.A. The study drug and placebo are manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), as required by the current Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), at Pharmavize N.V. (Mariakerke, Belgium). The packaging and labeling of study drug will be in accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements. The ESN364 and placebo capsules will be packaged in h igh-density po lyethylene bottles with polypropylene closure. Subjects will be assigned 2 bottles as a kit (1 bottle labeled “morning” and 1 bottle labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 8 (Visit 4).

(Mariakerke, Belgium). Study drug will be assigned by the I RT to study sites/subjects. 5.5.3 Study Drug Administration Subjects will be assigned 2 bottles of study drug as a kit (1 bottle labeled “morning” and 1 bottle labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 8 (Visit 4). Each bottle will contain 34 capsules of ESN364 or placebo. Study drug should be dispensed under the supervision of the Investigator, a qualified member of the clinical staff, or the hospital/clinic pharmacist . All study visits should be conducted in the morning. Subjects should be fasted (defined as nothing by mouth except for water [up to 1 hour before study drug intake] for at least 10 hours prior to study visit). Day 1 ( Visit 2 ) should be planned to allow for first intake of study drug (“morning” dose) at the study site between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM. Following Day 1 ( Visit 2 ), each subsequent visit should be planned at the same time of day (morning) for each subject. Study drug intake will be done with a glass of room temperature tap water. The first intake of study drug will take place at the study site on Day 1 (Visit 2) between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM under the supervision of the study staff. On study visit days (Day 1 [Visit 2], Week 4 [Visit 3], and Week 8 [Visit 4], only) , the morning dose of study drug will be taken at the study site under the supervision of the study staff, after collection of predose blood samples. Subjects will be instructed to arrive at the study site fasted ( defined as nothing by mouth except water [up to 1 hour prior to study drug intake] for at l east 10 hours prior to study visit ). On all other days throughout the treatment period, subjects will be instructed to take their morning dose of study drug at home, around the same time of the day and spaced as near to 12 hours apart as possible (preferably between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM and 7:00 PM and 10:00 PM ). Intake of study drug should be preferably 1 hour before or 2 hours after meals. Subjects need to re cord all home study drug intake in the electronic Patient -Reported Outcome (ePRO) diar y. In the event a subject accidentally misses a s cheduled dose of the study drug, the missed dose should be skipped and the subject should resume the usual dosing schedule. Any deviation from the treatment regimen defined in the protocol must be documented in the eCRF ."

Each bottle will contain 34 capsules of ESN364 or placebo. On visit days during the treatment period (Day 1 [Visit 2], Week 4 [Visit 3], and Week 8 [Visit 4], only) , the morning dose of study drug will be taken at the study site under the supervision of the clinical staff. All other study drug intakes (evening dose and morning dose on all da ys without visits) will take place at home. W hen taking study drug at home, subjects will be asked to record their home study drug intake in the ePRO diary. Subjects will also be asked to return all unused study drug . Compliance of study drug intake will be assessed by counting returned study drug in addition to reviewing ePRO entries of study drug intake . Any discrepancies bet ween returned study drug number and dosing in the ePRO diary will be discussed with the subject for whom a discrepancy was seen and recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. If a subject demonstrates continued non-compliance with study drug dosing (85% compliance) despite educational efforts, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor to discuss withdrawal of the subject from the study. 5.5.5 Storage and Accountability The Investigator (or his/her designee) is responsible for the safe storage of all study drug assigned to the study site. Study drug will be stored in a locked, secure storage facility with access limited to those individuals authorized to dispense the study drug and maintained within the appropriate ranges of temperature. All study drug must be stored as specified at delivery and in the original packaging. Instructions for the subjects regarding the storage and handling of the study drug will also be provided to the study sites. ESN364 must be stored at ambient conditions (15 °C to 30°C or 59 °F to 86°F), should not be exposed to freezing temperatures, and should be protected from light during storage at the study site. Study drug is stable up to 24 months at 25 °C with 60% relative humidity. Daily temperature logging of the study drug storage r oom at the study site should be performed. In the event a deviation in storage conditions should occur, the site must discontinue dispensing the affected study drug and notify the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) . The same instruction applies for temperat ure deviations occurring during shipment of study drug to the sites. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study drug received at the study site is inventoried and acco unted for throughout the study. As misallocations of study drug will have an impact on study execution and will jeopardize the validity of the data obtained, utmost care should be taken to correctly dispense the study drug as assigned by the randomization system. Subjects will be assigned 2 bottles of study drug as a kit (1 bottle labeled “morning” and 1 bottle labeled “evening”) at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 8 (Visit 4). Each bottle will contain 34 capsules of ESN364 or placebo. Study drug should be dispensed under the supervision of the Investigator, a qualified member of the clinical staff, or the hospital/clinic pharmacist. The Investigator must maintain accurate records demonstrating date and amount of study drug supplied to whom and by whom. Study drug will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study."

At the screening visit, subjects will receive the ePRO diary in which to record daily vasomotor symptoms during the screening period. Subjects must have 7 consecutive days of vasomotor symptom recordings to participate in the study . Data on vasomotor symptom frequency and severity collected during the screening period (Days -35 to -1) will serve as baseline for vasomotor symptom frequency and severity . Vasomotor symptoms will be recorded by calendar day (ie, 1 day is midnight [12:00 AM (00:00 hours) ] to 11:59 PM [23:59 hours]). Night sweats (vasomotor symptoms that disrupt the subject ’s night sleep) should be recorded no later than in the morning upon a wakening to start a new day. Subject s should take note of the time of the night sweat and record it on the appropriate calendar day (ie, before or after midnight). The severity of vasomotor symptoms is defined clinically as follows (according to the FDA a nd European Medicines Agency Guidance s for Industry23,24 and the National Institutes of Health [NIH] Hot Flash Workshop25): • Mild: Sensation of heat without s weating/dampness. If at night, subject does not wake up but later notices damp sheets or clothing. • Moderate: Sensation of heat with sweating/dampness, but able to c ontinue activity. If at night, subject wakes up because she is feeling hot and/or is sweating, but no action is necessary other than rearranging the bed sheets. • Severe: Sensation of intense heat with sweating, causing disrup tion of activity. If at night, subject wakes up hot and is sweatin g and needs to take action (eg , remov e layers of clothes, open the window, or get out of bed). The definition of the main parameters are as follows: Frequency The frequency is the number of vasomotor symptoms per day. Severity Severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per day is calculated as follows: [(number of moderate vasomotor symptoms  2) + (number of severe vasomotor symptoms  3)]/ number of daily moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms Severity is zero for s ubjects that have no moderate or severe vasomotor symptoms. A weekly average severity is the average of the daily severity scores."
54,page_54,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 55 Severity of vasomotor symptoms per day is calculated as follows: [(number of mild vasomotor symptoms  1) + (number of moderate vasomotor symptoms  2) + (number of severe vasomotor symptoms  3)]/ number of daily mild/ moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms Severity is zero for subjects that have no hot flashes. A weekly average severity is the average of the daily severity scores. Hot Flash S core Hot flash score per day is calculated as follows: (number of moderate vasomotor symptoms  2) + (number of severe vasomotor symptoms  3) Frequency, severity, and hot flash score will be assessed by taking the mean of the data over 7 days. 8.1.2 Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale Perceived vasomotor symptom interference on daily activities will be evaluated at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Vis it 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5) /ET, and the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) using the HFRDIS. The HFRDIS will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive procedures. The HFRDIS is a 10 -item scale that measures a woman’s perceptions of the degree to which vasomotor symptoms interfere with 9 daily life activities ( work, social activities, leisure, sleep, mood, concentration, relations with others, sexuality, and enjoying life ); the 10th item measures interference wi th overall quality of life .26 This scale was modeled after items on the Brief Pain Inventory27 and Brief Fatigue Inventory ,28 which assess the extent to which pain or fatigue interfere with daily life. Subjects will be asked to rate the ext ent to which vasomotor symptoms have interfered with each item during the previous 2-week time interval using a 0 (do not interfere) to 10 (completely interfere) scale. Recent structural equation modeling suggests this is a unidimensional scale best repres ented by an overall mean score (sum of items/10) .29 8.1.3 Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire Subject sleep quality will be evaluated at Day 1 (Visit 2 ), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4) , Week 12 (Visit 5) /ET, and at the f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) using the LSEQ . A baseline questionnaire will be used at Day 1 (Visit 2) and a post -baseline questionnaire will be used at all other visits. The qu estionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive procedures. The LSEQ is a 10 -item self -rated questionnaire that assesses a subject ’s aspects of sleep and early morning behavior. The questions are grouped into 4 chronological areas : ease of getting to sleep, perceived quality of sleep, ease of awaking from sleep, and integrity of ear ly morning behavior following wakefulness .30 The LSEQ is a visual analo gue scale that requires respondents to place marks on a group of 10 cm lines representing the changes they have experienced in a variety of symptoms compared to usual (baseline version) versus since the beginning of treatment (post -baseline version) . Lines extend between extremes like “more difficult than usual” and “easier than usual.” Res ponses are measured using a 100 mm scale and are averaged to provide a score for each domain."

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 56 8.1.4 Greene Climacteric Scale Changes in climacteric symptoms will be evaluated at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3 ), Week 8 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5) /ET, and at the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) using the GCS. The questionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive procedures. The GCS is a 21-item scale that provides a brief but comprehensive and valid measure of climacteric symptomatology .31 Each item is rated by the subject accord ing to its severity using a 4-point rating scale from 0 (no ne) to 3 ( severe ). The first 20 items of the scale comb ine into 3 main independent symptom measures by summing up the individual item scores : psychological symptoms (items 1 to 11; score 0 to 33), physical symptoms (items 12 to 18; score 0 to 21), and vasomotor symptoms (items 19 to 20; score 0 to 6). Item 21 is a probe for sexual dysfunction. The total score can range from 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate worse symptoms. 8.1.5 Menopause -Specific Quality of Life The MENQoL questionnaire will be recorded at Day 1 (Visit 2 ), Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and at the f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]). The questionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive procedures . The MENQoL questionnaire was introduced in 1996 as a tool to assess health -related qual ity of life in the immediate post menopausal period. An inherent assumption of the MENQoL is that disease states and conditions like menopause produce symptoms that may disrupt emotional, physical, and social aspects of an individual’s life, and must be con sidered concomitantly with treatment decisions. The MENQoL improves upon several instruments used to assess the impact of menopausal symptoms on quality of life, including the Kupperman Index and the General Well-Being Scale, in the following ways: 1) spec ificity to the condition of menopause; 2) item development based upon women’s own qualitative and quantitative accounts of menopausal symptoms; 3) inclusion of all pertinent domains of the menopause experience, including sexual symptoms; and 4) demonstrate d reliability and validity . The MENQoL is self -administered and consists of a total of 29 items in a Likert -scale format. Each item assesses the impact of 1 of 4 domains of menopausal symptoms, as experienced over the last month: vasomotor (items 1 to 3), psychosocial (items 4 to 10), physical (items 11 to 26), and sexual (items 27 to 29). Items pertaining to a specific symptom are rated as present or not present, and if pr esent, how bothersome on a 0 (not bothersome) to 6 (extremely bothersome) scale.32,33 Means are computed for each subscale by dividing the sum of the domain’s items by the number of items within that domai n.33 Non-endorsement of an item is scored a “1” and endorsement a “2,” plus the number of the particular rating, so that the possible s core on any item ranges from 1 to 8.34 8.1.6 Body Composition CCI"

Subjects should be fasted (defined as nothing by mouth except water [up to 1 hour before study drug intake] for at least 10 hours prior to study visit. During the postdose assessment period, the subject may eat and drink, provided this is done at least 1 hour after dosing. Samples will be taken predose at Day 1 (Visit 2) , Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , as well as predose and 3 hours postdose at Week 4 (Visit 3 ). The Week 4 (Visit 3) 3-hour postdose PD sample should be shifted to a later date in case s where the subject c annot accommodate the PK sampling schedule at that visit. The PD sample should be taken at the same time as the 3 -hour postdose PK sample (see Section 8.2). A PD sa mple will be taken at the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) as well. Markers include LH, FSH, E2, and SHBG . The exact date and time of blood sampling must be recorded in the source documents and on the eCRF. Plasma will be collected and handled as speci fied in the central laboratory manual. After appropriate labeling, the plasma samples will be stored below -70°C at the study site . Thereafter, the frozen plasma samples will be transported/shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory for collection and st orage below -70°C until analysis . Further procedures for sample collection, shipment, processing, and storage are descr ibed in the laboratory manual. 8.4 Pharmacogenomic Assessments Optional p harmacogenomic sampling is scheduled to occur at Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET ; however, sampling can occur any time after subjects sign the PGX ICF and are enrolled into the study . Pharmacogenomic samples will be stored for potential future analysis. Any PGX sample taken during screening will be destroyed in the event of a scr een failure."

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or sympt oms, are to be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . Adverse events, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the time of informed consent until s tudy participation is complete . Subjects should be instructed to re port any adverse event that they experience to the Investigator . Investigators should make an assessment for adverse events at each visit (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, and 4A) and record the event on the appropriate adverse event eCRF. Wherever possible, a spe cific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by the Investigator , it should be recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF. Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse ev ent, not the procedure. Any medical condition already present at the screening visit will be recorded as medical history and should not be reported as an adverse event . Any medical condition or signs or symptoms present at screening that change in severit y or seriousness at any time during the study should be reported as an adverse event. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( eg, ECG ) findings that are detected during the study or are present at the screening visit and significantly worsen during the study should be reported as adverse event s. The Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically signifi cant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant. Any abnormal test that is determined to be an error does n ot require reporting as an adverse event . 9.1.1 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction An unexpected a dverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information."
59,page_59,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 60 9.1.2 Adverse (Drug) Reac tion All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considere d an adverse drug reaction . “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at l east a reasonable possibility, ie, the relationship cannot be ruled out. 9.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by the Investigator The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe, and will also categorize eac h adverse event as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of yes or no. Assessment of Severity : Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities. Moderate – An event that is suffi ciently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inability to work or perform normal daily activities. Causality Assessment : The relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the stu dy drug is to be assessed according to the following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, no relation) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and a nother cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) is suspected. Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event is consistent with a causal relationship and no oth er cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to sugges t a causal relationship. The following factors should also be considered: • The temporal sequence from study drug administration - o The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event. • Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases - o Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have. • Concomitant drug - o The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question."
60,page_60,"Ogeda S.A. Clinical Study Protocol ESN364_HF_205 Confidential & Proprietary Protocol Version 4.0 (incl. Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 61 • Known response pattern for this class of study drug - o Clinical and/or noncl inical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a class effect. • Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses - o The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipient and provide a logical and better explanation for the ev ent. • The pharmacology and PK of the study drug - o The known pharmacologic properties ( ADME ) of the study drug should be considered. 9.2 Serious Adverse Event s An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death , • A life -threatening adverse event , o NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the su bject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizations , o NOTE : Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnig ht stay will be considered an inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as adver se event s and assessed for seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situational reasons ( ie, no place to stay, live too far away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations. • A persistent or significant disabi lity/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions , • A congenital anomaly/birth defect , or • An important medical event. o NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospit alization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependency."

Serology (HBsAG, HCV, and HIV antibodies) will be completed at the screening visit. Urinalysis will be performed on site using a comme rcial urine dipstick. In the event the dipstick result is positive, a urine sample must be shipped to a central laboratory f or urine sediment analysis (see Appendix B for list of urinalysis analytes) . Urine drug screen for amphetamine s, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, cannabinoids, cocaine , or opiates will be performed at the screening visit. Note that testing positive for cannabinoids will not exclude a subject from participating the study. A subject with an active prescription for opiates may also participate in the study at the discretion of the Investigator. The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any change occurring d uring the study considered to be c linically relevant in the source documents and in the adverse events section of the eCRF. Laboratory values outside the laboratory normal range will be flagged and their clinical relevance will be assessed by the Investigator. A copy of all laboratory reports must be filed in the subject’s medical records. Samples that remain after protocol -specific assessments have been performed may be used for further exploratory work on PK, metabolites, plasma protein binding, protein analysis, and biochemistry . 9.8 Bone Tu rnover Markers Plasma concentrations of the bone turnover markers BALP, P1NP , and CTX will be assessed at Day 1 ( Visit 2 ), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and f ollow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) . Blood samples for the assessment of BALP , P1NP , and CTX in plasma wil l be collected and handled as specified in the central laboratory manual.

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 65 9.9 Vital Signs Vital sign parameters will be assessed at each study visit (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, and 4A). The vital sign parameters that will be assessed are body temperature (oral /tympanic ), blood pressure (sitting), and pulse rate (supine after 5 minutes of rest) . These parameters will be measured using a completely automated device consisting of an inflatable cuff and an oscillatory detection system. All values will be registered on a built -in recorder so that measurements are observer -independent. Any change from baseline in vital sign values occurring during the study that is considered to be clinically relevant or that requires concomitant medication , as judged by the Investigator , should be recorded in the source documents and the adverse event section of the eCRF. Refer to Appendix E for normal ranges for vital sign parameters. 9.10 Electrocardiograms Twelve -lead digital ECGs will be obtai ned at each study visit (excluding Visits 2A, 3A, and 4A) after 10 minutes in a supine position . Whenever vital signs, 12 -lead ECGs, and blood draws are scheduled for the same nominal time, the assessments should occur in the following order: 12 -lead ECG, vital signs, and blood draws. Skin preparation should be thorough and electrodes should be placed according to standard 12 -lead ECG placement. Electrocardiogram s will be digitally recorded and printed on paper. All 12 -lead ECGs will be captured in triplic ate (ie, 3 s eparate 12 -lead ECGs at least 1 to 2 minutes apart within a 5 -minute window). The printed paper ECGs will be used for “real time” bedside ECG assessment by the Investigator (or designee) who will be responsible for the overall interpretation an d determination of the clinical significance of any potential ECG findings. Digital ECGs will be submitted to the ECG core lab oratory , which will perform the digital ECG analysis and interpretation in this study using standard methodology. If the central r eader identifies an abnormality, per the study alert criteria, the Investigator will be notified who will review the ECG and report any adverse event s as necessary. The following variables will be reported: HR, RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB, and QTcF intervals. The Investigator may add additional 12-lead ECG safety assessments if there are a ny abnormal findings or if the I nvestigator considers it is required for any other safety reason. Refer to Appendix E for normal ranges for ECG parameters. 9.11 Physical Examinations Physical ex aminations will be performed at the screening visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit 1]), Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]). A limited physical examination (weight and waist circumference only) will be performed at Week 4 (Visit 3) and Week 8 (Visit 4). The p hysical examination includes height (at screening only), weight, and waist circumf erence. To obtain the actual body weight, subjects must be weighed lightly clothed. The height should be measured barefoot. Waist circumference will be measured according to NIH guideline s (see Appendix C)."

This includes age, race, sex, and smoking status (smoker/non -smoker). A clinical breast examination will be performed at the screening visit only. A bimanual clinical pelvic examination will be performed at screening and at any time during the study where clinically indicated. Any change in physical examination occurring during the study that is considered to be clinically relevant by the Investigat or should be recorded in the source documents and the adverse event section of the eCRF. 9.12 Pap Smear Pap smears will be performed at the screening visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit 1]) only in the event that the subject does not have documentation of a normal/neg ative or no clinically significant findings Pap smear (or equivalent cervical cytology) within the prior 9 months. Pap smears must show no clinically significant findings in order for subjec ts to be included in the study (refer to guidance35). Samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory. For details on collection, handling, and shipment instructions, refer to the laboratory manual. 9.13 Mammograms Mammograms will be performed at the screening visit (Days -35 to -1 [Visit 1]) only in the event that the subject does not have documen tation of a normal/ negat ive or n o clinically significant findings mammogram within the prior 9 months of trial enrollment. Mammograms must show no clinically significant findings in order for subjects to be included in the study. 9.14 Abnormal Liver Function Monitoring and Drug -Induced Liver Injury Monitoring Subjects will be monitored for liver function tests throughout the study, including transaminases, total bilirubin, complete blood count, serum alkaline phosphatase, prothrombin time/INR, and creatine kinase. If a subject develops a liver function test abnormality, promptly investigate with repeat biochemical and physical evaluation and notify the CRA immediately (refer to Section 4.3 for detailed procedures) . 9.14.1 Abnormal Liver Function Weekly monitoring of liver function tests is required under the following conditions: • Subject with a non -elevated liver function test at baseline is found to have any abnormal liver function test elevation that does not meet the stopping rules or discontinuation criteria (Section 9.4) or withdrawal criteria (Section 4.4); or • Subject who is enrolled with a baseline liver function test that is 1.5  ULN and subsequently has an elevation 2  that of the baseline value.

Subjects must be immediately withdrawn from the study and follow the evaluation for sus pected DILI in Appendix D, if they meet any of the following criteria: • ALT or AST >8  ULN; • ALT or AST >5  ULN for more than 2 weeks; • ALT or AST >3  ULN AND total bilirubin >2  ULN or INR >1.5  ULN ; or • ALT or AST >3  ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%). 9.15 Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest are ad verse events the Sponsor may wish to carefully monitor. These adverse events may be serious or non -serious and are not considered SAEs unless they meet the SAE definition in Section 9.2. Adverse events of special interest should be reported on the eCRF as such. Adverse events of special interest in this study will include: • Uterine bleeding, • Oral/f acial paresthesia , and • Elevation in ALT and/or AST >3  ULN. 9.16 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS will be collected at Day 1 (Visit 2), Week 12 (Visit 5)/ET , and the follow -up visit (Week 15 [Visit 6]) . The C -SSRS will be used to assess all suicidal events and pro vide a summary of suicidal ideation and behavior. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suic ide. The questionnaire will be paper -based and administered at the study site prior to any invasive procedures. 9.17 Transvaginal Ultrasound Subjects will undergo trans vaginal ultrasound at screening, Week 12 (end -of-treatment), and, for subjects who are withdrawn from the study prior to completion, at the ET Visit. The endometrium should be measured in the long axis or sagittal plane . The measurement is of the thickest echogenic area from one basal endometrial interface across the en dometrial canal to the other basal surface. Care should be taken not to include the hypoechoic myometrium in this measurement. All transvaginal ultrasounds will be read by a local reader to determine endometrial biopsy eligibility followed by a central reading. In the event a subject has endometrial fibroids, the subject must undergo endometrial biopsy. Subjects with endometrial fibroids may be included in the s tudy provided the endometrial biopsy"

Although the transvaginal ultrasounds (see Section 9.17) will be read centrally, a local transvaginal ultrasound reading at screening should guide the decision to perform endometrial biopsy or not. In the event the local reader measures an endometrial thickness 4 mm , a single biopsy will be taken from the thickest part of the endometrium. Refer to the FDA draft guidance.23 In the event an inadequate specimen is obtained at screening, 1 repeat biopsy may be performed if technically possible . If the biops y is abnormal at Week 12 ( end-of-treatment ), subjects will have a repeat biopsy 4 weeks later , if clinically indicated. All biopsies will be read by centrally by a blinded pathologist. In the event that subject’s biopsy ind icates hyperplasia, biopsies will be assessed by 2 additional blinded pathologists. The participating study pathologists will be from different institutions with independent fiduciary and organizational reporting and will be blinded to each other’s assessments . Concurrence of 2 of the 3 pathologists will be accepted as the final diagnosis. If the 3 pathologists do not agree, the most severe pathologic diagnosis would be used as the final diagnosis."

All data collected in the study will be documented using summary tables, figures, and subject data listings. 10.1 Analysis Populations All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed usin g the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPAS) will be used only for the analysis of the selected endpoint s to examine the robustness of the primary analysis. Safety and tolerability w ill be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set. 10.1.1 Safety Analysis Set The Safety Analysis Set comprises all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. 10.1.2 Full Analysis Set The FAS comprises the subset of the Safety Analysis Set who have a baseline and post -baseline efficacy evaluation . 10.1.3 Per Protocol Analysis Set The PPAS comprises the subset of subject s from the FAS who are treated according to the protocol without any major deviations. A full list of inclusion criteria will be decid ed and assessed prior to database lock and unblinding. 10.1.4 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set The PK Analysis Set comprises the subset of the Safety Analysis Set who provide evaluable PK assessments . 10.2 Statistical Methods 10.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 10.2.1.1 Primary efficacy analysis Primary Efficacy Analysis : The 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints are the mean change in the frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and the mean change in severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12. For each of the 4 co -primary efficacy endpoints, an analysis of covariance model will be used with treatment group, pooled center, and smoking status as factors, with baseline weight and baseline measurement as covariates. Pairwise comparisons between the active doses and placeb o will be calculated based on least -squares mean contrasts using a 2 -tailed 95% confidence interval (CI). For subjects in the efficacy analysis populations with missing primary efficacy endpoints, multiple imputation by fully conditional specification meth ods will be used. The imputation model will use subject demographics (age, sex, race, baseline weight, and smoking status) and baseline and"

Amendments) 01 Aug 2018 70 post-baseline mean number and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Sensitivity analyses will be performed with other mult iple imputation methods and m ixed model for repeat measurement s. Since the study design requires the comparison of 7 active dose group s with placebo for 4 co-primary efficacy variables, a two -tier closed testing procedure will be used to control the famil y-wise error. A step -down tes ting procedure will be followed. T he following testing order of doses will be employed: a. Placebo versus 90 mg BID (daily dose 180 mg), b. Placebo versus 60 mg BID (daily dose 120 mg), c. Placebo versus 120 mg QD (daily dose 120 mg), d. Placebo versus 30 mg BID (daily dose 60 mg), e. Placebo versus 60 mg QD (daily dose 60 mg), f. Placebo versus 15 mg BID (daily dose 30 mg), and g. Placebo versus 30 mg QD (daily dose 30 mg). The 4 co -primary efficacy endpoints will be compared at each dose level. On ly when ESN364 is proved to be significantly better than placebo at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 for all 4 co-primary efficacy endpoints will this dose level be claimed to be superior to placebo. A failure to prove the significance for 1 or more co -primar y efficacy endpoints will lead to a failure to claim superiority to placebo at this dose level, and the other dose levels after this one in the sequence will not be tested. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS. A supportive analysis will be carried out for the co -primary efficacy variables based on the PPAS to examine the impact of premature dropouts and/or major protocol deviations. 10.2.1.2 Secondary efficacy analysis Efficacy will be further assessed based on the secondary endpoints described in Section 7.2 using the FAS. 10.2.1.3 Pharmacodynamic analysis Individual plasma hormone concentration values and actual sampling times relative to study drug intake will be listed. Descriptive statistics on the actual values and changes from baseline values will be summarized by assessment timepoint and by treatment arm. Descriptive statistics will include number of subjects, (arithmetic) mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum, and a 95% CI. Frequency tabulations will show counts and percentages. Pharmacodynamic data and efficacy data may be eval uated by a population PD or population PK/PD approach.

The unblinded results will be restricted to a very small group independent of the study team . No changes to the study or the statistical analysis plan will be made as a result of this analysis (wh ich is intended to assist with internal decision making only). Full details will be documented in a separate charter to ensure the integrity of the trial blinding; all study team personnel, including all those involved in data management, clinical, medical , or statistical review of the data, will remain bl inded until database hard-lock (see Section 5.3). 10.2.4 Sample Size Determination A total of 352 subjects are planned to be randomized, 44 subjects in each treatment arm. In the Phase 2a study, the observed least -square s mean difference between ESN364 90 mg BID (highest dose of this Phase 2b study) and placebo in change from baseline to Week 12 in mean daily frequency of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms was -5.0 (95% CI: -6.8, -3.3) with similar results at Week 4. Fo r any given pairwise comparison for a 2 -sample t -test at a 2 -sided 5% alpha, 40 subjects provides the following power to detect the following effect sizes assuming an SD of 5: Assumed treatment difference in mean daily frequency Power for pairwise test 3.3 83% 3.5 87% 4 94% 4.5 97% 5 >99% For change from baseline to Week 12 in mean severity of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, the observed mean treatment different in the Phase 2a study was -1.12 (95% CI: -1.5, -0.74) with similar results at Week 4. For any given pairwise comparison for a 2 -sample t -test at a 2 -sided 5% alpha, 40 subjects provides the following power to detect the following effect sizes assuming a SD of 1: Assumed treatment difference in mean severity Power for pairwise test 0.64 80% 0.75 91% 1 >99% Note that the combined power for testing all 4 co -primary endpoints will be lower than the power for each considered individually.
