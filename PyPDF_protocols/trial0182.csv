Identification and descri ption of the investigat ional device Xonrid® is an EC-marked medical device class IIa for radiation dermatitis; it is a t opical gel that prevents and treats skin symptoms such as erythema, itching, burning sensati on and pruritus, induced by radiothera py or other causes. When applied to the target skin area s, Xonrid® forms a protective film, reduces the TEWL (Trans Epidermal Water Loss) and increas es moisturizing. It promotes the healing process by restoring the physiological hydration levels of the affected skin areas. It can be applied to the target areas including skin f olds and creas es, with or without minor trauma or abrasions. Xonrid® is manufactured by Helsinn Healthca re SA. 3. Justification for the design of the clinical investigat ion Acute radiation dermatitis is a comm on side effect of radiothera py in many forms of cancer, first of all breast and head & neck. The intensity of the reaction depen ds on radiothera py parameters (dose per fracti on, total dose, use of bolus or other beam-modifying devices, type and energy of radiation, size of the treatment field and site treated) and on concomitant chemotherapy employment. Although with a lesser grade, other factors involved in determining the intensity of radiation dermatitis are comorbidities (e.g. diabetes) and individual susceptibility1-2. Skin reactions during radiothera py, scored ac cording to different systems, usually span in severity from mild erythema (grade 1) to moist desquamation confined to s kin folds (grade 2) or not (grade 3). Large ulcerations that require surgical procedures (grade 4) with potential lethal consequences (grade 5) are except ional and should be considered non-accepta ble complicat ions in routine practi ce. Early onset of severe acute skin reaction during trea tment could be responsible for a reduced compliance to the pla nned sche dule of irra diation, so jeopardizing local disea se control. The most used scales for assessing toxiciti es (Rad iation Thera py Oncology Group RT OG and CTCAE) do not capture symptoms as reported by the patien ts. Moreover, adverse events assess ed by physicia ns are less accurate than patient-repo rted outcome (PRO) instruments and some clinicians have proposed replacing physician scales with patie nt-asse ssed re porting of adverse events3-4. A recent trial showed how CTCAE and the PRO Skindex-16 were supplementary and that patients repor ted a greater number of symptoms. The Skindex-16 allows patient rating of emotional and functional burdens that the CTCAE does not take into account5. These adverse e vents cause patien t’s discomfort and impact negativ ely on quality of life6."
13,page_13,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 53 There is no gold-stan dard approach in the prevention and management of radiation dermatitis; however, a large variety of products and methods for the prevention of acute radiation-induced skin react ions have been tested, without identifying one product that has clear ly demonstrated superiority over another7. Generally, preemptive treatments are aimed to reduce the drying effe ct of radiothera py that causes desquamation and loss of the superficial protective layers of the skin. In this regard, the most employed agents are moisturizing creams, aimed at hydrating the skin and preventing the transcuta neous water loss. Evidence-based recommended for practice include the employment of intensit y-modulated radiation thera py and usual hygiene practices such as wash ing the irradiated skin and the use of mild soaps8. The employment of a moisturizing cream based on urea or anionic polar phospholipid is advisable9-10. There is a strong need to study products with a preemptive role in radiation dermatitis development, with a trial desi gn taking into account patient subjective evaluation and compliance. Xonrid® is a promising EC-marked medical device for radiation dermatitis; it is a topical gel that prevents and trea ts skin symptoms such as erythema, itching, burning sensati on and pruritus, induced by radiothera py or other causes. When applied to the target skin area s, Xonrid® forms a protective film, reduces the TEWL (Trans Epidermal Water Loss) and increas es moisturizing. It promotes the healing process by restoring the physiological hydration levels of the affected skin areas. It can be applied to the target areas including skin f olds and creas es, with or without minor trauma or abrasions. In a recent pilot study using Xonrid® (Iacovelli et al. 2016, accepted for publication on “Supportive care Cancer”, 02 jan-2016), the proportion of patients treated with Xonrid® and SOC preemptive treatment that not reached G2 radiation dermatitis at week 5 was 82.9%. Xonrid® use resu lted associated with a decrease in the incidence of G3 t oxicity and a delay in the development of G2 toxicity when compared to the data from a previous study (historical cohort)11. At week 5, patients with G2 and G3 dermatitis were about 52% and 10% in the historical cohort and 15% and 2% in the pilot study, respectively. The aim of this clinical i nvestigation is to evaluate if the use of Xonrid® in the prevention and treatment of G2 radiation dermatitis in breast and head & neck cancer patients can be a valid support, when compared to the Standard of Care as defined by MASCC (Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer) guidelines."
14,page_14,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 15 of 53 Forty women affected by breast cancer and forty men and/or wo men affec ted by head & neck cancer, planned to undergo postoperative or curative radiation treatment will be enrolled in this clinical investigation. 4. Risk and benefits of the investigational device and clinical investigat ion To date a large variety of products and methods for the prevention of acute radiation-induced skin react ions have been tested but there is not yet a gold-stan dard approach in the prevention and management of radiation dermatitis. Xonrid® is an EC-marked medical device that prevents and treats skin symptoms such as erythema, itching, burning sensati on and pruritus, induced by radiothera py or other causes, by restoring the physiological hydr ation levels of the affected skin ar eas. A previous experience on head & neck cancer patients has shown that Xonrid® is safe and well tolerated and is effective in reducing and dela ying high-grade radiation dermatitis. In this study subjects will be randomly allocated to Xonrid® + Standard of Care or Standard of Care alone. The Standard of Care that su bjects will be requested to follow is according to MASCC guidelines, that means evidence-based cli nical p ractice guidelines known and recognized worldwide. Subjects will receive their planned radiothera py treatment and will be constantly followed by clinicians. The study visits will be done every week. Partici pants will undergo a carefu l, frequent and accurate evaluation of their irradiated area equal if not better than what is the normal practice for subjects undergoing radiotherapy. In the case a subject allocated to the group “SOC alone” develops a G2 skin toxicity, an additional treatment will be introduced, ac cording to the Investigator’s opinion. Should a G3 skin toxicity develops the subject will immediately interrupt the study treatment a nd the study partic ipation. The Investigators will thereafter choose the best treatment for that subject. In the light of the above, no additional risk arising from the partici pation to this clinical investigation can be envisioned."

Design of the clinical investigat ion 6.1 General This is a monocenter, open label, randomized, standard of care controlled, post-marketing clinical investigation. Subjects will be randomly allocated to one of the following groups: - Group A: Xonrid® gel + standard of care (SOC) preemptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines; - Group B: standard of care (SOC) pre emptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines."
16,page_16,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 17 of 53 Both Groups will start treatments on the fi rst day of radiothera py and will go on until two weeks after the last radiotherapy session. Group B subjects will receive an additional stan dard treatment (according to Investigator’s opinion) at G2 skin toxicity development. All subjects will interrupt the treatment and the study in the case of G3 skin toxicity development. Should this occur, the subject will be treated according to the Investigator’s opinion. Each patient for whom written consent is obtained will be assigned a five-digit screening code, consisting of the cancer area (e.g. 01 = head & neck; 02= breast) and a progressive number within the site: for example the first subject screened f or head & neck cancer will be assigned the code 01-001, the second one 01-002 etc.; the first subject screened for breast cancer will be assigned the code 02-001, the second one 02-002 etc. All screened subjects will receive the code irrespective of whet her or not they will be randomized. If a subject discontinues from the study at any time, the code will not be re-used. All subjects who will sign the informed consent and receive the screening code will be ente red into a Subject’s Regi ster, containing the name and sur name of the patients and the date they have signed the consent form. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive the treatment ac cording to a randomization list. The patient randomization list will be generated by Latis S.r.l., using the PROC PLAN of SAS 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institu te Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Once eligibility of a patient is established ( see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) the study treatment will be assigned thro ugh cent ralized randomization system. The Investigator will also keep record of all enrol led patients in the Subject’s Enrolment Log: the subject screening number, the date of consent, the treatment assigned to the patient, if applicable, or the reas on for not being randomized will be recorded. 6.2 Investigational dev ice and co mparator 6.2.1 Xonrid® The product under investigation is Xonrid®.

Xonrid® is a short term use, Class IIa Medical Device, a topical gel designed for RT-induced dermatitis. When applied to the target skin areas, Xonrid® forms a protective film, reduces the trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL ) effect induced by external factors and increases moisturizing. The component responsible for the formation of this film is mainly Hyaluronic Acid, that also helps to achieve an optimal moisturizing effect. The other components responsible for the formation of this film are: polyacrylamide gluconolactone, and Xanthan gum. In particular, gluconolactone is a polyhydroxy acid, with a strong hygroscopic moisturizing power, as well as a glycerin effect. Moreover, the device includes swee t almond oil, known for its emo llient, softening, nourishing and soothing properties, and is particularly effective in the treatment of dry, reddened and sensitive skin areas. It promo tes the healing process by restoring the physiological hydration levels of the affected skin areas. It can be applied to the target areas including skin folds and creases, either presenting or not minor traumas or abrasions.

Instrumental RS measur ements will be performed at three different fixed regions within the area treated wi th RT, in any case only on flat skin regions and in absence of hair or nevus. A control measu rement will be done also in a specific contrala teral a rea. The trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) exam will be done at the same time-points as for the spett rophotometry exam, bef ore RT sessions. The exam will be conducted with Va poMeter instrument (by Delfin Technologies Ltd. – Finland).

Instrumental TEWL measurements will be performed at five different fixed regions within the area treated wi th RT, in any case only on flat skin regions and in absence of hair or nevus. A control measu rement will be done also in a sp ecific contrala teral a rea. 6.4.4 Skindex-16 questionnaire The Skindex-16 scale is a self -administered questionnaire to comprehensively measu re the c omplex effects of skin diseases on subject’s quality of life. The Skindex-16 measure is considered appropriate for a study since it has b een shown to be relia ble and valid for general skin disease. The Skindex-16 allows pat ient r ating of emotional and functional burdens that the CTCAE does not take into account5. These adverse events cause patient’s discomfort and impact negat ively on quality of life6. The Skindex-16 questionnaire will be completed by the subject at each visit. 6.4.5 Patient Global Satisfaction Global satisfact ion evaluation by the su bject will be assessed thro ugh a 5-point Likert scale (very poor, poor, medium, good, very good) at the end of the radiothera py sessions and two weeks after the last irradiation. 6.5 Mon itoring plan The study will be monitored on a regular basis by the CRO’s adequately qualified and trained clinical Monitors thro ughout the study period to ensure the proper conduct of the clinical Investigation. The purposes of study mon itoring are to verify that the rights and well-being of study subjects are protected, that t he reported study data are accu rate, complete and verifiable against the source documents, and that the study is conducted in accordance with the current clinical investigati on plan, Good Clinical Practi ce guideline (UNI EN ISO 14155) and applicable regulatory requirements."

If inconsistencies are identified, the corresponding corrections to the CRF data will have to be made by the Investigator or desi gnated per son. Monitors will also check subject compliance, accru al, study product handling, including dispensing procedures and accountability logs, delegat ion of res ponsibilities within the Investigator’s team, relevant commun icati ons with family doctors, if any, ancillary equipment and facilities, including refri gerators and freezers, local labs, etc. The Investigator and other site staff involved in the study must allocate enough time to the Monitor at these visits. Upon request by the Sponsor, on-site study audits may be conducted in order to ens ure the study is in compliance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements, and the clinical investigation plan. The auditing activities may also be conducted after study completion. The Investigator agrees to allow Sponsor/auditors/CRO monitors to have direct acc ess to his/her study records for review, being understood that they are bound by professional secrecy, and as such will not disclose any personal identity or per sonal medical information. Regulatory Authorities may wish to conduct on-site inspections (during the study or after its completion). If a Regulatory Authority notifies the Investigator of an inspection or visits the site unannounced for purposes of conducting an inspection, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor and CRO immediately. The Investigator will make all ef forts to facilitate the conduct of the audits and inspecti ons giving access to all nec essary faciliti es, da ta and documents. Any result or information ar ising from the inspection will be immediately communicated by the Investigator to the Sponsor. The Investigator will take all appropriate measu res required by the Sponsor to implement corrective actions for all p roblems found during audits or inspections. 7. Statist ical considerati ons This section su mmarizes the statistical principles and methods planned to analyze the data for this clinical investigat ion. 7.1 Sample Size Determination In a previous observational study11, 38.2% of the patients treated with SOC preemptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines did not reach G2 radiation dermatitis at week 5. In a pilot study using Xonrid® (Iacovelli et al. 2016, submitted), the proportion of patients treated with Xonrid® and SOC"
27,page_27,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 of 53 preemptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines that did not reach G2 radiation dermatitis at week 5 was 82.9%. According to these previous resu lts, a two group chi-square test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the differen ce between a proportion of patients that do not reach G2 of 38.2% in the Group B (standard of care (SOC) preemptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines) and a proportion of 82.9% in the Group A (Xonrid® and SOC preemptive treatment according to MASCC guidelines) when the sample size in each group is 18. To take into account a possible 10% dropout rate, 20 patients will be enrolled in each t reatment group. As two cancer sites will be investigated, to assess the treatment effect within each site, 80 patients will be enrol led: 40 patients with breast cancer and 40 patients with head a nd neck cancer. 7.2 Definition of Study Popu lations for Analysis The study will be analyzed using an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) approach. All randomized patients receiving at least a trea tment dose and having at lea st one post-randomization effica cy evaluation will be included in the ITT population for efficacy analysis. All randomized patients receiving at least a tre atment dose will be included in the safety analysis. 7.3 Stati stical Analysis Descriptive statistics of all relevant variables will be performed. Continuous variables will be summarized by the number of patients (N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum. Wh ere appropriate, 95% confidence intervals for the tar get variables will be estimated. Categ orical variables will be summarized by the number (N) and the proportion of pat ients (%). The significance level of statistical tests will be set at 0.05. Details of statistical analysis are provided in the f ollowing paragraphs. The statistical analysis will be performed us ing SAS 9.4 for Win dows (SAS Institu te Inc., Ca ry, NC, USA). 7.3.1 Missing Data Missing values will not be replaced u nless specif ied otherwise.

In case of clinically and statistical ly significant results, the exact p-value will be reported to support the strength of the findings. 7.3.3 Covariates, Interactions and Subgroups Due to the limited number of patients to be enrolled, c ovariates and subgroup analyses, if any, will be performed only with exploratory purposes. 7.3.4 Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Variables Demographic (ge nder, age) and baseli ne characteristics will be summarized using mean, median, stan dard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and frequencies and percentag es for categorical variables. To compare demographic and baseli ne characteristics between treatment groups, chi-square or t-tests will be used for discrete and continuous variable, respectively. 7.3.5 Efficacy analysis 7.3.5.1 Primary endpoint The prima ry objective of this clinical investigati on is to evaluate the proportion of patients without G2 radiation dermatitis (radiation dermatitis < G2) at week 5. The proportion of subjects will be compared between treatment groups using chi-square test. Logistic regression will be used to obtain Odds Ratio (OR), with 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI), and to eventu ally adjust for covariates. 7.3.5.2 Secondary endpoints The median time to G2 radiation dermatitis development will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method. Comparisons between treatment groups will be performed using log-rank test. The proportion of patients with out G2 radiation dermatitis at week 6 for both cancer sites, at week 7 for head & neck cancer and 2 weeks after the last radiation for both cancer sites will be asse ssed and compared between trea tment groups using chi-square test. Logistic regress ion will be used to obtain ORs, with 95% CIs, and to eventu ally adjust for covariates. The worst skin toxicity during treatment and until 2 weeks after the last radiation will be compared between treatment groups using ANOVA."

The ITA of the area treated with RT will be obtained averaging the ITA measured at the three different fixed regions, adjusted for the control measurement done in a specif ic contralateral area. Changes between visit 2, befo re the first RT session, and the end of RT and between the end of RT and the end of treatment will be analyzed and compared between treatment groups using ANCOVA, to adjust the estimates for baseline values. The changes in trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) will be graphically described reporting the Evaporation rate value (ERV, measured in g/m²h) throughout the study. The ERV of the area treated with RT will be obtained averaging the ERV measured at the five different fixed regions, adjusted for the control measu rement done in a specific contrala teral area. Changes between visit 2, before the first RT session, and the end of RT and between the end of RT and the end of treatment wi ll be analyzed and compared between treatment groups using ANCOVA, to adjust the estimates for baseline values. The mean a nd worst score of Skindex-16 questionnaire will be compared between treatment groups using ANCOV A, to adjust the estimates for baseline values. Both the number of daily product applications repo rted on the patien t’s diary and the amount of used product, estimated through the difference in tubes weight between delivery to patient and return, will be used to assess the compliance to experimental trea tment. The consistency between the t wo asses sments will be checked through linear regress ion. The patien ts’ global satisfaction with treatment, assessed by Likert scale, will be compared between treatment groups usi ng Kruskal -Wall is test. 7.3.6 Safety analysis All randomized p atients receiving at least a treatment dose will be included in the safety analysis. Adverse events will be coded using the last updated version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activit ies (MedDR A) dictionary to give a preferred term (PT) and a system/organ class term (SOC) for each event. The number of patients who experie nced at least one AE, study product-related AE, serious AE, s evere AE a nd the n umber of patients withdrawn due to AE will be summarized by treatment arm. For each SOC and preferred term, summaries will be made with respect to the proportion of patients having at least one occur rence of that event during the trial and the total number of events. The incidence of AEs in each treatment arm will be presented overall, by SOC and prefer red term, and additional grouping by severity and relationship to the trial treatment.

Data manag ement During each study visit, the study Investigator (or designee) will collect and report study data in the relevant patient’s chart, documenti ng all significant observations. Any contact with the patient via telephone or other means that provides significant clinical in formation shall be documented in the source data. An Electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF) will be used to record patient’s study data. The Investigator will maintain a list of all persons aut horized to make entr ies and/or corrections on the CRFs. Each a uthorized person will be provided with a user-specific ID protected by a renewab le passw ord. Data entries and corrections will be made only by the authori zed persons. The e-CRF system will record date and time of any entry and /or correction and the user ID of the person making the entr y/correction. The system will keep track of all old and new values (audit trail). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the CRFs are properly and completely filled in. The CRFs must be completed for all subjects who have been included in the study. The Investigat or will review all CRFs and electronically sign and date them for each subject, verifying that the information is complete, true and correct. All fields on the CRF must be completed as applicable. Subjects will be provided with paper questionnaires. Such documents will be filled by the subjects during the stu dy visits, to record data concerni ng their skin condition. It is responsibility of the Investigators to instruct the study partici pants on how to fill in questionnaires in a clear way and preferably in black ball-point pen. The questionnaires will be anonymous, each subject is identified through the subject screening number. A copy of all questionnaires will be stored in patient ’s chart. It is res ponsibility of the Investigators to correctly enter the data collected on the questionnaires in the relevant sections of the e-CRF. Questionnaires will be considered source data. Checks to assist during the data entry and to assess the appropriateness and consisten cy of data will be developed on the e-CRF system. E-CRF p ages will be reviewed both on site by the monitor of the center and remotely, by the data management staff of the CRO.

The subject must be made aware that he/she may refuse to join the stu dy or may with draw his/her consent at any time without prejudicing further medical care and that he/she is covered by the Sponsor's indemnity insurance in the event of a study related injury. Subjects must also know that their personal medical records may be reviewed in confidence by the Sponsor's staff or representatives a nd by Regulatory Authority and IEC and that personal information will be collected and retained in a confidential database. Consent will always be given in writi ng after the subject has had adequate time to review the information and ask questions, if need be. The signed form will be reviewed by the study Monitor. 14. Adverse events, adverse device effects and devices deficienc ies 14.1 Definitions Adverse Event (AE) Any undesira ble experience occur ring to a su bject, whether or not it is considered causally related to the investigati onal medical device. An AE may be a clinical finding, a clinical laboratory abnormality or a symptomatic complaint which is considered by the Investigator to be outside the normal variation for that pa rameter. Adverse Device Eff ect (ADE) Any untoward and unintended respo nse to a medical device. This includes any event resulti ng from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device and any event that is a result of a user error."
34,page_34,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 53 Device De ficiency Inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identit y, quality, durability, safety or performance (included malfunctions, use errors and inadequate labelling). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event (SAE) could be any event that suggests a si gnificant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or preca ution. The seriousness of an AE relates to its clinical si gnificance and its potential impact on health. An AE will be considered as serious when: Lead to death Lead to serious deterioration in the health of the s ubject, that either results i n: a. a life -thre atening illness or injury, or b. a per manent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or c. in-patient or prolonged h ospitalization, or d. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a b ody structure or a body function Lead to foetal d istress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defe ct. Serious Adverse Device Ef fect (SADE) Adverse device effect that has resu lted in any of the consequences characterist ic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstan ces had been less opportune. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effe ct (USADE) Serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identif ied in the risk analysis report. 14.2 Adve rse Event Int ensity/Causality The Investigat or, based on his direct observation or on subjects' rep ort, will record the event according to the current version of CTCAE: Grade 1 (Mild): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;"

Grade 2 (Mode rate): minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicate d; limiting age-appropriate instrumental daily life activities. Grade 3 (Severe): medically significant but not immediately life-thre atening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicate d; disabling; limiting self -care daily life activities. Grade 4 (Life-threatening consequen ces): urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to AE. The relationship of any AE to the p roduct will be classified by the Investigator as follows: Description Definition Certain The AE is clear ly related to the stu dy product Probable The AE is likely related to the study product Possible The AE may be related to the study product Unlikely The AE is unlikely related to the study product None The AE is clear ly not related to the study product Unknown Causality is not assessab le, for one reason or anot her, e.g. becau se of insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor documentation 14.3 Adve rse Eve nt, Device Deficiency, Adverse Devi ce Effect reporting The investigator will report to the Sponsor any AEs, Device Deficiencies and ADEs concerni ng the medical device occur ring during the study. He/She will also co-operate with the Sponsor in connection with the reporti ng of any SADE to the Competent Authority and to the In depen dent EC, if applicable. All AEs regardless of severity occur ring between recruitment and completion of the study by a subject must be recorded on the AE form provided with the CRF. If there is a significant worsening of a medical condition that was prese nt before starti ng the study, this should be considered as a new AE and a complete evaluation recorded. Signs and symptoms considered as lack of effica cy and occurring during the study will not be recorded on the AEs Section of the CRF except on the condition that, in the Investigator’s opinion, these signs and symptoms are caused by any reason different from lack of efficacy of the study product or meet the definition of serious AE."
36,page_36,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 37 of 53 In the event of a SADE/SAE the Investigator has to: ▪ Complete the relevant CRF pages and a reporting form with the all available in itial information, ▪ Immediately inform the CRO by telep hone, ▪ Fax the completed report form to the contact person at the CRO or to the Sponsor as soon as possible. SAE/SADE reporting contacts are on page 4 of this Clinical I nvestigati on Plan. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the follow-up of any subject who experiences an S AE/SADE during the study. The investigat or must re-examine the subject at regular intervals until the symptoms have completely disappeared or stab ilized. 15. Vulner able population This section is not applicable, since no subject belonging to any vulnerable population will be recru ited for participating in th is study. 16. Suspension or premature terminati on of the clinical investig ation Unless premature interruption occurs, the end of the study will be the closure visit at the clinical site. 16.1 Study Discontinuation Subjects may be discontinued at any time from the study for any of the following reas ons: ➢ Grade ≥ 3 skin toxicity develops ➢ An AE occurs that, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes it unsafe for the subject to continue in the study, included la boratory test abnormalities evaluation ➢ Lack of compliance of the subject to the study treatment or assessments ➢ The subject is lost to follow-up ➢ The subject dies ➢ The subject withdraws consent"

If a subject is discontinued fr om the study, the Investigator will, as far as possible, complete the end of study visit (visit 9 or 10) CRF pages. The Investigator should try to ascertain the reason(s) for with drawa l, while fully respe cting the subject’s rights. 16.2 Study Interruption The Sponsor may consider study closure at the clinical site if the following occur s: ➢ serious and/or persi stent non-compliance with the Clinical I nvestigati on Plan ➢ inadequate collaboration of site personnel with CRO/Sponsor ➢ administrat ive reasons ➢ non-compliance with GCP, SOPs or regulatory requirements ➢ lack of confidentia lity and/or non-compliance with the contract spread with the Sponsor. 17. Publication policy All information obtained as a resu lt of the study will be regarded as confidentia l. The results of the clinical study will be documented in an integrated clinical study report according to ISO 14155. The Sponsor and the Investigator(s) agree that no publicati ons presenting or discussing data and/o r resu lts from clinical study sponsored by Helsinn Healthcare SA will take place until the partici pating cent er has completed the study, the data h ave been interpreted, and the final re port has been issued. As a rule, the Sponsor is free to use the data collected in the spons ored study for world-wide scientif ic product documentat ion, and for publication. In general, the Sponsor has no objections if the Investigator publishes the resu lts of the study sponsored by Helsi nn Healthcare SA. However, the Investigator is requested to provide the Sponsor with a copy of the manuscript for review before submitting it to the publisher with a cover letter informing the Sponsor about the intention to publish the study results. When permission for presentation or for publicat ion is granted, Investigators, prior to submission of a manuscript or abstract to the publisher, shall forward a copy of said manuscript or abstract to the Sponsor who shall have 45 days to request any reasonable amendment ther eto, which shall be t aken into due account and consideration by the Investigator."

Costs for publication must be regulated by written agreement between the part ies. For multicent er studies, the Investigators who will be quoted as authors of the publicati on(s) should be agreed upon with the Sponsor. If publicati on of the resu lts of the study, either in part or in full, is prepared by the Sponsor, the Investigator(s) will be provided with a copy of the manuscript before the submission to the publisher and asked to give approval of the document. Investigators will be asked in writi ng if he/she accepts to be included as author of the publicati on. Answers should be sent in writing to the Sponsor within a reasonable time limit (30 days). If no answer is received, it is assumed that the Investigator agrees to the Sponsor’s proposal."

The World Medical Associat ion (WMA) has developed the Declarat ion of Helsinki as a statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, i ncluding research on identif iable human material and data. The Declar ation is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 2. Consistent with the mandate of the W MA, the Declar ation is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA enc ourages others who are involved in medical res earch i nvolving human su bjects to adopt these principles. General Principles 3. The Declar ation of Gene va of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first considerati on,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician sha ll act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care .” 4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeg uard the health, well-being and rights of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowled ge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving hum an subjects. 6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions"
48,page_48,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 53 (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually thro ugh research for their sa fety, effectiveness, efficien cy, accessibility and quality. 7. Medical research is su bject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respe ct for all human subjects and protect their health a nd rights. 8. While the prima ry purpose of medical research is to genera te new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and intere sts of individual research su bjects. 9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self-determination, privacy, and confidentia lity of personal information of resear ch subjects. The res ponsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 10. Physicia ns must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and stan dards for res earch involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the pr otections for research subjects set forth in th is Declar ation. 11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the environment. 12. Medical research involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualificati ons. Research on patients or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional. 13. Groups that are underrepre sented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to partici pation in research. 14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or thera peutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patien ts who serve as research subjects. 15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a resu lt of participating in research must be ensured. Risks, Burdens and Benefits 16. In medical p ractice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the ri sks and burdens to the research subjects. 17. All medical research involving human subjects must be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with"
49,page_49,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 of 53 foreseeable benef its to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation. Measur es to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, assess ed and documented by the researcher. 18. Physicia ns may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfac torily managed. When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benef its or when the re is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the study. Vulnerable Groups and Individuals 19. Some groups and individuals are partic ularly vulnerable and may have an increa sed li kelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm. All vulnerable groups and individuals sh ould receive specifical ly considered p rotection. 20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is respo nsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this group should stand to benefit from the knowled ge, practices or interventions that resu lt from the research. Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols 21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to general ly accepted scienti fic principles, be based on a th orough knowled ge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected. 22. The design and performance of each research stu dy involving human subjects must be clear ly described and justif ied in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in th is Declar ation have been addressed. The protocol shou ld include information regarding funding, spon sors, institut ional aff iliations, potential c onflicts of interest, incent ives for subjects and information reg arding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post-trial provisions. Rese arch Ethics Committees 23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be indepen dent of the researcher, the spon sor and any other undu e influence"
50,page_50,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 of 53 and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and stan dards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declarati on. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especial ly information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without considerati on and approval by the committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. Privacy and Confidentiality 24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the confidentia lity of their personal information. Informed Consent 25. Partici pation by individuals capable of giving i nformed consent as subjects in medical research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or community leaders, no individual ca pable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research stu dy unless he or she freely agrees. 26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, institutional aff iliations of the re searcher, the anticipated benef its and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entai l, post-study provisions and any other relevant aspects of the study. The potential su bject must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to with draw consent to partici pate at any time with out reprisal. Special attention should be given to the specif ic information needs of individual potential subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed consent, preferab ly in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writi ng, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnes sed. All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study. 27. When seeking informed consent for partici pation in a research study the physician must be partic ularly cautious if the potential subject is in a depen dent relat ionship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by an appropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this rel ationship. 28. For a potential re search subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised rep resentative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote"
51,page_51,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 53 the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the research cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entai ls only minimal risk and minimal burden. 29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is able to give assent to decisions about partici pation in research, the physician must seek that asse nt in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be resp ected. 30. Research involving su bjects who are physically or mental ly incapable of giving consent, for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such circumstances t he physician must seek informed consent from the legal ly authorised repre sentati ve. If no such representative is available and if the research ca nnot be delayed, the study may proceed with out informed consent provided that the specif ic reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics co mmittee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the s ubject or a legal ly authorised representative. 31. The physician must fully inform the patient which as pects of their care are related to the researc h. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the pat ient’s decision to with draw from the stu dy must never adversely affect the patient-physician relationship. 32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. T here may be exceptional situ ations where consent would be impossible or impractica ble to obtain for such research. In such situat ions the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics co mmittee. Use of Placebo 33. The benefit s, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances: Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is accepta ble; or Where for compelling and scientif ically sound methodological reasons the use of any intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is necessary to determine the effica cy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible ha rm as a resu lt of not receiving the best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. Post-Trial Provisions"
52,page_52,"CIP HD01-16-30 Versi on 1.0, 06/02/2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 of 53 34. In advance of a clinical trial, spon sors, researchers and host country governm ents should make provisions for post-trial ac cess for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to partici pants during the informed consent process. Rese arch Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results 35. Every research study involving hum an subjects must be registered in a publicly accessib le datab ase before recruitment of the fir st subject. 36. Researche rs, authors, spon sors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the r esults of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the resu lts of their research on human subjects and are accountable for the completeness and accu racy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive resu lts must be published or otherw ise made publicly available.
