Patients who prematurely discontinue trial medication will perfor m EOT visit and Follow Up visit, and then continue with scheduled visits until the trial is stopped. For patients not willing to attend scheduled visits, telephone call smust be made regularly (ref. Section 3.3.4.1 ) to document any occurrence of outcome events and vital status. If the trial continues beyond 148 weeks, visitsare to be repeat ed with same intervals as from week 64 and onwards. 3 Timepoint for the EOT will be communicated via an Investigator letter when the Sponsor is confident that required number of events will be reached within a reasonable timeframe (ref. Section 3.1 and 6.2.3 ). All patients will have a follow up visit 30 days following regular or premature completion of the treatment period. 4 Visit dates are determined per the date of randomisation. If a visit is missed, the patient should be returned to the original visit schedule at the next visit. 5 NF = non fasting, F=fasting. Fasting means no food or liquid intake except for water the last 10 -16hours 6 All v isit 1 procedures shou ld be performed within 28days of signing the informed consent form (ICF) 7 If accepted by local authorities or ethic committees, d emographics to be collected in this trial are gender, year of birth , ethnicity and race. 8 The Investigator will be asked to record results from clinical routine examinations like ECG, echocardiography or similar procedures (MRI, CT -scan, etc.) , and if applicable information gathered from interrogation sof the ICD, in the eCRF 9 Vital signs measurements in this trial are blood pressure and pulse rate. 10 Protocol specified outcome events should be collected on the appropriate eCRF page. Exempt ions from reporting on the SAE form are specified in Section 5.3.7. 11 For patients with non -fatal stroke the Modified Rankin Scale should be scored by the investigator based on an interview at the next regular on -site visit after the onset of the stroke. In those cases where MRS assessment occurred within 90 days after the stroke, a repeat MRS-assessment should be performed at the next on-site visit. For patients who experience a non -fatal stroke less than 90 days prior to the study closure date, the final MRS assessment will occu r at the final study visit for that patient. 12 For the 12 -lead ECG done at the screeening andEOT visit, the interpretation of the tracing must be made locally by a qualified physician or appropriately qualified designee and documented on the ECG section of the eCRF. In case of any cardiac symptoms (indicating rhythm disorders or cardiac ischaemia), additional 12-lead ECG(s) should be done to document a potential outcome event. 13 For female patients of child -bearing pote ntial, local urine pregnancy test should be performed according to the Flow Chart . More frequent testing should be performed if required by local regulations/authorities. 14 For the screening Visit 1, the safety laboratory is limited to liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine and haematology . Patients do not have to be fasting. 15 HbA1c to be analysed in all patients, e.g. diabetics and non -diabetics. 16 For PK analysis ,one blood sample will be collected prior to the next scheduled dose of trial medication at Visit 4, and between 22 to 26 h after the most recent drug intake . 17 Collection of biobanking samples (plasma, serum, urine, DNA) is optional. Participating patients are required to give informe d consent specifically for biobanking . Samples will be stored at a biobanking facility for future research. 18 DNA biobanking requires only one blood sample to be taken, preferably at Visit 2 (Randomisation). However, collection at late r visits is permitted a s long as the informed consent for biobanking remains valid. 19 At all visits; the respective kit number has to be allocated to the patient via IRT . Trial medication should betaken after all trial related procedures are completed at an on -site visit ."

HF is a prevalent disease affecting an estimated 26 million people worldwide. In the United States alone the prevalenc eis 5.7 million, and there are 670,000 new cases per y ear [R16- 1527] . HF is associated with premature mortality and frequent hospitalisation . Approximately 50% of patients who develop HF die within 5 y ears after diagnosis [ P16-03952] . Annually , more than 1 million patients are hospitali sed with a primary diagnosis of HF. HF is the most common cause of hospitalisation among individuals above 65 y ears of age in the western countries [P16-03760]. Two ty pes of HF have been defined mainly based on the LV ejection fraction (EF) and also other structural changes in heart muscle. They consist of heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF) <40% and heart failure with pres erved EF (HFpEF) ≥40%. Relative prevalence of HFrEF among HF patients is approximately 50% [R16-1528 ]. Amongst patients with HF who require hospitalisation , the proportion of HFpEF is rising. The rate of rehospitalisation among patients with HFrEF is close to 29% within 60 -90 day s ofdischarge from hospital [P16- 03760] . Despite advances in therapy and management, HF remains a deadl y clinical sy ndrome. After HHF , the one y earmortality rate is high and not different between patients with preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) [R16-2217 ], underscoring a high unmet medical need in this population. About 25 to 45% of patients with HF have concomitant ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and nearl y 15-25 % hasborderline diabetes (pre -diabetes), indicating a potential link between the HF s yndromes and glucometabolic disturbances [R16-2382 , R16 -2384]. Desp ite the current standard of care for treatment of HFrEF such as medical therapy [angiotensin- converting enzy me (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) , ivabradine and angiotensin receptor blocker -neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) ] or device therapy the mortalit y and morbidity remains high in HF patients .For HFpEF, however, control of congestive s ymptoms during acute episodes is the mainstay of management of these patients and no class of drugs have shown to increase survival or reduce hospitalisations for HF (HHF) [ P16-03760, P16-05920]. Empagliflozin is an orally available inhibitor of the renal dependent glucose co -transporter 2 (SGL T-2) indicated for, reduction of blood glucose in patients with T2DM by promoting urinary glucose excretion. I t also reduces blood pressure, arterial stiffness and measures of the my ocardial work load, likely through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CV risk factors (uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminuria) [ P15- 00589, P15 -09541]. In 2010 Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) initiated theEMPA -REG OUTCOME trial to explore CV benefit of the drug as well as to establish the safety profile of empagliflozin [P15-09840]. This trial completed in 2015 and showed empagliflozin, when given in addition to standard care treatment in high CV risk patients with T2DM, reduces the risk of 3 -point MACE by"

Furthermore this trial demonstrated reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV death or hospitalisation for heart failure (H HF)” and HHF by 34%. Consistent with the main results of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial , in approximately 10% of the trial population who had investigator -reported heart failure at baseline, empagliflozin showed significant reduction in CV death, HHF, and comp osite of “HHF or CV death” [P16- 01253 ]. DRUG PROFILE 1.2 Empagliflozin is an orally available, potent, and selective inhibitor of the renal SGLT -2. Its selective inhibition reduces renal reabsorption of sodium and glucose. This leads to both increased urinary sodium and glucose excretion. While urinary sodium excretion returns to normal within few day s of empagliflozin administration, the effect on urinary glucose continues Empagliflozin has been developed for the treatment of T2DM, and has received marketing approval in various regions including ,for example ,the European Union , Latin America n countries , USA and Japan where it is marketed under the brand name Jardiance®. For a more detailed description of the drug profile p lease refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) [ c01678844-06 ] and local prescribing information for empagliflozin . 1.2.1 Non-clinical assessment of safety For further information regarding pre -clinical evaluation, please refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin. 1.2.2 Clinical pharmacokinetics In humans, empagliflozin predominantly showed linear pharmacokinetic (PK). Empagliflozin reaches peak levels at approximately 1.5 hours and showed a biphasic decline with t he terminal elimination half- life of 12.4 hours ranging from 10 to 19 hours. Empagliflozin exposure increases with renal or hepatic impairment; however, no dose adjustment is recommended as the observed changes in exposure were not clinically meaningful. N o clinically relevant PK interactions were observed with other oral antidiabetics, warfarin, verapamil, ramipril, simvastatin, digoxin, hy drochlorothiazide, torasemide, emfibrozil, rifampicin, probenecid and oral contraceptives (Microgynon®). For further details refer to the current version of the IB for empagliflozin. 1.2.3 Clinical efficacy and safety Approximately 550 healthy volunteers were exposed to empagliflozin (up to 800 mg single dose and up to 50 mg multiple dosing). Approximately 8500 patients with T2DM have been treated with empagliflozin in research studies, of which approximately 4400 have been treated for m ore than 52 weeks. Also, empagliflozin was tested in over 4600 patients with T2DM and high CV risk for median treatment duration of 2.6 y ears."

I t ended in 2015 after accruing the minimum prespecified 691 major adverse CV events. Empagliflozin was associated with significant risk reduction of all -cause mortality by 32% ( HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57, 0.82 p<0.0001) and CV de ath b y 38% ( HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.49, 0.77, p value <0.0001). In addition, the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed reduction in the prespecified and adjudicated composite outcome of “CV death or HHF” b y 34% ( HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.55, 0.79, p value <0.0001). This result was consistent across various predefined sensitivity anal ysis and internal consistency was confirmed by showing overall homogeneit y over a wide range of subgroups, including patients with and without history of HF at baseline. There was no significant diff erence in improving CV outcomes between the 10 and 25 mg dose. The Phase III studies in T2DM showed that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of HbA1c up to1%, body weight reduction between 2 -3 kg, and a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 3 - 5 mmHg compared with placebo. This was consistently observed with empagliflozin as monotherap y, add on to metformin, metformin and sulphony lurea, pioglitazone with or without metformin, and to ba sal insulin with metformin and/or sulphony lurea. Phase III studies up to 104 weeks in T2DM support the sustained effect of empagliflozin. In clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in both healthy volunteers and patients with T2DM including patients with high CV risk up to a median duration of 2.6 y ears. The frequency of overall AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and serious Adverse E vents (SAEs) were comparable to placebo. There was no significant increase in frequency of hypoglycaemia with emp agliflozin compared to placebo except when used in combination with a sulphony lurea or basal insulin. I n general there was a small increase in frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) compared to placebo. There was an increase in frequency of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. There was a small increa se in total cholesterol, low -densit y lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -densit y lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and no significant changes in trigl ycerides. No changes in electroly tes were observed with empagliflozin. In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial renal function over time , as measured by the eGFR, is shown in Figure 1.2.3:1 [P16- 06807 ]. After the initial decrease, eGFR remained stead y in the empagliflozin group and was reversed after the cessat ion of the trial medication (Figure 1.2.3 :2). At the follow -up visit, the adjusted mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline in the eGFR with each of the two doses of empagliflozin was 4.7 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 (95% confidence interval, 4.0 to 5.5; P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Figure 1.2.3:2 ).This data indicated that the initial drop in eGFR after administration of empagliflozin is reversible and most likely due to hemody namic carnages. This is very similar to what have been observed with ACEi and ARBs. The EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial also generated the h ypothesis that the expected deterioration in renal function in patients with T2DM slowed down after using empagliflozin, and thi s will be further tested in the HF trials using the eGFR slope analy sis and composite renal endpoints ( see Section 5.1.2 and 5.1.3)"

In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial a similar reduction in CV risk was observed in the subgroup of patients with different degree of renal impairment, including patients with eGFR between >45-60and >30- 45mL/min/1.73 m2. 2RATIONALE, OBJECTIVES, AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL 2.1 Heart failure is an important public health problem, and one of the leading causes of hospitalisation in the Western countries. With the increasingl y aging population and increasing incidence of obesity , the scope and cost to society associated with this condition will progressively rise. There is anunmet medical need in treatment of patients with HF, despite available therapies for HFrEF, outcomes remain suboptimal with increase rate of rehospitalisation and high mortality rate [ P16-03760]. HF also significantly decreases health - related qualit y of life (HRQOL) and pharmacological therapies have not shown consistent improvement in HRQOL. Empagliflozin improves survival in patients with high cardiovascular risk by mechanisms which go bey ond the blood glucose lowering effect. There was no heterogeneity by baseline HbA1c categories inHHF or “CV death and HHF” risk reduction in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial. Empagliflozin exerts its glucose lowering effect b y preventing sodium and glucose reabsorption. The initial natriuresis will be compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubulo -glomerular feedback. However, the glucosuria lasts as long as the medication is use d. This leads to consequent hemod ynamic changes associated with a modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, reduction in oxidative stress, and decrease in heart rate( HR) xPressure product, a measure of m yocardial oxy gen consumption, with no increase in HR and no effect on sympathetic nerve activity [P15-00589, P15 -09541 ]. Of note, the effect of empagliflozin on improving CV outcomes is evident even at low urinary glucose excretion demonstrated in those with low HbA1c as well as in those with reduced renal function (i.e. eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). Subgroup anal ysis of theEMPA -REG OUTCOME trial showed no difference in patients with baseline HbA1c <7%, 7 to 8%, 8 to 9%, or >9% for CV death or HHF risk reduction. In addition, patients who had no HbA1c change or only modest change up to 0.2% throughout the trial have shown to have a similar risk reduction of HHF as the patients with at least 0.3% or higher reduction in HbA1c. Also as noted changes in BP reduction and hemod ynamic changes were preserved in patients with CKD4, despite loss of glycaemic efficacy . Lack of correlation between CV outcome improvement and blood glucose levels provides supporting evidence that the benefit of empagliflozin in HHF or CV death risk reduction should also be expected in patients withou t diabetes [ P16-01253, c09670340, c11764168 ]. The beneficial CV effects of empagliflozin cannot be explained by the modest glucose control achieved in the EMPA -REG OUTCOM Etrial. Other outcome"

It should be noted that in a mechanistic trialnon-diabetic subjects showed metabolic changes such as glucosuria, increase in endogenous glucose production, and substrate shift from glucose to lipid oxidation similar to those observed in patients with T2DM after one dose and up to 4 weeks of dail y administration of empagliflozin [P16-01830]. Furthermore, in a trial of healthy volunteers, empagliflozin 10 mg resulted in approximately 50 g glucosuria per day [P13-04190] . This amount of glucose excretion is similar to what had been observed in patients with eGFR between 30 -60 mL /min 1.73 m2 (CKD3) which wasclose to 55 g glucosuria per day . In the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, patients with CKD3 showed a trend for the CV death or HHF risk reduction very similar to the risk reduction in the main cohort and in patients with CKD2 and 1 . While the higher level of glucosuria is associated with a higher HbA1c reduction and better gl ycaemic control, this correlation is lacking for the CV benefits associated with empagliflozin, and in fact a lower glucose excre tion similar to what has been observed in patients with CKD3 or in healthy volunteer sseems to be sufficient to improve the CV outcomes. Therefore, the expected benefit of empagliflozin such as BP reduction, weight loss, improvement in arterial stiffness, and hemod ynamic changes, as well as CV benefits seen in patients with T2DM is also speculated to be seen in HF patients without DMand in patients with CKD3 and 4 .These findings further support the rationale of exploring the effect of empagliflozin bey ondDM.Although the t ype of HF was not assessed entering the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, it is highl y likely in this trial both patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction were included, considering the high prevalence of both HFrEF and HFpEF in patien ts with DM [R16-1529]. The modes of action described above, and beneficial effect in patients with history of HF in the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial, further supports the scientific rationale of performing this trialto explore the effect of empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF . TRIAL OBJECTIVES 2.2 The objective of this event -driven trial is to demonstrate superiorit y of empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo on top of guideline- directed medical therapy in patients with sy mptomatic , chronic HF and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%). For further description of trialendpoints and statistical anal ysis, please refer to Section 5 and 7. This trial is part of an investigational clinical trial program of empagliflozin inpatients with chronic HF . Atrial to investigate the efficacy and safet y inpatients with preserved E F (LVEF > 40%) is ongoing in parallel. BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSMENT 2.3 The overall benefits and safe profile of empagliflozin have been outlined in previous sections. A pharmacologic rationale for the use of empagliflozin in HF can be found in Section 1.1. In this trial, the effect of empagliflozin will be evaluated in HF patients. DM is known to be a frequent and clinicall y important co -morbidity in HF patients. To evaluate this important co -"

Special safet y considerations are required for patients with T1DM, and several safet y monitoring strategies will be employ ed, including training of investigators and education of patients on the risk and prevention strategies for ketoacidosis, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) . Since a nSGLT -2 inhibitor may alter the t ypical presentation of this condition, T1DM patients will receive a home monitoring device to measure blood ketones and a diary for patient s torecord their blood glucose, ketone values and insulin intake. Patients with T1DM will also be required to carry a trial information card which includes information about the possible altered presentation of ketoacidosis to be presented to health care professionals should the patient be seen in an urgent care setting. For further details refer to Section 4.2.1. As outlined above, inclusion of patients who do not have diabetes is also allowed in this trial. Ithas been shown in healthy volunteers dosing with empagliflozin results in gl ycosuria summing up to about 2/3 the average glucosuria in patients with T2DM. This is similar to the amount of glucose lost in T2DM subjects with moderate renal impairment. Because in the EMPA REG Outcome study no difference in CV benefit was detected for patients with renal impairment vs the overall population, it is hy pothesized that this amount of glucosuria is not the main factor to obtain CV effects with em pagliflozin. There are no long -term safet y data for empagliflozin in patients without diabetes. Data in non-diabetic subjects is limited to healthy volunteers, without significant co -morbidities or concomitant medications. Exposure in healthy volunteer s is from single dose and multiple dose studies with exposure up to 28 day s . However, while limited, such data does include over 500 health y volunteers exposed to empagliflozin during the clinical development for treatment of T2DM. No specific safet y con cern was identified and no occurance of symptomatic hy pogly caemia was detected [U12- 2707-01] . It is noted that in patients with T2DM, the risk of h ypogly caemia was only increased with empagliflozin compared to the placebo group in patients who were concomitantl y treated with insulin or a sulfony lurea. Further, in a mechanistic study [c11963611-01] , subjects without DM were shown to increase endogenous glucose production in response to glucosuri a after administration with empagliflozin. As a result, blood glucose levels remained in the normal range for these individuals [P16-01830] . Therefore it isscientifically reasonable to hy pothesize that in non - diabetic patien ts, with no medical indication for insulin or sulfony lurea treatment that the risk of hy poglycaemia associated with empagliflozin treatment would be lower than in patients with T2DM . Because of the mode of action, blockade of the SGLT -2 with consequent glucosuria, is the same in patients with and without diabetes, although to different degree , it is considered likely that the tolerability of empagliflozin in non- diabetic patients may be no less favourable in patients with T2DM. There is also currentl y limited therapeutic experience with empagliflozin in patient aged 85 years and older. The prevalence of chronic heart failure increases with age and the therapeutic options in the elderl y above 85 years are limited. The inclusion of this population"

Special caution should be used in these patients, who may be at increased risk of adverse consequences attributed to empagliflozin - related volume depletion. Many patients with chronic HF have renal impairment, and to ensure that the trial results reflect this population, patients with eGFR ≥20 ml/min/1.73m2can be included. In the EMPA -REG Outcome trial, the cardiovascular benefits of empa gliflozin were not driven b y its pharmacological effect of lowering blood glucose and were consistentl y noted in patients with different degrees of renal impairment, including patients with eGFR between > 30 and < 45ml/min/1.73m2. In previous trials in p atients with T2DM, the safet y profile in moderate and severe renal impairment was comparable to the overall trial population [P17-10453] . Renal safet y will be closely monitored throughout the trial. Refer to Sections 5.3.4.1 and 5.3.7 .1. The overall tolerability and safet y profile outlined in Section 1.2 , and the current IB, supports chronic administration of empagliflozin 10 mg in human studies. Investigators will be encouraged to treat participants to best standard of care in compliance with the local guidelines and recommendations for HF, and diabetes if present. Based on the putative mechanism of actions ( reviewed in Section 2.1) and the result of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial it is assumed that patients with HFrEF should benefit from empagliflozin treatment on top of guideline -directed therapies. The safet y profile of empagliflozin in these patients should follow a similar trend which was previously observed in over 10000 patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin, including patients with high CV risk. Safety will be ensured b y close monitoring of the subjects f or AEs both clinically and b y laboratory testing. To continue the assessment of the long- term safety of empagliflozin, adjudication of cardiovascular events , certain hepatic events ,and ketoacidosis will be performed in this trial. The progress of the tri al will also be assessed at regular intervals by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). For further details please refer to Section 3.1.1 . One i nterim anal ysis is planned after approximately 500 prim ary event shave been accrued. If the prespecified criteria for stopping for success at the interim anal ysis has been reached, the Executive Steering Committee ( ExSC)and the Sponsor will be informed. The final decision whether to stop the trial will be made b y Sponsor. For further details refer to Section 7. 4. As with all drugs, the potential for h ypersensitivity and allergic reactions has to be taken into consideration when empagliflozin is administered. O ther risks to the patients are the risks inherent to an y investigational medicinal product used in a clinical trial setting, such as unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory events. Empagliflozin causes intravascular volume contraction. In patients with volume depletion, correcting this condition prior to initiation of empagliflozin is recommended. Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is under constant surveillance by the Sponsor and regulators. Therefore, this trial requires tim ely detection, evaluation, and"

Figure 3.1: 1 Trial design Patients are included in the trialonce they have signed the informed consent form (ICF) . All patients suitable after screening and who still meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria when returning for Visit 2 approximately 1-3 weeks later will be randomised into one of the treatment groups in a 1:1 manner. Randomisation will be stratified with respect to geographical regio n (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and “O ther”) , history of diabetes (diabetes, prediabetes, no diabetes) and eGFR at screening CKD -EPI (<60 mL/min/1.73 m², >= 60mL /min/1.73 m²). The trial is event -driven and all randomised patients will remain in the trial until the defined number of adjudicated primary endpoint event s has been reached. Estimated trialduration is 38 months with a recruitment period of approximately 18 months. The actual l ength of the recruitment period may be extended bey ond 18 months and the follow -up period may be adjusted to achieve the 841 confirmed primary outcome events. The estimated total trial duration and length of the double-blind treatment for each patient wil l vary accordingl y.The total number of randomised patients may be adapted based on assessment of the blinded event rate. If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slower accrual of primary outcome events over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 4000. Operationall y, the recruitment period would be extended and could continue up to 6 months before the target number of events is expected to be achieved. The number of primary outcome event s required is not affected by this consideration. For further details refer to Section 7.7.

DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF CONTROL 3.2 GROUP( S) A variet y of medications have been tested in patients with HFrEF with beneficial effect in morbidity and mortality . The aim of this trialis to recruit patients with HFrEF on various HF background therapies to evaluate the long term effect of empagliflo zin on CV death and HHF in a real life clinical setting. Due to its mode of action empagliflozin should be efficacious in treating patients with HF and could provide additional efficacy in combination with any given background therapy . The placebo -control led design is considered ethically acceptable on the basis of appropriate criteria for patient discontinuation, ability to change background therapy to maintain, or obtain, sufficient level of hemody namic control as defined in relevant local and regional guidelines for optimised standard of care. The double -blind treatment period is planned until the necessary number of events is observed to evaluate efficacy of empagliflozin compared to standard of care. The 30 day s follow -up period is considered to be suf ficient for assessment of adverse events and efficacy outcomes after stopping trial medication . Patients should be receiving appropriate care as defined b y their ph ysician or practitioner for all cardiovascular conditions according to the prevailing guidelines . This includes, but isnot limited to ,(if indicated and not contraindicated) aspirin, statins, a diuretic, an inhibitor of the renin -angiotensin s ystem, a beta -blocker and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, ea ch to be given at clinicall y appropriate doses , and the use of implantable device slikeICD and CRT. This should be conducted in the context of local or regional guidance for primary or secondary CV prevention. The rationale for dose and dose -interval sele ction is described in Section 4.1.2 . SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION 3.3 An appropriate number of patients will be screened for the trialin approximate ly 15 countries. Approximately 480 trialcentres will participate to ensure that the estimated 2850 patients are randomised to trial medication and complete the trial.Investigators who fail to randomi se at least one patient in the first 12 weeks from site initiation may be excluded from further participation. If enrolment is delay ed, additional centre s may be initiated. The total number of randomised patients may be adapted based on assessment of the blinded event rate. If the accumulated blinded data suggests a slow er accrual of primary outcome events over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of patients randomised may be increased up to 4000. Operationall y, the recruitment period would be extended and could continue up to 6 months before the target number of events is expected to be achieved. The number of primary outcome events required is not affected by this consideration. For further details refer to Section 7.7 ."

Greater diversit y in clinical trial samples allows for broader generali sation of trial results, increased minority access to trials, improved standards of care, decreased disparities in disease treatment and outcomes, and improved external validity supported by a more representative sample. Greater number of African- Americans as an example suffer from HF and all efforts must be made to have adequate representation of this minority population from the USA [ P15-10667 ].Each Investigator should develop a recruitment strategy that ensures the recruitment of a representative patient population and takes into co nsideration gender, race and ethnicity . According to previous heart failure trials and registries the prevalence of DM amongst patients with HF varies from 25% to 40%. Prevalence of pre -DM is not clearly understood but it is estimated to vary from 15% to 50% [ R16-2384 , R16-2382 ]. In a recent large HF outcome trial, 35% of the patients reported to have diabetes and another 15% found to have undiagnosed diabetes and around 27% had pre- diabetes [ R16-2383 ]. Since there is a chance that empagliflozin, as a diabetes drug, when used in CV outcome trials recruits more patients with T2DM, capping on trial level will be used to aim for a similar distribution of patients with DM, pre-DM or no DM as it is expected in the population of patients with the chronic heart failure in real life. Via IRT it will be ensured that approximately a minimum of 35% of the trial population will be diabetic patients, a minimum of 15% will be prediab etic patients and a minimum of 20% will be non- diabetic patients. Additionally recruitment to the three categories of DM, pre- DM or no DM will be monitored on regional level. Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. DM in this context is define d as screening HbA1c ≥6.5% , active treatment with antidiabetic medication (for indication of DM) or history of DM . Pre-DM is defined as screening HbA1c ≥5.7% and <6.5% without the intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non -DM indication) andno history of DM . Patients with no DM is defined as screening HbA1c < 5.7 % without an y intake of antidiabetic medication (unless taken for a non- DM indication) and no history of DM [R16- 2261 ]. Screening of patients for this trialis competitive, i.e. screening for the trialwill stop at all centre swhen a sufficient number of patients have been randomised to trial treatment. Investigators will be notified when screening is complete and will not be allowed to recruit additiona l patients thereafter. Patients who have completed visit 1 procedures prior to notification of the termination of recruitment will be allowed to be randomised in the trial, if they meet all eligibility criteria. Patient eligibility will be based upon a com plete medical history including a ph ysical examination and clinical laboratory tests. Judgment of the clinical relevance of a concomitant disease is at the discretion of the Investigator. Re-screening and/or re-testing (of assessments) is permitted if appr oved b y Local Clinical Monitor ( CML )/Clinical Lead (CL )or delegate. Whilst the information provided below is not"

If a patient is withdrawn from the trial the ExSC and the Sponsor should be informed immediately about each individual case. Prematurely discontinuation of trial medication For patients who prematurely discontinue trial medicatio n all efforts should be made to observe these patients and ask them to continue to attend the scheduled visits until the end of trial. I t is expected that all efforts are made to follow up on the collection of all adverse events, outcome events and concomi tant therap y, and to have a complete dataset without missing data. If a patient wh o prematurely discontinued trial medication is not willing to return to the predefined trial visits, at minimum a telephone call every 24weeks (preferably every 12 weeks) a nd a telephone call at trial end will be required, to document the occurrence of"

Every attempt must be made b y the investigator to ensure patients continue partici pating in the trial during trial medication interruptions an d after discontinuation of trial medication. Patients who prematurel y discontinue trial medication are allowed to restart treatment, at an y time if appropriate in the opinion of the Investigator . At every visit following trial medication discontinuation Investigators must consider if trial medication can be re-started. Patients that are not actively taking trial medication may be less motivated to adhere to the scheduled trial visits. I nvestigators and site staff should work to detect early signs of losing interest and readily present such patients (not actively taking trial medication) with the following options to encourage continued participation: Option 1 Conti nue to attend regularly scheduled trial visits at the centre until the trial ends Option 2 Conduct all remaining trial visits over the phone Option 3 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status and CV outcome events at the end of the trial through the patient or alternative person designated b y the patient (e.g., family, spouse, partner, legal representative, or ph ysician) even if only by telephone . If possible, other AE’s and concomitant therap y chang estobe recorded. Sites should encourage the patient to return to the clinic for the final stud y visit. Option 4 Discontinue participation in remaining trial activities but permit collection of vital status at the end of the trial through the patient, al ternative person designated b y the patient, or through review of patient’s medical information from alternative sources (e.g., doctor’s notes, hospital records, etc.) Patients will be asked to choose the most rigorous form of follow -up that they are willin g to comply with. A patient could be instructed to permanently stop the trial medication only after discussion with I nvestigator, if eligibility criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply with the protocol (e.g. non -attendance at trial assessments). Withdrawal of informed consent A patient has the right to withdraw informed consent for participation at an y time for an y reason. However, withdrawal of consent from trial participation should be very rare and unusual. Because of this, the I nvestigator must be involved in the discussions with the patient regarding a withdrawal of consent. Additionally , the Investigator must discuss the withdrawal of consent with the Sponsor’s/CRO’s representative prior to stopping trial participation. Early discontinuation of trial medication is not a criterion for withdrawal of consent for participati on in the trial."

If the patient withdraws informed consent for participation in the trial, the trial will end for that patient. The patient should stop taking trial medication and should be asked to compl ete the end of treatment (EOT) visit and follow- up procedures as described in the Flow Chart . Completing these procedures is strongl y recommended for the patient’s safety. Patients that withdraw informed consent will not be re placed. Vital status must be collected at the end of trial for patients that withdraw consent from trial participation, if allowed by local regulations . Patients lost to follow -up If a patient is lost, every effort will be made by the Investigator and site staff to contact and locate the patient before the patient is declared lost to follow -up. Investigators and site staff must use every possible allowable means, according to local regulations, to locate patients who have missed visits. Efforts to contact the patient may include but are not limited to: • Calling all numbers for patient and listed contacts (including in the evening and on weekends). •Calling primary care physician, refer ring specialist and/or other listed phy sicians for more recent information, date of last office visit or to determine vital status. •Sending an email and follow up with mailing certified letters (return receipt requested) to all known patient addresses and all listed contacts (e.g., relatives, friends, neighbours) that were provided by the patient. •Reviewing patient’s records and medical notes for any details of a hospitalisation, doctor’s visit or other procedure that may indicate location or status of subj ect. •Use Internet to search for possible contact information for the patient. •Try reverse directory for phone numbers to get possible addresses and/or new contact details. • Utilise social networking sites. • Check local, regional, and national public records to locate the patient or search for vital status in accordance with local law. •Consider home visit. • Contact patient finder service. Pregnancy If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial, the trial medication will be stopped, the patient will be followed up during the trial and until birth or termination of the pregnancy (see further details in Section 5.3.4.2 ). An excessive withdrawal rate can have a severe negative impact on the scientific value of the trial. The “Intention To Treat ”analysis requires that all randomised patients be followed until trial end even if the trial medication was temporarily interrupted, discontinued or never started.

Empagl iflozin exerts its effect by promoting glucosuria and consequent hemody namic changes associated with diuresis, improvement in arterial stiffness, blood pressure lowering effect with no increase in HR and reduction in HR xPressure product, an index of my ocardial oxygen consumption. These modes of actions support the scientific rationale of using empagliflozin in patients with HF. In the EMPA -REG -OUTCOME trialboth doses were administered to patients with T2DM and showed to be equally effective in reducing CV death, HHF, and composite of HHF or CV death in patients with HF at baseline. In subgroup anal ysis empagliflozin improved the main outcome of CV death and HHF with a similar magnitude in patients with low or high levels of HbA1c at baseline. This indicates the risk reduction for HF outcome is independent of the degree of gl ycaemic control at baseline, suggesting that these benefit scan be achieved with the 10 mg dose similar to the 25 mg dose in the non- diabetic population as well. The mechanism of action is supported by studies in healthy volunteers where both doses were associated with about 50g glucosuria. Given the lower exposure with 10 mg empagliflozin, similar general safety and CV effects for both doses, empagliflozin 10 mg once dail y has been selected in this trial. For further det ails see current version of the IB. 4.1.3 Method of assigni ng patients to treatment groups During Visit 2 eligible patients will be randomised to receive empagliflozin 10 mg, or matching placebo, in a 1:1 ratio according to therandomisation plan. The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). To facilitate the use of the IRT, the Investigator will receive a manual including all necessary instructions for using the sy stem. A cop y of the manual will be available in the I SF. Patient assignment to the treatment group will be determined b y a c omputer generated random sequence. Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented -for further details please refer to Section 4.1.5.1. and 4.1.5.2 .

Empagliflozin can be taken with or without food. To ensure a dose interval of about 24 hours, the medication should be taken in the morning at approximately the same time every day. If a dose is missed by more than 12 h ours, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. On days before the next visit, the dose should be taken 22 -26 h ours before the planned dose at the visit. N o double doses should be taken. Patients should be inst ructed not to take their medication on the morning of trialvisits as they will be dosed whilst in the clinic. Visits should be routinely scheduled at approximately the same time of day for each visit. The actual date and time of administration of the trial medication at the trial visit will be recorded in the eCRF. 4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding Blinding 4.1.5.1 Patients, I nvestigators and every one involved in trialconduct or analy sis or with any other interest in this double -blind trial, will remain blin ded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database lock. The DMC will be provided with unblinded data in order to allow them to review efficacy and safet y and to fulfil their tasks as outlined in the data monitoring committee char ter.

The randomisation code will be kept secret by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. Unblinding and breaking the code 4.1.5.2 Emergenc y unblinding will be available to the Investigator via the IRT. It must only be used in an emergency situation when the identity of the trial medication must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safet y of trial participants. Whenever possible and if time allows, the need for unblinding will be discussed with the medical representative from the Sponsor/ CRO before the unblinding of trial medication takes place. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate eCRF page along with the date and the initials of the person who broke the code. The patient could continue with trial medication after unblinding. Due to the requirem ents to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), it may be necessary for a representative from B I’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trialconduct.

At the time of return to the Sponsor /CRO, the Investigator/Pharmacist/investigational drug st orage manager must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial patient and that no remaining supplies are in the Investigator’s possession . OTHER TREATMENTS, EM ERGENCY PROCEDURES, RESTRICTIONS 4.2 4.2.1 Other treat ments and emergency procedures The use of medication for the treatment of HF will be at the discretion of the Investigator and should be in accordance with local/international guidelines. All concomitant (additional) medications and other therapies should be recorded on the appropriate pages of the eCRF . Concomitant antidiabetic medications should be adjusted individually as clinically indicated by the patient’s usual diabetes care provider. Restrictions of antidiabetic background therapy are described in Section 4.2.2 . Patients without a diagnosis of DM experiencing repeated or severe s ymptoms such as nervousness, sweating, intense hunger, trembling, weakness and palpitations should contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional, as these sy mptoms might be suggestive of hypoglycaemia. In the case of hy pogly caemia , in patients with or without DM , that may put the patient at risk (e.g. repeated s ymptomatic hy poglycaemia or severe h ypogl ycaemia), appropriate care should be provided at the discretion of the Investigator. Special attention must be paid to the prevention of ketoacidosis . All patients must be made aware of this risk and need to be instructed to contact the Investigator or other healthcare professional in case of s ymptoms of metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA. Cases of DKA have been reported in patients treated with empagliflozin , including fatal cases . In a number of reported cases, the presentation of the condition was at ypical with only moderatel y increased blood glucose values ;below 14 mmol/l (250 mg/dl). The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non- specific s ymptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepiness. Patients should be assessed and treated for keto acidosis immediately according to local guidelines if these s ymptoms occur, regardless of blood glucose level.

In instances where a patient cannot give or decide upon a response, no response should be recorded. The Investigator (or designated site -personnel) should check that all items have been completed by the patient, but the response to each item should not be scrutinised. Instru ctions to patients are included in the questionnaire. The respective procedure for illiterate patients (if included) is described in the Appendix 10.1 . To assess the further endpoint of c hange from bas eline in KCCQ based on patient- preferred outcome at week 52 , the investigator or designee will be required to ask the patient one additional question about which domain is the most difficult for the patient to cope with. The response to this question will be recorded in the eCRF. 5.2.2 N ew York H eart Association classification The New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification will be used to classify the severit y of the patients’ heart failure ( ref. Appendix 10.3 ). The investigator should place the patients in one of the four categories based on how limited their phy sical activity are. Candidates for screening are required to have a NYHA functional c lass II, III or IV. The classification of patient’s phy sical activit y according to NYHA will be performed at all on-site until end of the trial .If a visit is designated as an on -site visit but is conducted by phone, the NYHA functional classification mus t be performed. 5.2.3 NT-proBNP Refer to Section 5.5 Assessment of biomarkers . 5.2.4 Blood pressure SBP and DBP as well as pulse rate (electronically or by palpation, count for 1 minute) will be measured after 5 minutes of rest in the seated position according to the Flow Chart . At visit 1, after the patient has rested quietly , in the seated position for fiv e minutes, three blood pressure measurements will be taken and recorded in the eCRF. The mean of these 3 blood pressure values will be used to determine eligibility . At subsequent visits, blood pressure recordings should be measured using a similar t ype o f and validated certified blood pressure recording instrument on the same arm when possible. 5.2.5 Body weight BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated for determination of eligibility at Visit 1. Body weight will be measured at all on-site visits •after the urine sampli ng (weight after bladder voiding), • shoes and coat/jackets should be taken off, and •pockets should be emptied of heav y objects (i.e. keys, coins etc.)."

Patients should measure their ketones at least on ce daily , ideally after fasting for at least 6 hours, throughou t the treatment period, andfor 5 day s after empagliflozin / placebo treatment has been stopped. Patients should be reminded to test their ketones in case of any symptoms of ketoacidosis , e.g. nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Patients must be remind ed about the signs and s ymptoms of ketoacidosis , on the interpretation of ketone values measured via the meter, and on appropriate action to take in the event of increased ketone levels (see below) . In the same way as during routine clinical care, patient s should also be reminded to test for ketones in case of repeatedly elevated blood glucose levels (e.g. >11.1 mmol/L (> 200 mg/dL)) which cannot be explained. Patients will be instructed that in the event of increased ketones, they are to either follow t he rules given b y their treating ph ysician (e.g. increased fluid intake and/or insulin bolus) or contact their trial site. Blood glucose and ketone levels should be checked every 1-2 hours until they are back in a range considered to be normal. Patients are to be instructed to immediately refer themselves to hospital and/or the Investigator, or to contact an emergency physician in case of a blood ketone concentration > 1.5 mmol/L (as indicated in the meter manual). In case of a suspected ketoacidosis a blood gas test (pH, bicarbonate) should be performed locall y at the earliest opportunity and the patient treated according to local medical judgement .

Detailed in formation on the stroke (date and time of onset, type, symptoms, method of detection, outcome) will be collected in the eCRF. Hepatic events 5.3.6.2 For assessment of hepatic events please refer to Section 3.1.1. 2. 5.3.7 Assessment of adverse events Definitions of AEs 5.3.7.1 Adverse event An AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Adverse reaction An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at leas t a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may arise from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authori sation include off- label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors. Serious adverse event A serious adverse event ( SAE) is defined as an y AE which:"

For Ja pan only : The following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other reason ”: AEswhich possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAE s. AEs considered “Always Serious” In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Importan t Medi cal Events, BIhas set up a list of AEs, which by their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as given above. The latest list of “Alway s serious AEs” can be found in the ISF.These e vents should alway s be reported as SAEs as described above. Note: Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the can cer. Adverse events of Special Interest (AESIs) The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been identified at the substance level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the Sponsor’s /CRO’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, see Section 5.3.7.2 . The following are considered as AESIs: Hepatic injury A hepatic injury is defined by the following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: an elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or Marked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ 5 fold ULN"

In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed . Decreased renal function Decreased renal function is defined by a creatinine value showing a ≥ 2 fold increase from baseline and is above the ULN. For the AESI “decreased renal function” patient sneed to be followed up appropriat ely based on local clinical guidance. The Investigator should refer to follow -up schedule for renal endpoint events described in Section 5.3.4.1 . Ketoacidosis Ifmetabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA is suspected further investigations shoul d be done according to the medical judgment and the clinical course until a diagnosis is made and/or the patient is recovered. Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentiall y modify the clinical presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients with DM and potentially also in non -diabetic patient population. The diagnosis of ketoacidosis in these patients can be based on arterial pH ≤7.30, serum bicarbonate levels <15 and measurement of serum beta- hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic criteria which can support the diagnosis of ketoacidosis are urine ketones and anion gap >10. Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need to appl y for the diagnosis of ketoacidosis , and clinical ju dgment should also be taken into consideration. Events leading to l ower limb a mputation Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of amputation, auto -amputation or disarticulation as defined below is considered as an AESI . “Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb through a joint. Auto -amputation is a spontaneous separation of non -viable portion of the lower limb. Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), pro cedures on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and other procedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb (amputation or disarticulation).” (International Working Group of Diabeti c Foot, 2015)."

The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation or disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the proce dure and if the patient had some of the known risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation. Intensity of A Es The intensity of the AE should be judged based on the following: Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities Causal relationship of AEs The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a cau sal relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an adverse event. An adverse reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected. Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and releva nt history . Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be: •The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug •The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class. •A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure. • Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced •No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre - existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications). •The event is t ypicall y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome). •An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller effect size if d ose is diminished). Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could be: • No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident (e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned). • Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives). Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger."

All exempted events must be collected s ystematically on the eCRF (within 24 hours). The investigator is also required to provide all d efined supporting documentati on (ref. to ISF). If the events specified above occur before randomization, they are not exempted form immediate reporting on the SAE form. In addition, whenever such events meet the definition of an AESI, then no exemption applies, regardless of occurre nce before or after randomization. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the safety data in the trial on an ongoing basis. Reported SAEs occurring after randomisation that are protocol exempted events will be collected in the eCRFs an d evaluated b y the DMC.

DRUG CONCENTRATION M EASUREMENTS AND PHAR MACOKINETICS 5.4 (SUBSTUDY) 5.4.1 Pharmacokinetic endpoints The PK sampling will be done from a limited number of randomised patients (approximately 1140 patients) and atsites in pre-selected countries only. The pre -dose blood samples will be collected at visit 4 to determine plasma empagliflozin trough concentrations. These samples will serve to determine stead y state trough concentrations of empagliflozin. The date and exact clock time of trial medication intake the day before this visit will be recorded together with the date and exact clock time of drawing thetrough pharmacokinetic sample. 5.4.2 Methods of sample collection The time interval for blood sample collection relative to the most recent intake of trial medication should be between 22 and 26 h. For quantification of empagliflozin trough plasma concentrations, 3 mL of blood will be d rawn from a forearm vein in an EDTA- anticoagulant blood drawing tube at each time -point. Details of sample handling and sample logistics can be found in the ISF (Central lab manual)."

The patients should be fasting (no food or liquid except water the last 10 -16 hours) at Visit2 (Randomisation), EOT Visit and Follow Up Visit . If a patient mistakenl y takes trial medication on the morning of Visit 4 before attending the clinic, or comes in non -fasted where a fasting condition is required ( ref. Flow Chart ),the visit should be rescheduled for another day as soon as possible reminding the patients about expected time of dosing. The rescheduled visit must take place in a short enough time -frame so that the patient has sufficient trial medication available. All patients are to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. The trial medication packs contain sufficient medication to allow for these time windows. DETAILS OF TRIAL PROC EDURES AT SELECTED V ISITS 6.2 The Flow Chart summari ses the investigational procedures to be done at each visit, and trial procedures should be performed before intake of any trial medication . The procedures ar e further described below. 6.2.1 Screening (Visit 1) No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. Preferably the patient should also be informed about biobanking (including DNA) sampling alread y at this visit. Patients who have been diagnosed with T1DM are to be provided with the consent form that contains information relevant for patients with T1DM. Once the patient hasconsented to trial participation , he/she is considered to be enrolled in the trial and hav e started screening. The patient should be registered i n the enrolment log and in the IRTas a screened patient. Patients will continue taking background medication for heart failure and treatment for their concomitant disorders ifapplicable. The screen ing visit may be conducted over multiple day s, at the discretion of the investigator, as long as all screening procedures are performed and resulted within the allowable visit window in the flow chart. For example, a site may obtain written informed conse nt followed b y collection of samples for the safet y lab analysis and ECG . Remaining procedures may be performed on a separate day, once it is confirmed that the patient’s laboratory values, including NTproBNP value, are not exclusionary . Background medical therapy for HF should be stable for at least 1 week prior to Visit 1 and during screening period until Visit 2 (Randomisation) with the exception of diuretics which should be stable for onl y one week prior to Visit 2 to control sy mptoms."

If the patient does not meet the entry criteria, the site may make a phone c ontact to inform the patient that he/she is no longer required to return to the clinic for Visit 2. Patients who fail screening (i.e. fail to meet one or more of the inclusion criteria, and/or meet one or more of the exclusion criteria) following Visit 1 procedures should be registered as a screen fai lure in IRT. 6.2.2 Treatment period Randomisation will occur at Visit 2 using IRT. The patients will return to the clinic for regularl y scheduled visit s4, 12, 32 and 52 weeks after randomi sation during the first y ear of trial participation, and every 24weeks t hereafter for the duration of the trial, as specified in the Flow Chart. These on-site visits will assess the occurrence of safet y and efficacy endpoints, trial medication compliance, concomitant therap y or intervention. Telephone follow -up calls will be scheduled 10 -12 weeks after every on-site visit starting after Visit 4 and continuing throughout the trial (see Flow Chart). The telephone contacts will focus on safet y (e.g. hospitalisations or occurrence of AEs), changes in concomitant therap y and trial medication compliance. The patients should be fasting at the Randomisation Visit (Visit 2) . Consenting patients with T1DM should be provided with the ketone monitoring device, the patient diary and Trial information card. The site staff are to provide instruction to the patient on how to properly use the ketone monitoring device and the importance of recording their glucose, ketone and insulin intake throughout the trial. At all subsequent visit s, site staff are required to review the patient’s diary with the patient to ensure that the diary is properl y completed. Patients with T1DM should be provided with ketone monitoring supplies as necessary . The optional blood sample for DNA will preferably be collected at the Randomisation Visit for all patients eligible for randomisation, but could also be taken at an y later visit after the separate consent is signed . At any time during the treatment period the Investigator is allowed to adjust and optimis e HF background therap y according to local and international guidelines. If any additional therap y is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare during the treatment period it may be given at the discretion of the Investigator (see also restrictions in Section 4.2.2 sites selected to participate in collection of samples for PK analy sis, please refer to Section 5.4 and the Lab Manual for details.

To ensure the trial population consist of a reasonable combination of non- , pre-and DM patients capping will be used on trial level (see also Section 3.3). Capping on regional level may be applied to achieve a contribution of each region to each category of diabetes status. The composite primary endpoint is the time to first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF . The statistical model for the primary anal ysis is the Cox proportional hazards model. The hazard ratio and its confidence limits will be determined for evaluating the superiority of empagliflozin to placebo for the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoints, which are part of the testing strategy , are occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crslope of change from baseline NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES 7.2 A hierarchical testing procedure will be followed for the assessment of the primary and the key secondary endpoints. For all the endpoints, superiority of empagliflozin vs. placebo will be evaluated with a two -sided test in the following structure: Null hy pothesis: There is no difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question. Alternative h ypothesis: There is a difference between the effect of placebo and the effect of empagliflozin in terms of the endpoint in question.

The joint frailty model will be adjusted for the sa me covariates as the primary anal ysis. The joint frailty model therefore models the hazards in the following way : ri (t | ωi , Zi) = ω i exp {β’ 1Zi}r0(t) λi (t | ωi,Zi) = ω iαexp {β’ 2 Zi}λ0(t) where r i(t) is the hazard of the recurrent HHF for the ith patient, proportional to the baseline intensity function r 0. The hazard function of CV death for the ith patient is λ iproportional to the baseline hazard λ 0. β1and β 2are vectors of the regression coefficients of the covariate vectors Z iincluding treatment, age (continuous), gender, history of DM,geographical region , LVEF (continuous) and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline (continuous) . Patient specific independent random effects are denoted b y ω i, with α giving the relation between HHF and CV d eath. Patient specific independent random effects denoted b y  i and are assumed to follow a gamma distribution with mean 1. The resulting likelihood function can be solved assumi ng piecewise constant hazards. Slope in change from baseline of eGFR (CKD- EPI) crwill be anal ysed by a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept and random slope per patient. The model will include the factors treatment, gender, geographical region, baseline LVEF, and status of DM as fixed effects and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline (continuous), age (continuous) , time , interaction of treatment by time ,and interaction of eGFR (CKD -EPI) cr at baseline (continuous) b y time as linear covariates and allow for randoml y var ying slope and intercept between patients. The model will include all on -treatment change from baseline data. Since the slope is run on the change from baseline data, the intercept will model the acute drop, whereas the long- term effect is modelled by the slope. Change from baseline in clinical summar y score for HF s ymptoms and physical limitations domains of the KCCQ at week 52 will be evaluated by a mixed model for repeated measures data including age (continuous) and eGFR (CKD- EPI)crat baseline (continuous) as linear covariate sand baseline score b y visit, visit by treatment, gender, geographical region , baseline LVEF, and status of DMat baseline as fixed effects. All on -treatment data up to week 52 will be included. Occurrence of all -cause hospitali sation (first and recurrent) will be evaluated by a similar joint frailty model for adjudicated HHF , and will be modelled together with all -cause mortality . The other time -to-event type of secondary endpoints will be analysed using the same Cox proportional hazards model as the primary anal ysis. This also applies for time to adjudicated CV death and all -cause mortality , rather than using the joint frailty model described above."

The number of comparisons lost is noted as N L. The win ratio is N W/ N L. The rules for winning and losing follow a modified Rogers 20 14 [R16- 4909 ] approach also considering the time to the first HHF event in case of a tie on the number of HHF events. T he analysis of the unmatched win ratio will be conducted as described in Pocock 2012 [ R16- 4813 ]. Further longitudinal continuous endpoints will be anal ysed in a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), including age and eGFR (CKD -EPI) crat baseline as linear covariates and visit by treatment interaction, baseline by visit interaction, geographical region, gender , baseline LVEF, and baseline history of DM as fixed effects. The details of analy ses will be defined in the TSAP prior to unbli nding. 7.3.4 Safety analyses In general, safety anal yses will be descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. No h ypothesis testing is planned. Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse ev ents will concentrate on treatment -emergent adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP will be considered ‘treatment -emergent’. The REP is defined as 7 day s after last dose intake . Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’. Frequency, severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)."

Data from this trial and a parallel trial in HFpEF patients ( 1245.110 ) will be pooled. The statistical model will include trial as a covariate. More details are specified in the meta - analysis plan s. INTERIM ANALYSES 7.4 The safet y and conduct of the trial will be monitored by an independent DMC. Details on this process are outlined in the DMC charter. There will be one unblinded interim anal ysis to be conducted b y the DMC . At the time of the interim analy sis, the ExSC, SEC, S ponsor , CRO and all trial /site personnel will stay blinded to the interim results .For blinding, please also refer to Section 4.1.5.1 . After approximately 500 primary adjudicated outcome events have been accrued (approximately 60% of information is available) an interim anal ysis will be performed.

If the p -value for the primary endpoint and the p -value for CV -death (from the primary Cox proportional hazards model) are lower than the cut -off to be evaluated from the alpha spending function (planned at 0.001 one -sided), the trial will be stopped for overwhelming efficacy . In this case, the hierarch y will be tested as specified in Section 7.2 .Otherwise the trial will be continued. The final alpha level is therefore planned at a one- sided alpha -level of 0. 0248 which translates in a two -sided alpha of 0.0496. The event rate will be assessed by the trial team i n a blinded manner only during trial recruitment and before the unbl inded interim analy sis (see Section 7.7 ). HANDLING OF MISSING DATA 7.5 There will be no imputation for safety data or for time -to-event t ype of endpoints . For patients who discontinue the trial treatment prematurely, all efforts will be made to follow the patients for survival and any other endpoint s,including the primary and key secondary endpoints, until the end of the trial. For the slope anal ysis of eGFR (CKD -EPI) cr, all available on -treatment change from baseline data will be used. Patients without on-treatment data after randomisation will not b e included in this analysis. For the anal ysis of change from baseline to 30 days after treatment stop, only available data will be used. Only patients with post -treatment data will be used in this analysis. For other longitudinal efficacy endpoints such as KCCQ scores , MMRM methodology will be used. Models will be run on both all observed data and all observed on - treatment data. Details of the imputation rule will be given in the statistical analy sis plan. An eGFR (CDK -EPI) reduction is considered sustain ed, if it is determined by twoconsecutive post-baseline central laboratory measurements separated by ≥30 day s. If only one post -baseline value is available and the patient dies within 60 day s of this measurement without second measurement ≥30 day s after the first, then the eGFR reduction is also considered sustained. RANDOMISATION 7.6 The trial will be performed as a double -blind design with respect to placebo and empagliflozin. Subjects will be randomised to the trial treatments in a 1:1 ratio. The randomi sation will be stratified by the following factors: Geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia , Other ) Status of DM at screening :"

Approximately equal numbers of patients will be randomised to each treatment group. BI will arrange for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo - random number generator so that the resulting treat ment will be both reproducible and non - predictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR ). Access to the codes will be controlled and documented. DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 7.7 For the sample size calculation, a y early event rate in the placebo group of 15% is assumed (ref. Paradigm 12% event rate [ R16-1460 ], Rales 18 % event rate [P99-02524 ], and Emphasis -HF 15% event rate [R16-1459 ]). In the CHARM –added trial[R06-0956 ]event rate was 16.5%. The trial is designed to achieve a power of 90% for a two sided test at level α = 0.05. The following table (Table 7.7: 1 ) presents the n umber of required events together with the number of to be randomised and treated patients assuming an accrual period of 18 months and a follow- up period of 20 months for different assumed true hazard ratios. However, the follow -up period is not fixed but the trial will continue until the necessary number of events is observed, which are confirmed by the adjudication committee. The drop -out rate from the trial is assumed to be very low (< 1% per year) and is therefore not further considered for the determi nation of sample size."

Including interim anal ysis with Hwang -Shih- deCani alpha spending with gama=- 8 at 60% of information will decrease the power onl y slightl y (>89.5%). The blinded event rate and recruitment progress will be assessed during recruitment before any interim unblinding . If the accumulated data suggests a slower accrual of primary outcome event s over calendar time than originally projected, then the number of randomised patients may be increased to a maximum of 4000 patients. Operationall y, the recruitmen t period would be extended and could continue up to 6 months before the target number of events is expected to be achieved. The number of confirmed primary outcome events will not be affected b y this consideration and will remain 841 events. Calculations were performed using ADDPL AN6.1 .1by ADDPLAN Inc. Based on the abovementioned assumptions, and considering that HHF (first and recurrent) will only be tested if the primary endpoint is successful, the chance of showing significance for HHF (first and recu rrent) in a positive trial is at least 70%. For the integration of a Japanese population in this global phase III trial, and in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for bridging the trial results to this population, the Japanese patients to be randomised will be followed and controlled if necessary .

To evaluate this important co - morbidity, HF patients across the DM spectrum (i.e. T1DM, T2DM, pr e-diabetes) as well as HF patients who do not have DM, will be included in this trial. Special safety considerations are required for patients with T1DM, and several safety"

Since an SGLT -2 inhibitor may alter the typical presentation of this condition, T1DM patients will receive a home monitoring device to measure blood k etones and a diary for patients to record their blood glucose, ketone values and insulin intake. Patients with T1DM will also be required to carry a trial information card which includes information about the possible altered presentation of ketoacidosis to be presented to health care professionals should the patient be seen in an urgent care setting. For further details refer to Section 4.2.1 . As outlined above, inclusion of patients who do not have diabetes is also allowed in this trial. It has been shown in healthy volunteers dosing with empagliflozin results in glycosuria summing up to about 2/3 the average glucosuria in patients with T2DM. This is similar to the amount of glucose lost in T2D M subjects with moderate renal impairment. Because in the EMPA REG Outcome study no difference in CV benefit was detected for patients with renal impairment vs the overall population, it is hypothesized that this amount of glucosuria is not the main facto r to obtain CV effects with empagliflozin. There are no long -term safety data for empagliflozin in patients without diabetes. Data in non -diabetic subjects is limited to healthy volunteers, without significant co -morbidities or concomitant medications. Exposure in healthy volunteers is from single dose and multiple dose studies with exposure up to 28 days. However, while limited, such data does include over 500 healthy volunteers exposed to empagliflozin during the clinical development for treatment of T2DM. No specific safety concern was identified and no occurance of symptomatic hypoglycaemia was detected [U12-2707-01 ]. It is noted that in patients with T2DM, the risk of hypoglycaemia was only increased with"

Further, in a mechanistic study [ c11963611 -01], subjects without DM were shown to increase endogenous glucose product ion in response to glucosuria after administration with empagliflozin. As a result, blood glucose levels remained in the normal range for these individuals [P16-01830 ]. Therefore it is scientifically reasonable to hypothesize that in non -diabetic patients, with no medical indication for insulin or sulfonylurea treatment that the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with empagliflozin treatment would be lower than in patients with T2DM. Because of the mode of action, blockade of th e SGLT -2 with consequent glucosuria, is the same in patients with and without diabetes, although to different degree, it is considered likely that the tolerability of empagliflozin in non -diabetic patients may be no less favourable in patients with T2DM. There is also currently limited therapeutic experience with empagliflozin in patient aged 85 years and older. The prevalence of chronic heart failure increases with age and the therapeutic options in the elderly above 85 years are limited. The inclusion o f this population in the clinical trial setting will help support the assessment of benefit -risk of empagliflozin for patients over 85 years. Special caution should be used in these patients, who may be at increased risk of adverse consequences attributed to empagliflozin -related volume depletion. Many patients with chronic HF have renal impairment, and to ensure that the trial results reflect this population, patients with eGFR ≥20 ml/min/1.73m2can be included. In the EMPA- REG Outcome trial, the cardiovascular benefits of empagliflozin were not driven by its pharmacological effect of lowering blood glucose and were consistently noted in patients with different degrees of renal impairment, inclu ding patients with eGFR between > 30 and"

Rationale for change The use of SGLT -2 inhibitors or combined SGL T- 1 and 2 inhibitors does not need to be prohibited during the follow-up period as the patient is no longer taking the study medication, and because events which occur during the follow -up period at study close out are not to be included in the primary anal ysis.Furthermore investigators are encouraged to treat patients to the best standard of care in compliance with local guidelines and recommendations for HF and diabetes if present (see section 2.3). Section to be changed 7.3.1 Primary endpoint analy ses Description of change All events observed after randomisation until trial termination will be included in the anal ysis. Patients who do not have an event during the trial period will be censored at the individual day of trial completion or the last day that the patient was known to be free of the event, whichever is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual day of trial completion or the last day known to be free of the event – randomisation date) + 1. Was changed to: All events observed after randomisat ion until completion of the planned treatment phase will be included in the analy sis. Patients who do not have an event will be censored at the individual end of the planned treatment phase or the last daythat the patient was known to be free of the even t, whichever is earlier. The time to censoring will be computed as (individual end of the planned treatment phase or the last day known to be free of the event –randomisation date) + 1. Rationale for change The intention -to-treat analy sis approach was chosen to as closel y as possible reflect real-life conditions, disregarding any occurrences of treatment stop or restart of treatment, that may happen in clinical practice. The study defined treatment discontinuation in the close -out period is administra tive and does not"
