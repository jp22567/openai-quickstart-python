8,page_8,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 9 Methodology: This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods. Period 1 is 56 weeks in duration and includes a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and active comparator- controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of blinded, active comparator-controlled treatment (Weeks 24 – 56). Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is an open-label (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long-term extension of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have completed Period 1. The study is designed to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 56-week blinded period which includes 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator controlled treatment followed by 32 weeks of active comparator controlled treatment (Period 1); a long-term extension period of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); a 30-day follow-up call or visit; and a 70-day follow-up call. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, where randomization for each country will be stratified by extent of psoriasis (≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups: Group 1: ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 410) Group 2: ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 410)Group 3: ADA (40 mg eow) (N = 410) Group 4: Placebo followed by ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 205) Group 5: Placebo followed by ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 205)No more than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled with concomitant use of hydroxychloraquine, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod. Subjects will receive both oral study drug QD (ABT-494 15 mg, ABT-494 30 mg, or matching placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either ADA 40 mg or matching placebo) until all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are unblinded to study treatment."
9,page_9,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 10 Methodology (Continued): Subjects who were assigned to placebo at Baseline will be preassigned to receiving either ABT-494 15 mg QD or ABT-494 30 mg QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (total study duration up to approximately 5 years). Subjects will continue study treatment as assigned at the end of Period 1. Subjects who are assigned to the ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow will continue to receive ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow, respectively, in a blinded manner. When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study drug assignment in both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion until the completion of Period 2. Subjects must have had inadequate response to ≥ 1 non-biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, LEF, cyclosporine, apremilast, bucillamine or iguratimod) or an intolerance to or contraindication for DMARDs as defined by the investigator prior to the Screening visit. No background non-biologic DMARD therapy is required during participation in this study. For subjects who are on non-biologic DMARD therapy at baseline (MTX, SSZ, LEF, apremilast, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bucillamine or iguratimod), non-biologic DMARDs should have been started ≥ 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit, must be at stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and remain on a stable dose through Week 36 of the study; the non-biologic DMARD dose may be decreased only for safetyreasons. In addition, all subjects taking MTX should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed according to the Investigator's instructions. Please refer to Section 5.2.3.1 and Section 5.2.3.2 for additional details related to prior and concomitant DMARD therapy, respectively. Starting at the Week 36 visit (after Week 36 assessments have been performed), initiation of or change in background PsA medication(s) including, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency opiates, and non-biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 non-biologic DMARDs except the combination of MTX and leflunomide) is allowed as per local label with maximum doses as outlined in Section 5.2.3.3. At Week 16, subjects classified as non-responders (defined as not achieving at least 20% improvement in either or both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16) will add or modify background therapy for PsA. After the last subject completes the Week 24 study visit, an unblinded analysis will be conducted for the purpose of initial regulatory submission. To maintain integrity of the trial during the blinded 56-week period, study sites and subjects will remain blinded until all subjects have reached Week 56. A second unblinded analysis may be conducted for regulatory purposes after all subjects have completed Period 1. A final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 2. An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted by an independent external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after approximately 600 subjects have completed the Week 12 visit or have prematurely discontinued from the study. The interim analysis is to assess if the study met the pre-defined No-Go boundary for the primary endpoint ACR20."

Pharmacokinetic: Blood samples for assay of ABT-494 and possibly other medications in plasma will be collected at each visit after baseline in Period 1. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional) Prognostic, surrogate, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers signatures may be evaluated. Samples for different applications including, but not limited to, pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or lipids. Safety: Safety evaluations include adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for the entire study duration. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Period 1 Efficacy:Analysis of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints: For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group. Pairwise comparisons between each ABT-494 treatment group and the combined placebo groups will be conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors. For ACR20 response rate at Week 12, analysis will be conducted to assess the non-inferiority of each ABT-494 dose versus ADA on placebo-subtracted treatment difference using Koch's 3-arm test statistic. The test aims to show that ABT-494 preserves at least 50% of the placebo-subtracted ADA effect. Superiority of ABT-494 versus ADA will also be tested for ACR20."

Pairwise comparisons for each of the ABT-494 treatment groups and the combined placebo groups will be carried out using the analysis of covariance model with treatment group as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates. For change from baseline in Patient's Assessment of Pain NRS and change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, superiority of ABT-494 vs adalimumab will also be tested. The overall type I error rate of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure. Long-Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined: Long-term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic:A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of ABT-494 oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. Safety: Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. There will be two sets of planned safety analyses: safety analysis by Week 24, and long-term safety analysis. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, ECG, and vital signs. Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary, by system organ class, by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator will be provided. The changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed in a descriptive manner. Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated."

26,page_26,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 27 3.0 Introduction Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease classified as a sub- type of spondyloarthritis (SpA) and characterized by the association of arthritis and psoriasis. PsA can develop at any time, but for most people it appears between the ages of 30 and 50, and it affects men and women equally. 1 The course of PsA is usually characterized by flares and remissions.1 Left untreated, patients with PsA can have persistent inflammation, progressive joint damage, disability, and a reduced life expectancy. 1,2 For most patients, skin manifestations predate the arthritis.1 Patients with PsA experience varying combinations of disease manifestations affecting the synovium, tendons, entheses, skin, and bone. These manifestations of disease range in prevalence with peripheral arthritis and variable degrees of psoriasis observed in all patients at some point during their disease course, axial disease in 40 – 74% depending on the criteria used for diagnosis, 3enthesitis in 25 – 51%, dactylitis in 8 – 59%,4-6and anterior uveitis in 2 – 25%.7 Additionally, PsA patients are more likely to experience the co-morbid conditions of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, 9depression, and anxiety than healthy subjects,8and have decreased quality of life and functional impairment.10,11 The prevalence of PsA varies by region and has been reported as 0.13% in North America, 0.07% in South America, 0.19% in Europe, and 0.01 – 0.07% in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. 12 PsA patients require treatment of the entire spectrum of disease manifestations. The primary goal of treating patients with PsA is to maximize long-term health-related quality of life, through control of symptoms, prevention of structural damage, normalization of function and social participation and abrogation of inflammation. Initial treatment of musculoskeletal symptoms is composed of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs"
27,page_27,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 28 (NSAIDs) and local corticosteroid injections, while topical therapies are used for the initial treatment of psoriasis. For patients who experience lack of efficacy or toxicity with these measures, for the treatment of peripheral arthritis, both the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 13and Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA)14recommend systemic therapy with conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide [LEF], sulfasalazine [SSZ], or ciclosporin A), followed by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients who do not respond adequately to cDMARDs. Other biologic therapies (e.g., IL-12 /23 or IL-17 inhibitors) are also recommended as alternatives to anti-TNF inhibitors in selected PsA patients. Additional specific recommendations differ slightly between EULAR and GRAPPA, however recommendations for therapeutic choice are made based on a patient's clinical presentation as some manifestations of PsA, such as enthesitis, dactylitis, and axial disease are either not responsive or poorly responsive to cDMARDs. Additional therapeutic options are also recommended specifically for treatment of skin disease. 13,14 Despite the beneficial results achieved with currently available biologic agents, approximately 40% of patients do not have at least 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores 13,15-21and only 58%22to 61%23of patients with PsA who receive them are able to achieve clinical remission after 1 year of treatment, with only approximately 43% achieving sustained remission for at least 1 year. 24 Thus, there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in PsA for patients with inadequate response to or intolerance to currently available therapies. Targeting the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases, such as PsA, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and atopic dermatitis, is supported by the involvement of various pro-inflammatory cytokines that signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune-related disorders. The activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. 25,26"
28,page_28,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 29 The JAK family is composed of 4 members: JAK1, 2, 3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). These cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases act in tandem to activate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) that transduce cytokine-mediated signals, and are associated with multiple membrane cytokine receptors such as common gamma-chain (CGC) receptors and the glycoprotein 130 trans-membrane proteins. 27 JAK3 and JAK1 are components of the CGC cytokine receptor complexes that are responsible for the signaling of the inflammatory cytokines IL-2, - 4, -7, -9, -15 and -21; whereas IL-12 and IL-23 signal through JAK2 and Tyk2. 28 Propagation of these signals is important in the amplification of inflammatory responses. While the exact mechanism of PsA has not been fully elucidated, multiple cytokines such as IL-1, -6, -12, -17, -20, and -23 are thought to be involved in the activation and proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions. 29 The IL-17/IL-23 cytokine axis is also thought to be important in PsA pathogenesis.30 Thus, blockade of either JAK1 or Tyk2 could inhibit the response of central cytokine signals thought to be important in the pathogenesis of PsA. Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that inhibits JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 with high in vitro functional specificity for kinases 1 and 3. Tofacitinib is currently in Phase 3 development in PsA. The Phase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily (BID) in adult patients with active PsA who had an inadequate response to at least one conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and who were TNF inhibitor-naïve (OPAL Broaden) or who had an inadequate response to at least 1 TNF inhibitor (OPAL Beyond). Both studies achieved the primary endpoints of ACR20 and change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) versus placebo for both the 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID doses at Month 3. Data reported from OPAL Broaden indicate ACR20 response at Month 3 for placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and adalimumab 40 mg EOW of 33.3%, 50.5%, 60.6%, and 51.9%, respectively; p-value versus placebo for each active therapy was ≤ 0.05. At Month 3, statistically significant results in favor of tofacitinib over placebo for both dose groups were also observed for ACR50/70 responses, and PASI75 response. Superiority of tofactinib versus placebo was seen in the Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), and Dactylitis Severity Score (DSS) at the 10 mg BID dose only. Results for the primary and reported"
29,page_29,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 30 secondary efficacy endpoints were maintained to Month 12. No radiographic data were reported at Month 3 (end of double-blind period); however at Month 12 little radiographic progression was observed in any dose group. 31 OPAL Beyond results for ACR20 response at Month 3 for placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and tofacitinib 10 mg BID were 23.7%, 49.6%, and 47.0%, respectively; p-value versus placebo for each active therapy was ≤ 0.0001. At Month 3 statistically superior results in favor of tofacitinib at both doses versus placebo for ACR50, LEI, and DSS were also observed with superiority over placebo for PASI75 demonstrated only at the 10 mg BID dose while ACR70 response was not significantly different from placebo for either dose group. 32 The observed safety findings for both studies were consistent with those observed in the RA and psoriasis development programs. In related diseases (RA, 33psoriasis,34and ankylosing spondylitis35), tofacitinib has demonstrated an impact on signs and symptoms, as measured by ACR, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis (ASAS) response criteria. 31-35 ABT-494 is a novel JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with inflammatory diseases. Based on in vitro selectivity assays and in vivo animal models, ABT-494 has demonstrated inhibition of JAK1 at efficacious drug exposure levels that spare an inhibitory effect on JAK2. The enhanced selectivity of ABT-494 may have the potential for an improved benefit/risk profile by mitigating JAK2 inhibitory effects on erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. ABT-494 Clinical Development To date, single and multiple doses of ABT-494 have been studied in healthy volunteers in 10 Phase 1 studies (one of which also employed a substudy in subjects with mild to moderate RA), which have completed study conduct. In addition, ABT-494 has been studied in 4 Phase 2 trials in subjects with RA or Crohn's disease. Two of these Phase 2 trials have completed study conduct: 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 575 subjects with moderately to severely active RA on background MTX (Studies M13-550 and M13-537). One open-label extension to the completed RA studies (Study M13-538) and 1 randomized, dose-ranging, placebo-controlled study"
30,page_30,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 31 (Study M13-740) in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease with a history of inadequate response to or intolerance to anti-TNF therapy are ongoing. The RA Phase 3 clinical development program has been initiated and will include 6 randomized, controlled studies followed by long-term extension periods. No Phase 2 studies in subjects with PsA have been performed with ABT-494. Results from the Phase 2 randomized controlled studies in subjects with RA are available. Efficacy of treatment with ABT-494 in patients with moderate to severe RA was demonstrated in both Phase 2 Studies M13-550 and M13-537. Results from both studiesdemonstrated dose- and exposure-dependent improvement in clinical signs and symptoms as measured by the ACR20/50/70 response criteria. The Phase 2 program for ABT-494 in subjects with moderately to severely active RA consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both on stable background methotrexate (MTX) therapy, and one open-label extension (OLE) study (Study M13-538; NCT02049138) for those subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs. Study M13-550 (NCT01960855) enrolled subjects who had an inadequate response to anti-TNF therapy and Study M13-537 (NCT02066389) enrolled subjects who had shown an inadequate response to MTX. A total of 4 twice daily (BID) and 1 once daily (QD) dose regimens of ABT-494 immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were evaluated. In TNF-inadequate responder (TNF-IR) subjects, who represent the population with the greatest unmet need, the primary endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater at all doses of ABT-494 (up to 73%) compared with placebo (35%). In addition, numerically higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and ACR70 responses and low disease activity (LDA, based on Disease Activity Score [DAS] 28 C-reactive protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity Index [CDAI]) in the ABT-494 dose groups versus placebo."
31,page_31,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 32 In MTX-inadequate responder (MTX-IR) subjects, the primary endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose of ABT-494 compared with placebo (50%). At all doses of ABT-494 compared to placebo, significantly higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and clinical remission at Week 12. Safety results across the studies showed that ABT-494 was well tolerated and the types and frequencies of adverse events (AEs) were consistent with subjects with moderately to severely active RA receiving immunomodulatory therapy. One subject died from lung cancer 14 weeks after completing the 12-week study (Study M13-537); the lung cancer was considered by the investigator as not related to study drug. This subject had a 40 pack-year history of tobacco use and a positive family history of lung cancer. The rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drugwere low and not significantly different from placebo. No trends in the number of subjects with potentially clinically significant values or changes per dose group were observed for any of the hematology or urine parameters; however, treatment-emergent increases in blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK), all of which were asymptomatic, were reported with higher doses of ABT-494 (12 to 18 mg BID). No subject discontinued study drug due to elevated CPK. In all subjects, the CPK values normalized or were significantly reduced at the time of last observation. Among subjects with laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (as evidenced by C-reactive protein [CRP] > upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment with ABT-494 3 mg BID or 6 mg BID was associated with improvements in mean hemoglobin (Hgb) relative to placebo. At higher doses, there was a reduction in mean Hgb, however the reduction was not clinically significant, as mean Hgb levels remained within normal range throughout the treatment period. One subject each in the 18 mg BID group in both Study M13-550 and Study M13-537 had an AE of anemia. Overall, the AEs observed during the Phase 2 development, as well as changes in physical examination findings, vital signs and clinical laboratory results, do not indicate any safety concerns for further development of ABT-494."

Study M13-542 (NCT02706847) will enroll subjects who had an inadequate response to biologic DMARDs. Study M15-925 (NCT03086343) will compare ABT-494 vs. abatacept in subjects who had an inadequate response to biologic DMARDs. Study M13-549 (NCT02675426) will enroll subjects who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and have an inadequate response to csDMARDs. Study M14-465 (NCT02629159) will enroll subjects who are on a stable dose of MTX and have an inadequate response to MTX. Study M13-545 (NCT02706873) will enroll subjects who are MTX naïve. Study M15-555 (NCT02706951) will enroll subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX and will investigate the use of ABT-494 as monotherapy. A total of 3 dose regimens of ABT-494 once-daily tablets [30 mg QD, 15 mg QD, and 7.5 mg QD (Japan only)] will be evaluated. There are no data available from these studies at this time. 3.1 Differences Statement This study is the first to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 in subjects with PsA and a previous inadequate response to at least one non-biologic DMARD. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Despite the availability of various PsA therapies, including conventional synthetic (cs)DMARDs, 1 targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD and biologic (b)DMARDs, many patients still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or gradually lose response over time. There is evidence for clinical benefit of JAK inhibition in PsA based on 2 Phase 3 studies of tofacitinib, a non-selective JAK inhibitor. 31,32 Many AEs (serious infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic adverse events) observed for tofacitinib are thought to be a consequence of non-selectivity against the members of the JAK family of proteins. ABT-494 is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability to decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by JAK1 signaling while having"
33,page_33,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 34 minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3. This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. The safety profile specific to ABT-494 is evolving with safety results to date consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition. Adverse events in the categories of infection such as urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection and herpes zoster reactivation have been reported as well as adverse events in the categories of malignancies, and gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal perforation. Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. In addition, laboratory changes including elevations of liver function tests, increase in lipids, elevation in serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, reduced hemoglobin depending on baseline inflammatory burden, lower white blood cell counts, and reductions in Natural Killer (NK) cells have been observed with ABT-494 therapy. The results of all genetic toxicology testing indicate that ABT-494 is not genotoxic, however ABT-494 is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in women of childbearing potential. Based on an embryofetal development study in rats, there is judged to be no risk associated with administration of upadacitinib to male partners of females of childbearing potential. A detailed discussion of the pre-clinical and clinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology and safety experience with ABT-494 can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure. A Phase 2 program with ABT-494 demonstrated efficacy for improvement in signs and symptoms of RA and the safety results were consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition. 36-44,50,51 Together, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 RA program and establishment of proof of concept for efficacy of JAK inhibition in PsA support further development of ABT-494 in Phase 3 in subjects with PsA."

Period 1 is 56 weeks in duration and includes a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and active comparator-controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of"
35,page_35,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 36 blinded, active comparator-controlled treatment (Weeks 24 – 56). Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg eow for the treatment of signs and symptoms of subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate response or intolerance to non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is an open-label (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long-term extension of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have completed Period 1. The study is designed to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 56-week blinded period which includes 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator- controlled treatment followed by 32 weeks of active comparator controlled treatment (Period 1); a long-term extension period of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); a 30-day follow-up call or visit; and a 70-day follow-up call. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, where randomization for each country will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups: Group 1: ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 410)"

Subjects will receive both oral study drug QD (ABT-494 15 mg, ABT-494 30 mg, or matching placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either ADA 40 mg or matching placebo) until all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are unblinded to study treatment. Subjects who were assigned to placebo at Baseline will be preassigned to receive either ABT-494 15 mg QD or ABT-494 30 mg QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (total treatment up to approximately 5 years). Subjects will continue study treatment as assigned in Period 1. Subjects who are assigned to the ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow will continue to receive ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow, respectively, in a blinded manner.

In addition, all subjects taking MTX should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed according to the Investigator's instructions. Please refer to Section 5.2.3.2 for additional details related to prior and concomitant DMARD therapy. At Week 16, rescue therapy will be offered to subjects classified as non-responders (defined as not achieving at least 20% improvement in either or both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16) as follows: 1) add or modify doses of non-biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency opioid medications (tramadol or combination of acetaminophen and codeine or hydrocodone), oral corticosteroids and/or 2) receive 1 intra-articular, trigger point or tender point, intra-bursa, or intra-tendon sheath corticosteroid injection for 1 peripheral joint, 1 trigger point, 1 tender point, 1 bursa, or 1 enthesis as described in Section 5.2.3.4 (Rescue Therapy). After the last subject completes the Week 24 study visit, an unblinded analysis will be conducted for the purpose of initial regulatory submission. To maintain integrity of the trial during the blinded 56-week period study sites and subjects will remain blinded until all subjects have reached Week 56. A second unblinded analysis may be conducted for regulatory purposes after all subjects have completed Period 1. A final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Period 2. Starting at Week 36, subjects who fail to demonstrate at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued from study drug treatment.

Lab values can be re-tested once during the screening period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. If the subject does not have either an elevated hs-CRP or an erosion on x-ray examination of bilateral hands and feet (inclusion criterion 4), hs-CRP may be re-tested once during the screening period. Redrawing samples if initial samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since initial result was never obtained. Subjects that initially screen fail for the study are permitted to re-screen once following re-consent without prior AbbVie approval. For additional re-screening, AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) approval is required. All screening procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during re-screening. The subject must meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of re-screening in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation including HBV, HCV and HIV serology, the assessment of an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold test) and/or a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), ANA, chest x-ray, and electrocardiogram (ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re-screening provided the conditions noted in Section 5.3.1.1 are met, there are no changes in the subject's medical history that would warrant re-testing, and no more than 90 days have passed. Provided the conditions noted in the central imaging manual are met, if the subject had x-rays of hands and feet performed within 12 weeks of re-screening these tests will not be required for re-screening."

At the Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and randomized to double-blind treatment. During this period of the study, subjects will visit the study site at Baseline (Day 1), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44 and 56. A ± 3 day window is permitted around scheduled study visits up to Week 36. Following Week 36, a ± 7 day window is permitted. The last dose of oral study drug in Period 1 is taken the day prior to the Week 56 visit. Period 2 (Long-Term Extension Period [Up to a Total Treatment Duration of Approximately 5 Years]) Period 2 will begin at the Week 56 visit after all assessments have been completed. When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study drug assignment in both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion until the completion of Period 2. During Period 2, subjects will have a study visit at Week 56 and every 12 weeks thereafter until completion of the study. A ± 7 day window is permitted around scheduled study visits. The last dose of oral study drug is taken the day prior to the Week 260 visit. Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 and Period 2) Starting at Week 36, subjects who failed to show at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued from study drug treatment. Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment may choose to continue to participate in the study (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks.

At the time of the reported malignancy AE, sites will be asked if any of the below prior and concomitant medication categories contributed to the event. Any medications in these categories used prior to the study will be captured on the appropriate eCRF. Information on the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, highest maintained dose, dosage information including dose, route and frequency, and reason for stopping the medication will be collected in the source documents and appropriate eCRF pages. Medication Categories: ●corticosteroids ●immunosuppressants ●biologic agents ●antineoplastics ●other Vaccines Vaccines recommended by local guidelines should be considered. If the investigator chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval. It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (Tdap). It is recommended that the live herpes zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least 4 weeks (8 weeks in Japan) before first dose of study drug or administered at least 30 days after last dose of oral study drug, or at least 70 days after last dose of subcutaneous study drug. If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of primary varicella (chicken pox), pre-existing immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine. If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered. See Section 5.2.3.3 for a list of commonly used live vaccines."
52,page_52,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 53 The AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy(ies). 5.2.3.1 Prior Therapy All prior drug therapies for PsA (arthritis and psoriasis), since initial diagnosis, must be recorded in the eCRF along with the dates of first and last dose, maximum dosage taken, route of administration and reason for discontinuation, if known. Additionally, the investigator will record response to DMARDs (e.g., no response, inadequate response, loss of response), intolerance to DMARD and/or contraindication for DMARDs. 5.2.3.2 Permitted Background Therapy In Period 1, if subjects are on background DMARDs they should continue on stable treatment of up to 2 non-biologic DMARDs (DMARDs should have been started ≥12 weeks prior to the Baseline visit and without dosing or administration changes ≥4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit). The following non-biologic DMARDs are allowed as background therapy during the study: MTX ( ≤ 25 mg/week), SSZ ( ≤ 3000 mg/day), leflunomide (LEF) ( ≤ 20 mg/day), apremilast ( ≤ 60 mg/day), HCQ (≤ 400 mg/day), bucillamine ( ≤ 300 mg/day) and iguratimod ( ≤ 50 mg/day). In addition, for all subjects taking MTX, subjects should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent, such as folinic acid) throughout study participation. Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed according to Investigator's instructions. No other DMARDs are permitted during the first 36 weeks of study participation in Period 1. At any time, the background DMARD dose may be decreased for safety reasons. AbbVie will not provide background DMARDs or folic acid. In the first 36 weeks of study participation in Period 1, subjects should also continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low-potency opiates (tramadol or combination of acetaminophen with codeine or hydrocodone), oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day). If taking any of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take them as they did at study entry with no change in dose or frequency, including on study visit days. If not taking any of the above at baseline, these"
53,page_53,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 54 should not be initiated except where permitted by protocol (specific time period or protocol-defined rescue). If taking any of the above at baseline on an as-needed basis (PRN), they should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose each time but they should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any study visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements. In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, these medications may be decreased, or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that class. PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is permitted at any time. In Periods 1 and 2, starting at Week 36 (after Week 36 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, 1 intra-articular, trigger point or tender point, intra-bursa, or intra-tendon sheath injections of corticosteroids, dosage and frequency per standard of care, is allowed every 12 weeks. However, corticosteroid injections should be avoided within 21 days prior to the next scheduled study visit to avoid confounding effects of systemic absorption of intra-articular, trigger point or tender point, intra-bursa, and intra-tendon sheath corticosteroids. In addition, at Week 36 (after Week 36 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, initiation of or change in corticosteroids, NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low-potency opiates (tramadol or combination of acetaminophen with codeine or hydrocodone) or adding or changing doses of non-biologic DMARDs (MTX, LEF, SSZ, apremilast, HCQ, bucillamine or iguratimod) is allowed as per local label. Concomitant use of up to 2 non-biologic DMARDs (MTX, LEF, SSZ, apremilast, HCQ, bucillamine or iguratimod) except the combination of MTX and LEF is permitted. Doses of non-biologic DMARDs and oral corticosteroids may not exceed maximums defined above and in inclusion criteria (Section 5.2.1 ). After the Week 16 visit has been completed, a subject who qualifies for rescue therapy will be permitted to add or modify doses of non-biologic DMARDs, NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency opioid medications (tramadol or combination of acetaminophen and codeine or, hydrocodone), oral corticosteroids, and/or receive 1 intra-articular, trigger point or tender point, intra-bursa, or intra-tendon sheath corticosteroid injection for 1 peripheral joint, 1 trigger point, 1 tender point, 1 bursa, or 1 enthesis as"

Corticosteroid injections should be avoided within 21 days prior to the next scheduled study visit to avoid confounding effects of systemic absorption of corticosteroids. In Period 1 and Period 2 permitted topical treatments for Psoriasis (PsO) include: ●Non-medicated shampoos ●Bland (without beta or al pha hydroxy acids, urea or salicylic acid) emollients ●Low potency (Class VI or VII) topical corticosteroids on the palms, soles, face, inframammary area and groin only. Starting at Week 16 (after Week 16 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, subjects may use any therapy for PsO per investigator judgment, with the exception of non-biologic DMARDs which may not be initiated or modified at Week 16 unless non-responder criteria are met as detailed in Section 5.2.3.4 Rescue Therapy. At Week 36 and thereafter, initiation of or change in dose of non-biologic DMARDs is permitted, as described above. 5.2.3.3 Prohibited Therapy Non-Biologic DMARDs Prior exposure to or concomitant use of JAK inhibitors (including but not limited to ruxolitinib [Jakafi®], tofacitinib [Xeljanz®], baricitinib, and filgotinib) is not allowed. Use of MTX in combination with LEF is NOT allowed.

Surgically sterile is defined as: ●bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of both ovaries); or ●bilateral salpingectomy (surgical removal of both fallopian tubes); or ●hysterectomy (surgical removal of uterus) Postmenopausal is defined as: ●Age ≥ 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause; or ●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative medical cause AND a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 40 mIU/mL. If the female subject is < 55 years of age and has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening: ●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential and protocol-specified contraception is required."
60,page_60,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 61 ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post-menopausal status, contraception is not required. ●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre-menopausal status, contraception is required, and pregnancy testing requirements for women of childbearing potential must be followed (see Section 5.3.1.1 pregnancy test). For a female subject at any age: ●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required. ●Female subjects who are surgically sterile (defined above) are not of childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is required. A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the following highly effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study Day 1 (or earlier) through at least 150 days after the last dose of subcutaneous study drug, and at least 30 days after the last dose of oral study drug. ●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. ●Progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit. ●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation (Japan only: bilateral tubal ligation only). ●Vasectomized partner(s) provided the vasectomized partner verbally confirms receipt of medical assessment of the surgical success and is the sole sexual partner of the women of childbearing potential trial participant. ●Intrauterine device (IUD). ●Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)."
61,page_61,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 62 ●True abstinence: Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence for example, using calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods and withdrawal are not acceptable. If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the birth control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence). If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or post-menopausal and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no longer required. It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are specifically intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therapy. Contraception recommendations related to use of concomitant therapies prescribed per standard of care should be based on the local label. Additional local requirements may apply. Refer to Appendix H for local requirements. Contraception Recommendation for Males Based on data from animal studies (including a fertility study) there is no effect of upadacitinib on male reproduction. No contraception is required for male subjects. If a pregnancy occurs, a partner authorization form requesting pregnancy outcome information may be requested from the pregnant partner. Contraception recommendations related to use of concomitant therapies prescribed per standard of care should be based on the local label."

Visits after the Week 36 visit will have a visit window of ± 7 days. If a subject has an out of window visit, the next visit should occur as originally scheduled based on the first date of study drug administration (Baseline Visit). Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are summarized in tabular format in Appendix C . 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of in vivo pharmacodynamic biomarkers (discussed in Section 5.3.1.2 ), exploratory research and validation studies (discussed in Section 5.3.1.2), drug concentration measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2), the collection of prior and concomitant medication information (discussed in Section 5.2.3), and the collection of AE information (discussed in Section 6.0). All study data will be recorded in source documents and on the appropriate eCRFs. Informed Consent At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, IEC/IRB approved, informed consent form before any study procedures are performed or any medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study. Separate written consent will be required for each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory research and validation studies. The separate written consent may be part of the main consent form. Subjects can withdraw informed consent at any time. Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3."
63,page_63,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 64 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits. Medical/Surgical History A complete non-PsA medical and surgical history, including history of alcohol use and nicotine use will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit. Additionally, a list of each subjects' PsA and PsO related medical and surgical history will be recorded at Screening. History of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history. An updated medical history will be obtained prior to study drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment. A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factors will be documented in the study source documentation. This information will include BCG vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic locations. Vital Signs, Weight and Height Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate (counted for at least 30 seconds after 5 minutes in sitting position), respiratory rate, body weight, and body temperature will be obtained at the designated study visits in Appendix C . Vital signs should be performed before blood draws and prior to receipt of study drug. Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off). All measurements will be recorded in metric units where applicable. Physical Exam A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Appendix C . The physical examination at the Baseline Visit will serve as the baseline physical examination for the entire study. Physical examination abnormalities"
64,page_64,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 65 noted by the Investigator at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study drug should be recorded in the subject's medical history. Abnormalities noted after the Baseline Visit and first dose of study drug should be evaluated and documented by the Investigator as to whether or not these are AEs. All findings whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history should be captured on the appropriate eCRF page. A symptom-directed physical examination will be performed when necessary. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at the Screening and Week 56 Visit. A qualified physician will interpret the clinical significance of any abnormal finding, sign, and date each ECG. ECGs with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Friedericia's correction formula (QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed. In these cases, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into the appropriate eCRF for comparison as well. A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular conduction abnormalities. In addition, any clinically significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF. Each signed original ECG will be kept with subject's source documents onsite. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required, provided all protocol required documentation is available and nothing has changed in the subject's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test. If there are clinically significant findings, the Investigator must contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling the subject. Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator."

All subjects who fail to attain at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x-ray examination at Week 16. All subjects will receive x-rays of hands and feet if they discontinue from the study or from study drug at Week 12 or later and it has been at least 12 weeks from when x-rays were last obtained during Period 1 or at least 24 weeks during Period 2. In such subjects, x-rays should be obtained as close as possible to the date of study drug discontinuation. For subjects who re-screen: Provided the conditions outlined in the imaging manual are met, if the subject had x-rays of hands and feet performed within 12 weeks of re-screening these tests will not be required for re-screening. Radiographs will be sent to the designated central imaging vendor and will be interpreted by an experienced reader selected for the study, who will make the final determination as to whether a subject has at least 1 erosion. The imaging vendor will return an eligibility notification report to the site as outlined in the central imaging documents. Further details regarding the specific imaging techniques to be used will be provided in an imaging manual from AbbVie or designee. The Investigator or their qualified delegate should read the Screening visit x-rays of the hands and feet to determine if the subject fulfills item 5 of the CASPAR criteria (Appendix G ). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all delegates are qualified and that all training is documented. Chest X-Ray (CXR) A CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views) is required:"

The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previously normal CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views) within 90 days of Screening, provided all source documentation is available at the site as outlined below and provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. ●Annually for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified by the TB risk assessment form ( Appendix E ), subjects living in areas endemic for TB, and subjects with newly positive PPD and/or QuantiFERON-TB Gold test or equivalents after baseline. Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any time during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the Investigator. A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform an assessment of the CXR. The Principal Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any findings and will sign and date the report. In the assessment of the CXR (review of images required), a radiologist, the Principal Investigator or their physician delegate must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB. If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, apical or basilar pleural thickening) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD before enrolling the subject. Pregnancy Test A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the Screening Visit. The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure.

At each visit, the study staff should review the pregnancy avoidance recommendations with each subject of childbearing potential and document this discussion in the subject's source records. If during the course of the study a woman becomes surgically sterile or post-menopausal and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy testing is no longer required. A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation in this study or be allowed to continue study drug. TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis The TB screening tests provide diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's epidemiology, history, exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, or latent TB. At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form ( Appendix E ) and tested for TB infection by QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. The PPD Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines). The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. The TB risk assessment form will be completed annually for all subjects, regardless of TB test results. One or more ""yes"" response on the TB risk assessment form indicates increased risk of TB. At annual evaluations, questions on the TB risk assessment form should be answered considering the previous year when the timeframe is not indicated in the question. If a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test cannot be performed by the Central Lab at Screening and a subject had a negative PPD within 90 days prior to Screening and source"

These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. In cases where the annual QuantiFERON-TB Gold test by the central laboratory is positive and the investigator considers the subject at low risk for TB (i.e., no risk factors identified on the TB risk questionnaire) and has no clinical suspicion of TB, the investigator may perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory if not locally available) to confirm the positive test result. If repeat testing result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive, the test is considered positive. For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an annual TB re-test will be performed. If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x-ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB. Expert consultation can be considered per Investigator's discretion. Any positive TB screen after the patient has started the study, should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). Subjects with documentation of a prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or equivalent) or PPD are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive. TB test: ●For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON-TB Gold testing, both will be performed. If either PPD or QuantiFERON-TB Gold is positive, the TB test is considered positive. ●If a site has the capacity to perform both PPD and QuantiFERON-TB Gold tests, and local guidelines require only one test to be performed, then the QuantiFERON-TB Gold is the preferred test. At a site with capacity to"

Similarly, if a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold test alone or other IGRA (negative result), then the subject should have their annual TB test performed with QuantiFERON-TB Gold test. ●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test and the PPD Skin Test are required per local guidelines): the PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test) will be performed according to standard clinical practice. The TB Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm"" not ""negative."" Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past should not be re-exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered positive. ●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or through the central laboratory, if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result. If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of this study. If the testing result is negative, then the patient is considered to be negative. ●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (such as T-SPOT TB test) may be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold. Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x-ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be enrolled. Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR. Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below). Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled."

If the Investigator deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert could be considered. Of note: Rifampin (Rifampicin) or Rifapentine are not allowed for TB prophylaxis.Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant repeat treatment. For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy, but insufficient documentation, the investigator should consult with the AbbVie TA MD. Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source documents. Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF. During the study, subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophylactic treatment immediately per local guidelines and complete at least 6 months of prophylaxis. Study drug(s) should not be withheld. Two to 4 weeks later the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms of toxicity to TB prophylaxis. If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspicious for TB or something has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test before the next scheduledannual TB re-test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director."

Four anatomic sites – head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities – are assessed for erythema, induration and desquamation using a 5-point scale. Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site, the area affected is assigned a numerical value. Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to approximately 10, 20, 30 and 40% of body surface area, respectively; the PASI score is calculated using the formula: PASI = 0.1(E h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.3(E t+ It+ D t)At + 0.4(E l+ Il + D l)Al Where E, I, D , and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, u, t , and l denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively. PASI scores range from 0.0 to 72.0 with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree. Typically scores of 3 or less represent mild disease, scores over 3 and up and including 15 represent moderate disease and scores over 15 are considered to be associated with severe disease. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. Body Surface Area (BSA) – Psoriasis The subject's right or left hand should be selected as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1%. Measurement of the total area of involvement is aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimating the total area involved."

The assessment should begin with visual inspection of the hands and feet. For each pair of digits in which one or both digits appear dactylitic, the circumference of the affected digits (both right and left side) will be assessed using a dactylometer. Additionally, the affected digit pairs will be assessed for tenderness by squeezing the digital shaft mid-way between the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints and will be recorded as tenderness, yes or no. Tenderness should not be assessed by squeezing the joint lines. Digits injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection.

Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present, absent, or not assessed for each of the 18 sites. For scoring purposes, the inferior patella and tibial tuberosity are considered to be one site due to their anatomical proximity. The overall score range is 0 – 16. Enthesitis sites injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. The Lateral epicondyle and Achilles tendon insertion will only need to be assessed once since the 2 bilateral sites overlap between the LEI and SPARCC Enthesitis Index. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. Psoriatic Spondylitis This evaluation will be conducted at Baseline only as a single question asking the investigator to take into consideration all that is known about the subject to assess whether or not the subject has psoriatic spondylitis. Responses will be recorded as yes or no. This evaluation should be assessed by the rheumatologist investigator. 5.3.1.2 Optional Samples for Exploratory Research and Validation Studies Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research and validation studies. Subjects may still participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in the optional collection of samples for exploratory research/validation studies. Exploratory research can help to improve our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs and our ability to predict which subjects would benefit from receiving specific therapies. In addition, exploratory research may help to improve our understanding of how to diagnose and assess/monitor PsA by assessing associations between disease characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests."

For Japan only: The research on DNA and RNA exploratory research samples will be restricted to the subject's response to the treatment in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the exploratory research/validation studies samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples will be retained while research on ABT-494 (or drugs of this class) or PsA and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion. All subjects are preferred to have been fasting for a minimum of 8 hours prior to sample collection. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation. The following samples will be collected according to Appendix D for each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory research/validation studies: ●DNA samples for pharmacogenetic or epigenetic analyses; ●RNA samples for transcriptomic and/or epigenetic analyses; ●Serum and plasma samples for systemic analyses, including but not limited to proteomic and metabolomics; ●Urine samples, including but not limited to targeted protein and metabolomic analyses.

Instructions for the preparation and shipment of the samples will be provided in the laboratory manual. 5.3.2 Drug Concentration Measurements Blood Samples for ABT-494 PK Assay (Period 1 Only) Blood samples (plasma) for assay of ABT-494 and possibly other medications will be collected as follows ( Appendix C ): ●Weeks 2 and 4 prior to oral study drug dosing; ●Weeks 8 and beyond at any time during the visit. For subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug treatment prior to Week 56, at any time during the PD visit. On Week 2 and Week 4 visit days, if possible, subjects should take the oral study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample, except if the subjects regularly take the study drug dose at night. Those subjects who regularly take the oral study drug dose at night should continue to take study drug according to their normal schedule. For all other visits, subjects can take the study drug dose on visit days at their regular schedule and not necessarily at the clinic. For all PK samples, the date and accurate time of the PK sample collection will be recorded on the lab requisition form. The date and accurate time of the last two study drug doses will be recorded on the eCRF to the nearest minute.

Additional parameters for ABT-494 may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. 5.3.6 Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies Optional samples may be collected to conduct exploratory investigations into known and novel biomarkers. The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to: nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites. For Japan only: The research on DNA and RNA exploratory research samples will be restricted to the subject's response to the treatment in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Biomarker assessments may be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures. These assessments may be explored in the context of PsA or related conditions and/or ABT-494 or drugs of similar classes. The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the study report. The samples may also be used to develop new therapies, research methods or technologies. In addition, samples from this study may be banked for future use. Samples may then be used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a prospective study, leading to the development of diagnostic tests."

In addition, all future rescue and efficacy driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply. Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early. If a subject is discontinued from study drug, the procedures outlined for the PD Visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks of the last dose of study drug, and preferably prior to the initiation of another therapy. In addition, if subject is willing, 30-day follow-up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) may occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. For subjects on subcutaneous study drug, if the subject is willing, a 70-day follow-up phone call may occur to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs, the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs, and medications used to treat AEs/SAEs. Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely after randomization will not be replaced.

Following discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment. Lost to Follow-Up For subjects that are considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to obtain information on the final status of the subject. At a minimum, two phone calls must be made and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documents. 5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination. The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. 5.5 Treatments 5.5.1 Treatments Administered There are two active study drugs in this study. The first is daily ABT-494 and the second is ADA eow. ABT-494 (or matching placebo) will be taken orally once daily, beginning on Day 1 (Baseline), and should be taken at approximately the same time each day. The study drug can be taken with or without food. Subjects will continue their stable background non-biologic DMARD therapy. AbbVie will not supply background DMARDs."

Before the study is initiated, IRT directions will be provided to each site. At the Screening Visit, subjects will be assigned a unique subject number by the IRT. The unique subject number will be used for each subject throughout the study. For subjects that re-screen, the Screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial Screening visit should be used; a new Screening number should not be requested. Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be centrally randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups at Baseline (Day 1) as follows: ●Group 1: ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 410) ●Group 2: ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 410) ●Group 3: ADA (40 mg every other week [eow]) (N = 410) ●Group 4: Placebo followed by ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 205) ●Group 5: Placebo followed by ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 205)"

IRT will provide the appropriate study drug kit number(s) to dispense to each subject. Study drug will be administered at the study visits as summarized in Section 5.3.1.1. Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to any subject. 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Subjects should take study drugs as outlined in Section 5.5.1. On dosing days that occur on study visit days, subjects should follow the regular dosing schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2 regarding Week 2 and Week 4 visits). Each subject's dosing schedule should be closely monitored by the site at each study visit through Week 151 by careful review of the subject's diary.

In order to maintain the blind, the ABT-494/placebo tablets and adalimumab/matching placebo syringes provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IRT will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information inthe case of medical emergency. In the event of a medical situation that requires unblinding of the study drug assignment, the Investigator is requested to contact the AbbVie TA MD prior to breaking the blind. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting the AbbVie TA MD, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie notification or agreement. Unblinding is available in the IRT system via the Unblind Subject transaction, which is available only to the Investigator. If the IRT system is unavailable, unblinding may occur by contacting EndPoint technical support via either phone (preferred) or email (support@endpointclinical.com). For country-specific phone numbers, please see the following website: http://www.endpointclinical.com/helpdesk/. In the event that the blind is broken before notification to the AbbVie TA MD, AbbVie requests that the AbbVie TA MD be notified within 24 hours of the blind being broken. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to AbbVie and recorded on the appropriate eCRF. After the last subject completes the Week 24 visit the Sponsor will be unblinded to study drug assignment to facilitate regulatory filings.

If necessary to ensure subject safety, the DMC will also be given access to selected efficacy data which will be specified in the DMC charter. The primary responsibility of the DMC will be to protect the safety of the subjects participating in this study. Additionally, the external DMC will review efficacy data after at least 600 subjects have completed the Week 12 Visit or have prematurely discontinued from the study. The interim analysis is to assess if the study met the pre-defined No-Go boundary for the primary endpoint ACR20. A DMC charter will be prepared for the safety and efficacy data review outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety and efficacy data to be assessed. Communications from the DMC to the Study Team will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. 5.5.6 Treatment Compliance The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Subject dosing will be recorded on a subject diary through Week 151. Subjects will be instructed to return all drug containers (even if empty) to the study site personnel at each clinic visit.

This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt or similar document and by registering the arrival of drug through the IRT. The original Proof of Receipt Note and the IRT confirmation sheet will be kept in the site files as a record of what was received. In addition, an IRT will be used to document investigational product accountability including but not limited to date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date dispensed, subject number, and the identification of the person dispensing the drug. All empty/used study drug packaging including pre-filled syringes will be inventoried by the site. Each subject will be given their own Sharps container to dispose of used syringes. Empty/used study drug packaging and Sharps containers should be returned by the subject at each visit for accountability and compliance purposes. Site staff will complete study drug accountability via IRT, source documents, subject dosing diaries, empty IP boxes and by visually inspecting the packaging whenever possible. After drug accountability has been completed by the site, empty used packaging may be discarded with any subject identifiers removed or returned to AbbVie-designated destruction depot. Unused study drug and used packaging with remaining study drug will be destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the AbbVie-designated destruction depot (for those sites that do not meet AbbVie's documentation requirements for on-site destruction). For sites performing on-site drug destruction or using a third-party vendor for drug destruction a copy of the destruction methodology and date of destruction/date prepared for destruction should be maintained at the site's facility.

Period 1 is 56-weeks in duration and includes a 24 week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and active-comparator controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of blinded, active comparator-controlled treatment (Weeks 24 – 56). Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and ABT-494 30 mg versus placebo and versus ADA 40 mg eow in subjects withmoderately to severely active PsA who have an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARD therapy. Period 1 is designed to test the superiority of ABT-494 versus placebo for achieving the primary endpoint (ACR20 at Week 12) and other efficacy parameters atWeeks 12 – 24, and to test non-inferiority of ABT-494 versus adalimumab (ACR20 at Week 12). At Week 24 all subjects will be given ABT-494 and will continue on blinded treatment until all subjects have completed the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56). This will allow unbiased assessments of long-term safety of ABT-494 without compromising the study conduct or results of the ongoing study. In addition, the blinded study design will allow the assessment of the maintenance of treatment response of both doses in an unbiased manner during the first year of the study. The purpose of Period 2 is to further evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 (15 mg QD and 30 mg QD) in PsA subjects who have completed Period 1. All subjects will continue treatment to which they were assigned at the end of Period 1 in a blinded manner. When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study drug assignment will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion until the completion of Period 2."
105,page_105,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 106 Adalimumab was first approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of PsA in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and is considered standard of care. Additional updates regarding approved indications and safety can be found in the current edition of the Package Insert and Summary of Product Characteristics. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. Efficacy measurements in this study have been selected or designed to assess disease activity in subjects with PsA. Other than the biomarker analyses which are exploratory, all clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population The intended study population is moderately to severely active PsA patients who have had an inadequate response to prior non-biologic DMARD treatment. Key entry criteria are to enroll adult female and male subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of PsA and who fulfill the CASPAR criteria with symptoms for at least 6 months. Eligible study subjects must have ≥ 3 swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) and ≥ 3 tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening and Baseline Visits, and either ≥ 1 erosion on x-ray of the hands or feet as determined by the central imaging reader or an elevated hs-CRP > laboratory defined ULN) at Screening. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study The doses of ABT-494 selected for this study, 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, dosed up to approximately 5 years, are expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety profile. Two doses of ABT-494 have been selected for this study in order to perform limited dose ranging in subjects with PsA. The ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD doses were selected as they are expected to demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of patients with PsA while limiting potential drug-related effects on laboratory parameters (e.g., hemoglobin). Doses of 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD are the doses that are currently being evaluated in Phase 3 trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The doses being evaluated in the RA Phase 3"
106,page_106,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 107 trials are considered appropriate for investigation in PsA as (1) effects of ABT-494 on tender and swollen joints, markers of inflammation, and ACR responses are expected to be similar in RA and PsA; and (2) proof of concept has been demonstrated with another JAK inhibitor (tofacitanib) at the doses that are efficacious in RA. In addition, in RA the plateau for efficacy was achieved by exposures equivalent to 30 mg QD, indicating that higher doses may not provide greater therapeutic benefit. Results from two Phase 2b trials in subjects with RA with the ABT-494 immediate release capsule formulation indicate that all evaluated doses (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were generally well tolerated and without unexpected safety concerns. The Phase 2 dose-response and exposure-response results in RA show that the 6 mg BID dose approaches the plateau of efficacy, and increasing the dose to 12 mg BID appears to result in some incremental efficacy benefit, particularly in the more refractory subjects with inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF biologic therapy. Therefore, ABT-494 exposures associated with 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID were selected as the target exposures to evaluate in Phase 3 trials in RA. In order to enhance patients' compliance and to provide a more convenient dosing regimen than BID administration, AbbVie developed a once-daily tablet formulation which will be used in the current study. A bioavailability study has demonstrated that 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD regimens of the once-daily tablet formulation provide equivalent daily AUC and comparable C max, and Cminto 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID, respectively, of the immediate-release capsule formulation used in Phase 2 studies in RA. The mean exposures (AUC and C max) for the highest dose that will be evaluated in this study (30 mg QD) are predicted to be lower than the exposures associated with the no- observed-adverse-effect level in the 9-mont h GLP preclinical toxicology study in dogs (1.5 mg/kg/day) and lower than the highest mean ABT-494 exposures evaluated in healthy subjects or in patients in previous clinical studies."

Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2). For adverse events (AE), please refer to Section 6.1. For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events (SAE) considered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event. For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a"
108,page_108,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 109 causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. Expected manifestations of PsA (i.e., psoriasis, joint pain and swelling, dactylitis, enthesitis, etc.) are not to be recorded as AEs unless the manifestation is considered to be a disease flare (worsening) of the underlying condition. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject."

This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life- threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form."

No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated."

AbbVie is participating in an FDA-requested, TNF inhibitor class wide exploration of the rare appearance of malignancy in subjects/patients who are 30 years of age or younger at the time of diagnosis. The risk of malignancy in this age group has not been established and is difficult to study due to its rarity. AbbVie appreciates your attention to the additional reporting requirements needed in this unlikely event. In the event of a SAE, and additionally, any nonserious event of malignancy in subjects 30 years of age and younger, whether related to subcutaneous study drug or not, the physician will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the physician becoming aware of the event by entering the SAE or nonserious event of malignancy in subjects 30 years of age and younger data into the electronic data capture (EDC) system. SAEs that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE ®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE."

Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued from study drug treatment (Section 5.4.1). Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. Pregnancies in study subjects and female partners of male subjects will be collected from the date of the first dose through 30 days of the last dose of oral study drug and 150 days following the last dose of subcutaneous study drug. Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an AE. The medical outcome for either mother or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous abortion is considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. Female subjects should avoid pregnancy throughout the course of the study, starting with the Screening Visit through 150 days after the last subcutaneous study drug administration for female subjects and through 30 days after the last oral study drug administration. Results of a positive pregnancy test or confirmation of a pregnancy will be assessed starting with the Screening Visit through the final study visit. In the event of pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome."
116,page_116,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 117 6.1.7 Toxicity Management The toxicity management of the AEs including AESIs consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safety issues by an independent external data monitoring committee), interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from study drug. The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below. For subjects who have had study drug discontinued and are instead on standard of care therapies, these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab) and any intolerability to standard of care therapies should be managed by the prescribing physician. Serious Infections: Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug. Study drug should be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection. A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject. As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the subject should be closely monitored. Re-challenge with study drug may occur once the infection has been successfully treated. Subjects who develop active TB must be permanently discontinued from study drug. See Section 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject for study drug interruption guidelines. Herpes zoster: If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting study drug until the episode resolves.Gastrointestinal Perforation: Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and treatment. If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug."
117,page_117,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 118 Cardiovascular Events (MACE): Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should be carefully monitored. These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner. Malignancy: Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug. Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. Muscle-related symptoms: If a subject experiences symptoms suggestive of myositis or rhabdomyolysis, consider checking CPK and aldolase with clinical management and/or study drug interruption as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Thrombosis Events: Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug. ECG Abnormality: Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered clinically significant and with a reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > 500 msec. Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities: For any given laboratory abnormality, the Investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment following any local guidelines. Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table 4 and may require an appropriate supplemental eCRF be completed. All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be followed to a satisfactory resolution. If a repeat test is required per Table 4, the repeat testing must occur as soon as possible."

A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing will require immediate interruption of study drug (unless not acceptable by local practices) and a hepatologist consultation should occur within 1 week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment. Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate. If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented appropriately in the eCRF. If ALT or AST values return to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be restarted. If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe. If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug.

Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint condition. In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days. If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return. The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required. 7.0 Protocol Deviations AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator is responsible for notifying Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and the following AbbVie Clinical Monitor(s):"

A final analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed the last visit of the study. Completed and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized prior to the first unblinded analysis (Week 24 analysis). The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS ®(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 8.1.1 Analysis Populations 8.1.1.1 Full Analysis Set (FAS) The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. The FAS will be used for all efficacy and baseline analyses. 8.1.1.2 Per Protocol Analysis Set The Per Protocol Analysis Set represents a subset of the FAS and consists of all FAS subjects who did not have major protocol violations which are expected to impact the primary endpoint. Additional analysis may be conducted on the Per Protocol analysis set, in order to evaluate the impact of major protocol violations. The Per Protocol Analysis Set will be determined prior to the Week 24 analysis. 8.1.1.3 Safety Analysis Set The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. For the Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless of the treatment randomized. 8.1.2 Subject Accountability, Disposition and Study Drug Exposure 8.1.2.1 Subject Accountability The following will be summarized by site and by treatment group as well as overall, separately for Period 1 and Period 2 as appropriate: the number of subjects randomized,"

Reasons for premature discontinuation of study drug and study participation will be summarized separately for all randomized subjects by treatment group and overall, with frequencies and percentages by reason for discontinuation. 8.1.2.3 Study Drug Exposure Exposure to study drug will be summarized for the Safety Analysis Set for Period 1 alone as well as for Period 1 and Period 2 combined. The exposure to study drug (days) will be summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median, and range for each treatment group. The exposure to study drug is defined as the difference between the dates of the first and last doses of the study drug plus 1 day for oral study drug and plus 14 days for injectable study drug. Study drug compliance will be summarized for each treatment group for Period 1. The compliance for oral study drug is defined as the total number of tablets taken divided by the total number of tablets a subject is supposed to take during Period 1. The compliance for injectable study drug is defined as the total number of injections received divided by the total number of injections a subject is supposed to receive during Period 1. 8.1.3 Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group and overall for the FAS. For the purpose of this analysis, baseline data for each subject will be the data collected prior to the first dose of study drug."
126,page_126,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 127 Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, and range. For discrete variables, frequencies and percentages for each category will be summarized. Medical history will be presented by counts and percentages of subjects, broken down by Body System and Diagnosis. Prior therapy and medication will be summarized by treatment group. Prior therapy and medication will include all therapies and medications with a start date prior to the date of first dose of study drug. Concomitant medications will also be summarized with frequencies and percentages for each treatment group. All medications administered during study drug exposure will be included. 8.1.4 Efficacy Analysis All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the FAS population, which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. 8.1.4.1 Primary Efficacy Variable Analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as randomized. Comparison of the primary endpoint will be made between each ABT-494 dose group and the combined placebo groups using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors. For the primary analysis, Non-Responder Imputation (NRI) will be used. The analysis will be repeated using Observed Cases (OC). Supportive analysis will also be conducted on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. The primary efficacy analyses will also be performed in demographic subgroups including age, gender, race, body mass index, and geographical region to assess the consistency of the treatment effect. Additional subgroup analyses based on baseline disease characteristics and stratification factors will also be conducted."
127,page_127,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 128 8.1.4.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Variables Unless otherwise specified, comparisons are between each dose group of ABT-494 and the combined placebo group. For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group. Similar analyses as for the primary endpoi nt will be conducted. For ACR20 response rate at Week 12, analysis will be conducted to assess the non-inferiority of each ABT-494 dose versus ADA on placebo-subtracted treatment difference using Koch's 3-arm test statistic. Non-inferiority will be claimed if ABT-494 preserves at least 50% of the placebo-subtracted ADA effect, i.e., the multiplicity adjusted lower confidence limit for the ratio of placebo-subtracted ABT-494 ACR20 rate versus the placebo-subtracted ADA ACR20 rate is at least 50%. Superiority of ABT-494 versus ADA will also be tested for ACR20 at Week 12. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported for each treatment group. Pairwise comparisons between each ABT-494 dose group and the combined placebo groups will be carried out using the Mixed-Effects Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates. For change from baseline in Patient's Assessment of Pain NRS and change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, superiority of ABT-494 vs ADA will also be tested. 8.1.4.3 Additional Efficacy Variables Additional efficacy variables as listed in Section 5.3.3.3 will be summarized for all visits. For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported by treatment group by visit. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be reported by treatment group by visit."
128,page_128,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 129 8.1.4.4 Multiplicity Control for the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints The overall type I error rate of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure.47,48 Specifically, the testing will utilize the endpoint sequence of primary endpoint followed by key secondary endpoints in the order as specified in Section 5.3.3.2, and will begin with testing the primary endpoint using α of 0.025 for each dose. Continued testing will follow a pre-specified α transfer path which includes downstream transfer along the endpoint sequence within each dose as well as cross-dose transfer. More details of the graphical procedure will be specified in the SAP. 8.1.4.5 Imputation Methods The following methods will be used for missing data imputation: Observed Cases (OC): The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC analysis for that visit. Multiple Imputation (MI): The MI analysis imputes missing data multiple times under appropriate random variation and thus generates multiple imputed ""pseudo-complete"" datasets. Results will be aggregated across the multiple imputed datasets, overcoming drawbacks of the single imputation methods. Non-Responder Imputation (NRI): NRI applies to binary endpoints only. In NRI analysis, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug will be considered non- responders for visits after the discontinuation. Linear Extrapolation for Radiographic Data: For radiographic data (i.e., SHS-based endpoints), if a subject prematurely discontinued before Week 24/56, their Week 24/56 data will be imputed assuming a linear relationship between baseline and the time point when x-ray should be collected."
129,page_129,"ABT-494 M15-572 Protocol Amendment 6 EudraCT 2016-004130-24 130 Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM): The MMRM includes treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate. For non-radiographic data, the NRI approach will serve as the primary analysis approach for binary endpoints. Analysis for key binary endpoints will also be repeated using OC. The mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) will serve as the primary analysis for key continuous endpoints at Week 12 which are prior to potential modification of background therapy. The Multiple Imputation (MI) approach will serve as the primary analysis for key continuous endpoints at Week 24. A Missing Not At Random (MNAR) model that varies assumptions for the missing data in active treatment groups and placebo groups may be used as a sensitivity analysis for important continuous endpoints to account for potential deviation from the missing at random assumption. For radiographic data, both linear extrapolation and as-observed analysis will be conducted. 8.1.4.6 Interim Analysis An unblinded interim efficacy analysis will be conducted by an independent external DMC after at least 600 subjects have completed the Week 12 Visit or have prematurely discontinued from the study. The interim analysis is to assess if the study met the pre-defined No-Go boundary for the primary endpoint ACR20. A futility recommendation will be made only when both the ABT-494 15 mg and 30 mg QD doses meet the futility criteria. Details of the decision making rules will be specified in a separate DMC charter. 8.1.4.7 Long-Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined The efficacy variables are listed in Section 5.3.3.3 and will be summarized for all visits. Long-term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be summarized. For continuous endpoints, the mean and standard deviation will be reported."

There will be two sets of planned safety analysis: safety analysis by Week 24, and long-term safety analysis. Safety analyses are based on treatments actually received. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary, by system organ class, by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator will be provided. The vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed in a descriptive manner. Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated. Missing safety data will not be imputed. 8.1.5.2 Analysis of Adverse Events Unless otherwise specified, the following conventions apply for both sets of safety analysis. 8.1.5.2.1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) AEs will be coded using MedDRA. A TEAE is defined as AE that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug. AEs starting more than 70 days following the last dose of study drug for subjects on ADA and AEs starting more than 30 days following the last dose of study drug for subjects on ABT-494 or PBO will not be included in summaries of TEAEs. As a general safety summary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be summarized for each treatment group for the following AE categories:"

Additional AEs may be considered for tabulation/summary based on recommendations from the TA MD and Pharmacovigilance and Patient Safety as deemed appropriate. TEAEs will be summarized and presented by system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) using MedDRA. The SOCs will be presented in alphabetical order, and the PTs will be presented in alphabetical order within each SOC. TEAE will also be summarized by maximum severity and by maximum relationship.The AESIs listed in Section 6.1.1.3 will be summarized. Event rate (per 100 patient years) for AESIs will also be summarized for the long-term safety analysis.All AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will be presented in listing format. A listing by treatment group of TEAEs grouped by SOC and MedDRA preferred term with subject identification numbers will be generated. 8.1.5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events and Death All treatment-emergent SAEs and AEs leading to death will also be presented in listing format. In addition, SAEs will be summarized by SOC and MedDRA PT."

Baseline values are defined as the last non-missing measurements recorded on or before the date of the first dose of study drug in Period 1. The laboratory data will be categorized as Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 based on National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The shift tables will tabulate the number and percentage of subjects with baseline and post-baseline values by the above categories. Descriptive summary and listings will be provided for potentially clinically significant laboratory values and vital signs. 8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses Individual ABT-494 plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and summarized with appropriate statistical methods. Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses. Population PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The CL/F and V/F of ABT-494 will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The relationship between the conditional estimates of CL/F andV/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful"

Relationships between ABT-494 exposure and clinical observations will be explored. The effect of meaningful covariates (e.g., body weight) on the exposure-response relationships for efficacy measures (e.g., ACR andPASI) in PsA patients will be evaluated. Results of the PK and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report, rather than in the CSR. Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The planned sample size of approximately 1640 for this study (with 2:2:2:1:1 randomization ratio for ABT-494 15 mg, ABT-494 30 mg, adalimumab and placebo subjects) provides at least 90% power for a 20% difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of 30%). It will also provide at least 90% power for the majority of the key secondary endpoints. With the given sample size, there is approximately 90% power to detect a standardized effect size of 0.26 in change from baseline in SHS for each ABT-494 dose group versus the combined placebo group at Week 24. 49 This sample size will also provide at least 85% power for evaluating non- inferiority for each ABT-494 dose group vs. ADA in ACR20 response rate at Week 12 assuming 50% ACR20 response rates for ADA and ABT-494 and 30% ACR20 response rates for placebo. All power and sample size calculations are performed at two-sided significance level of 0.025 and accounting for a 10% dropout rate. 8.3 Randomization Methods Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of the five treatment sequences per study design diagram Figure 1 . Randomization will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of"

Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A . 9.3 Subject Information and Consent The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer all questions regarding this study. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by the subject, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy. Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form. Samples for exploratory research/validation studies will only be collected if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory research/validation studies, approved by an IEC/IRB, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions. The separate written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples are collected and testing is performed. If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study. In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional exploratory research/validation samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples. If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once AbbVie is informed, the optional samples will be destroyed. However, if the subject withdraws"

Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a password-protected method of internet access. Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study. Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data. It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media. Electronic Patient Reported Data: Patient reported data must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study. Some of these data are being collected with an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) system called Trialmanager, provided by the technology vendor CRF Health of Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA. The ePRO system is in compliance with Title 21 CFR Part 11. The documentation related to the system validation of the ePRO system is available through the vendor, CRF Health, while the user acceptance testing of the study-specific PRO design will be conducted and maintained at AbbVie. The subject will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded to a server. The data on the server will be considered source, and maintained and managed by CRF Health. The ePRO data will be collected electronically via a Tablet device into which the patient will directly enter the required pieces of information. The electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for patients to complete more than one of the same assessments at any one visit. All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by CRF Health. The Investigator and delegated staff will be able to access all uploaded patient entered data via a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the study archive."

This on-site visit is 30 days after the last dose of study drug. For those subjects who prematurely discontinue from the stu dy (withdrawal of informed consent) a 30-day follow-up phone call (and not an on-site visit) may be allowed for subjects who have completed the PD visit to determine the st atus of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. The 70-day follow-up phone call is to take place 70 days after the last dose of study drug. T he 70-day follow-up phone call is also for those subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study (withdrawal of informed consent). Subjects completing the study on O L therapy will only be required to have the 30-day follow-up visit if on oral study drug and the 70-day follow-up call if on injectable study drug. The 30-day follow-up v isit and 70-day follow-up call are not required for subjects who discontinued study drug and continued study participation with completion of at least one study visit approxim ately 30 days or 70 days after last dose of study drug, respectively. c. Obtain informed consent prior to performing any study related procedures. d. Note herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history. e. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, body weight, and respiratory rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.f. Height will be measured at Screening visit only (with shoes off). g. For concomitant medications, at Week 36 (after Week 36 assessments have been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add n on-biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 non-biologic DMARDs, except the combination of MTX and leflunomide), or increase DMARD dose. h. For Period 1 (up to and including Week 56 visit), a full physical exam is required at the visits indicated. A symptom-directe d physical exam may be performed when necessary. For Period 2 (after Week 56), a full physical exam is required approximately every 24 weeks (Wk 80, Wk 104, Wk 128, Wk 152, Wk 176, Wk 200, Wk 224 visits) and at the Wk 260/PD visit.

For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required; provided al l protocol-required documentation is available and nothing has changed in the subject's health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test. If required by country regulatory authorities, an annual ECG will be performed. j. HIV testing will be performed at Screening. The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health a gencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive re sult, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A sub ject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result. k. The screening chest x-ray will not be required if a subject had a previously normal chest-x-ray (posterior-anterior and lateral views) within 90 days of Screening, provided that all protocol-required documentation is available at the site and nothing has changed in the subject's health status since the t ime of the test that warrants a repeat test (refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements). l. Obtain a chest x-ray annually for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified by the TB risk assessment form, subjects living in areas endemic for TB, and subjects with a newly positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (and/or PPD skin test) after baseline. In the case a subject prematurely discon tinues from the study drug a chest x-ray should not be performed if it has been less than 48 weeks since the last examination. m. X-rays of hands and feet will be performed for all subjects at Screening, Wk 24, Wk 56, Wk 104, Wk 152 and Wk 260/PD visits. All subjects who fail to attain at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x-ray examination at Week 16. An x-ray examinatio n at Week 16 is not required for subjects with at least a 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16. All subjects will receive x-rays of hands and feet if they discontinue from the study or from study drug at Week 12 or later and it has been at least 12 weeks from when x-rays were last obtained during Pe riod 1 or at least 24 weeks during Period 2. n. Randomization is permitted prior to results of the central reading of hand and foot x-rays for eligibility if a subject has a n elevated hs-CRP available from the central laboratory and all other criteria are met. o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test at Screening and if any urine pregnancy test is pos itive at any time during the study. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure. If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). If still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details. p. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits. M ore frequent pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study if required per local/country requirements. If urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is ne gative, begin or continue dosing. If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from study drug treatment. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details."

If a urine pregnancy test is positive, the subject must stop dosing, come into the clinic and have blood drawn for a serum pregnancy test that will be analy zed at the central laboratory. A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study. The monthly at home tests between sc heduled on-site visits are to occur at Weeks 40, 48, 52, 60, 64, 72, 76, 84, 88, 96, 100, 108, 112, 120, 124, 132, 136, 144, 148, 156, 160, 168, 172, 180, 184, 192, 196, 204, 208, 216, 220, 228, 232, 240, 244, 252, and 256. r. Latent TB risk factor questionnaire will be obtained at Screening and annually thereafter through study participation. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements for TB testing and TB Prophylaxis. s. TB testing will be performed at Screening and annually thereafter through study participation. In the case a subject prematu rely discontinues from the study drug TB testing should not be performed if it has been less than 48 weeks since the last test was obtained. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 for specific requirements for TB testing and TB Prophylaxis. t. Minimum 8-hour fast. If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting statu s will be recorded in study source documentation. u. Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs-CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, or the subject. For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin. Results of tests such as hs-CRP, and procalcitonin may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety as sessment or adverse event management. Any local hs- CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests reported to the investigator until a subject is known to receive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is unblinded will be recorded as protocol deviations. v. If required by country regulatory authorities, subjects who initiate or increase dose of MTX during the study should undergo ALT, AST, creatinine and CBC testing every 4 weeks for a 12-week period. w. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits. A microscopic an alysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. x. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Section 5.2.4 ). y. For China and Japan, or where mandated by local requirements: for subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening, the HBV-DNA PCR test should be performed again every 12 weeks. Retesting every 12 weeks is not necessary for subjects that have a history of HBV va ccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–. If necessary, HBV DNA PCR may be tested at unscheduled visits. z. At Week 2 and Week 4 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to oral study drug dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit. aa. PK samples should be collected at any time during the visit. Subject should follow the regular dosing schedule. Collect PK samples at Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 32, Week 56, and at PD visit only for subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug treatment prior to Week 56. No PK sample collection is required at Week 260. bb. Prior to other study visit procedures."

Period 1 is 56 weeks in duration and includes a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and active comparator- controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of blinded, active comparator-controlled treatment (Weeks 24 – 56). Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is an open-label (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long-term extension of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 3 years to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have completed Period 1. The study is designed to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 56-week blinded period which includes 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator controlled treatment followed by 32 weeks of active comparator controlled treatment (Period 1); a long-term extension period of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 3 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); a 30-day follow-up call or visit; and a 70-day follow-up call. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, where randomization for each country will be stratified by extent of psoriasis (≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups: Group 1: ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 410) Group 2: ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 410) Group 3: ADA (40 mg eow) (N = 410) Group 4: Placebo followed by ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 205) Group 5: Placebo followed by ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 205)No more than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled with concomitant use of hydroxychloraquine, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod. Subjects will receive both oral study drug QD (ABT-494 15 mg, ABT-494 30 mg, or matching placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either ADA 40 mg or matching placebo) until all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are unblinded to study treatment."

Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long-term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (total study duration up to approximately 3 years). Subjects will continue study treatment as assigned in Period 1. Subjects who are assigned to the ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow will continue to receive ABT-494 15 mg QD, ABT-494 30 mg QD, or adalimumab 40 mg eow, respectively, in a blinded manner. When the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1 (Week 56), study drug assignment in both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an open-label fashion until the completion of Period 2. Subjects must have had inadequate response to ≥ 1 non-biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, LEF, cyclosporine, apremilast, bucillamine or iguratimod) or an intolerance to or contraindication for DMARDs as defined by the investigator prior to the Screening visit. No background non-biologic DMARD therapy is required during participation in this study. For subjects who are on non-biologic DMARD therapy at baseline (MTX, SSZ, LEF, apremilast, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bucillamine or iguratimod), non-biologic DMARDs should have been started ≥ 12 weeks prior to the baseline visit, must be at stable dose for ≥4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug and remain on a stable dose through Week 36 of the study; the non-biologic DMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons.

Period 1 is 56 weeks in duration and includes a 24-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and active comparator- controlled period followed by an additional 32 weeks of blinded, active comparator-controlled treatment (Weeks 24 – 56). Period 1 is designed to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo and versus adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA and have an inadequate response to non-biologic DMARDs (DMARD-IR). Period 1 is also designed to compare the efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD versus placebo for the prevention of structural progression. Period 2 is an open-label (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long-term extension of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ABT-494 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD in subjects with PsA who have completed Period 1. The study is designed to enroll approximately 1640 subjects at approximately 350 study centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. The study duration will include a 35-day screening period; a 56-week blinded period which includes 24 weeks of double-blind, placebo-controlled and active comparator controlled treatment followed by 32 weeks of active comparator controlled treatment (Period 1); a long-term extension period of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 5 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); a 30-day follow-up call or visit; and a 70-day follow-up call. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be stratified by extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least 1 DMARD, presence of dactylitis, and presence of enthesitis, except for subjects from China and Japan, where randomization for each country will be stratified by extent of psoriasis (≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then will be randomized in a 2:2:2:1:1 ratio to one of five treatment groups: Group 1: ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 410) Group 2: ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 410) Group 3: ADA (40 mg eow) (N = 410) Group 4: Placebo followed by ABT-494 15 mg QD (N = 205) Group 5: Placebo followed by ABT-494 30 mg QD (N = 205)No more than approximately 15% of subjects will be enrolled with concomitant use of hydroxychloraquine, sulfasalazine, bucillamine, or iguratimod. Subjects will receive both oral study drug QD (ABT-494 15 mg, ABT-494 30 mg, or matching placebo) and subcutaneous study drug eow (either ADA 40 mg or matching placebo) until all subjects have completed Period 1 (Week 56) and sites and subjects are unblinded to study treatment."

Pharmacokinetic: Blood samples for assay of ABT-494 and possibly other medications in plasma will be collected at each visit after baseline in Period 1. Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional) Prognostic, surrogate, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarkers signatures may be evaluated. Samples for different applications including, but not limited to, pharmacogenetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, proteomic and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points. Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, or lipids. Safety: Safety evaluations include adverse event (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) as a measure of safety and tolerability for the entire study duration. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: All efficacy analyses will be carried out using the Full Analysis Set population, which includes all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. Period 1 Efficacy:Analysis of the Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints: For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment group. Pairwise comparisons between each ABT-494 treatment group and the combined placebo groups will be conducted using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors. For ACR20 response rate at Week 12, analysis will be conducted to assess the non-inferiority of each ABT-494 dose versus ADA on placebo-subtracted treatment difference using Koch's 3-arm test statistic. The test aims to show that ABT-494 preserves at least 50% of the placebo-subtracted ADA effect. Superiority of ABT-494 versus ADA will also be tested for ACR20."

Pairwise comparisons for each of the ABT-494 treatment groups and the combined placebo groups will be carried out using the analysis of covariance model with treatment group as the fixed factor, and the corresponding baseline value and the main stratification factors as the covariates. For change from baseline in Patient's Assessment of Pain NRS and change from baseline in HAQ-DI at Week 12, superiority of ABT-494 vs adalimumab will also be tested. The overall type I error rate of the primary and key secondary endpoints for the two doses will be strongly controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure. Long-Term Efficacy for Period 1 and Period 2 Combined: Long-term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Pharmacokinetic: A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empirical Bayesian estimates of the individual values of ABT-494 oral clearance (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F). Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data. Safety: Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set, which includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. There will be two sets of planned safety analyses: safety analysis by Week 24, and long-term safety analysis. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examination, laboratory assessments, ECG, and vital signs. Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary, by system organ class, by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator will be provided. The changes from baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed in a descriptive manner. Shift of laboratory values from baseline to defined time points will be tabulated.

All su bjects who fail to attain at least 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16 will have an x-ray examination at Week 16. An x-ray examinatio n at Week 16 is not required for subjects with at least a 20% improvement in either or both TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 16. All subjects will receive x-rays of hands and feet if they discontinue from the study or from study drug at Week 12 or later and it has been at least 12 weeks from when x-rays were last obtained during Pe riod 1 or at least 24 weeks during Period 2. n. Randomization is permitted prior to results of the central reading of hand and foot x-rays for eligibility if a subject has an elevated hs-CRP available from the central laboratory and all other criteria are met. o. For all women of childbearing potential, collect serum for pregnancy test at Screening and if any urine pregnancy test is pos itive at any time during the study. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure. If serum pregnancy test comes back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). If still borderline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled int o the study. Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details. p. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.

Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs-CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, or the subject. For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin. Results of tests such as hs-CRP, and procalcitonin may be blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby limiting the clinical utility of these tests in the setting of a possible safety as sessment or adverse event management. Any local hs- CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests reported to the investigator until a subject is known to receive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is unblinded will be recorded as protocol deviations. v. If required by country regulatory authorities, subjects who initiate or increase dose of MTX during the study should undergo ALT, AST, creatinine and CBC testing every 4 weeks for a 12-week period. w. A urine dipstick macroscopic urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at all required visits. A microscopic ana lysis will be performed in the event the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. x. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization (defined in Section 5.2.4 ). y. For China and Japan, or where mandated by local requirements: for subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening, the HBV-DNA PCR test should be performed again every 12 weeks. Retesting every 12 weeks is not necessary for subjects that have a history of HBV va ccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–. z. At Week 2 and Week 4 visits, PK samples should be collected prior to oral study drug dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit. aa.
