Trial Summary Title A randomised placebo -controlled phase III trial of the effect of the omega -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on colorectal cancer recurrence and survival after surgery for resectable liver metastases Acronym EMT2 Background Despite significant advances in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), it remains the second most common cause of cancer -related death in the UK . The majority of deaths from CRC are related to distant metastasis, predominantly to the liver. Overall 5 -year survival following liver resection and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer liver metastases ( CRCLM ) is, at best , 40-60%. Despite surgery with curative intent, up to 60% of patients develop recurrence within 2 years of surgery. A randomised controlled trial ( RCT) of the omega -3 fatty acid (O3FA) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA) addressing anti -neoplastic activity demonstrated that treatment with EPA 2g daily for 6 months was associated with a significant reduction in rectal adenoma size and multiplicity compared with placebo. There is pre -clinical evidence that O3FAs reduce existing CRC tumour growth in rodent models of metastasis. The EMT study was a Phase II RCT of EPA 2 g daily in patients (n=88) undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM. Although there was no difference in the primary endpoint (tumour prolifera tion index), metastases from the EPA arm had a lower vascularity score (suggesting possible anti -angiogenic activity ) than placebo -treated tumours. Although EPA (or placebo) treatment was limited to the pre -operative period, overall survival (OS) and disea se-free survival (DFS) were specified as exploratory end - points on the basis that oral dosing with EPA before liver surgery would provide tissue EPA exposure in the immediate peri -operative period with prolonged bioavailability in the post -operative period due to the slow tissue ‘washout’ kinetics of EPA. Survival analysis demonstrated that the median DFS in the EPA group was 22.6 months compared with 14.7 months in the placebo group. Any DFS benefit was explained by a reduction in CRC recurrence from 12 months after surgery onwards. Design A randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -centre, phase III trial of the omega -3 fatty acid (O3FA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as the ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl [IPE ; Vascepa® or Vazkepa® ]) in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) with curative intent. Objectives Primary  To determine whether icosapent ethyl (IPE) treatment improves Prog ression -Free Survival (PFS)"
8,page_8,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 9 Secondary  To determine whether IPE treatment improves overall survival ( OS) (key secondary objective )  To confirm the safety and tolerability profile of IPE before and after surgery, including during cancer chemotherapy  To determine whether IPE treatment improves qu ality of life (QoL) after CRCLM surgery  To perform a health economic analysis of IPE treatment starting before and continuing after CRCLM surgery  To determine whether IPE treatment has an effect on the diagnosis of new primary cancers (excluding DCIS, cervical carcinoma in situ , superficial bladder carcinoma where treatment consisted of resection only and non -melanoma skin cancer where treatment consisted of resection or radiotherapy only) Exploratory  To determine whether baseline , pre-operative and/or 6 month post-operative red blood cell EPA content predicts disease - related outcomes  To determine whether IPE treatment maintains muscle mass in CRCLM patients and whether the re is any association between changes in muscle mass and disease -related outcomes Endpoints Primary endpoint:  Progression Free Survival (PFS) during a minimum of 2 years follow up. Secondary endpoints:  Overall Survival (OS)  Safety and tolerability profile of IPE including during chemotherapy  Participant -reported quality of life after CRCLM surgery  Cost-effectiveness of IPE treatment  New primary cancer s (excluding DCIS, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial bladder carcinoma where treatment consisted of resection only and non -melanoma skin cancer where treatment consisted of resection or radiotherapy only) Exploratory endpoints:  Red blood cell EPA content  Muscle mass in CRCLM patients measured by abdominal CT scan Population Adult individuals listed for CRCLM resection with curative intent. Randomisation Randomisation (1:1) to receive either IPE capsules or placebo capsules."
9,page_9,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 10 Dose 4 capsules per day containing IPE (equivalent to 4 g EPA -ethyl ester [EE] daily) or 4 placebo capsules per day Duration Participants will start treatment before CRCLM surgery and will continue to receive treatment for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 4 years po st-liver resection . Participants are followed up for 60 days beyond the end of treatment. Evaluation of outcome measures Participants are clinically assessed 6 months post -operatively ( from liver resection) and at 6 -monthly intervals thereafter for disease progression/recurrence . QoL outcomes are assessed using the EQ -5D, EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LMC21 supplementary module questionnaires. Health economic outcomes are assessed using a modified UK Cancer Costs Questionnaire Version 2.0 and data collected at each trial visit and telephone call. Adverse events will be documented during study treatment and follow -up. Measurement of the red blood cell fatty acid content will be performed by liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) me asurement of individual fatty acid ( FA) species. Changes in lean body mass will be measured longitudinally from routine CT abdomen images based on muscle area at the L3 vertebral level."

Background 6.1 Colorectal cancer and liver metastasis Despite huge advances in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal ca ncer (CRC), it remains the second most common cause of cancer -related death with 15,903 deaths from CRC in the UK in 201 41. Despite significant improvements in survival from CRC, overall five -year survival for CRC is still only 59%1. The majority of deaths from CRC are related to distant metastasis (predominantly to the liver)2. Approximately half of all CRC patients will develop liver metastasis (CRCLM), median survival from which, without treatment, is only 6 months (increasing to >24 months with sy stemic chemotherapy)2. Liver metastases are surgically resectable in 10 -20% of cases and this provides the only prospect of cure (20% long -term [>10 year] disease -free survival)2-3. Overall 5 -year survival following liver resection and adjuvant chemotherapy for CRCLM is, at best, 40 -60%2. The use of oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy (oxaliplatin/5 -fluorouracil or oxaliplatin/capecitabine) has become integral to management of resectable CRCLM2. However, timing of chemotherapy for resectable disease r emains controversial with some cases receiving neoadjuvant (pre - operative) chemotherapy rather than post -operative adjuvant chemotherapy4. Some patients with unresectable CRCLM also undergo a trial of chemotherapy aiming to ‘downsize’ their disease prior t o a final decision regarding resectability2,4. Despite surgery with curative intent, up to 60% of patients develop recurrence within 2 years of surgery3. Approximately 20% of these are eligible for second or ‘re -do’ hepatectomy, with similar post -operative outcomes to the first resection5, but the remainder have incurable disease, which is invariably fatal. 6.2 Omega -3 fatty acids Omega -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3FAs) are naturally occurring lipids consisting of a variable length carbon chain with a methy l group at one (the omega [ ]) end and a carboxylic acid group at the other (alpha) end6. They contain more than one C -C double bond, one of which is located at the third C atom ( 3) from the omega end. The dominant long -chain (≥13 carbons) O3FAs in nature are C18:3 3 (where X:Y denotes the carbon chain -length:number of C-C double bonds) alpha -linolenic acid (ALA), C20:5 3 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and C22:63 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)6. The majority of O3FAs reside naturally in a triglyceride (TG) form in the phospholipid bilayer of all cells. EPA and DHA have physiological (structural and signalling) activity as integral components of the cell plasma membrane in humans but ALA is believed to be inactive. ALA is found in significant quantities in seed oi ls, plants and vegetables. However, ALA is a poor substrate for human elongase and desaturase enzymes meaning that the dominant dietary source of EPA and DHA is restricted to cold -water oily fish such as salmon, mackerel and herring7. A 100 g portion of oi ly fish contains approximately 1 g O3FAs8. In contrast, omega -6 fatty acids (O6FAs) such as C18:2 6 linoleic acid are ubiquitous in vegetable oils used widely in the ‘western’ diet, leading to a preponderance of C20:4 6 arachidonic acid (AA) over O3FAs in human cell membranes7-8."
15,page_15,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 16 O3FAs are widely available as nutritional supplements, either as a complex mixture of naturally -occurring variable chain -length O3FAs (predominantly EPA and DHA) in fish oil (250 - 300 mg/g) or more commonly as a soft -gelatin capsule formulation, in which EPA alone, or in combination with DHA, is concentrated (to >300 mg/g)7. O3FAs can be presented in the TG form, as the ethyl ester (EE), or as the free fatty acid (FFA)9. Pancreatic lipase stimulated by food (especially fat) i ntake hydrolyses O3FA -TGs producing O3FA FFAs, which are absorbed by small intestinal enterocytes before re -esterification to the TG form for chylomicron transport to the liver and eventual systemic distribution leading to incorporation into all plasma cel l membranes9. Omega -3 fatty acid EEs require hydrolysis by carboxyl -ester lipase (also known as bile salt -dependent lipase) in order to generate FFAs for enterocyte uptake9. Presence of pancreatic lipase and carboxyl -ester lipase in the intestinal lumen is critically dependent on stimulation of pancreatic secretion by food intake. Food fat content has been demonstrated to affect O3FA tissue incorporation after short -term administration of EEs10. Systemic O3FA bioavailability is most accurately and relia bly measured in clinical studies by quantification of red blood cell (RBC) O3FA levels11. Oral dosing studies have determined that O3FA tissue incorporation approaches steady -state levels at two weeks after starting supplements, reaching a peak between 4 -6 weeks, and that ‘washout’ to basal levels can take as long as 3 months12. Recently, whole blood O3FA testing from dried finger -prick blood samples has emerged as an alternative to venepuncture needed for RBC isolation13. Preliminary data suggest a strong correlation between whole blood and RBC O3FA levels after O3FA supplementation13. There have been few direct comparisons of bioavailability of EPA given as the FFA, TG and EE. Most studies have been short -term ( < 2 weeks) and measured plasma/serum TG level s, which are of uncertain relevance to tissue o mega -3 fatty acid incorporation9 In the studies of El Boustani et al.1420 and Lawson and Hughes1517, 1619, plasma TG levels were higher after FFA administration than TG ingestion, when omega -3 PUFAs were given with a low -fat meal. Interestingly, in the longer study of Dyerberg et al.17, plasma TG levels after TG administration were in slight excess of those after FFA in gestion. One comparison of tissue (RBC) EPA incorporation after longer -term mixed omega -3 PUFA administration as the –TG, -EE or krill oil (4 weeks) reported no significant difference between formulations with equivalent EPA and DHA content18ref. In another long -term (6 months) comparison of mixed EPA/DHA administration in TG and EE forms in hyperlipidaemic subjects, TG treatment resulted in a significantly greater % RBC c ontent of EPA than the EE group19."
16,page_16,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 17 Overall, the available data suggest little difference betwe en bioavailability of the EPA -TG, EPA - EE and EPA -FFA forms of EPA, when EPA alone or an omeg a-3 PUFA mix is given with food9. By contrast, bioavailability of the EE form of EPA is more variable and more dependent on simultaneous food intake in short -term studies9. However, differences in ‘bioavailability’ of different formulations of mixed omega -3 PUFAs during long -term (weeks -months) dosing are insignificant and other factors (eg. compliance, other host factors) are likely to be more important than t he type of omega -3 PUFA used. Compliance (in turn, affected by tolerability of any given O3FA formulation) is likely to play an important role in tissue O3FA exposure but has not been studied formally. It is likely that variable compliance contribute s to the significant intra -patient (coefficient of variation [CV] ~5%) and inter -patient variability (CV~10%) in O3FA levels (measured by red blood cell membrane content) recognised during medium -term (weeks) supplementation9,20-22. Similar TG-lowering effects of mixed EPA/DHA preparations in humans have been consistently observed for O3FA s in the TG, EE and FFA form suggesting that the chemical form of EPA does not affect clinical effectiveness during long -term dosing 22-23. Moreover , O3FA s, either EPA alone or as an EPA -DHA mix, have demonstrated similar efficacy as the TG, EE or FFA in several rodent CRC models (see 6.2.1)6. 6.2.1 Evidence that EPA has anti -CRC activity Evidence that O3FAs have anti -CRC activity has been summarised elsewhere6. In brief, a large body of human observational studies has not demonstrated a relationship between dietary O3FA intake and CRC risk, perhaps because of methodological limitations of dietary measurement and/or modest dietary O3FA intake in most study cohor ts6. By contrast, a strong and consistent signal that O3FAs have anti -CRC activity has emerged from rodent models of colorectal carcinogenesis6. The majority of pre -clinical studies have tested O3FA mixtures including both EPA and DHA. The limited number o f studies investigating the anti -CRC activity of either EPA or DHA alone has demonstrated equivalence6. Pre -clinical evidence that O3FAs have anti-CRC activity has led to a number of colorectal mucosal biomarker studies which reported that oral dosing with an EPA/DHA mixture or EPA alone (1 -4g per day) was associated with reduced epithelial cell proliferation and increased apoptosis6. Clinical studies looking at the chemoprevention efficacy of O3FAs have to date been restricted to EPA with no studies of pu re DHA preparations. Importantly, EPA is considered to be the ‘universal donor’ such that C20:5 3 EPA can be metabolised to C22:6 3 DHA in humans via C22:53 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), which is reflected by increased DHA tissue content following EPA supp lementation24. The first Phase III RCT of EPA addressing anti -neoplastic"
17,page_17,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 18 activity demonstrated that treatment with 99% EPA -FFA 2g daily for 6 months was associated with a significant reduction in rectal adenoma size (29.8%) and multiplicity (22.4%) compare d with placebo24. This preliminary observation prompted an adenomatous polyp prevention trial of EPA ( using both 99% FFA 2 g and 90% TG 2870 mg daily [ also equivalent to 2 g FFA]) and aspirin 300 mg daily in ‘high risk’ individuals (n= 709) undergoing colon oscopic surveillance in the English Bowel Cancer Screening Programme, results of which are expected in 201725. There is also pre -clinical evidence that O3FAs reduce existing CRC tumour growth in rodent models of metastasis6. It has been demonstrated that d ietary supplementation with EPA -FFA (producing similar tissue EPA incorporation to that seen in clinical studies24) abrogated mouse MC-26 CRC cell liver metastasis after intra -splenic injection in Balb/c mice26. These experimental observations prompted a P hase II RCT of EPA -FFA 2 g daily in patients (n=88) undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM (the EPA for Metastasis Trial [EMT ] study)27. The primary end -point of the EMT study was the histological CRC cell proliferation index, but safety and tolerability were key secondary endpoints. Due to the ‘window of opportunity’ trial design, EPA -FFA or placebo treatment was restricted to the pre -operative period (median EPA treatment duration 30 days). As expected, EPA treatment was associated with higher intra - tumoral EPA levels27. Although there was no difference in the primary endpoint (tumour proliferative index) , metastases from the EPA arm had a lower vascularity score, suggesting possible anti -angiogenic activity, than placebo -treated tumours27. Adverse events in patients with CRCLM awaiting surgery were limited to mild GI upset , with withdrawal because of symptoms occurring in only two cases27. Importantly, there was no excess intra -operative or post-operative bleeding risk associated with EPA treatment in keeping with a lack of any clinically significant effect of EPA on bleeding events27. Although EPA (or placebo) treatment was limited to the pre-operative period, overall survival (OS) and disease -free survival (DFS) were specified as exploratory end -points on the basis that oral dosing with EPA before liver surgery would provide tissue EPA exposure in the immediate peri -operative period with p rolonged bioavailability in the post -operative period due to the slow tissue ‘washout’ kinetics of EPA12. Survival analysis demonstrated that the median DFS in the EPA -FFA group was 22.6 months compared with 14.7 months in the placebo group. Any DFS benefi t was explained by a reduction in CRC recurrence from 12 months after surgery onwards27. A Cox multivariate analysis revealed that EPA treatment was associated with improved DFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% confidence interval 0.15 -0.79]). EPA use also conferred OS benefit with 7 CRC -related deaths in 41 evaluable CRCLM patients who received EPA-FFA compared with 14 deaths in 42 placebo group patients (HR 0.40 [95% confidence interval 0.16-1.0])27. The two previous adequately powered RCTs of perioperative chemotherapy in patients undergoing CRCLM resection, including the most recent New EPOC trial, both used PFS as the primary endpoint28-29-. These trials are not directly comparable to the EMT study due to differences in the study populat ions related to trial exclusion criteria and historical differences"
18,page_18,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 19 in hepatobiliary surgical practice27. However, the median PFS in these trials28-29- and smaller preceding studies30 is slightly longer (approximately 21 months versus 15 months) than the median PFS in the placebo arm of the EMT study27. Two -year OS in the EMT study was 71.5% compared with 78 -79% OS in the control arm of the two most recent trials 28-29, perhaps related to not having preoperative chemotherapy as an exclusion criterion, and w ider inclusion criteria in the latter trials. 6.2.2 Mechanisms of the anti -neoplastic activity of O3FAs The mechanistic basis of the anti -CRC activity of O3FAs has not been fully elucidated. Multiple mechanisms of action almost certainly contribute to the anti -neoplastic activity31. For example, EPA (but to a much lesser extent DHA) is a substrate for the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which drive colorectal carcinogenesis6. EPA effectively inhibits COX -1 but leads to synthesis of 3-series prostaglandins (PGs) by COX -2 at the expense of pro -tumorigenic 2 -series PGs such as PGE 226,31 -32. Alternatively, EPA and DHA alter membrane fluidity, which may inhibit pro-tumorigenic sig nalling through cell surface receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor31. More recently, O3FAs have been characterised as ligands for specific fatty acid G protein -coupled receptors such as GPR12031. The lipophilic, membrane -bound nature of th e O3FAs and the above putative mechanisms of action are compatible with extended ‘washout’ after cessation of therapy and suggest that prolonged anti -CRC activity is plausible even after limited short -term treatment. 6.2.3 Interaction of EPA with other CRC treat ment modalities There is preliminary evidence that concurrent O3FA therapy may improve the efficacy of platinum -based chemotherapy of lung cancer36 and further evidence that O3FAs may protect against muscle loss and improve quality of life in cancer chemot herapy patients37. There has been no large, randomised study of the effect of O3FA supplementation on chemotherapy outcomes in CRC patients except for two uncontrolled case series that support improved tolerability and nutritional parameters during both F OLFOX and FOLFIRI regimens38-39. Acetyl -salicylic acid (aspirin) may also have anti -CRCLM activity40. Adjuvant aspirin therapy in patients who have undergone primary CRC surgery is currently being tested in the Add -aspirin trial41. Aspirin (like EPA) inhibits COX -1 (by irreversible acetylation ) and alters enzymatic activity of COX -2, leading to reduced prostaglandin production42. Therefore, a valid hypothesis is that aspirin and EPA may have additive anti -CRC activity. 6.3 O3FAs a nd cancer cachexia Although recent systematic reviews of a small number of studies in other cancers, particularly pancreas, have not demonstrated a clear signal, it has been hypothesised that O3FAs may abrogate cancer cachexia (the clinical syndrome of wei ght loss, muscle atrophy, loss of appetite, fatigue and weakness) perhaps by anti -inflammatory properties43. One explanation"
19,page_19,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 20 for the different effect of EPA on OS and DFS observed during the first 18 months post -surgical follow -up in the EMT study is that EPA could reduce cancer -related cachexia. Therefore, a valid hypothesis is that EPA treatment abrogates the reduction in muscle mass (termed sarcopaenia) that is an integral feature of the cancer -related cachexia syndrome. This can be tested by measuring l ean body mass longitudinal ly using routine CT abdomen images using the method of Baracos (based on muscle area at the L3 vertebral level), in parallel with assessment of patient -reported symptoms44. 6.4 Safety and tolerability of EPA treatment Vast experience of O3FAs in a cardiology setting and from the informal ‘over -the-counter’ nutritional supplement market has confirmed that long -term O3FA supplementation is safe, with a restricted set of mild side -effects generally pertaining to the gastrointes tinal tract such as dyspepsia, eructation and diarrhoea (all ≤10%)45. Total daily doses of O3FAs up to 4g are considered safe45. In practice, no excess bleeding risk has been observed in large -scale randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of doses of mixed O3F As and pure EPA up to 2 g daily , including the EMT trial in CRCLM patients27, despite some ex vivo evidence for anti -platelet activity of O3FAs46. Previous s tudies of O3FA use in cardiology patients taking anti -platelet and anti -coagulant drugs have not de monstrated any excess of bleeding events45,47. The Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) for the mixed O3FA preparation, which is licensed in the UK (Omacor ®), advises that it has been used in conjunction with warfarin without haemorrhagic complication s but advises that the prothrombin time should be checked if there is co -prescription with warfarin. The FFA and TG formulations , which have been used in current and previous RCTs in patients with, and at risk of, CRC have not raised any safety concerns24,27. In particular, there was no excess of peri -operative bleeding events in the group that received EPA prior to liver surgery compared with placebo in the EMT trial27. 6.5 The IMP in EMT2 Icosapent ethyl (IPE) or Vazkepa® , also known as AMR101 or Vascepa® in the USA, (Amarin Pharma ceuticals Inc.), is approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ), European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) and US F ederal Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of cardiovascular events in individuals with established cardiovascular disease, or diabetes and at least one other cardiovascular risk factor, who are already taking a statin and have elevated blood triglyceride levels . It is available as 1 g (998 mg) EPA-EE in soft gelatin capsules. Therefore , each capsule contains the equivalent of 914 mg EPA -FFA. Dosing is recommended with meals. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated a dose - response relationship with the plasma and red blood cell EPA level attained (and changes in"
20,page_20,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 21 other red blood cell O3FAs), with IPE 4 g/day providing a significant increase in plasma and red blood cell EPA level after 12 weeks therapy compared with 2 g/ day48. Plasma EPA levels (expressed as the % total fatty acids) in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia after 12 weeks treatmen t with 2 g/day and 4 g/day were 1.9% and 3.4 -3.6% respectively48-49. An 8 week study in healthy volunteers of EPA FFA 2 g daily ( used in EMT27 and seAFOod25 trials ) resulted in plasma EPA levels of 4.6%50. Treatment with EPA FFA 2 g daily for a shorter period (median 30 days) in the EMT trial (which may not have generated steady -state O3FA levels) was associated with a similar % increase in red blood cell EPA content (240%)27 to that seen with IPE 2 g/day for 12 weeks (300%; cf. 500% with 4 g/day)48. In a Japanese trial of 1800 mg EPA - EE per day for 5 years, the % change from baseline of serum EPA (as the % of total fatty acids) was only 126%51. Therefore, the available evidence suggests that dosing with 4 g/day IPE will produce EPA bioavailability most similar to that obtained with EPA-FFA and EPA-TG in previous CRC trials52 with the caveats that there has been no direct comparison between different EPA formulations in CRC patients and that differences in m ethodology for measurement and reporting of plasma, serum and red blood cell EPA content mean that direct comparisons should be carried out cautiously. Short -term studies have demonstrated no difference in bioavailability between single and split (BD) IPE dosing at 2 g/ day53. Therefore, the dose of IPE used in the EMT2 trial (4 g/day ) is recommended as a twice daily 2 g (2 x 1g capsules) dose. A large (n= 8179 ) randomised trial of IPE 4 g/day for prevention of cardiovascular disease with median follow -up of 4.9 years (REDUCE -IT; NCT01492361) reported that overall rates of adverse events an d serious adverse events in the IPE group were not significantly different from placebo users54. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter occurred in 5.8% of subjects receiving IPE in REDUCE -IT compared with 4.5% in subjects receiving placebo54. Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter requiring hospitalisation for 24 hours or more occurred in 3% of subjects treated with IPE compared with 2% in subjects receiving placebo. Atrial fi brillation and atrial flutter were reported more frequently in subjects with a previous history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter receiving IPE than in those receiving placebo (12.5% vs 6.3%)54. Bleeding occurred in 11.8% of subjects receiving IPE i n REDUCE -IT compared with 9.9% in subjects receiving placebo54. Serious bleeding events were reported more frequently in subjects receiving IPE than in those receiving placebo when administered in combination with concomitant antithrombotic medication (3.4 % vs 2.6%), but occurred at the same rate (0.2%) in subjects not taking concomitant anticoagulant/antiplatelet medication54. The bleeding events most frequently observed with IPE in the REDUCE -IT trial were gastrointestinal bleeding (3.1%), contusion (2.5% ), haematuria (1.9%), and epistaxis (1.5%). EPA-EE has been licensed in Japan since the 1990’s as Epadel (Mochida Pharmaceutical Co.), at a 1800 mg dose (capsule or sachet), and, more recently (2013), in an OTC form"
21,page_21,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 22 (Epadel T). This product has been the su bject of the large (n=18645) JELIS trial55, in which GI adverse events were reported in 3.8% (placebo 1.7%). 6.6 Rationale for the trial Despite optimal multidisciplinary team management of patients with CRCLM using liver resection surgery and systemic chemo therapy, metastatic CRC of the liver remains a significant cause of cancer -related death with long -term survival occurring in a small minority of patients and with overall 5 year survival being typically only 40-60%. Therefore, there remains a need for safe, well -tolerated treatment that will improve outcomes for patients with CRCLM. The EMT study suggested that short -term pre -operative treatment with EPA might provide long-term OS and DFS benefit in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM . EMT2 will determine definitively whether prolonged EPA treatment, starting before surgery and continuing afterwards, reduces cancer progression, and secondarily whether there is an OS benefit, in CRCLM patients. For the EMT2 trial, PFS will be used as th e primary endpoint on the basis that 1) participants will have clinically evident metastatic CRC at randomisation prior to liver surgery and 2) other major RCTs of outcomes after CRCLM surgery have employed PFS as the primary outcome measure. In addition, OS will be the key secondary outcome measure in order to explore any effect on OS after CRC progression during the intervention period (see Section 7.3). 7. Aims and Objectives EMT2 is a randomised placebo -controlled, double -blind tria l of EPA-EE (IPE) for CRCLM patients . 7.1 Aims The trial aims to determine whether oral IPE therapy started before CRCLM surgery and continued for a minimum of 2 years post liver resection lengthens progression -free survival (PFS) in patients undergoing liver resection surgery for CRCLM with curative intent . 7.2 Primary Objective"
22,page_22,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 23  To determine whether IPE treatment improves progression -free survival (PFS) in CRCLM patients. 7.3 Secondary Objectives  To determine whether IPE treatment improves overall survival (OS) .  To confirm the safety and tolerability profile of IPE before and after surgery, including during chemotherapy .  To determine wh ether IPE treatment improves participant reported quality of life after CRCLM surgery .  To perform a health economic analysis of IPE treatment .  To determine whether IPE treatment has an effect on the diagnosis of new primary cancer s (excluding DCIS, cervical carcinoma in situ , superficial bladder carcinoma where treatment consisted of resection only and non -melanoma skin cancer where treatment consisted of resection or radiotherapy only ). 7.4 Exploratory Objectives  To determine whether baseline , pre-operative and/or 6 month post -operative red blood cell EPA content predicts disease -related outcomes .  To determine whether IPE treatment maintains muscle mass in CRCLM patients and whether there is any association between changes in muscle ma ss and disease related outcomes . 8. Design The EMT2 study is a prospective randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -centre, parallel -group, superiority phase III trial of the omega -3 fatty acid (O3FA) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in patients undergoing liver resection surgery with curative intent for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM). 448 eligible participants will be randomised on an equal basis to receive 4 x 1 g capsules per day of either icosapent ethyl (IPE; equivalent to 4 g of EPA -EE or 3656 mg EPA -FFA) taken as 2 capsules twice daily with food or 4 placebo (containing light mineral oil instead of IPE) capsules taken in an identical fashion. The trial is designed to investigate whether EPA (IPE) treatment will result in an improvement in PFS (see section 17.1.1 for definition) ."
23,page_23,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 24 EMT2 is a double -blind trial design in which participants and site personnel will be blinded to the treatment allocation to minimise the possible in trodu ction of bias. All participants will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 4 years post liver resection (Please refer to Section 13 on Assessments/samples/data collection for more details on the follow -up schedule). There is also the option for EMT2 participants to join a sub -study funded by The US National Institutes of Health called Prebiotic effect of eicosapentaenoic acid treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastases, in which biospecimens (stool, urine, blood, and tumour t issue) will be collected before and after EPA or placebo treatment (refer to the Biospecimen Collection protocol ). 9.

These patients are eligible for trial participation providing that both the primary colorectal cance r and the liver metastases are considered able to be resected curatively. Eligibility of participants should be confirmed at the point at which liver resection is definitely scheduled regardless of the primary CRC management . 9.4 Chemotherapy prior to liver resection It is expected that some patients may require chemo therapy prior to liver resection surgery.

Please note that it is necessary to determine the purpose of chemotherapy treatment prior to liver resect ion as ‘downsizing’ chemotherapy for borderline operable liver metastases is a stratification factor and must be confirmed prior to randomisation. Prior chemo therapy at any time-point is not an exclusion criterion for EMT2 . However , patients must have comp leted chemotherapy and have an MDT recommendation for CRCLM resection with curative intent in order to be eligible for EMT2 participation. Details of the chemotherapy treatment regimens will be recorded. 9.5 Prior and concurrent participation in other clinic al trials The eligibility of participants who have participated in other previous or concurrent trials will be determined on a case by case basis and must be discussed with the CTRU , Sponsor and the respective trial team prior to randomisation. Co-enrolment with participants in the colorectal cohort of the Add -Aspirin trial (EudraCT 2013 - 004 398 -28, Sponsor University College London) will be permitted providing that the respective eligibility criteria of each trial are fulfilled41. Add-Aspirin aims to assess whether regular aspirin use after standard therapy prevents recurrence and prolongs survival in participants with non - metastatic common solid tumours including CRC41. Add-Aspirin participants with CRC who go on to develop CRCLM m ay be eligible for EMT2 if liver resection with curative intent is considered appropriate. EMT2 participants are also permitted to participate in the Add -Aspirin study following CRCLM surgery if the participant fulfils the eligibility criteria defined by t he current Add -Aspirin protocol ; information on Add -Aspirin trial participation should be provided on the EMT2 Follow -Up CRF. This pragmatic trial design facilitates the assessment of the efficacy of EPA in participants who use aspirin which may become sta ndard practice in the future . This approach also minimises any potential negative effects on recruitment due to competing trials in the same patient population. 9.6 Biospecimen collection to investigate the prebiotic effect of EPA treatment for CRCLM Once an i ndividual has provided written informed consent to participate in EMT2, the participant may be given the opportunity to take part in a sub -study, which involves collection of stool, urine, blood and tumour tissue during the EMT2 trial (See Biospecimen Coll ection protocol)."

Documented reasons for ineligibility or patient declining participation will be closely monitored by the CTRU as part of a re gular review of recruitment progress. Screening forms should be returned to CTRU on a monthly basis. Anonymised information will be collected including : - Age - Gender - Date screened - ‘Downsizing chemotherapy (yes or no) - Known extra hepatic CRC metastases with curative treatment planned (yes or no) - Current regular aspirin use (yes to current use, no current use or Add -aspirin trial participant still receiving IMP) - Reason not eligible for trial participation or - Eligible but declined and reason for this or - Other reason for non -randomisation 10.3 Informed Consent and Eligibility The Principal Investigator ( PI) will retain overall responsibility for the informed consent of participants at their site and must ensure that any person delegated responsibility to participate in the informed consent process is duly authorised, trained and competent to participate according to the current ethically approved protocol, principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Declaration of Helsinki 1996. Informed consent must be obtained by a clinician authorised by the PI on a delegation log prior to the participant undergoing procedures that are specifically for the purposes of the study and are not standard routine care at the participating site. Assenting participants will be broadly as sessed for eligibility during the screening process based on their medical history according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria."

The participant must remain free to withdraw at any time from the study without giving reasons and without prejudicing his/her further treatment and will be provided with a contact point where he/she may obtain further information about the trial. Where a participant is required to re - consent or new information is required to be provided to a participant , it is the responsibility of the PI to ensure this is done in a timely manner and according to any timelines requested by the CTRU. 10.3.1 Initial Information and Initial Approach Potential part icipants will be identified through the hepatobiliary MDT at the time of the decision to offer CRCLM surgery to that individual. Potential participants who require a primary CRC resection or ‘downsizing ’ chemotherapy for liver metastases prior to CRCLM sur gery should be reviewed for CRCLM surgery by the MDT again following primary CRC surgery/ ‘downsizing’ chemotherapy of CRCLM and assessed regarding eligibility for trial participation at that point. Potential participants will be approached about the trial at the outpatient appointment , at which CRCLM surgery is discussed and will be provided with the full Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form (PIS/ICF) at this time . 10.3.2 Consent Process Potential participants will be given sufficient time (e.g. 1-2 hours or as considered sufficient by the individual ) to independently consider the verbal and written trial information provided . Potential participants may be invited to provide their informed consent for the study at the time of the initial approach. This approach may be beneficial when patients have travelled a significant distance for tertiary -level clinical management and may not accept a dedicated research visit soon after the outpatient clinic appointment. A member of the site trial team may contact a potential participant by telephone and send the PIS/ICF in advance of the outpatient clinic visit in order to introduce the concept of the EMT2 Trial and research in general, particularly if there is likely to be a short period of time between the clinic assessment and likely CRCLM surgery. However, if any potential participant requires more time to consider trial participation , this will be accommodated through an additional visit for consent and randomisation, with provision to take the PIS/ICF home for subsequent telephone contact by a research nurse . If the potential participant is interested in taking part in the study, the research nurse will arrange a dedicated clinic visit for the purpose of consent, rand omisation and dispensing of treatment. Assenting potential participants will be invited to provide written informed consent. The PI or any other clinician who has received Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training and is authorised"

Participants who lose mental capacity after informed consent has been obtained will continue trial treatmen t if considered appropriate by the PI and the participant’s carer/family with the participant’s best interests foremost in the decision making process . Ongoing collection of safety and follow -up data will continue via the clinical care team for inclusion i n the trial analysis in order to preserve the integrity of the trial’s intention to treat analysis and fulfil regulatory requirements specifically for pharmacovigilance purposes. 10.3.4 Eligibility Process The MDT will assess eligibility for CRCLM liver resection using a recent CT scan to confirm that the CRCLM are resectable with curative intent. A trial clinician listed on the EMT2 Authorised Personnel Log will confirm suitability for surgery and eligibility for EMT2 b ut in the majority of cases, patients suitable for surgery are eligible for participation in the study. Women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test following consent and prior to randomisation . Women found to be pregnant will not be randomis ed into the trial but will be registered and assigned a trial number for monitoring purposes. A CT scan of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis will be used to confirm that the participant is eligible for curative CRC LM resection and may be collected retrospectively as part of the sarcopaenia analysis (see Section 13.14 )."

Women of childbearing potential will require a pregnancy test prior to randomisation. Therefore , recruitment is a two -step process with all participants providing written informed consent for entry into the trial before the CTRU 24 -hour registration/randomisation system is accessed. Those participants who are not women of childbearing potential wil l be registered and randomised into the trial during the same telephone call/web session. Those participants who are women of childbearing potential will be regi stered into the trial and will require a pregnancy test. Those participants who are confirmed n ot to be pregnant can then be randomised into the trial. Those participants who are confirmed to be pregnant must be registered into the trial but will not be randomised. Informed written consent for entry into the trial must be obtained prior to registration. Following confirmation of written informed consent and eligibility, participants will be registered and randomised into the trial by an authorised member of staff at the trial site. All participants who consent to the trial must be registered . Where possible, the date for surgery should be booked prior to randomisation. Randomisation should take place as soon as possible after consent is obtained and eligibility confirmed, and will be prior to the day of CRCLM surgery . 10.4.2 Treatment Allocation Participants will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either IPE 4 g daily or placebo and will be allocated a trial number and a unique kit -code to identify which box of capsules (active [IPE] or placebo) will be dispensed. The participant’s randomisatio n allocation will not be disclosed in order to maintain the blinding of the trial. A computer -generated minimisation programme that incorporates a random element will be used to ensure that treatment groups are well balanced for the following participant characteristics, details of which will be required for randomisation :  ’Downsizing’ chemotherapy prior to liver resection * (yes or no)  Known extrahepatic CRC metastases with curative treatment planned (yes or no)  Current regular (intention to use daily) aspirin use :"

Only authorised members of staff at the trial sites will be able to access the randomisation system. Participants will be registered into the trial and issued a trial numbe r. Women of childbearing potential will be required to take a pregnancy test prior to randomisation. Participants who are not women of childbearing potential may proceed directly to randomisation during the same telephone call/web session. The following in formation will be required in order for the participant to be registered and randomised. The person performing the registration/ randomisation should have all details to hand:  Name and code (assigned by the CTRU) of trial site  Name of person performing the registration/ randomisation  Patient initials , and date of birth  Confirmation of eligibility  Confirmation of whether the participant is a woman of childbearing potential  Confirmation of written informed consent  Stratification factors (see section 10.4.2 )  Planned operation date"

At the end of the randomisation process a unique kit -code will be provided which identifies the box of capsules that needs to be dispensed by pharmacy. The participant’s randomisation allocation will not be disclosed in order to maintain the blinding of t he trial. 10.4.4 Post Randomisation Actions Two Confirmation of Randomisation notification s, detailing the participant details and the kit - code they have been all ocated , will be sent to site by email : one to the nominated contact in the local research team a nd another to pharmacy. These notifications are generated and sent automatically from the CTRU. In the event of a system failure, the kit -code may need to be provided to the pharmacy directly by the member of site staff randomising the participant (this information will be provided as part of the randomisation procedure ). Confirmation of randomisation will also be automatically sent to the local PI. 10.4.4.1 Pharmacy The kit -code provided will inform pharmacy which box of capsules needs to be dispensed to the participant.

Trial Medicinal Product Management Please refer to the EMT2 Pharmacy and Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) Study Site Operating Procedure (SSOP) for full details of the trial IMP management requirements. Within the trial the following are classed as IMPs: Eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester (EPA -EE [IPE] )  Composition: soft, amber to light yellow, oblong gelatin capsules, one capsule contains 1g (998 mg) pure EPA -EE equivalent to 914 mg EPA -FFA  Supplied by Amarin Pharma Inc. Placebo  Composition: soft, amber to light yellow, oblong gelatin capsules containing light mineral oil  Supplied by Amarin Pharma Inc. For handling guidance of both EPA -EE (IPE) and placebo, please refer to the Investigator Brochure (IB). In order to maintain the blinding of the trial, both the IPE and placebo capsules look identical and are identically packaged and labelled in bottles with the same study -specific label in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (as amended). IMP boxes will be iden tified only by a unique kit -code assigned at random. 11.1 Supply and distribution Stockport Pharmaceuticals at Stockport NHS Foundation Trust will act as the trial’s Central Pharmacy and holds a Manufacturer’s Authorisation for Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP). The trial IPE capsules and placebo capsules are obtained from Amarin Pharma Inc. (Bedminster, New Jersey, USA). The capsule co ating contains gelatin of animal origin and therefore is not suitable for vegetarians. IMP will be imported from the USA by Fisher Clinical Services (Horsham, UK) and will then be sent to the Central Pharmacy where the bottles and boxes will be labelled and packaged for trial purposes."
33,page_33,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 34 Labelled trial IMP boxes will be stored by Stockport Pharmaceuticals and distributed to participating centres on request by CTRU. CTRU will manage a record of IMP at participating centres and order replacement stock as required. Management of IMP supply will be carried out by CTRU using a kit logistics application which is linked to the 24 -hour randomisation system . The kit logistics application will allocate kit -code labelled IMP boxes , as assigned by the safety statistician, at randomisation and at each trial visit. An authorised member of the trial team will use the 24 -hour telephone/web randomisation system to obtain a kit code for the IMP to be dispensed to a participant at each visit as required ; this is known as replenishment. Should a participant require a dispensing before a scheduled replenishment visit or delivery (for example if they lose the capsules) an authorised member of the trial team will access the 24 -hour telephone/web randomisation system to obtain a kit code to be dispensed. This is known as replacement. Blinded m anagement of the kit logistics application will be conducted by the Senior Trial Co- ordinator. Management of the kit -code lists uploaded to the kit logistics application will be conducted unblinded by the CTRU Safety Statistician . In addition to the automated system, there will be a back -up kit -code list for each site which will also be maintained by the CTRU Safety Statistician . The CTRU Safety Statistician will be respo nsible for maintaining all kit -code lists and all lists will be securely password -protected when treatment information is contained within the list. Trial IMPs ( IPE and placebo) will be provided to sites free of charge for use in this clinical trial. 11.2 Prescribing and participant supply management Each box contains seven bottles of IMP capsules (130 capsules in each bottle ) and is sufficient for approximately 7 months of trial treatment (to allow for a standard 6 month treatment period and incorporating a +/- 2 week window around the visit date). One box of IMP capsules will be dispensed to participants at the start of treatment (visit 1) and at visit 3 /trial telephone call onwards. It is expected that the entire box of IMP capsules dispensed at visit 1 w ill not have been used by visit 2 . However, a repeat dispensing of IMP should be dispensed at visit 2 if surgery is >2 weeks after randomisation to cover a possible trial treatment period in excess of 7 months between visit 1 and visit 3 . Participants will be asked to bring in their IMP boxes at each trial visit or report the number of capsules remaining at a trial telephone call so that the participant’s IMP can be checked by the research nurse with regards to the amount of IMP remaining a nd the expiry date. If the participant requires a further supply of IMP to ensure that there is sufficient IMP to continue treatment until the next trial visit (i.e. a 7 month supply) , an additional box will be dispensed. The participant will be informed t hat all capsules from the first box must be used before the second box is opened and used and will be reminded regarding the expiry date of the IMP , if necessary."
34,page_34,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 35 The expiry date of the capsules will be printed on the bottle and box label s, the IMP bottles and the IMP box and the participant will be responsible for checking on an ongoing basis that the capsules being used have not expired. The participant will be provided with a Participant Drug Tracking Card which will list the visit/telephone call numbers , visit date /telephone call dates, kit-codes and expiry dates of all IMP boxes dispensed to the participant to aid in tracking which IMP box to use . Participants will be asked to return any expired IMP supply to clinic when attending trial visits. For participants undertaking telephone clinic follow -up due to distance from the trial site hospital, participants will be asked to store all unused/expired IMP until it is collected at the end of the trial. Since IMP will be dispensed at each visit, it is expected that the participant may eventually accumulate sufficient IMP to last until the next trial visit and a dispensing will not be required. It is the responsibility of the prescribing healthcare professional to determine whether the participant has sufficient IMP with an appropriate expiry date (i.e. a 7 month supply) to miss a dispensing episode . 11.3 Dispensing The relevant site pharmacist will be notified by the CTRU of all randomisations , replenishments and replacements at that site , either by fax o r secure email ; each Confirmation of Randomisation /Replenishment /Replacement notification will detail the participant trial ID number, date of birth, initials and the kit -code assigned to that participant. In order to maintain the blinding of the trial the pharmacist will not be informed of the participant’s treatment allocation. Each box of trial IMP, identifiable only by the unique kit -code, will have a corresponding code-break envelope. Each time a box is dispensed, the participant identifiers must be added to the trial IMP box label and also to the corresponding code-break envelope by the dispensing pharmacist . This code-break envelope will then be held securely within the site pharmacy for access requi red in the event of unblinding (see Section 12.3.1 ). At each dispensing the participant will receive one trial IMP box, containing seven bottle s (130 capsules per bottle , provid ing 910 capsules per box), of either IPE or placebo. Participants will take 4 capsules per day with food . A suggested schedule is 2 capsules taken in the morning with food and 2 capsules in the evening with food but particip ants are able to vary the timing to once daily with food according to preference and ease of use . Dispensing must be performed by an authorised member of site staff as delegated on the trial Pharmacy Authorised Personnel Log. All dispensed trial IMP must be recorded on the trial Accountability and Dispensing Log. Courier delivery of IMP is permissible for participants who are unable to return to collect IMP from the dispensing hospital after Visit 2 due to the excessive distance between home and"
35,page_35,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 36 hospital. The IMP delivery will be arranged by a member of the site staff, who will be responsible for arranging a courier and confirming successful delivery to the participant. Courier account and contact details will be provided by CTRU. Receipt of the IMP by t he participant should be documented in the participant’s clinical notes. The number of unused capsules should be determined during the telephone assessment and recorded on the case report form (CRF) for the purpose of documenting treatment compliance. 11.4 Storage Trial IMPs will be stored in pharmacy at room temperature. If the pharmacy storage temperature exceeds 25°C please quarantine stock and contact CTRU. The supply of trial IMPs ( IPE and placebo) must not be used for any purpose other than that outlined in this protocol and should be clearly ring -fenced from standard hospital stock. 11.5 Reconciliation Receipt of IMP a t participating centres and trial stock dispensed to participants must be recorded on the EMT2 Accountability and Dispensing Logs. These completed logs will be returned to CTRU upon request to facilitate central IMP reconciliation. Participants should return any unused trial IMP stock to the participating centre and the pharmacy should record these returns. The returned capsules should be c ounted , recorded and the record returned to CTRU prior to local destruction as per standard operating procedures. For participants receiving a courier delivery of IMP, unused capsules will be collected and returned to the dispensing pharmacy at Visit 10/Ex it visit or sooner if the participant stops treatment or withdraws from trial treatment and follow up. Code -break envelopes for any un -dispensed trial IMP will be returned to CTRU during reconciliation for each trial IMP batch . Code -break envelopes for dis pensed trial IMP will be collected after all participants have completed the 60-day post -treatment period at the completion of trial treatment. Code -break envelopes will be checked by the CTRU for potential unreported unblinding (i.e. opened or damaged envelopes). 12. Treatment The following section of the protocol describes treatment for participants with IPE or placebo. The local Investigator, the site pharmacist, other members of the site staff involved with the trial, and the participants themselves, w ill remain blinded to the treatment allocation (except when emergency unblinding is required)."
36,page_36,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 37 12.1 Treatment Details Participants will be randomised to receive either IPE or placebo capsules for a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 4 years post liver resection . Participants will be resupplied with IMP at each trial visit, as required. Since IMP will be dispens ed at each visit /telephone call , it is expected that the participant may eventually accumulate sufficient IMP to last until the next trial visit and a dispensing will not be required. It is the responsibility of the prescribing healthcare professional to determine whether the participant has sufficient IMP with an appropriate e xpiry date to miss a dispensing visit. When dispensing IMP at trial visits /telephone calls , authorised members of staff at the participating centre will access the CTRU 24 -hour service which will inform the site of the kit - code for the box to be dispensed. Pharmacy will receive a fax or email to inform them of which kit-code labelled box to dispense. 12.2 Treatment Regimen Participants will be randomised to receive either 4 x 1g capsules of IPE or 4 identical placebo capsules daily. Participants should take their capsules with food . The trial treatment should be taken daily from the date of randomisation until the participant has completed study treatment (maximum of four years treatment post liver resection ). Trial treatment will c ontinue following diagnosis of disease progression or diagnosis of a new primary cancer as there is still potential for EPA treatment to improve outcomes of any new or recurrent cancer. 12.2.1 Treatment breaks While it is preferred that participants continue their trial medication daily, it may be necessary for participants to take one or more treatment breaks during follow -up. Examples of possible reasons for a treatment break include in-patient hospital stays (eg. for CRCLM surgery ) if nil by mouth is specif ied or during chemotherapy treatment or other concurrent treatment that results in a persistent adverse reaction (AR) or difficulty taking IMP . In the event of a persistent AR, a dose reduction (see Section 12.2.4 ) should be tried prior to a treatment break. Details of any dose reduction or break in treatment should be recorded on the Treatment CRF, including the duration and reason . 12.2.2 Concomitant med ication It is expected that a proportion of participants will require chemotherapy following CRCLM surgery. It is not considered necessary for trial treatment to be discontinued during"
37,page_37,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 38 chemotherapy. However, should the participant experience adverse events (AEs) during chemotherapy that might be exacerbated by EPA use and these do not resolve with the IPE dose –reduction algorithm (see Figure 1 in Section 12.2.4 ), the participant may take a temporary treatment break from trial treatment. Details of this treatment break should be recorded on the Treatment CRF. Details of any concomitant medication , including details of all over -the-counter medications, should be recorded on the Treatment CRF. Over -the-counter or prescribed nutritional supplements containing any O3FA eg. Seven Seas® or prescribed O3FAs ( Vazkepa, Omacor) are prohibited while participants are receiving trial treatment and are an exclusion criterion for the trial . Therefore, any participants consistently using over -the-counter O3FA preparations or requiring treatment with a prescription O3FA for hypertriglyceridaemia or f or vascular prophylaxis will be withdrawn from trial treatment and the site will complete the Protocol Violation CRF and forward this to CTRU as soon as possible. The participant will continue to be followed up as normal. As participants are not informed o f their treatment allocation, it is possible that any concomitant O3FA supplementation could add to their treatment dose which is not advised in the interest of participant safety. In addition, persistent use of over -the-counter O3FAs may compromise the tr ial results should participants in the placebo arm receive O3FAs, as this will result in ‘contamination’ of the control group . Participants should be reminded at each trial visit /telephone call that it is not permitted for O3FA supplements to be taken during trial participation . Concomitant use of aspirin and/or any other anti -platelet agent is allowed with usual management of anti -platelet agent use around interventional procedures being follow ed. Similarly, concomitant warfarin use is allowed with usual careful monitoring of anticoagulation control. In the absence of any data on any adverse interaction between O3FAs and new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) such as rivaroxaban and da bigatran , concomi tant use of NOACs is allowed . In the REDUCE -IT trial of 8179 individuals with cardiovascular disease or risk factors (approximately 10% taking concomitant anticoagulation, with or without an antiplatelet agent), serious bleeding events were reported more f requently in subjects receiving IPE 4 g daily (3.4%) than in those receiving placebo (2.6%) when administered in combination with concomitant antithrombotic medication, but occurred at the same rate (0.2%) in subjects not taking concomitant anticoagulant/a ntiplatelet medication54. 12.2.3 Known Toxicities As this is a blinded trial, adverse events should be assessed for causal relationship assuming the participant has been receiving active IPE."
38,page_38,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 39 Refer to the Reference Safety Information (RSI) contained within the current approved version of the IB held in the Investigator Site File. The RSI is located in s ection 8.4 of the EMT2 Icopsapent Ethyl Investigator Brochure 12.2.4 Dose reduction Participants should be advised to contact the relevant research nurse between t he 6-monthly clinic visits /telephone calls in the event of a persistent AE that may require capsule dose reduction. In the event that the participant experiences AEs that the treating clinician suspects to be related to trial treatment, the clinician should review the participant’s treatment regimen (eg. have the capsules been taken with food?). If the AE persists, the dose of trial treatment should be temporarily reduced as per the dose reduction algorithm in Figure 1 below . Dose reduction should be r ecorded in the medical notes and on the Treatment CRF. If a participant is undergoing a course of chemotherapy and a dose reduction has stopped the symptoms of an AE, the dose should not be increased back to full dose until the course of chemotherapy has c ompleted. If a participant is undergoing a course of chemotherapy and has stopped taking trial capsules due to an AE (i.e. is on a treatment break) , the participant should resume on the reduced dose once the course of chemotherapy has completed with a vie w to increasing the capsule dose to 4 capsules daily, in due course . A decision to permanently stop trial treatment should not be made during chemotherapy if possible. If a participant is still experiencing symptoms of the AE following a dose reduction, is not undergoing a course of chemotherapy and no other factors are considered to be contributory, a permanent halt to trial treatment should be considered. If a participant does permanently stop trial treatment, a Withdrawal CRF should be completed and retu rned to CTRU within 24 hours. The participant should continue to attend trial visits or take a trial specific telephone call as per the trial visit schedule."

40,page_40,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 41 12.2.5 Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance will be assessed by questions at each trial visit/telephone call to determine if the participant has had any delayed, missed or modified doses. This information will be recorded on the appropriate Follow -up Form . Any unused expired capsules will be collected from the participants by the research team at the next trial visit or at the end of the trial for those participants undertaking telephone clinic follow up and returned to pharmacy for drug reconciliation and local destruction (see Section 11.5 above for further details). The fatty acid analysis on visit 2 and 3 samples compared with baseline visit 1 (see Section 13.15 ) will act as a marker of compliance to IPE and also allows the assessment of whether the placebo arm has been ‘contaminated’ by possible participant supplementation with over -the-counter O3FA. 12.3 Blinding The Principal Investigator, participating centre staff, pharmacy staff, participants and the CTRU staff involved in the day to day activities of the trial will be blinded to the treatment allocation of each participant . Participants will not be informed of their trial allocation until the final analysis has been completed and the results of the study are published. At this time the CTRU will provide each site with a list of treatment allocations for participants recruited at that site. Participants cannot request their trial allocations until this time. The following controls will be employed to maintain the double blind status of the trial:  The IPE and placebo capsules and bottles will be identical in appearance and have the same labelling.  Boxes will be id entified by a unique kit code assigned at random. The CTRU Safety Statistician (an independent CTRU statistician responsible for carrying out tasks requiring access to unblinded information) will be responsible for maintaining this list, which will be secu rely password protected when treatment information is contained within the list.  The Investigator and other members of the site staff involved with the trial and the participants themselves will remain blinded to the treatment allocation (except where emer gency unblinding is necessitated). The following outline s how unblinding will be kept to a minimum for tasks to be conducted unblinded at the CTRU:"
41,page_41,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 42  Management of kit -codes on the kit logistics application which is linked to the 24 -hour randomisation system will be conducted by the CTRU Safety Statistician in addition to maintaining the back -up kit -code lists for each centre.  Any unblinded interim reports provided to the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will be provided by the CTRU Safety Statisti cian and the reports will be securely password -protected.  Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be unblinded by the CTRU Safety Statistician. If the event requires expedited reporting, the Safety Statistician will pass the SUSAR to t he trial Data Manager who will be responsible for electronic SUSAR reporting to the Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the ethics committee. Unblinded records of SUSARs reported will be maintained by the Safety Statistician. Code break pr ocedures are outlined below in Section 12.3.1 and described in detail in the Emergency Unblinding SSOP provided in the Investigator Site File and Pharmacy Site File. 12.3.1 Emergency Unblinding Whilst the safety of participants in the trial mu st always take priority, maintenance of the blind is crucial to the integrity of the trial. Investigators should only break the blind when information about the participant‘s trial treatment is clearly necessary for the appropriate medical management of th e participant and where stopping the blinded medication is not sufficient. Unblinding may be requested on the grounds of safety by the Chief Investigator (CI), local PI or treating physician. It is anticipated that requests for unblinding will most likely originate from a participant, carer (or friend/family member) or personal physician (e.g. GP) at the time of an adverse event or planned change in non -trial related drug therapy. Requests for unblinding will first be handled by the local PI or delegate who will explore the reason for the request and evaluate the importance of knowledge of treatment assignment for participant safety. In the event of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), all participants should be treated as though they are receiving the active med ication. Refer to protocol Section 14 (Pharmacovigilance). Should an alternative to unblinding not be identified, and if unblinding is required to optimise medical management of the participant, investigators should follow the emergency unblinding process. Emergency unblinding is provided by the CTRU during Office Hours and the participating site pharmacy at all other times, thereby covering each 24 -hour period. It is encouraged that requests for Emergency unblinding should be made directly with CTRU wherever possible."
42,page_42,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 43 During Office Hours (9:00 to 17:00 Monday to Friday excluding public/bank holidays, the period between Christmas Eve and New Year, Thursday afternoon before Good Friday and all Tuesdays following a bank holiday except for Mayday and New Year’s Day), Investigators should telephone CTRU who will carry out the unblinding procedure . Outside of Office Hours, or where the Investigator is unable to contact CTRU, emergency unblinding may also be undertaken by contacting the local/assigned pharma cy department at the respective participating centre who will also hold code -break envelopes . Code -Break envelopes for unblindings will be provided to pharmacy at the time of IMP delivery and each envelope will be linked to a specific box of capsules using a unique kit -code . The following information will be needed to perform an emergency unblinding:  Participant details, including trial ID number, initials and date of birth  Name of trial research site and site code  Name of person making the request for a code -break  Reason for requesting a code -break  Confirmation of whether the PI authorised the request Following the emergency unblinding of a participant, CTRU will fax or send via secure email a confirmation of emergency unblinding to the requester and the local PI . The details of the emergency unblinding should be recorded on the EMT2 Unblinding Log provided by CTRU. Outside of Office Hours, or where the Investigator or treating physician is unable to contact CTRU, emergency unblinding must be p erformed by the local pharmacy department. The responsible pharmacist on duty will complete the Unblind Request CRF, retrieve the code - break information and reveal the treatment allocation to the person requesting the unblind. The pharmacist must return (by fax or secure email) the completed Unblind Request CRF to the CTRU within 24 hours of the unblinding request. Following an emergency unblinding the participant should stop tri al treatment and be treated in line with local hospital policy. The participant will continue to be followed -up as per the trial protocol.

43,page_43,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 44 12.4 Withdrawal s In line with usual clinical care, cessation or alteration of regimens at any time will be at the discretion of attending clinicians or the participants themselves. All participants withdrawn from treatment or prescribed alternative treatment will still attend for follow -up assessments unless unwilling to do so and CRFs will continue to be completed. The Withdrawal CRF should be completed and faxed or sent via secure email to the CTRU within 24 hours of the research team becoming aware. Treatment breaks are permitted if necessary (see Section 12.2.1 ). Participants should not be recorded as withdrawn fr om trial treatment until it is clear that they will not be resuming trial treatment. The PI or delegate should make every effort to ensure that the specific wishes of any participant who wishes to withdraw consent for further involvement in the trial are d efined and documented using the Withdrawal CRF in order that the correct processes are followed by the CTRU and site following the withdrawal of consent. It should be made clear to any participant specifically withdrawing consent for further data collecti on that data pertaining to safety will continue to be collected for regulatory reporting purposes and will be included in any safety analysis. In addition it is suggested that the participant is made aware of the fact that if any significant new informatio n becomes available in regard to the treatment they have received in the trial it may be necessary to contact them in the future. 13. Assessments , Samples and Data Collection Data will be collected using paper CRFs, the electronic templates for which will be provided by the CTRU and upon completion should be returned to the CTRU at the University of Leeds. Participating hospitals will be expected to maintain a file of essential trial documentation (Investigator Site File), which will be provided by the CTRU, a nd keep copies of all completed CRFs for the trial in the Investigator Site File. The timings of interventions and assessments required for the EMT2 trial are summarised in Appendix A: Schedule of Events. 13.1 Assessment of eligibility and randomisation Potential participants will be identified through the hepatobiliary MDT at the time of the decision to offer CRCLM surgery to that individual. The MDT will review the most recent CT of the"
44,page_44,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 45 thorax, abdomen and pelvis and determine eligibility for CRCLM surg ery. This CT scan may be collected retrospectively as part of the sarcopaen ia analysis. If the patient is eligible for CRCLM surgery, the surgeon will assess eligibility (medical review including medical history, assessment of management of the underlying disease , pregnancy and concomitant medication use) for trial participation at the surgical outpatient visit at which CRCLM surgery is discussed with the patient. The trial site team may telephone the potential participant in order to introduce the trial i n general terms and then send a PIS/ICF in advance of an outpatient clinic appointment, especially if the time between outpatient review of eligibility for surgery and the date of CRCLM surgery is limited. Participants must be screened and have given written informed consent before any trial specific procedures are performed and the participant is randomised. For patients who do not go on to be registered , details should be added to the Screening Log (see Section 10.2). All patients who consent to trial participation must be registered.

The intervention al phase of the trial will complete 2 years after the last participant is randomised. At the end of the intervention al phase, participants will be requested to attend clinic for an ‘Exit Visit’ which should be within 2 months of the end of the intervention al phase (this may be the standard clinic follow -up visit if timing is appropriate). Participants should return all unused IMP upon cessation of trial treatment either at a hospital visit or via a courier . 13.11 Disease Progression The date of clinical progressio n is defined as the date of the CT scan or the relevant assessment at which disease progression or new recurrence is identified. This can be clinical progression or, for RECIST evaluable disease, radiological progression by RECIST principles. In the event that the liver or extra -hepatic metastases are found to be unable to be resected following randomisation (macroscopic disease remaining) , a CT scan to determine the existing disease should be carried out as soon as possible following surgery . This scan will act as a baseline for assessment of progression and should be reported in accordance with RECIST v1.156 (see Appendix D). Subsequent scans to monitor disease progression should also be reported in accordance with RECIST v1.1. Up to 5 target lesions shou ld be defined. Disease progression is defined as:  Appearance of one or more new lesions  A minimum 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  Clear, unequivocal progression of non -target lesions (which may be measurable or non-measurable)"
53,page_53,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 54 In the event that a participant is found to have positive microscopic margins following liver resection (microscopic disease) an immediate CT scan is not required as this disease is not evaluable according to RECIST . Disease progression is defined as the appearance of CRC metastases by CT scan of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis. Disease progression in the extra -hepatic metastases will be assessed using the CT scan of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis if appropriate. Other clinical evaluations will be carried out to monitor extra -hepatic metastases as required and as per local standard practice. In a small number of cases, participants may have clear clini cal symptoms of disease progression without confirmatory imaging. In this circumstance, clinical deterioration that is unambiguously due to CRC progression should be reported as a progression event and the date of clinical assessment should be recorded as the date of clinical progression. 13.12 Quality of Life For all participants, Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires will be completed at visit 1, visit 3 and at all clinic visits thereafter. The QoL questionnaires include t he EQ -5D, EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LMC21 questionnaires . 13.12.1.1 Timing and administration of Quality of Life questionnaire s Participants will be asked to complete the Quality of Life questionnair es prior to receiving their first box of capsules and wherever possible prior to meeting with the clinician at the clinic visit (or prior to randomisation at visit 1). The Visit 1 Questionnaire Pack should be given to participants after consent has been obtained and eligibility has been confirmed. All questionnaires will be provided in clinic or by post . Questio nnaires should be completed by participants at the time of clinical assessment, but before discussion of the outcome of any medical assessments or blood tests wherever possible. Participants will be asked to seal the questionnaires in pre -supplied envelope s prior to being given to research staff.

The routine CT scans will be obtained at baseline (confirmation of eligibility ), visit 3 and visit 4. The CT scan images will be requested at the end of the interventional phase, depending on the availability of funding for measurement of this exploratory endpoint. These measurements could easily be extended to cover longer periods of follow -up or expanded to include participants at other sites if funding is available. It is the responsibility of the participating centre to obliterate all personal identifiable data prior to sending the CT scan to the CTRU/central reviewer. The trial number, date of birth and initials will be used to identify the participant. 13.15 Red Blood Cell Fatty Acid Analysis Blood samples taken at visits 1, 2 and 3 will be collected from participants recruited at two of the participating centres: Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. These samples will be analysed to measure the red blood cell fatty acid content whi ch determines the absolute and relative content of the major O3FAs including EPA, as well as the EPA/AA and EPA+DHA/AA ratio52. The fatty acid analysis on the baseline samples (see Section 13.2) will enable the investigation of whether O3FA status predicts subsequent therapeutic response to IPE. The absolute and differential O3FA levels at visits 2 and 3 will also act as a marker of compliance to IPE and allows the assessment of whether the placebo arm has been ‘contaminated’ by possible participant supplementation with over -the-counter O3FA. At visits 1 -3, whole blood will be collected in EDTA tubes for centrifugation and isolation of plasma and red blood cells. Both fractions will be stored locally at -30°C before courier transport of the complete sample sets to the Institute of Cancer Therapeutics (ICT), University of Bradford which will act as the central biobank. Lipid extraction from red blood ce lls followed by derivatisation and liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) measurement of individual fatty acid (FA) species will be performed as described in the EMT2 Lab Manual52. The red blood cell fatty acid analysis will be carried out centrally at the Institute of Cancer Therapeutics (ICT), University of Bradford. The fatty acid analysis will be carried out on blood samples from all participants recruited at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust only."
55,page_55,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 56 At visits 1 -3, whole blood will be collected for centrifugation and isolation of plasma and red blood cells.

Tubes should be agitated immediately to prevent clotting. The blood components should be sep arated within 30 minutes of taking the blood sample. If not processed immediately, the two K2EDTA Vacutaine r tubes should be stored in the fridge at 4°C for up to 30 minutes. Separation of blood components will be achieved by centrifugation of the sample in K 2EDTA Vacutainers in a centrifuge , preferably refrigerated . Full details on the separation of the blood components are provided in the EMT2 Lab Manual. All separated fractions will be stored locally at -30°C before courier transport of the complete sample sets to the ICT, Bradford every three months . Lipid extraction from red blood cells followed by derivat isation and liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) measurement of individual FA species will be performed as described in the EMT2 Lab Manual. The fatty acid -analysis may be carried out at intervals during the two years of recruitment in order to assess treatment compliance and/or ‘contamination’ by ‘over -the-counter’ O3FA use . Any blood samples remaining following analysis for trial purposes will be stored at the Institute of Cancer Therapeutics at the University of Bradford and may pro vide a resource for future studies in colorectal cancer . Ethical approval will be obtained for any future studies involving EMT2 data or samples and t he Institute of Cancer Therapeutics at the University of Bradford has been granted a main HTA licence (121 91). Participants will not be identified in the results of future studies. It is the responsibility of the participating centre to ensure that samples are appropriately labelled in accordance with the trial procedures to conform with the 1998 Data Protecti on Act. Blood samples collected from participants as part of this study will be transported, stored, accessed and processed in accordance with national legislation relating to the use and storage of human tissue for research purposes and such activities sh all at least meet the requirements as set out in the 2004 Human Tissue Act. 13.16 Biospecimen Collection, storage and transport Please see the Biospecimen Collection protocol for details of sample collection and transport.

Pharmacovigilance 14.1 General Definitions ‘Adverse Event’ (AE) – any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign ( includin g an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered to be related to the medicinal product. ‘Adverse Reaction’ (AR) – all untoward and unintended response s to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered. This definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship which is supported by facts, evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. This definition inclu des medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol (i.e. if an AR occurs as a result of a medication error and including misuse and abuse of the product ). ‘Serious Adverse Event’ (SAE) – any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose: - results in death, - is life -threatening, - requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, - results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, - is a congenital anoma ly or birth defect, - jeopardised the subject or required intervention to prevent one of the above. These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life -threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have"
59,page_59,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 60 caused death if it were more severe. Medical and scientific judgement must be exercised in deciding whether an event is ’serious’ in accordance with these criteria. ‘Serious Adverse Reaction’ (SAR) – reference is made to the criterion of ‘Seriousness’ above in relation to SAE. Where an SAE is deemed to have been related to any IMP used in this trial the event is termed as a serious a dverse reaction (Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also consider ed a serious adverse reaction.) ‘Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction’ (SUSAR) – means an adverse reaction, the nature and severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information: - in the case of a product with a marketing authorisation, in the summary of product characteristics for that product, - in the case of any other investigational medicinal product, in the investigator’s brochure relating to the trial in question. The term ‘severity’ is used here to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from the term ‘serious’. Reports which add significant information on the specificity, i ncrease of occurrence, or severity of a known, already documented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. 14.2 Operational Definitions Adverse events will be collected for all participants and will be evaluated for intensity and causal relationship with the trial medication or other factors according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE V4.0 (NCI -CTCAE).

In the event that the participant experiences an SAE during chemotherapy treatment, it should be assessed whether the event is related to chemotherapy or IPE. If the event is related to chemotherapy , it should be assessed whether the event has been exacerbated by IPE or could possibly have been exacerbated by IPE. Please refer to Appendix B for the Pharmacovigilance Reporting Flowchart. 14.2.2.1 Events not to be classed as SAEs / SARs The following events will not be classed as SAEs / SARs within this trial and will therefore not be subject to expedited reporting: Hospital isation for:  Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deterioration in condition;  Treatment which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition not associated with any deterioration in condition, e.g. pr e-planned hip replacement operation which does not lead to further complications;  Any admission to hospital or other institution for general care where there was no deterioration in condition;  Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospital admission. 14.2.2.2 Events classed as expected SAEs / SARs Any e vents which will be classed as expected SAEs / SARs within this trial are given in the RSI (section 8.4 of the current approved EMT2 Icosapent Ethyl IB) . Such events will not be reportable as SUSARs on the trial, unless the severity of the event is considered to be unexpected. The current approved version of the EMT2 IPE IB must always be referred to . All events should be reviewed for relatedness by the Principal Investigator, or another medically qualified member of the research team authorised on the EMT2 Authorised Personnel Log. The CI will review all SARs on behalf of the Sponsor in order to determine expecte dness."
61,page_61,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 62 14.2.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) For general definitions of SAEs and SARs, please see Section 14.2.2 above. A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is a serious adverse drug reaction which also demonstrates the following characteristic of being unexpected: Unexpected – An adverse event, the nature OR severity of which is NOT consistent with the RSI in the current approved version of the EMT2 Icosapent Ethyl IB SUSARs will be subject to expedited reporting to the Medicines and Healthcare and products Regulatory Author ity (MHRA) and Research Ethics Committee. As this is a blinded trial, serious adverse events should be assessed for expectedness and causal relationship assuming that the participant has been receiving IPE. Events associated with placebo will usually not satisfy the criteria for a SUSAR and therefore expedited reporting. However, where SARs are thought to be associated with placebo (e.g. reaction due to excipient or impurity) , the CTRU will forward such cases to the CI for review of causality and expectedn ess on behalf of the Sponsor and, if appropriate, onward report to the MHRA and REC. Routinely breaking the blind could compromise the integrity of the trial. For this reason blind -breaking will only take place where information about the participant’s trial treatment is clearly necessary for the appropriate medical management of the participant. In all cases the Investigator would be expected to provide an evaluat ion on the causality of SAEs as though the participant was receiving the active medication. 14.3 Reporting Requirements All SAEs/ SARs/ SUSARs occurring from the time of randomisation until the 60 days post cessation of trial treatment must be recorded on the SAE Form or the SAR Form . For each SAE or SAR/ SUSAR the following information will be collected:  Full details in medical terms and case description  event duration (start and end dates, if applicable)  action taken  outcome  seriousness criteria  causality(i.e. relatedness to trial drug), in the opinion of the investigator  whether the event would be considered expected or unexpected"
62,page_62,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 63  Principal Investigator signature (or another clinically qualified member of the medical team authorised in the EMT2 Authorised Personnel Log) For SARs and SUSARs additional information will be collected on concomi tant medications, relevant medical history, diagnostic tests and treatment for the event. All events must be reviewed and assessed (for seriousness and causality) by the Principal Investigator, or another medically qualified member of the research team aut horised in the EMT2 Authorised Personnel Log. If an authorised medic is not available on the day the site team become aware of the event, initial reports without causality must still be faxed or sent via secure email to the CTRU within 24 hours of the site becoming aware, and must be followed - up by medical assessment as soon as possible thereafter. SARs must be recorded on the SAR Form and faxed or sent via secure email to CTRU within 24 hours of the research staff becoming aware of the event. Subsequently, follow -up reports (detailing changes in condition or other follow -up information) must be reported to CTRU within 24 hour s of the information becoming available. Events will be followed up until the event is resolved or a final outcome has be en reached. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Form and reported to the CTRU within 24 hours of the trial team becoming aware of the event . SAE data will be reviewed as collated data and will be reviewed for trends by the Chief Investigator at quarterly inte rvals (in a blinded manner) and by the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee at six monthly intervals (in an unblinded manner). It is expected that SAEs, SARs and SUSARs may be identified by the centre at which the participant is receiving chemotherapy (f or those participants receiving chemotherapy as per standard practice) which may be different to the randomising centre. It is the responsibility of the chemotherapy team to report events fulfilling the seriousness criteria to the trial team at the randomising centre. An authorised clinician on the trial team is responsible for assessing whether the event is related to trial treatment. If the event is considered to be serious , it is the responsibility of the trial team to report the event to the CTRU within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 14.3.1 Reporting of Adverse Events (AEs) All AEs occurring from randomisation up to 60 days after the end of trial treatment must be recorded on the appropriate CRF.

Once all resulting queries have been resolved, the original wet -ink CRF will be posted to the CTRU and a copy retained at site. 14.3.4 Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse React ions (SARs) and Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) All SARs and SUSARs occurring from randomisation up to 60 days after the end of trial treatment (see Section 14.2.2 above for definition) must be recorded on the SAR CRF and faxed or sent via secure email to the CTRU within 24 hours of the local research team site staff becoming aware of the event (this includes participants who have withdrawn consent for data collection, see Section 12.4). Any SARs or SUSARs which the site team become aware of after this point must still be reported to CTRU. Once all resulting queries have been resolved, the original wet -ink CRF will be posted to the CTRU and a copy retained at site. Please ensure that only one event is reported on each SAR CRF (details of mult iple symptoms should be listed if they relate to the same event). 14.4 Responsibilities 14.4.1 Principal Investigator: 1.

Participant -reported measures Quality of life will be assessed by parti cipants' self -reported symptoms and functioning using validated instruments completed by participants at visits 1, 3 and all clinic visits thereafter . All instruments are self -administered to avoid interviewer bias. The three QoL questionnaires and the hea lth economics questionnaire to be used in this study are described below. The EQ -5D is a well validated, multi -purpose, standard health -related QoL evaluation questionnaire, which will be used to assess generic QoL. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value for hea lth status."
66,page_66,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 67 The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a well validated questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. This information relates to the previous 1 -week time period. It is supplemented by disease -specific modules and the colorectal liver metastases module QLQ - LMC21 will also be used in the study. The majority of this information relates to the previous 1-week time period, with information relating to the effect of the disease or treatment on the participants’ sex -life relating to the previous 4 -week time period. A participant self -reported questionnaire will be administered at Visit 10/Exit Visit to determine the participant’s opinion of their trial treatment allocation at the end of the treatment period. This questionnaire will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the blinding measures used throughout the trial. 16. Economic Evaluation The aim of the economic evaluation is to provide an estimate of the cost -effectiveness of IPE in comparison with placebo. The economic evaluation also aims to identify important drivers of cost differences between the trial arms, the likely magnitude of cost differences and the likely magnitude of differences in health status to assist in the design of subsequent research and economic modelling in this area. The economic analysis will be conducted by the Academic Unit of Health Economics, University of Leeds, under the supervisio n of the lead Health Economist. The timeframe for the health economics analysis will be 4 months from receipt of the final dataset. Health economic data will be collected at each trial visit using patient questionnaires and clinical records transcribed ont o trial case report forms and by a Hospital Episode Statistics data download at the time of analysis . The scope will include secondary care costs, primary care and community NHS costs, patient out -of-pocket expenses and wider societal costs57. The calculat ion of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs ) will rely on the EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L questionnaire in order to weight survival for quality of life. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated between trial arms. Outcomes will comprise: (i) cost per disease recurrence prevented at 2 years, and (ii) the cost per QALY at 2 ye ars, both reported alongside the trial primary endpoint57. CRFs will, where possible, collect data in a manner consistent with activity types used by the NHS Reference Costs, from which unit costs will be assigned to secondary care activity. Other nationa l sources of NHS unit costs such as the Commercial Medicines Unit Electronic Medicines Information Tool and the PSSRU Unit Costs of Health and Social care will be used to assign non -secondary care unit costs. A second analysis, performed as a sensitivity analysis, will use secondary care activity costed from linked Hospital Episode Statistics using the Department of Health HRG grouper software once this becomes available for 2 years follow -up for all patients"
67,page_67,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 68 The non -parametric bootstrap method will be used to produce a within -trial probabilistic sensitivity analysis of the incremental cost effectiveness ratio. The impact of missing data will be examined using imputation methods. In addition to presenting the expected incremental cost effectiveness ratio, th e scatterplot on the cost effectiveness plane the cost effectiveness acceptability curve and the expected value of perfect information will also be reported. The value based price of IPE will be calculated. Subgroup analysis will be conducted for trial stratification factors and any other factors described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 17. Endpoints 17.1.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) during a minimum of 2 years follow up. PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to death (from any cause), first documented evidence of disease progression (as defined in Section 13.11 ), new recurrence or clinical deterioration unequivocally due to disease progression56]. 17.1.2 Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints are:  Overall Survival (OS) , defined as the time from randomisation to death, from any cause (key secondary endpoint)  Safety and tolerability of IPE before and after surgery, including during chemotherapy  Patient reported quality of life, measured using the EQ -5D, EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LMC21 questionnaires  Cost-effectiveness of IPE  New primary cancer s (excluding DCIS, cervical carcinoma in situ , superficial bladder carcinoma where treatment consisted of resection only and non -melanoma skin cancer where treatment consisted of resection or radiotherapy only) 17.1.3 Exploratory Endpoints The exploratory endpoints are:  Red blood cell membrane EPA content, measured at baseline, surgery and 6 months after surgery (only patients from Leeds and Sheffield )"
68,page_68,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 69  Change in lean body mass measured by CT scanning during follow up as assessed by the L3 skeletal muscle index score 18. Statistical Considerations 18.1 Sample size and planned recruitment rates 18.1.1 Sample size A sample size of 448 participants (giving 247 events) is required to detect a HR of 0.7 for PFS in favour of EPA (the treatment arm) with a power of 80% at the 5% (2 -sided) level of significance. This assumes the control arm has a median PFS of 21 months and the treatment arm has a median PFS of 30 months . It also assumes a 24 month recruitment period and a minimum 24 mon ths follow up and allows for 10% dropout. The HR for PFS in the Phase II EMT study27 was 0.694, but the EPA arm, by chance, recruited a higher proportion of patients with poor prognostic features, and a multivariate analysis including these factors actuall y yielded a HR of 0.35 (95% confidence interval : 0.15 -0.79) lending credence to the assumed more conservative HR of 0.7 chosen for this larger phase III study, given that the magnitude of benefit observed in phase II studies is often greater than that obse rved in the phase III counterpart. The EMT study tested EPA -FFA 2g daily27. Although the EMT2 study will evaluate IPE 4 g daily, we assume similar efficacy of EPA given as IPE, compared with EPA -FFA, for the purposes of the trial power calculation. The pow er calculation for the main secondary endpoint of OS uses a simulation approach based on an established mathematical model58 that assumes a plateau in the time to event curves at around 4 -5 years. Assuming 80% OS at 2 years in the control arm 28-29, and a difference between the treatment arms of 10% in the actuarial OS rate at 2 years (equivalent to a hazard ratio of 0.47 similar to that observed in the EMT study27), 448 patients (80 events) yields approximately 91% power to detect such a difference, and 78% power to detect a lesser HR of 0.55. This calculation again assumes 24 months recruitment and a minimum 24 months follow -up, a 5% (2 -sided) significance level and a 10% dropout rate. Although this is an optimistic scenario, it is based on the EMT tria l results27, which suggested that it is entirely possible that EPA produces benefits both before and after progression, and this (secondary) endpoint encompasses that possibility. We note that OS is likely to be, if anything, slightly less than 80% at 2 ye ars, from experience in the phase II EMT trial, which would increase the power under these assumptions. In terms of the exploratory change in lean body mass endpoint, assuming a mean L3 skeletal muscle index score of the order of 50 cm2/m2, and a standard deviation of the order of 10 in"
69,page_69,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 70 this score59 then it would be possible to detect a relatively small mean difference between the treatment arms of 5 in the L3 skeletal muscle index (e.g. from 50 to 45) with 128 patients (64 in each arm) tes ted at the 12-month post -surgical follow -up with 80% power and using a 5% (2-sided) significance level. Therefore, this analysis is currently restricted to participants in Leeds and Sheffield . This high power with a small sample size is possible because we are looking at differences in a continuous variable, which yields higher sensitivity to changes on smaller numbers of patients. 18.1.2 Planned Recruitment Rate We propose to recruit into this trial from eight sites incorporating the large UK hepatobiliary units offering ‘high -volume’ tertiary level CRCLM management. For a two -year recruitment period, the combined annual CRCLM resection rate of 890 patients (roughly 40% of the national workload) allows for a realistic 25% randomisation rate in order to recruit to time and target (224 per year). In the EMT study, only 4 of 203 (2%) CRCLM patients screened for eligibility refused to participate27. Although the excellent acceptability of the EMT study was aided by the dedicated study Research Fellow and single sit e-nature of the trial, we expect that the number of screened individuals who decline to participate will be low based on the preliminary data from the EMT study, combined with the excellent safety and tolerability profile of IPE. Given the relatively low n umber of exclusion criteria, we believe that a 25% recruitment rate allowing recruitment to time and target is realistic and obtainable despite the possibility of some placebo avoidance behaviour based on the phase II trial data28. 19. Statistical Analysis 19.1 General Considerations Statistical analysis is the responsibility of the CTRU Trial Statistician under the supervision of the Supervising Statistician , except for the health economic analysis which is the responsibility of the health economic TMG member . A full statistical analysis plan will be written before any analyses are undertaken and in accordance with CTRU standard operating procedures. 19.2 Analysis populations Analyses will be conducted on the intention to treat (ITT) basis where participants will be included according to which treatment they were randomised to receive, apart from the safety/tolerability endpoint which will be based on the safety population. The safety population"
70,page_70,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 71 will consist of all patients who take at least one dose of any trial t reatment; analyses based on the safety population will summarise participants according to treatment received. All hypothesis tests will be two -sided and will use a 5% significance level. Sensitivity analyses may be performed for each endpoint, for example to take into account differing assumptions about missing data if there is a significant number of missing data, and will be detailed in the full statistical analysis plan. 19.3 Frequency of analysis A DMEC will be set up to independently review data on safety and recruitment. Interim reports will be presented to the DMEC in strict confidence, on at least yearly intervals. This committee, in light of the interim data and of any advice or evidence they wish to request, will advise the TSC if there is proof beyon d reasonable doubt that one treatment is better. No formal interim analyses are planned hence no statistical testing will take place until final analysis. We do not propose interim futility or early stopping (for superiority) analyses. Given the relatively short recruitment and follow -up periods in this trial, and the absence of a plausible reason to believe that outcomes would be worse in the EPA arm, we are highly unlikely to have observed sufficient events to stop for futility at 2½ years because of limi ted overall follow - up. Similarly, the relative paucity of events expected halfway through the four -year intervention al period (i.e. at the end of recruitment) means that there would have to be a huge implausible difference in PFS in favour of EPA in order to stop for superiority. The final analysis will take place after the last patient recruited has been followed up for 24 months. 19.4 Primary endpoint analysis The primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS) during a minimum of 2 years follow up (see s ection 17.1.1 for definition) . PFS will be analysed using the 95% confidence interval of the hazard rat io; the 95% confidence interval of the difference in median PFS will also be presented to aid interpretation. Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be calculated for PFS. Patients without a PFS event at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive and p rogression - free. Differences in PFS between the treatment groups will be compared using multivariate modelling (for example, an extended Cox model if appropriate) to adjust for the minimisation factors of ‘downsizing’ chemotherapy, extrahepatic CRC metasta ses, randomising centre , and time between randomisation and surgery and also regular aspirin use during follow -up which will be included as a time dependent covariate. A sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to examine the effects of other potential effect modifiers in addition to the minimisation factors. The primary analysis will be the multivariate analysis which adjusts for the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow -up. Treatment HRs and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be obtained from the multivariate models."
71,page_71,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 72 19.5 Secondary endpoint analysis Kaplan -Meier survival curves will be calculated for Overall Survival (OS). Participants without an OS event at the time of analysis will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive. Differences in OS between the treatment groups will be compared using multivariate modelling (for example, an extended Cox model if appropriate) to adjust for the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow -up, which will be inc luded as a time dependent covariate , and subsequent analyses will be conducted to examine the effects of other potential effect modifiers in addition to the minimisation factors. Treatment HRs and corresponding 95% confidence interval s will be obtained fro m the multivariate models. Safety analyses will summarise the AE, AR, SAE, SAR and SUSAR rates per participant, by treatment received and overall. Suspected relationship to IPE will be presented along with other causality, outcome and event duration. QoL will be measured using the general EQ -5D and cancer specific EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LMC21 questionnaires. These will be analysed using random effects (multi -level) models to account for the hierarchical nature of repeated measures data and the models will i nclude adjustments for baseline QoL, the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow - up, which will be included as a time dependent covariate , with subsequent sensitivity analyses to adjust for any other potential effect modifiers in additio n to the minimisation factors . The nature of any missing data will be investigated and if it is suspected that data are not missing at random alternative analyses will be carried out to allow for the nature of the missing data. The number and timing of new primary cancers will be summarised descriptively by treatment group. 19.6 Subgroup Analyses A subgroup analysis comparing the outcomes for patients that receive ≥2 weeks of IMP prior surgery and patients that receive <2 weeks of EPA will be performed. Further subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate the effect of aspirin and EPA and the effect of EPA on the MSI status of the primary colorectal cancer on PFS. 19.7 Explorato ry endpoint analysis Red blood cell membrane EPA content will be measured at baseline , at surgery and 6 months after surgery in all participants from Leeds and Sheffield52. The effect of red blood cell membrane EPA content on disease -related outcomes (PFS and OS) will be analysed using an extended Cox model (if appropriate) which will adju st for the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow -up, which will be included as a time dependent covariate and will also include red blood cell membrane EPA content as a time dependent covariate . Subsequent sensitivity analyses will be conducted to adjust for any other potential effect modifiers in addition to the minimisation factors."
72,page_72,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 73 Lean body mass will be measured longitudinally from the routine CT abdomen images using the method of Baracos (ba sed on muscle area at the L3 vertebral level)44. The difference in muscle mass between the EPA and placebo treatment groups will be analysed using a random effects (multi -level) model to account for the hierarchical nature of the repeated measures data. Th e model will be adjusted for the baseline muscle mass, minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow -up, which will be included as a time dependent covariate, with a subsequent sensitivity analysis to adjust for any other potential effect modi fiers in addition to the minimisation factors . A possible association between changes in muscle mass and disease related outcomes (PFS and OS) will be analysed using an extended Cox model (if appropriate) which will adjust for the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow - up, which will be included as a time dependent covariate, and will also include lean body mass as a time dependent covariate . A subsequent sensitivity analysis will be carried out to adjust for any other potential effect modifiers as well as the minimisation factors . Weight will also be analysed as a measure of cachexia. The difference in weight of patients between the treatment arms will be analysed using a random effects (multi -level) model to account for the hierarchical nature of the repeated measures data and will be adjusted for baseline weight, the minimisation factors and regular aspirin use during follow -up, which will be included as a time dependent covariate . A sensitivity anal ysis will also be carried out to adjust for other potential effect modifiers as well as the minimisation factors . Analysis of the biospecimens collected during the sub -study ‘The prebiotic effect of EPA treatment for CRCLM’ are detailed in Appendix A of t he Biospecimen Collection protocol. Laboratory work will take place in Leeds Institute of Medical Research and ICT, University of Bradford , as well as Massachu setts General Hospital and Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, USA. 20. Trial Monitoring 20.1 Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC ) A Trial Monitoring Plan will be developed and agreed by the Trial Management Group (TMG) and T rial Steering Committee (TSC) based on the trial risk assessment ; this may include on site monitoring . The independent DMEC will review the safety and ethics of the study. Detailed unblinded reports will be prepared by the CTRU for the DMEC at approximately 6 monthly intervals. The DMEC will be provided with detailed unblinded reports containing the information agreed in the data monitoring analysis plan. Any unblinded interim reports provided to the DMEC will be provided by the CTRU Safety Statistician for consideration in a closed session and the reports will be securely password - protected."
73,page_73,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 74 20.2 Data Monitoring Data will be monitored for quality and completeness by the CTRU. Missing data will be chased until it is received, confirmed as not available, or the trial is at analysis. However, missing data items will not be chased from participants (although missing que stionnai res sometimes are). The CTRU will reserve the right to intermittently conduct source data verification exercises on a sample of participants, which will be carried out by staff from the CTRU. Source data verification will involve direct access to patient notes at the participating hospital sites and the ongoing central collection of copies of consent forms and other relevant investigation reports. 20.3 Clinical Governance Issues To ensure responsibility and accountability for the overall quality of care recei ved by participants during the study period, clinical governance issues pertaining to all aspects of routine management will be brought to the attention of the TSC and, where applicable, to individual NHS Trusts. 21. Quality Assurance , Ethical and Regulatory Considerations 21.1 Quality Assurance The trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of GCP in clinical trials, as applicable under UK regulations, the NHS Research Governance Framework (RGF) , and through adherence to CTRU Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) . 21.2 Serious Breaches The CTRU and Sponsor have systems in place to ensure that serious breaches of GCP or the trial protocol are picked up and reported. Investigators are required to promptl y notify the CTRU of a serious breach (as defined by Regulation 29A of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 and amendments ) that they become aware of. A “serious breach” is a breach which is likely to effect to a significant degre e – a) the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the trial; or b) the scientific value of the trial"
74,page_74,"EMT2 Protocol, Version 7.0, 7th May 2021 75 For further information, the Investigator should contact the Senior Trial Co -ordinator at the CTRU. 21.3 Ethical considerations The trial will be performed in accordance with the recommendations guiding physicians in biomedical research involving human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, 1964, amended at the 52nd World Medical Association General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1996 . Informed written consent will be obtained from the participants prior to randomisation into the trial. The right of a patient to refuse participation without giving reasons must be respected. The participant must remain free to wi thdraw at any time from the trial without giving reasons and without prejudicing his /her further treatment. The trial will be submitted to and approved by a main REC and the appropriate Site Specific Assessor for each participating centre prior to enterin g participants into the trial. The CTRU will provide the main REC with a copy of the final protocol, participant information sheets, consent forms and all other relevant trial documentation. 22.

Publication Policy The trial will be registered with an authorised registry, according to the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Guidelines, prior to the start of recruitment. The success of the trial depends upon the collaboration of all participant s. For this reason, credit for the main results will be given to all those who have collaborated in the trial, through authorship and contributorship. Uniform requirements for authorship for manuscripts submitted to medical journals will guide authorship d ecisions. These state that authorship credit should be based only on substantial contribution to:  conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data,  drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content,  and final approval of the version to be published,  and that all these conditions must be met ( www.icmje.org ). In light of this, the Chief Investigator, and relevant senior CTRU staff will be named as authors in any publication. In addition, all collaborators will be listed as contributors for the main trial publication, giving details of roles in planning, conducting and reporting the trial. To maintain the scientific integrity of the trial, data wi ll not be released prior to the first publication of the analysis of the primary endpoint, either for trial publication or oral presentation purposes, without the permission of the Trial Steering Committee and Yorkshire Cancer Research . In addition, indivi dual collaborators must not publish data concerning their participants which is directly relevant to the questions posed in the trial until the first publication of the analysis of the primary endpoint."
