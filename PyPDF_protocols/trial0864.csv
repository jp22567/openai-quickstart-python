Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulatin g hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) . Relugo lix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries), every 3 -months (3 -M) by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy. This study will evaluat e the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer . To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investigator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy . Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and /or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 12 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to baseline. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/dL (5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries ) 3-M depot subcutaneous or intramuscular injection , respectively, plus an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and age. Approximately 1125 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment P eriod of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days . Additionally, unscheduled follow -up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient- reported outcomes (European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer [E ORTC ] QLQ -C30, European Quality of Life 5 -Dimesion 5- Level questionnaire [Euro Qol EQ-5D-5L]) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment P eriod and mor e frequently during the F ollow -up P eriod. Additional s erum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. R elugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECG) , and Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 13 CONFIDENTIAL"

Randomization will be stratified by geographic region ( North and South America versu s Europe v ersus Asia and Rest of World) , presence of metastatic disease on baseline imaging (yes versu s no), and age (≤ 75 years old versu s > 75 years old ). The 2-sided type I error rate for this study is 0.05. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of achieving testosterone suppression to castrate level s of ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 Day 1 (Study Day 337) . This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method wit h the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1. 7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rule s will be pre specified in the statistical analysis plan. There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: t o determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater t han or equal to 90% to meet this criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2 : to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non-inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The 2-sided type I error rate will be 0.05 for each individual evaluation criterion. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1. Castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) prior to dosing on Week 1 Day 4, prior to dosing on Week 2, and prior to dosing on Week 3; 2. Profound castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 20 ng/dL ( 0.7 nmol/L) from Week 25 through Week 49; 3. PSA response rate: proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA from baseline at Week 2 and confirmed at Week 5; 4.

The methods and procedures needed to maintain a study -wide 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan. Pharmacokinetics Relugolix plasma concentrations will be summarized and described using population PK methods. Plasma PK parameters in a subset of patients from China and Japan will be determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety Safety assessments, including adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs , will be summarized for the treatment-emergent period. The treatment- emergent period is defined as the time from first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last d ose of leuprolide acetate . Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive an y amount of study drug (Safety population). Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the N ational Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) and will be coded to preferred term, higher- level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. Descriptive rather than inferential statistics will be used. Laboratory values also will be classified by toxicity grade based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE.

For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of ≤ 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non -inferiority margin of -10% and a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at least 99% power in declaring the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed after at least 915 patients have had the opportunity to complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans. Up to approximately 1125 men will be randomized in order to fulfill the regulatory requirements of all participating countries. This includes approximately 90 patients from Japan, approximately 111 patients in South Korea, and approximately 200 patients from China PR.

Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the US [ Greenlee, 2001] and Europe [ Ferlay , 2007]. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years, and diagnosis before the age of 40 years is rare [ Cersosimo , 1996]. In Japanese men, prostate cancer was the fourth leading cancer diagnosis in 2 007 [ Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research , 2012]. The incidence of invasi ve prostate cancer increases with age; a clear increase is seen among men aged 60 years or older [Siegel , 2014]. If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successfu l in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as either: PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation the rapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Androgens, such as testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone, are strong tumor promoters for prostate cancer [Bosland, 2014]. Through the androgen receptor, they synergistically augment the effect of other tumor promoters or carcinogens. Although prostate cancer is driven by presumed mutations in other tumor promoting pathways and/or by translocations leading to aberrant activation of the androgen receptor pathway, most early- stage prostate cancer cells remain either sensitive to or dependent upon circulating androgens. Thus, for more than 60 years, androgen deprivation therapy with surgical or medical castration has been the foundational therapy for either advanced inoperable or meta static cancer. Increasingly, androgen deprivation therapy is used earlier as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment to radiation therapy or for biochemical or clinical relapse after local therapies of curative or palliative intent. Mo re than 80% of men with progressive or advanced disease initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization [Kreis , 1995]. The duration and depth of response to androgen deprivation therapy is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastases respond for an ave rage of 2 years before any biochemical evidence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical -only evidence of progressive disease may respond to androgen deprivation therapy for 5 years or more [Klotz , 2015]. Currently, most patients in developed countries receive medical rather than surgical castration. GnRH (or LH-releasing hormone) agonists (ie, long- acting leuprolide acet ate depot injections) are the current mainstay of medical castration, causing long -term desensitization and down regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary gonadal axis. One disadvantage of the agonist form of GnRH is the initial stimulation of the axis las ting 1 to 3 weeks that occurs prior to desensitization. This results in a rise in LH and testosterone levels and an increase in clinical symptoms. In addition, at the time of repeat injection of GnRH agonist depot, microsurges of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 27 CONFIDENTIAL"
28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 1.0, 13 Jan 2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 27 CONFIDENTIAL LH and testosterone may occur, although the apparent incidence is low [ Klotz , 2008]. The initial flare response may be managed with simultaneous antiandrogen administration, such as with bicalutamide . Recently, GnRH antagonists, in particular degarelix, [Firmagon , 2016], have become available as an alternative form of medical castration. Degarelix, an injectable peptide, has been approved in some countries for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer . As a GnRH antagonist, degarelix achieves medical castration and PSA response with no initial agonist activity within the first 1 to 2 weeks of administration, and effectively can obviate the need for concomitant antiandrogen treatment. Post- hoc analyses of degarelix trials [Tombal , 2010] suggest that it may have additional advantages regarding disease response or secondary relapse; however, such differences require confirmation in prospective studies. Because of the need for monthly depot injections, with large volumes and accompanying local reactions, the use of degarelix in clinical practice has remained low. Relugolix , previously known as TAK-385, is a potent and highly selective oral small molecule antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. For patients, relugolix may offer the advantages conferred by a direct receptor antagonist, including a more rapid onset of action and the abse nce of clinical flare or worsening of symptoms from the initial rise in androgens caused by GnRH agonists, as well as having the added convenience and relative comfort of oral dosing. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix is being developed as a once daily oral m edication for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The proposed dose of relugolix is 120 mg administered orally once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120-mg tablets) on Day 1. 2.2.2. Pharmacology Relugolix is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective, high -affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH . Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotrophin- secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH -stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH fall rapidly, followed by a decline over a few days in testosterone in men and estradiol and progesterone levels in women. Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock -in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic -pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher.

Nonclinical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugolix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates ) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in rats (≥ 1000 mg/kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no-observed- effect level for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day, and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg/kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (area under the concentration -time curve [ AUC ]) in men receiving 120 mg once daily (0. 469 μg⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduc t of clinical studies up to the NOAEL ( 15 mg/kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg·hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mouse and rat studies. Embryo- fetal death was observed only in relugolix-treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg/kg (es timated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human Thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg ( C max of 0.181 µg/mL). 2.2.4. Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studies evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of relugolix, including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose -dependent suppression of testosterone in male subjects and estradiol in female subjects.

In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The PK and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated, and appear to be similar in Western and Asian volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Asian volunteers. A relative bioavailability and food effect study was conducted using the global phase 3 prostate cancer formulation of 120 mg relugolix. A fter administration with a high -fat, high -calorie breakfast, the C max and AUC of relugolix were reduced, on average, by 21.4% and 18.8%, respectively. In the phase 1 study C27001, serum LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and testosterone concentrations were determined in healthy men following single and multiple oral doses of relugolix or placebo for up to 28 days. Loading doses of ≥ 160 mg on Day 1 were used to shorten the time to testosterone suppression. Relugolix caused an immediate and effective suppression of LH, FSH, and testosterone. After 14 days of once daily dosing, mean LH and serum testosterone concentration profiles were similar for the 40, 80, and 180 mg relugolix dose cohorts. LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations began decreasing 2 to 6 hours postdose on Day 1 and remained suppressed through Day 14. However, the r elugolix once daily maintenance dose was a major determinant of sustained testosterone suppression. Profound castration (defined as average testosterone levels < 20 ng/dL or 0.7 nmol/L) was achieved with 40, 80, or 180 mg once daily for 14 days; however, 20 mg once daily was insufficient in maintaining adequate suppression of serum LH and testosterone concentration levels during the second week. In healthy, older men receiving 14 or 28 days of dosing, effective castration was consistently achieved over 14 and 28 days dosing at daily doses of 40 to 180 mg (14 days) and 80 to 160 mg (28 days). Use of a loading dose for up to 3 days (or once daily doses of ≥ 160 mg) resulted in castration levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L) within 24 to 48 hours. Results obtained after 28 days of dosing suggested that the likely minimal, fully effective maintenance dose for sustained castration would be relugolix ≥ 80 mg once daily. Doses of 80 mg and 120 mg were moved forward into phase 2 development. Relugoli x is to be administered in the fasted state (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal), as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption by approximately 20%. The exposure of relugolix is increased b y inhibitors of P-glycoprotein up to 6-fold, but relugolix does not significantly impact the exposure of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 substrates. In a dedicated study, relugolix did not prolong QTc at single doses of 60 or 360 mg . 2.2.4.2. Clinical Studies in Men with Prostate Cancer One phase 1 study and 2 phase 2 studies have been conducted evaluating relugolix in men with prostate cancer. Study TB -AK160108 is an ongoing multicenter phase 1, open-label, dose range-finding study conducted in hormone treatment-naïve Asian patients with non- metastatic prostate cancer. The study consists of a dose-rising phase (Part A) and an expansion phase (Part B). In Part A, a loading dose of relugolix (320 or 360 mg) was administered on Day 1 followed by once daily dosing on Days 2 through 28, with the dosage dependent on the individual cohort of 3 to 4 Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 30 CONFIDENTIAL"

In Part B, 30 patients receive a maximum of 96 weeks treatment at doses of 80 and 120 mg once daily (N = 15 each arm, loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1). Testosterone reduction by both doses of relugolix was rapid and sustained through 48 weeks. Both the 80- and 120- mg once daily doses were evaluated in phase 2 clinical studies. Study C27003 is a phase 2 study that enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily following a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks following a single loading dose of 240 mg (N = 38) for 24 weeks. External beam radiation therapy was initiated for most patients between Week 13 and Week 15. Relugolix 120 mg administered orally once daily rapidly suppressed testosterone levels below the castration threshold (50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels from the end of Week 4 through at least 24 weeks. The levels of testosterone suppression achieved by relugolix were similar to those achieved by monthly injections of degarelix. Profound castration rates below the lower testosterone threshold of < 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) were also similar in the relugolix and degarelix groups (Table 2-1).

In both treatment groups, the average reduction in estimated prostate volumes was similar, approximately 30%. Following discontinuation of therapy at the end of 24 weeks, patients were followed for an additional 12 weeks to evaluate testosterone recovery and associated changes in PSA and quality of life. At the end of the follow-up period, approximately half of the patients receiving relugolix had recovered either to the baseline testosterone value or to > 280 ng/dL, whichever was less, compared to only 6% of patients receiving degarelix (Figure 2-1 ).

Study C27002 is a phase 2 study of relugolix and leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer who require first-line androgen deprivation therapy, which is ongoing in North America. This study was designed to help plan the population, dosing, and assessment schedules for phase 3 studies in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Eligible patients in C27002 have evidence of advanced prostate cancer including either: 1) PSA biochem ical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; 2) newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer ; or 3) advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. In this open- label, parall el group study, patients we re randomized to receive 1 of 2 dose levels of oral relugolix (80 or 120 mg [patients randomized to relugolix received a loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1], N = 50 per group) or to an observation cohort to receive standard GnRH the rapy with leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg administered by intramuscular injection every 12 weeks ( N = 25).

Clinical Safety of Relugolix in Men with Prostate Cancer A full description of the safety data for relugolix from clinical trials is available in th e Investigator Brochure. Overall, approximately 632 healthy volunteers (330 women, 302 men), 535 female patients with uterine fibroids (N = 229) or endometriosis (N = 306), and 218 male patients with prostate cancer received at least 1 dose of relugolix. Data from the 175 patients with prostate cancer who received relugolix in randomized, open -label, parallel -group pha se 2 studies, C27002 and C27003, provide the basis for the frequency of expected adverse events associated with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. The adverse drug reactions in the prostate cancer indication observed in the phase 2 studies include hot flush (59%), fatigue (26%), arthralgia (10%), nausea (5%), and gynecomastia (3%). No clinical evidence of PLD has observed in any relugolix clinical study. Leuprolide Acetate Depot 3 -M Leuprolide acetate depot is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer. Leupro lide acetate acts as an agonist at pituitary GnRH (gonadotropin- releasing hormone) receptors. Leupro lide acetate has greater receptor affinity, reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and is approximately 100-fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin- producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and FSH, which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leydig cells. Initially, leuprolide acetate stimulates LH production, which in turn causes a surge of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for 5 to 12 days before the ultimate inhibition of LH. This androgen surge of male hormones can cause a flar e reaction (“clinical flare”), which may lead to an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [Tolis , 1982; Schally , 1980; Waxman , 1985; Conn, 1991; Limonata , 2001]. Chronic stimulation by the GnRH agonist ultimately desensitizes the GnRH receptors, downregulating the secretion of gonadotropins, LH, and FSH, leading to hypogonadism and thus a dram atic reduction in testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on which continued growth of prostate cancer cells depends. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels within 3 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels. The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible over time upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors. The flare phenomenon can be effectively prevented with antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [ Loblaw , 2004] . First generation antiandrogens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide bind to androgen receptors and competitively inhibit their interaction with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. They are often used in an attempt to limit the clinical sequelae produced by th e hormonal surge resulting from GnRH agonist treatment .

This study will evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels ( ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer. To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investigator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy. Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 12 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 12 months prior to baseline. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/ dL (5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or leupr olide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries ) 3-M depot subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, respectively, plus an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and age. Approximately 1125 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia- Pacific region. The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days. Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient- reported outcomes ( EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ -PR25, EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment Period and more frequently during the Follow-up Period. Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should remain on study and may receive additional oral therapy, systemic antineoplastic, and/or radiotherapy as prescribed b y the investigator.

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is designed to establish the safety and efficacy of relugolix 120 mg orally once daily in men with advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for androgen -sensitive disease. This study will focus on the primary objective of evaluating the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in patients with advanced prostate cancer. During the Treatment Period of the study (Day 1 to Week 49 [Study Day 337]), patients will be randomized to one of the study treatment arms: oral loading dose of relugolix (360 mg) followed by 120 mg once daily of relugoli x or leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection of 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in some Asian countries) at 12 -week intervals for 48 weeks. Patients treated with leuprolide acetate will a lso receive an antiandrogen for 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. The study is designed to allow for global approvals, however, different regulatory agencies require different criteria for the demonstration of efficacy. The United States (US) Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) requires , for approval , a primary efficacy criterion to determine whether the sustained castration rate (defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L] while on relugolix study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 through Week 49 Day 1) is greater than or equal to 90%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion. The study includes a leuprolide acetate arm to meet the regulatory requirement of other regions to establish the non- inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection as Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 41 CONFIDENTIAL"
42,page_42,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 1.0, 13 Jan 2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 41 CONFIDENTIAL assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority marg in of -10% to meet this criterion. The dose of relugolix selected is based on data from phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrating that oral doses of 80 mg and 120 mg once daily following an oral loading dose of 320 mg were able to suppress testosterone to castra te level s (see Section 2.2.4.2 and the Inves tigator Brochure). A loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120- mg tablets) was selected for phase 3 so that only one tablet size was required. Leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection was selected as the comparator as this is the GnRH agonist used most commonly as standard of care in the population under evaluation. Degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist , was considered, but was not used as it has limited market uptake attributed at least in part to a significant number of injection site reactions. 4.3. Selection of Study Population Approximately 1125 men with advanced prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . Enrollment is defined as the time at which a patient is randomized to a treatment group and receives at least one dose of study drug. Deviations from inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptabi lity, or patient safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Any questions regarding patient eligibility and entry criteria should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to randomizing the patient. 4.3.1.

Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations Patient eligibility may require additional or repeat assessments such as safety labs, vital signs, or ECG during the Screening Period . To assess any potential impact on patient eligibility with regard to safety, the investigator is referred to the Investigator Brochure for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events, and other significant data pertaining to the investigational product(s) used in this study. 4.5. Screening Screening numbers will be assigned to each patient who signs an informed consent form and begins the Screening Period. Study site personnel will access the interactive voice/web recognition system (I WRS) to assign a screening identification number to a potential patient. For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria, or withdraw consent are cons idered screen failures and are not randomized. Study site personnel should ensure that the source record includes documentation for the screen failure (eg, medical history, eligibility criteria, procedures performed). Patient numbers assigned to patients who become screen failures are not to be reused. Patient identification numbers will be assigned to eligible patients at randomization, as described in Section 4.6. 4.6. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient Identification Number After a patient is screened and the investigator determines that the patient is eligible for enrollment, the site staff will complete the Randomization Auth orization Form and send it to the sponsor ( Myovant Sciences GmbH ) or sponsor designee per the instructions in the Study Reference Manual . The sponsor (or designee) will approve the patient’s enrollment in writing. Once the site has received approval, the patient may undergo the Baseline Day 1 v isit. T he site will randomize the patient to treatment by using the IWRS during the patient’s Baseline Day 1 visit. The IW RS will assign the patient identification (ID) number. This number will identify the patient for the duration of the study. A study treatment kit number will be available at the site accord ing to the randomization code.

Removal of Patients from Therapy Patients may withdraw consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason. Investigators or the m edical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below. Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Week 49 visit on the Schedule of Activities . The End of Treatment is defined as the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks after the last leuprolide acetate injection . Follow-up visits to assess safety will be performed in all study patients. If the patient plans to start alternative androgen deprivati on therapy less than 30 days after the End of Treatment visit, the Safety Follow -up visit may occur earlier, before the start of the alternative androgen deprivation therapy. Testosterone recovery will be evaluated in the first 100 patients randomized to relugolix and 50 patients to leuprolide acetate who complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment and, in the opinion of the investigator, are candidates for intermittent androgen deprivation therapy and will not be offered alternative androgen deprivation therapy upon completion of study therapy . The se patients will return for the 60- and 90- day follow -up Testosterone Recovery visits.

The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit sched ule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. Patients randomized to relugolix should be counseled to notify the investigator in the event of intercurrent illness to determine if the study drug treatment can be continued. Every effort should be made to ensure the patient’s compliance with study drug treatment, including calling patients to reschedule missed visits. In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the patient. The site should attempt at least 3 documented telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing add ress so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 4.8. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance It is not known what effects relugolix has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. A patient must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman. Patients must not donate sperm from first dose of study drug through 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Nonsterilized male patients should use a male condom, either alone or in addition to effective methods of contraception used by a female partner of childbearing potential, through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below. Examples of effective contraceptive methods include condoms, hormonal contraceptives, and intrauterine devices. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to one of the following: • Use a male condom if having sex with a woman of childbearing age or a pregnant woman, during the entire study T reatment Period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug; or • Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 5. TREATMENTS 5.1.

Dose Escalation, Dose Reduction, and Dose Interruption Neither dose escalations nor dose reductions are allowed in the study. Every effort should be made to continue relugolix administration through treatment- emergent adverse events unless they are grade 3 or 4 and related to study drug, or the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient to interrupt relugolix dosing . Of note, patients on leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection continue to receive GnRH agonist therapy because it is imposs ible to discontinue treatment. If the grade 3 or 4 adverse event improves to g rade 0, 1 , or 2 after holding the dose, or if the adverse event is no longer believed to be related to study drug , the patient may be rechallenged at the same dose at the discretion of the investigator and medical monitor. If the adverse event remains grade 3 or grade 4 after treatment discontinuation and the investigator continues to believe the adverse event is related to study drug, study drug treatment should be discontinued permanen tly. 5.7. Storage, Packaging, and Labeling Relugolix will be packaged in bottles containing 45 120- mg tablets of relugolix. Additional details regarding the packaging of relugolix are provided in the Investigator Brochure and Study Reference Manual . Leuprolide acetate 11.25 mg or 22.5 mg 3- M depot injection will be packaged and labeled for clinical trial use. Relugolix medication should be stored in an appropriate, limited -access, secure location , protected from light, in the original bottles and within a temperature range at 2 0°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) with excursions perm itted to 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) as indicated on the label.

Instructions for collection and processing of blood specimens are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 6.6.1.2. Relugolix Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patient s randomized to relugolix study drug. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of relugolix will be c ollected at the visits indicate d in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients will be instructed to take their dose of study drug in the clinic at these visits. Study drug will be administered on an empty stomach or at least 2 hours before food, and food will be withheld for 1 hour after dosing. The date and time of their previous dose of study drug (ie, the dose the day before the clinic visit) will be accurately recorded. If the study patient inadvertently took the study drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the date and time of that dose should al so be accurately recorded and the pharmacokinetic sample collected, which may be used for population PK modeling. Plasma from the Week 5 and Week 13 visits in all patients will be analyzed for relugolix plasma concentration. Analysis of other individual patient plasma samples will be performed on a case-by-case basis (such as those patients with non -castrate testosterone levels). Collection, processing, storage, and shipping instructions will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Plasma analysis of relugolix will be performed by the sponsor (or designee).

Pharmacogenomic s Sample Collection Whole Blood Sample for Germline Deoxyribonucleic Acid Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. P articipation of study patients in pharmacogenomic sample collection is optional. A pharmacogenomics sample will be collected from patients at all participating study centers, with individual patient consent and per local ethics and regulatory standards. The sample will be retained for germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of potential genetic determinants of drug safety, drug efficacy or disease response, and drug metabolism. Every patient must sign informed consent/be consented in order to participate in the sampling of whole blood for DNA analysis. This research may be used to develop a better u nderstanding of the safety and efficacy of relugolix and other study drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condition being studied, and for improving the efficiency, design and study methods of future research studies. Two venous whole blood sample (3 mL per sample) for the analysis of germline DNA will be collected at Day 1 from all patients who have provided informed consent . The DNA sample s are expected to be collected at the Day 1 visit, but if necessary, may be collected at any visit after randomization. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if isolation of DNA from the first sample was not successful or possible. Germline DNA analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or diseases, which may lead to additional hypothesis- generating exploratory research on stored samples. Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the result of any analyses and corresponding information will be identified only by a code in a computer dat abase. The whole blood samples for DNA analysis will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated central laboratory vendor until 15 years after completion of this study (HERO, MVT -601-3201) and/or until the drug development of relugolix is no longer actively pursued by Myovant or its collaborators. The storage period for these samples may be adjusted by country in accordance with local regulatory and/or legal requirements for the storage of research samples. Such changes will be reflect ed in the I nstitutional Review Board (I RB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) country- specific informed consent form. After that time, the samples will be properly destroyed by the central laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor. The investigator will keep records linking the patient identity with the samples for the time required by applicable law. Patients who consent and provide a pharmacogenomic sample for DNA analysis can withdraw their consent and request disposal of a stored sampl e at any time.

Quality of Life European Quality of Life 5- Dimension 5 -Level Assessment The EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L comprises 5 scales and an overall assessment of health status on a visual analogue scale ( Appendix 2) . The 5 scales include: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The original version, the EQ-5D-3L, includes 3 response options for each scale. However, a new 5-level response-option version, the EQ-5D-5L, has been developed with the following response options: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. It is believed that the EQ -5D-5L is superior to the EQ- 5D-3L in terms of feasibility, ceiling effects, discriminatory power, and convergent validity. The EQ-5D- 5L index values will be calculated from the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system scores based on the Crosswalk value sets [EuroQol Group, 1990; Brooks , 1996; Herdman , 2011; Janssen , 2013].

The EORTC QLQ -C30 core measurement will be used to capture distal outcomes, including physical, social functioning, and overall health- related quality of life. The QLQ-C30 core questionnaire incorporates 30 questions comprising 9 multi- item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality of life scale. Several single -item symptom measures are also included. It is a reliable and valid measure of health -related quality of life in patients with cancer and takes about 11 minutes to administer. The instrument has been validated and used in many countries [ Aaronson, 1993]. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 is the 25-item Prostate Cancer module (P25) of the EORTC. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 contains 3 additional symptom scales (urinary, bowel, sexual) and 5 treatment -related items. 6.6.2. Safety -Related Procedures 6.6.2.1.

Biological Sample Retention and Destruction Biological samples present at the conclusion of this stu dy may be retained in storage by the sponsor for a period up to 10 years for purposes of this study. Samples of 5 mL of whole blood collected for pharmacogenomics testing (see Section 6.6.1.3) will be stored frozen at an appropriate vendor facility identified by the sponsor. The need to conduct pharmacogenomic analysis may be identified after this study (or additional studies) has been completed. For this reason, the collected samples will be retained for up to 10 years after the last patient completes the study. A patient m ay request the destruction of his sample at any time. The sponsor may destroy the samples sooner than 10 years after the study comp letes. 7. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations including visual acuity assessment , vital signs , weight, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre -existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately); and Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 65 CONFIDENTIAL"
66,page_66,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 1.0, 13 Jan 2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 65 CONFIDENTIAL • An investigational a bnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms; o Requires active intervention; or o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet the definition of an adverse event include: o Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event; o The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression; o Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug administration that do not worsen; and o Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitalization for an elective procedure, with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent). Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the investigator and graded accor ding to CTCAE ( Appendix 5) . Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are “inter mittent” . All other events are “continuous”. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted ; however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 10 days for evaluation and treatment of an adverse event. The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurr ence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is life -threatening ; NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patien t has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phys ician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event .

Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated h eadache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Important medical events that jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchosp asm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.2. Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local I RB/I EC. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feelin g?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient’s answers to the EQ-5D- 5L will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, p roper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determ ine if additional follow- up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 67 CONFIDENTIAL"

Overdose and pregnancy in a partner will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively . 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will be collected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the safety F ollow-up visit approximately 30 da ys after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection . Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. Any event occurring between signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who continues to me et eligibility criteria and proceeds to dosing with study drug. 7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The definitions in Table 7-1 are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug. Table 7-1 Causal Relationship to Study Drug Relationship Criteria Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re-administration (re-challenge) or withdrawal (de- challenge). Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation.

In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken. The investigator must determine th e severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE (see Appendix 5) . For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the cr iteria in Table 7-2 should be used to determine the grade severity. Table 7-2 Criteria for Determining the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified by the National Cancer Institute CTCAE Grade Criteria 1/Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 2/Moderate Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 3/Severe or medically significant Not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self- care activities of daily living 4/Life -threatening Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 5/Death Death related to adverse event Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. 7.5. Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting Adverse events of clinical interest in this study are defined as any increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN. Any ALT or AST elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the randomized T reatment Period or the Follow-up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the serious adverse event form within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event (see Section 7.6), even if the event does not meet serious adverse event criteria.

Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug in Association with Liver Test Abnormalities Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA dru g-induced liver injury guidelines [FDA , 2009]. If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status), and the event reported as a serious adverse event: • ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or • ALT or AST > 5 x ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%). Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. The investigator and sponsor must discuss and a gree with any decision to rechallenge. Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered possibly drug induced. 7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug in Association with Liver Test Abnormalities Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, potential severe drug -induced liver injury/Hy’s law case): 1) AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 x ULN; AND 2) Total bilirubin increases to > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5; A ND 3) Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 x ULN; AND 4) No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; important alternative causes include, but are not limited to the following: • Hepatobiliary tract disease ; • Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus); • Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms; • Alcoholic hepatitis ; • Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ; or • Autoimmune hepatitis . If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) whether study drug treatment should be withheld or permanently discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the patient.

Study Drug Overdose Management The medical monitor must be contacted in the event of any study drug overdose. An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a study patient, at a dose above that assigned to that individual patient according to the study protocol. For this study, any dose of relugolix > 240 mg within a 24-hour window is an overdose, except for the 360-mg loading dose on Day 1. The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose; supportive treatment should be provided as clinically applicable. In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: • Contact the medical monitor immediately ; • Closely monitor the patient for adverse events and laboratory abnormalities ; • All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awa reness by the study site, using a serious adverse event form, whether or not the overdose is associated with an adverse event; • If possible, obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 2 days from the date of the last dose of study drug if requested by th e medical monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis); and • Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. The medical monitor, in consultation with the i nvestigator, will make decisions regarding patient status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patient. 7.8. Pregnancy Reporting If the partner of any patient becomes pregnant during the study or through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, the investigator must inform the sponsor of the pregnancy. The patient should remain on study drug treatment, unless otherwise indicated. If the patient agrees, the patient’s pregnant partner should be notified and requested to sign a Release of Information form, permitting transfer of information regarding the pregnancy and outcome to the sponsor. A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness by the s tudy site personnel, using the pregnancy reporting forms. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this information, as avai lable. The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report the outcome to the sponsor. 7.9.

Table 7-3 Relugolix Potential Risks and Mitigation Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Mitigation Strategy Impact on Eligibility Monitoring and Stopping Criteria Hepatic Enzyme Increases Isolated increases in hepatic enzymes have been observed in prior clinical studies. Hepatic enzyme increases, considered an important potential risk of treatment with relugolix, are closely monitored in accordance with FDA guidelines for assessing drug - induced liver injury [ FDA , 2009] in all relugolix studies. Exclusion criteria for AST and ALT > 1 x the ULN; total bilirubin values > 1.0 ULN unless consistent with Gilbert’s syndrome. Liver chemistry will be monitored during the study. Appropriate liver stopping criteria and follow-up procedures are detailed in Section 7.5.2. Phospholipidosis Data from nonclinical studies in rats and monkeys showed histopathological changes consistent with PLD. PLD by itself is not adverse. No clinical evidence of relugolix- related PLD -associated toxicity has been observed nor was there a clinically meaningful increase in a biomarker of PLD assessed in phase 2 clinical studies. Patients with significant underlying medical conditions are excluded. Routine safety monitoring including laboratory assessments, ECGs, and assessment of adverse events; visual acuity will be evaluated during the study. Risks Associated with Medical Castration Acute and subsequent chronic symptoms of medical castration (reduction of testosterone to ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) include vasomotor symptoms or hot flushes, disturbed sleep related to vasomotor symptoms, decreased libido, and fatigue or loss of energy. These side effects are usually not severe and can be managed with anticipatory guidance. Long-term suppression of testosterone is associated with well- characterized risks including bone loss, decreased muscle mass, possible changes in insulin sensitivity with increased risk of diabetes, altered lipid metabolism, and possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ Oefelein , 2002; Lopez , 2005; Diamond ,1998; Keating , 2006; Braga - Basaria , 2006; Saigal , 2007; Tsai, 2007 ; D'Amico , 2007; Efstathiou , 2009]. - Effects can usually be managed with appropriate anticipatory guidance (eg, diet and exercise programs) or supportive therapy when required (e g, lipid-lowering or bone- sparing agen ts). Metabolic Changes Metabolic changes (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased weight) with increased risk of diabetes are a potential risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix. - Fasting lipids and glucose will be monitored during the study.

DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 8.1. Clinical Procedures Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site if necessary prior to initiation of the study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitor ing requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the Study Reference Manual with the site personnel. 8.2. Monitoring This study will be monitored by the sponsor (or designee) in accordance with current Good Clinical P ractice regulations. By signing this protocol, the i nvestigator grants permission to Myovant Sciences GmbH (or designee) and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on- site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation. In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports). During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality. A study monitor will contact and visit the site regularly and will be allowed, on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of the study. It will be the s tudy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries , and to meet with th e investigator to discuss study progress and compliance with the protocol and Good Clinical Practices. The study monitor should have access to laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. For this study, patient data will be entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee).

Analysis Populations The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients randomized to treatment who have taken at least one dose of study treatment. This will be the primary population used for the efficacy analysis. Patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assi gnment. The Per -Protocol population will consist of those members of the ITT population who have no major protocol deviations as defined in the statistical analysis plan , considering the following protocol deviations but not limited to : • Those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria; • Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn; • Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; • Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment. The Per -Protocol population will not be analyzed if this population comprises more than 95% or less than 50% of the ITT population. The Per -Protocol population will be used as a sensitivity analysis of the ITT population for the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary endpoints. The Per-Protocol population will be identified prior to the database lock. The primary population for safety analyses will be the Safety population, defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of any study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment assignment. 9.3. Efficacy Analyses 9.3.1. Primary Endpoint Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate, defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 (Study Day 337). This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier met hod with the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rules will be described in the statistical analysis plan . There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirement s for assessing benefit : • Evaluation Criterion 1: to determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion .

77,page_77,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 1.0, 13 Jan 2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 76 CONFIDENTIAL • Evaluation Criterion 2: to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The confidence interval of the treatment difference will be calculated using the formula 𝑉��𝑆1�(𝑡)−𝑆2�(𝑡)�=𝑉��𝑆1�(𝑡)�+ 𝑉��𝑆2�(𝑡)� , where each of the variance of the Kaplan -Meier estimate will be calculated using the Greenwood's formula 𝑉 ��𝑆̂(𝑡)�=𝑆̂(𝑡)2�∑𝑑𝑗 𝑛𝑗�𝑛𝑗−𝑑𝑗�𝑗:𝑡(𝑗)≤𝑡 � ; nj denote the number of patients at risk at time t (j) and d j denote the number of events observed at time t(j)) [Lachin , 2000]. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans. The 2-sided type I error rates for the final analyses will be controlled at 0.05 separately for each regional analysis. 9.3.2. Secondary Endpoint Analyses If the result of the primary endpoint is statistically significant, the secondary endpoints will be analyzed .

Further details of the secondary analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan . 9.4. Safety Analyses The safety analyses will be based on the Safety p opulation. Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyz ing adverse events , laboratory analytes, vital signs, ECG parameters, and concomitant medications. The severity of all adverse events is to be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. All adverse events will be coded t o preferred term and system organ class using MedDRA 19.1 or higher. The incidence of adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug treatment, and severity. A patient reporting the same adver se event more than once is counted once, and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to study drug treatment when calculating incidence. Laboratory data consist of chemistry, hematology, and hormonal tests. Only data collected by the central lab oratory will be used for analyses. The National Cancer Institute CTCAE will be used to categorize toxicity grade for the laboratory parameters. Shift tables will be provided for each gradable parameter to summarize baseline toxicity grade versus post- baseline toxicity grade. For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by the CTCAE, a shift table based upon the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summarize the baseline versus post- baseline results. 9.5. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Plasma relugolix concentration s will be listed and summarized and included in the clinical study report . PK data will be pooled with data from other studies in healthy male patient s and patients with prostate cancer for further pop ulation PK analysis, including evaluation of covariates of relugolix PK parameters, and for input into a population PK /pharmacodynamics models describing the Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 78 CONFIDENTIAL"

These population PK analyses will be detailed further in a separate statistical analysis plan and report. For patients from China and Japan in the PK subset, plasma relugolix PK parameters Cmax, AUC 0-τ, and t max from Day 1 and Day 14 of dosing will be determined. Population PK or PK/pharmacodynamic analyses may be conducted to explore the factors that affect relugolix exposure or to contribute to the assessment of the relationships between exposure and testosterone. 9.6. Endocrine Marker Analyses Endocrine markers will be analyzed to see effects of relugolix and leuprolide acetate as measured as absolute value and change from baseline for: • LH at Week 2, Week 3, Week 5, and then every 4 weeks until Week 49 and/or last follow-up visit; • FSH at Week 5, Week 13, Week 25, Week 37, and Week 49 visits ; • Dihydrotestosterone at Week 5, Week 13, Week 25, Week 37, and Week 49 visits ; and • Sex hormone binding globulin at Week 13, Week 25, and Week 49 visits . 9.7. Exploratory Analyses Overall survival : Overall survival defined as time from randomization to date of death prior to data cutoff date. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions for each treatment arm. Pharmacogenomic analys es may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety, pending availability of samples. Polymorphisms in germline genes related to the h ypothalamic -pituitary -androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or to drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter proteins that might be implicated in the drug disposition, safety, or efficacy of relugolix. These analyses will be detailed in a separate statis tical analysis plan and associated report s. 9.8. Interim Analyses There will be no planned interim e fficacy analysis for the study. 9.9. Sample Size To calculate the sample size required for the primary efficacy endpoint of this study, the following assumptions have been made: • True probabilities of sustained testosterone suppression are 94% and 96% for relugolix and leuprolide acetate, respectively ; • 2:1 randomization ratio (relugolix:leuprolide acetate) ; and • Dropout rate of 15%.

It was estimated based on the predicted dose-response relationship for the effect of relugolix on testosterone suppression in patients w ith prostate cancer (data from phase 2 studies C27002 and C27003). The assumed castration rate of 96% for leuprolide acetate was based on the results from degarelix phase 3 registration program [Shore , 2013]. For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of < 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and an overall 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at least 99% power in declaring the non -inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The final analysis will be performed separately for individual evaluation criterion using data collected through 48 weeks after enrollment of appr oximately 915 patients . Up to approximately 1125 patients will be randomized in order to fulfill the regulatory requirements of all participating countries. This includes approximately 90 patients from Japan (60 relugolix, 30 leuprolide acetate) and approximately 200 patients (133 relugolix, 67 leuprolide acetate) from China PR. 10. RESPONSIBILITIES 10.1. Investigator Responsibilities 10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant. For studies conducted under a US investigational new drug application, the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) Part 312, subpart D, “Responsibilities of sponsors and investigators,” 21 CFR Part 50, and 21 CFR Part 56, are adhered to. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR Part 54, is adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 80 CONFIDENTIAL"

Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Approval This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by the investigator to an IRB or IEC. Approval from the IRB or IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 10.1.3. Informed Consent A properly executed, written informed consent, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice , US CFR for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27), and local r egulations, will be obtained from each patient before entering the patient in the trial. The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures. The investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting written informed consent that contains all elements required by national, state, local , and institutional regulations or requirements . Each informed consent form will be appropriately signed and dated by the patien t or the patien t’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent. The investigator will provide copies of the signed informed consent form to each patient (or to the patient’s legal representatives) and will maintain the signed original document within the patient’s record file per local requirements. The investigator will also fully document the informed consent process in the patient’s source records. 10.1.4. Confidentiality The investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only patient number, date of birth, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screened and for all patien ts enrolled in the study.

The i nvestigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: 1) Investigator’s study file: The investigator’s study file will contain the Investigator Brochure , protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, au thorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 2) Patient clinical source documents : The required source data should include the following for each patien t: • Patient identification (name, date of birth, gender); • Documentat ion that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); • Participation in the study (including study number); • Study discussed and date of informed consent; • Dates of all visits; • Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed; • Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol; • Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study medication (drug dispensing and return should be documented as well); • Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and causality and intensity as assigned by the investigator ); • Concomitant medication (including start and e nd date); and • Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. All clinical study documentation must be retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, US , Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with the sponsor. The investigator must notify the sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Clinical study documentation includes the I nvestigator Brochure, signed protocol and amendments, signed informed consents, notification of serious adverse events and related reports, any dispensing and accountability logs, shipping records of investigational product and study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory authorities as applicable, curriculum vitae and all training records of study site personnel, and all correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study. Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance.

When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 10.1.5. Electronic Case Report Forms For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the i nvestigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 form and/or other appropriate local health authority documents within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-randomization Screening Period if an eCRF was initiated). If a patien t withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 10.1.6. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator or investigator’s designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability including dates and lot numbers of all study drug. This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, patient ID number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor ( or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study. All records must be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate regulatory agencies, upon request. Current ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries from the sponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following: • That such deliveries are recorded, for example, on the sponsor-approved drug accountability log, or other sponsor-approved pharmacy log; • That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the label and the study protocol; • That study drug is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with the protocol; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 83 CONFIDENTIAL"
84,page_84,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 1.0, 13 Jan 2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 83 CONFIDENTIAL • That any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor- designated facility or standard procedures for the alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed and only after approval by the sponsor representative. Drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by the investigator/pharmacist. Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent: • The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any persons except the patients in this study; • The investigator/pharmacist will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to those authorized by the investigator to dispense these study drugs; • The investigator/pharmacist will maintain a study drug inventory. The inventory will include details of material received and a clear record of when they were dispensed and to which patient; • The investigator/pharmacist agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory on the drug accountability record at the conclusion or termination of the study. It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and returned study drug. Any discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate forms of deliveries must be signed by the person responsible; • Used or unused study drug may be destroyed at the study site according to standard institutional procedures if the sponsor agrees with the procedure, and after drug accountability has been conducted by the sponsor or representative. Unused study drug not destroyed at the site must be returned to the sponsor- designated facility at the end of the study or upon expiration. 10.1.7. Inspections During the course of the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality assurance audits will be undertaken by authorized sponsor representatives. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was) conducted and monitored in compliance with the protocol as well as recognized Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. These audits will also increase the likelihood that the study data and all other study d ocumentation can withstand a regulatory authority inspection. If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed time. By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee to conduct onsite a udits of all appropriate facilities and study documentation. The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 10.1.8.

Protocol Modifications Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to patients , may be made only by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirements. Approval must be obta ined before changes can be implemented. The investigator must not deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, if required. In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will remove the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of emergency and the course of action taken. The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by the IRB or IEC, and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 10.2.2. Study Report A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies). The sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases. 10.2.3. Posting of Information on Publicly Available Clinical Trial Registers Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers (eg, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) before enrollment of patien ts begins. Results w ill be posted as required. 10.3. Joint Investigator/S ponsor Responsibilities 10.3.1. Access to Information Monitoring In accordance with ICH G ood Clinical Practice guidelines, the s tudy monitor must have direct access to the investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the da ta recorded in the eCRFs for consistency. The study monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.

Adverse Event Severity Grading When assessing adverse events, refer to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, June 14, 2010 (available at: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). A copy of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE table will be provided in the Study Reference Manual . The National Cancer Institute CTCAE is a descriptiv e terminology that can be utilized for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term. Components and Organization of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE • System Organ Class (SOC). SOC, the highest level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) hierarchy, is identified by anatomical or physiological system, etiology, or purpose (eg, SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms are grouped by MedDRA Primary SOCs. Within each SOC, adverse events are listed and accompanied by descriptions of severity (grade). • CTAE Terms. Each CTCAE term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term). • Definitions. A brief definition is provided to cl arify the meaning of each adverse event term. • Grades. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event . The CTCAE displays grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each adverse event based on this general guideline: o Grade 1 M ild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. o Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living; o Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living; o Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicat ed; and o Grade 5 Death related to adverse event . A semi-colon indicates “or” within the description of the grade. A single dash (- ) indicates a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events . Therefore, some adverse events are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. • Grade 5. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some adverse events and therefore is not an option.

Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of andro gen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Number of Patients Planned Approximately 915 total patients Study Objectives Primary : • To evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppress ion to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in men with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer. Secondary : • To evaluate the time course and change in serum testosterone duri ng treatment with relugolix; • To evaluate the time course and magnitude of prostate- specific antigen ( PSA) reduction during treatment with relugolix; • To evaluate testosterone recovery following discontinuation of relugolix; • To evaluate quality of life using validated patient-reported outcome instruments; • To evaluate the safety of relugolix 120 mg once daily in men with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer ; • To evaluate the effect of relugolix and leuprolide acetate on endocrine pharmacodynamic parameters ; • To collect relugolix plasma concentration data to further evaluate relugolix population pharmacokinetics (PK) and the relationship between relugolix exposure and serum testosterone ; and • To characterize the relugolix plasma PK parameters in a subset of patients from China (if enrolled) and Japan ; and • To describe the time course and magnitude of PSA progression and Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 111 CONFIDENTIAL"

Exploratory: • To explore the overall survival of patients treated with relugolix; and • To explore the contribution of genetic variance on drug response. Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagon ist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) . Relugo lix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China), every 3 -months (3 -M) will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy . This study will evaluat e the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppress ion to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1 .7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer . To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investi gator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy . Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and /or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Pat ients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 18 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to the baseline visit . If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot . Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/dL ( 1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China) . After randomization, patien ts on the leuprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator . Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and age . Approximately 915 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment P eriod of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period o f up to 90 days . Additionally, unscheduled follow- up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient-reported outcomes (E uropean Organisation of Resea rch and Treatment of Cancer [E ORTC ] QLQ -C30, Euro pean Quality of Life 5 -Dimesion 5 -Level questionnaire [Euro Qol EQ-5D-5L]) will be Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 112 CONFIDENTIAL"

Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China (if enrolled) and Japan . Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laborat ory tests, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECG) , and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should remain on study and may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide. For patients requiring other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the m edical monitor. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria All of the following inclusion criteria must have been met prior to randomization unless otherwise specified : 1. Has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form prior to initiat ion of any screening or study- specific procedures; 2. Is a male aged 18 years or older on the day of signing and dating the informed consent form; 3. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; 4. Is a candidate for , in the opinion of the investigat or, at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 113 CONFIDENTIAL"

Randomization will be stratified by geographic region ( North and South America versu s Europe v ersus Asia and Rest of World), presence of metastatic disease on baseline imaging (yes versu s no), and age (≤ 75 years old versu s > 75 years old ). The 2-sided type I error rate for this study is 0.05. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of achieving testosterone suppression to castrate level s of ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 Day 1 (Study Day 337) . This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method wit h the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patient s who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1. 7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rule s will be pre specified in the statistical analysis plan. There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: t o determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet th is criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2 : to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The 2-sided type I error rate will be 0.05 for each individual evaluation criterion. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1. Castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) prior to dosing on Week 1 Day 4, and prior to dosing on Week 3 Day 1 ; 2. Profound castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 20 ng/dL ( 0.7 nmol/L) from Week 25 through Week 49; 3. PSA response rate: proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA from baseline at Week 3 and confirmed at Week 5; 4. Undetectable PSA rate: proportion of patients with PSA concentration < 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 µg/L) at the Week 25 visit; 5. Time to testosterone recovery in approximately 100 relugolix- treated and approximately 50 leuprolide acetate -treated patients who complete 48 weeks of treatment and do not start alternative androgen deprivation therapy within 12 weeks after the last dose of relugolix or within 24 weeks following the last received injection of leuprolide acetate. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions; 6.

The effect of polymorphisms in germline genes related to the hypothalamic- pituitary - androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter proteins on the efficacy and safety of relugolix will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. The methods and procedures needed to maintain a study -wide 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan. Pharmacokinetics Relugolix plasma concentrations will be summarized and described using population PK methods. Plasma PK parameters in a subset of patients from China (if enrolled) and Japan will be determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety Safety assessments, including adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs , will be summarized for the treatment -emergent period. The treatment -emergent period is defined as the time from first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last dose of leuprolide acetate . Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive an y amount of study drug (Safety population). Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the N ational Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) and will be coded to preferred term, higher- level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug, an d severity. Descriptive rather than inferential statistics will be used. Laboratory values also will be classified by toxicity grade based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. Laboratory shift tables of baseline versus post baseline results will be produced. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will monitor all available safety data on a periodic basis. The roles and responsibilities of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be described in detail in a separate charter. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 121 CONFIDENTIAL"

For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of ≤ 90% at a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at least 99% power in declaring the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed after at least 915 patients have had the opportunity to complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans.

Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the US [ Greenlee, 2001] and Europe [ Ferlay , 2007]. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years, and diagnosis before the age of 40 years is rare [ Cersosimo , 1996]. In Japanese men, prostate cancer was the fourth leading cancer diagnosis in 2007 [ Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research , 2012] . The incidence of invasive prostate cancer increases with age; a clear increase is seen among men aged 60 years or older [ Siegel , 2014]. If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as either: PSA biochemical relapse follow ing primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Androgens, such as testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone, are strong tumor promoters for prostate cancer [Bosland, 2014]. Through the androgen receptor, they synergistically augment the effect of other tumor promoters or carcinogens. Although prostate cancer is driven by presumed mutations in other tumor promoting pathways and/or by translocations leading to aberrant activation of the androgen recepto r pathway, most early- stage prostate cancer cells remain either sensitive to or dependent upon circulating androgens. Thus, for more than 60 years, androgen deprivation therapy with surgical or medical castration has been the foundational therapy for eith er advanced inoperable or metastatic cancer. Increasingly, androgen deprivation therapy is used earlier as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment to radiation therapy or for biochemical or clinical relapse after local therapies of curative or palliative intent. Mo re than 80% of men with progressive or advanced disease initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization [ Kreis , 1995]. The duration and depth of response to androgen deprivation therapy is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastases respond for an average of 2 years before any biochemical evidence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical -only evidence of progressive disease may respond to androgen deprivation therapy for 5 years or more [ Klotz , 2015]. Currently, most patients in developed countries receive medical rather than surgical castration. GnRH (or LH-releasing hormone) agonists (ie, long- acting leuprolide acetate depot injections) are the current mainstay of medical castration, causing long -term desensitization and down regulation of the hypothalamic- pituitary gonadal axis. One disadvantage of the agonist form of GnRH is the initial stimulation of the axis lasting 1 to 3 weeks that occurs prior to desensitization. This results in a rise in LH and testosterone levels and an increase in clinical symp toms. In addition, at the time of repeat injection of GnRH agonist depot, microsurges of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 127 CONFIDENTIAL"
128,page_128,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 2.0, 02 Jan 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 28 CONFIDENTIAL LH and testosterone may occur, although the apparent incidence is low [ Klotz , 2008]. The initial flare response may be managed with simultaneous antiandrogen administration, such as with bicalutamide . Recently, GnRH antagonists, in particular degarelix, [ Firmagon , 2016], have become available as an alternative form of medical castration. Degarelix, an injectable peptide, has been approved in some countries for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer . As a GnRH antagonist, degarelix achieves medical castration and PSA response with no initial agonist activity within the first 1 to 2 weeks of administration, and effectively can obviate the need for concomitant antiandrogen treatment. Post-hoc a nalyses of degarelix trials [ Tombal , 2010] suggest that it may have additional advantages regarding disease response or secondary relapse; however, such differences require confirmation in prospective studies. Because of the need for monthly depot injections, with large volumes and accompanying local reactions, the use of degarelix in clinical practice has remained low. Relugolix , previously known as TAK-385, is a potent and highly selective oral small molecule antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. For patients, relugolix may offer the advantages conferred by a direct receptor antagonist, including a more rapid onset of action and the absence of clinica l flare or worsening of symptoms from the initial rise in androgens caused by GnRH agonists, as well as having the added convenience and relative comfort of oral dosing. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The proposed dose of relugolix is 120 mg administered orally once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120-mg tablets) on Day 1. 2.2.2. Pharmacology Relugolix is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective, hi gh-affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH . Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotrophin- secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH- stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH fall rapidly, followed by a decline over a few days in testosterone in men and estradiol and progesterone levels in women. Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock -in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothala mic-pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher.

Nonclinical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugolix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no signif icant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in rats (≥ 1000 mg/kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no-observed- effect level for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day, and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg/kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (area under the concentration -time curve [ AUC ]) in men receiving 120 mg once daily (0. 469 μg⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL ( 15 mg/kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg·hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mouse and rat studies. Embryo-fetal death was observed only in relugolix-treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg/kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human Thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg ( C max of 0.181 µg/mL). 2.2.4. Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studies evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of relugolix, including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose -dependent suppression of testosterone in male subjects and estradiol in female subjects.

In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The PK and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated, and appear to be similar in Western and Asian volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Asian volunteers. A relative bioavailability and food effect study was conducted using the global phase 3 prostate cancer formulation of 120 mg relugolix. A fter administration with a high -fat, high -calorie breakfast, the C max and AUC of relugo lix were reduced, on average, by 21.4% and 18.8%, respectively. In the phase 1 study C27001, serum LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and testosterone concentrations were determined in healthy men following single and multiple oral doses of relugolix or placebo for up to 28 days. Loading doses of ≥ 160 mg on Day 1 were used to shorten the time to testosterone suppression. Relugolix caused an immediate and effective suppression of LH, FSH, and testosterone. After 14 days of once daily dosing, mean LH and serum testosterone concentration profiles were similar for the 40, 80, and 180 mg relugolix dose cohorts. LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations began decreasing 2 to 6 hours postdose on Day 1 and remained suppressed through Day 14. However, the relugolix once daily maintenance dose was a major determinant of sustained testosterone suppression. Profound castration (defined as average testosterone levels < 20 ng/dL or 0.7 nmol/L) was achieved with 40, 80, or 180 mg once daily for 14 days; however, 20 mg once daily was insufficient in maintaining adequate suppression of serum LH and testosterone concentration levels during the second week. In healthy, older men receiving 14 or 28 days of dosing, effective castration was consistently achieved over 14 and 28 days dosing at daily doses of 40 to 180 mg (14 days) and 80 to 160 mg (28 days). Use of a loading dose for up to 3 days (or once daily doses of ≥ 160 mg) resulted in castration levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L) within 24 to 48 hours. Results obtained after 28 days of dosing suggested that the likely minimal, fully effective maintenance dose for sustained castration would be relugolix ≥ 80 mg once daily. Doses of 80 mg and 120 mg were moved forward into phase 2 development. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal), as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption by approximately 20%. The exposure of relugolix is increased b y inhibitors of P-glycoprotein up to 6-fold, but relugolix does not significantly impact the exposure of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 substrates. In a dedicated study, relugolix did not prolong QTc at single doses of 60 or 360 mg . 2.2.4.2. Clinical Studies in Men with Prostate Cancer One phase 1 study and 2 phase 2 studies have been conducted evaluating relugolix in men with prostate cancer. Study TB -AK160108 is an ongoing multicenter phase 1, open-label, dose range-finding study conducted in hormone treatment-naïve Asian patients with non- metastatic pr ostate cancer. The study consists of a dose-rising phase (Part A) and an expansion phase (Part B). In Part A, a loading dose of relugolix (320 or 360 mg) was administered on Day 1 followed by once daily dosing on Days 2 through 28, with the dosage dependent on the individual cohort of 3 to 4 Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 130 CONFIDENTIAL"

In Part B, 30 patients receive a maximum of 96 weeks treatment at doses of 80 and 120 mg once daily (N = 15 each arm, loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1). Testosterone reduction by both doses of relugolix was rapid and sustained through 48 weeks. Both the 80- and 120- mg once daily doses were evaluated in phase 2 clinical studies. Study C27003 is a phase 2 study that enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily following a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks following a single loading dose of 240 mg (N = 38) for 24 weeks. External beam radiation therapy was initiated for most patients between Week 13 and Week 15. Relugolix 120 mg administered orally once daily rapidly suppressed testosterone levels below the castration threshold (50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels from the end of Week 4 through at least 24 weeks. The levels of testosterone suppression achieved by relugolix were similar to those achieved by monthly injections of degarelix. Profound castration rates below the lower testosterone threshold of < 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) were also similar in the relugolix and degarelix groups ( Table 2-1).

In both treatment groups, the average reduction in estimated prostate volumes was similar, approximately 30%. Following discontinuation of therapy at the end of 24 weeks, patients were f ollowed for an additional 12 weeks to evaluate testosterone recovery and associated changes in PSA and quality of life. At the end of the follow-up period, approximately half of the patients receiving relugolix had recovered either to the baseline testost erone value or to > 280 ng/dL, whichever was less, compared to only 6% of patients receiving degarelix ( Figure 2-1 ).

Study C27002 is a phase 2 study of relugolix and leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer who require first-line androgen deprivation therapy, which is ongoing in North America. This study was designed to help plan the population, dosing, and assessment schedules for phase 3 studies in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Eligible patients in C27002 have evidence of advanced prostate cancer including either: 1) PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; 2) newly diagnosed metastatic prostat e cancer ; or 3) advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. In this open-label, parallel group study, patients we re randomized to receive 1 of 2 dose levels of oral relugolix (80 or 120 mg [patients randomized to relugolix received a loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1], N = 50 per group) or to an observation cohort to receive standard GnRH therapy with leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg administered by intramuscular injection every 12 weeks ( N = 25). R elugolix or le uprolide acetate was admi nistered for up to 48 weeks with patients randomized to leuprolide acetate receiving their last on -study 12-week depot injection at Week 37 . The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain testosterone suppression (< 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) through Week 25. Results from the completed study C27002 demonstrate that both doses of relugolix, 80 mg and 120 mg once daily, rapidly reduced t estosterone levels below the castration threshold within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels in 91% of patients through 24 weeks of treatment (Table 2-2).

Clinical Safety of Relugolix in Men with Prostate Cancer A full description of the safety data for relugolix from clinical trials is available in th e Investigator Brochure. Overall, approximately 632 healthy volunteers (330 women, 302 men), 535 female patients with uterine fibroids (N = 229) or endometriosis (N = 306), and 218 male patients with prostate cancer received at least 1 dose of relugolix. Data from the 175 patients with prostate cancer who received relugolix in randomized, open -label, parallel -group phase 2 studies, C27002 and C27003, provide the basis for the frequency of expected adverse events associated with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. The adverse drug reactions in the prostate cancer indication observed in the phase 2 studies include hot flush (59%), fatigue (26%), arthralgia (10%), nausea (5%), and gynecomastia (3%). No clinical evidence of PLD has observed in any relugolix clinical study. Leuprolide Acetate 3 -Month Depot Leuprolide acetate depot is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer. Leupro lide acetate acts as an agonist at pituitary GnRH (gonadotropin- releasing hormone) receptors. Leupro lide acetate has greater receptor affinity, reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and is approxim ately 100 -fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin- producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and FSH, which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leydig cells. Initially, leuprolide acetate stimulates LH production, which in turn causes a surge of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for 5 to 12 days before the ultimate inhibition of LH. This androgen surge of male hormones can cause a flare reaction (“clinical flare”), which may lead to an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [Tolis , 1982; Schally , 1980; Waxman , 1985; Conn, 1991; Limonata , 2001]. Chronic stimulation by the GnRH agonist ultimately desensitizes the GnRH receptors, downregulating the secretion of gonadotropins, LH, and FSH, leading to hypogonadism and thus a dramatic reduction in testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on which continued growth of prostate cancer cells depends. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels within 3 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels. The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible over time upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors. The flare phenomenon can be effectively prevented with antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [ Loblaw , 2004] . First generation antiandrogens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide bind to androgen receptors and competitively inhibit their interaction with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. They are often used in an attempt to limit the clinical sequelae produced by th e hormonal surge resulting from GnRH agonist treatment .

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1. Overall Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open- label, parallel -group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin- releas ing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ) every 3 -months (3- M) will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy . This study will evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels ( ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen- sensi tive advanced prostate cancer. To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investigator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen-Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 139 CONFIDENTIAL"

Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 1 8 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to baseline. If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/ dL (1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ). After randomization, patients on the leuprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and a ge. Approximately 915 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia- Pacific region. The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days. Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient -reported outcomes ( EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ -PR25, EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment Period and more frequently during the Follow-up Period. Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China (if enrolled) and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should remain on study and may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide. For patients requiring other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the medical monitor.

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is designed to establish the safety and efficacy of relugolix 120 mg orally once daily in men with advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for androgen -sensitive disease. This study will focus on the primary objective of evaluating the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in pati ents with advanced prostate cancer. During the Treatment Period of the study (Day 1 to Week 49 [Study Day 337]), patients will be randomized to one of the study treatment arms: oral loading dose of relugolix (360 mg) followed by 120 mg once daily of relugoli x or leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection of 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg Japan, Taiwan, and China) at 12 -week intervals for 48 weeks . Patients treated with leuprolide acetate will a lso receive an antiandrogen for 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. The study is designed to allow for global approvals, however, different regulatory agencies require different criteria for the demonstration of efficacy. The United States (US) Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) requires , for approval , a primary efficacy criterion to determine whether the sustained castration rate (defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L] while on relugolix study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 through Week 49 Day 1) is grea ter than or equal to 90%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion. The study includes a leuprolide acetate arm to meet the regulatory requirement of other regions to establish the non- inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection as Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 141 CONFIDENTIAL"

The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non-inf eriority margin of -10% to meet this criterion. The dose of relugolix selected is based on data from phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrating that oral doses of 80 mg and 120 mg once daily following an oral loading dose of 320 mg were able to suppress testoster one to castrate level s (see Section 2.2.4.2 and the Inves tigator Brochure). A loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120- mg tablets) was selected for phase 3 so that only one tablet size was required. Leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection wa s selected as the comparator as this is the GnRH agonist used most commonly as standard of care in the population under evaluation. Degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist , was considered, but was not used as it has limited market uptake attributed at least in part to a significant number of injection site reactions. 4.3. Selection of Study Population Approximately 915 men with advanced prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . Enrollment is defined as the time at which a patient is randomized to a treatment group and receives at least one dose of study drug. Deviations from inclusion and exclusion cr iteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or patient safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Any questions regarding pat ient eligibility and entry criteria should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to randomizing the patient. 4.3.1. Inclusion Criteria A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following inclusion criteria are met prior to ra ndomization, unless otherwise specified: 1. Has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form prior to initiation of any screening or study -specific procedures; 2. Is a male aged 18 years or older on the day of signing and dating the informed consent form; 3. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; 4. Is a candidate for, in the opinion of the investigator, at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer with one of the following clinical disease state presentations: a. Evidence of biochemical (PSA) or clinical relapse following local primary intervention with curative intent, such as surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, or high-f requency ultrasound and not a candidate for salvage treatment by surgery; or b. Newly diagnosed androgen- sensitive metastatic disease; or c. Advanced localized disease unlikely to be cured by local primary intervention with either surgery o r radiation with curative intent; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 142 CONFIDENTIAL"

The sponsor (or designee) will approve the patient’s enrollment in writing. Once the site has received approval, the patient may undergo the Baseline Day 1 v isit. The site will randomize the patient to treatment by using the IWRS during the patient’s Baseline Day 1 visit. The IWRS will assign the patient identification (ID) number. This number will identify the patient for the duration of the study. A study treatment kit number will be available at the site accord ing to the randomization code. 4.7. Remov al of Patients from Therapy Patients may withdraw consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason. Investigators or the m edical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below. Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Week 49 visit on the Schedule of Activities . The End of Treatment is defined as the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks after the last leuprolide acetate injection . Follow-up visits to assess safety will be performed in all study patients. If the patient plans to start alternative androgen deprivation therapy less than 30 days after the End of Treatment visit, the Safety Follow -up visit may occur earlier, before the start of the alternative androgen deprivation therapy. Testosterone recovery will be evaluated in approximately 100 patients randomized to relugolix and approximately 50 patients to leuprolide acetate who complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment and, in the opinion of the investigator, are candidates for intermittent androgen deprivation therapy and will not be offered alternative androgen deprivation therapy upon completion of study therapy. The se patients will retur n for the 60- and 90-day follow-up Testosterone Recovery visits. The safety and/or compliance events shown in Table 4-1 will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved .

The primary reason for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF. Patients who withdraw from treatment will not be replaced. Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol-defined window, the site should attempt to contact the patien t and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. Patients randomized to relugolix should be counseled to notify the investigator in the event of intercurrent illness to determine if the study drug treatment can be continued. Every effort should be made to ensure the patient’s compliance with study drug treatment, including calling patients to reschedule missed visits. In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the patient. The site should attempt at least 3 documented telephone calls and, if necessary , a certifi ed letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 4.8. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance It is not known what effects relugolix has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. A patient must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman. Patients must not donate sperm from first dose of study drug through 4 months afte r the last dose of study drug. Nonsterilized male patients should use a male condom, either alone or in addition to effective methods of contraception used by a female partner of childbearing potential, through defined periods during and after study treatm ent as specified below. Examples of effective contraceptive methods include condoms, hormonal contraceptives, and intrauterine devices. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to one of the following: • Use a male condom if having sex with a woman of childbearing age or a pregnant woman, during the entire study T reatment Period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug; or • Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Instructions for collection and processing of blood specimens are provided in the investigator site file. 6.6.1.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collectio n Relugolix Pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patient s randomized to relugolix study drug. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of relugolix will be c ollected at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients may take their dose of study drug in the clinic at these visits. Study drug will be administered on an empty stomach or at least 2 hours before food, and food will be withheld for 1 hour after dosing. The date and time of their previous dose of study drug (ie, the dose the day before the clinic visit) will be accurately recorded. Ideally, predose samples should be collected approximately 24 hours (±6 hours) after the previous dose of relugolix, although samples collected outside of this window would not be considered a protocol deviation. If the study patient inadvertently took the study drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the date and time of that dose should also be accurately recorded and the pharmacokinetic sample collected, which may be used for population PK modeling. Plasma from the Week 5 and Week 13 visits in all patients will be analyzed for relugolix plasma concentration. Analysis of other individual patient plasma samples will be performed on a case-by-case basis (such as those patients with non -castrate testosterone levels).

Pharmacogenomic s Sample Collection Whole Blood Sample for Germline Deoxyribonucleic Acid Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. P articipation of study patients in pharmacogenomic sample collection is optional. A pharmacogenomics sample will be collected from patients at all participating study centers, with individual patient consent and per local ethics and regulatory standards. The sample will be retained for germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of potential genetic determinants of drug safety, drug efficacy or disease response, and drug metabolism. Every patient must sign informed consent/be consented in order to participate in the sampling of whole blood for DNA analysis. This research may be used to develop a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of relugolix and other study drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condition being studied, and for improving the efficiency, design and study methods of future research studies. Two venous whole blood sample (4 mL per sample) for the analysis of germline DNA will be collected at Day 1 from all patients who have provided informed consent . The DNA sample s are expected to be collected at the Day 1 visit, but if necessary, may be collected at any visit after randomization. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if isolation of DNA from the first sample was not successful or possible. Germline DNA analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or diseases, which may lead to additional hypothesis- generating exploratory research on stored samples. Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the result of any analyses and corresponding information will be identified only by a code in a computer database. The whole blood samples for DNA analysis will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated central laboratory vendor until 10 years after completion of this study (HERO, MVT -601-3201) and/or until the drug development of relugolix is no longer actively pursued by Myovant or its collaborators.

The 5 scales include: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The original version, the EQ-5D-3L, includes 3 response options for each sca le. However, a new 5 -level response-option version, the EQ-5D-5L, has been developed with the following response options: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. It is believed that the EQ -5D- 5L is superior to the EQ- 5D-3L in terms of feasibility, ceiling effects, discriminatory power, and convergent validity. The EQ-5D- 5L index values will be calculated from the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system scores based on the Crosswalk value sets [EuroQol Group, 1990; Brooks , 1996; Herdman , 2011; Janssen , 2013]. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Assessments The EORTC -QLQ -C30 [ Fayers , 2001; Fayers , 2002] (Appendix 3) and the 25- item prostate cancer module EORTC -QLQ -PR25 [ Spry, 2006] (Appendix 4) will be administered as specified in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.1). The EORTC QLQ -C30 core measurement will be used to capture distal outcomes, including physical, social functioning, and overall health- related quality of life. The QLQ -C30 core questionnaire incorporates 30 questions comprising 9 multi- item scales: 5 fun ctional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality of life scale. Several single -item symptom measures are also included. It is a reliable and valid measure of health -related quality of life in patients with cancer and takes about 11 minutes to administer. The instrument has been validated and used in many countries [ Aaronson, 1993]. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 is the 25-item Prostate Cancer module (P25) of the EORTC. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 contains 3 additional sympto m scales (urinary, bowel, sexual) and 5 treatment -related items. 6.6.2. Safety -Related Procedures 6.6.2.1.

When an ECG is scheduled at the same time as vital signs and a blood draw, the ECG , when possible, will be obtained after the vital signs and prior to the blood draw; the blood draw will be collected at the scheduled time. ECGs will be read locally by a qualified physician. If patients have a prolonged QTc (> 500 msec) in the absence of a pacemaker , the ECG should be repeated and confirmed. Patients with a confirmed QTc > 500 msec, measured by Fridericia's formula [QTcF = QT/(RR^0.33)], should be withdrawn.

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations including visual acuity assessment , vital signs , weight, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event An adverse event is any un favorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre -existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be relate d to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately); and • An investigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms; o Requires active intervention; or o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet the definition of an adverse event include: o Medical or sur gical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event; o The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression; o Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected be fore the start of study drug administration that do not worsen; and o Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitalization for an elective procedure, with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent). Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the investigator and graded according to CTCAE (Appendix 5 ). Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are “intermittent”. All other events are “continuous”. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted ; however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 10 days for evaluation Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 167 CONFIDENTIAL"

The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is life-threatening ; NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospi talization ; NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patien t has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out- patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, a nd accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Important medical events that jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.2. Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory authorities is a r equirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local I RB/I EC. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 168 CONFIDENTIAL"
169,page_169,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 2.0, 02 Jan 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 69 CONFIDENTIAL Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient’s answers to the EQ-5D- 5L will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. All patients who experi ence an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow- up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overdose and pregnancy in a partner will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively . 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will be collected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Safety Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the Safety F ollow- up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection , or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. Any event occurring between signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 169 CONFIDENTIAL"

Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The definitions in Table 7-1 are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug. Table 7-1 Causal Relationship to Study Drug Relationship Criteria Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re-administration (re-challenge) or withdrawal (de -challenge). Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record. In the event a patient is w ithdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the eve nt itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken. The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE (see Appendix 5). For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-2 should be used to determine the grade severity. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 170 CONFIDENTIAL"

Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting Adverse events of clinical interest in this study are defined as any increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN. Any ALT or AST elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the randomized T reatment Period or the Follow-up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the serious adverse event form within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event (see Section 7.6), even if the event d oes not meet serious adverse event criteria. Additional instructions for evaluating patients with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN may be found in Appendix 6. 7.5.1. Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug in Association with Liver Test Abnormalities Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug -induced liver injury guidelines [FDA , 2009]. If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status), and the event reported as a serious adverse event: • ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or • ALT or AST > 5 x ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%).

The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report the outcome to the sponsor. 7.9. Benefit/Risk Assessment Summaries of findings from both nonclinical and clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure. The risk as sessment and mitigation strategies for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-3. Table 7-3 Relugolix Pot ential Risks and Mitigation Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Mitigation Strategy Impact on Eligibility Monitoring and Stopping Criteria Hepatic Enzyme Increases Isolated increases in hepatic enzymes have been observed in prior clinical studies. Hepatic enzyme increases, considered an important potential risk of treatment with relugolix, are closely monitored in accordance with FDA guidelines for assessing drug - induced liver injury [ FDA , 2009] in all relugolix studies. Exclusion criteria for AST and ALT > ULN; total bilirubin values > ULN unless consistent with Gilbert’s syndrome. Liver chemistry will be monitored during the study. Appropriate liver stopping criteria and follow-up procedures are detailed in Section 7.5.2.

Risks Associated with Medical Castration Acute and subsequent chronic symptoms of medical castration (reduction of testoster one to ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) include vasomotor symptoms or hot flushes, disturbed sleep related to vasomotor symptoms, decreased libido, and fatigue or loss of energy. These side effects are usually not severe and can be managed with anticipatory guidance. Long- term suppression of testosterone is associated with well- characterized risks including bone loss, decreased muscle mass, possible changes in insulin sensitivity with increased risk of diabetes, altered lipid metabolism, and possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ Oefelein , 2002; Lopez , 2005; Diamond ,1998; Keating , 2006; Braga - Basaria , 2006; Saigal , 2007; Tsai, 2007 ; D'Amico , 2007; Efstathiou , 2009]. - Effects can usually be managed with appropriate anticipatory guidance (eg, diet and exercise programs) or supportive therapy when required (e g, lipid-lowering or bone- sparing agen ts). Metabolic Changes Metabolic changes (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased weight) with increased risk of diabetes are a potential risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix. - Fasting lipids and glucose will be monitored during the study. Loss of Bone Mineral Density Loss of bone mineral density is considered a potential risk of treatment with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. - Fractures will be assessed through adverse event monitoring. Use of anti-resorptive bone therapy, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab , may be considered by the treating physician.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES A statistical analysis plan will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for this study. The statistical analysis plan will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock and analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. All confidence intervals will be 2 -sided at an alpha level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. The methodology to be used to maintain a study- wide type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan . All efficacy and safety measures over the course of the study will be presented. Continuous data will be summarized by means, standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients. Categorical data will be summarized by counts and percentages. 9.1. Randomization Methods Central randomization will be used and treatment allocation will be 2:1, relugolix to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot . Randomization will be stratified by the following factors: • Geographic Region: North and South America versus Europe versus Asia and Rest of World ; • Presence of Metastatic Disease: yes versus no; • Baseline Age: ≤ 75 years old versus > 75 years old. Stratified efficacy analyses will incorporate these 3 stratification factors unless otherwise specified. 9.2. Analysis Populations The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients randomized to treatment who have taken at least one dose of study treatment . This will be the primary population used for the efficacy analysis. Patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment. The Per -Protocol population will consist of those members of the ITT population who have no major protocol deviations as defined in the statistical analysis plan , considering the following protocol deviations but not limited to : • Those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria; • Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn; • Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; • Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment.

The Per -Protocol population will be used as a sensitivity analysis of the ITT population for the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary endpoints. The Per-Protocol population will be identified prior to the database lock. The primary population for safety analyses will be the Safety population, defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of any study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment assignment. 9.3. Efficacy Analyses 9.3.1. Primary Endpoint Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate, defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 (Study Day 337). This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method with the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rules will be described in the statistical analysis plan . There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: to determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2: to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority m argin of -10% to meet this criterion . The confidence interval of the treatment difference will be calculated using the formula 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)−𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)�+ 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)� , where each of the variance of the Kaplan -Meier estimate will be calculated using the Greenwood's formula 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)2�∑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗�𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗−𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗�𝑗𝑗:𝑡𝑡(𝑗𝑗)≤𝑡𝑡 � ; nj denote the number of patients at risk at time t (j) and d j denote the number of events observed at time t(j)) [Lachin , 2000]. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requireme nts and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans. The 2-sided type I error rates for the final analyses will be controlled at 0.05 separately for each regional analysis. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 178 CONFIDENTIAL"

Safety Analyses The safety analyses will be based on the Safety p opulation. Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing adverse events , laboratory analytes, vital signs, ECG parameters, and concomitant medications. The severity of all adverse events is to be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. All adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using MedDRA 19.1 or higher. The incidence of adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug treatment, and severity. A patient reporting the same adverse event more than once is counted once, and at the maximum severity o r strongest relationship to study drug treatment when calculating incidence. Laboratory data consist of chemistry, hematology, and hormonal tests. Only data collected by the central laboratory will be used for analyses. The National Cancer Institute CTCA E will be used to categorize toxicity grade for the laboratory parameters. Shift tables will be provided for each gradable parameter to summarize baseline toxicity grade versus post -baseline toxicity grade. For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by the CTCAE, a shift table based upon the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summarize the baseline versus post- baseline results. 9.5. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Plasma relugolix concentration s will be listed and summarized and included in the clinical study report . PK data may be pooled with data from other studies in healthy male patient s and patients with prostate cancer for population PK analysis, including evaluation of covariates of relugolix PK parameters, and for input into a population PK /pharmacodynamics models describing the relationship between relugolix exposure and serum testosterone [ Ahsman , 2016]. These population PK analyses will be detailed further in a separate statistical analysis plan and report. For patients from China (if enrolled) and Japan in the PK subset, plasma relug olix PK parameters C max, AUC 0-τ, and t max from Day 1 and Day 14 of dosing will be determined. Population PK or PK/pharmacodynamic analyses may be conducted to explore the factors that affect relugolix exposure or to contribute to the assessment of the relationships between exposure and testosterone. 9.6. Endocrine Marker Analyses Endocrine markers will be analyzed to see effects of relugolix and leuprolide acetate as measured as absolute va lue and change from baseline for: • LH at Day 4 , Week 5, Week 25, and Week 49 visits and/or follow-up visit(s); • FSH at Day 4 , Week 5, Week 25, and Week 49 visits and/or follow-up visit (s); Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 180 CONFIDENTIAL"

Exploratory Analyses Overall survival : Overall survival defined as time from randomization to date of death prior to data cutoff date. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions for each treatment arm. Pharmacogenomic analys es may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety, pending availability of samples. Polymorphisms in germline genes related to the hypothalamic -pituitary -androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or to drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter proteins that might be implicated in the drug disposition, safety, or efficacy of relugolix . These analyses will be detailed in a separate statistical analysis plan and associated report s. 9.8. Interim Analyses There will be no planned interim e fficacy analysis for the study. 9.9. Sample Size To calculate the sample size required for the primary efficacy endpoint of this study, the following assumptions have been made: • True probabilities of sustained testosterone suppression are 94% and 96% for relugolix and leuprolide acetate, respectively ; • 2:1 randomization ratio (relugolix:leuprolide acetate); and • Dropout rate of 15%. The assumed probability of sustained testosterone suppression for relugolix arm is 94%. It was estimated based on the predicted dose-response relationship for the effect of relugolix on testosterone suppression in patients w ith prostate cancer (data from phase 2 studies C27002 and C27003). The assumed castration rate of 96% for leuprolide acetate was based on the results from degarelix phase 3 registration program [Shore , 2013]. For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of < 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and an overall 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at le ast 99% power in declaring the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The final analysis will be performed separately for individual evaluation criterion using data collected through 48 weeks after enrollment of approximately 915 pa tients .

Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR Part 54, is adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted i n a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator. The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. 10.1.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Approval This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by the investigator to an IRB or IEC. Approval from the IRB or IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation.

Informed Consent A properly executed, written informed consent, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice , US CFR for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27), and local regulations, will be obtained from each patient before entering the patient in the trial. The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual participating in this study after adequate explan ation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related procedures. The investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting written informed consent that conta ins all elements required by national, state, local , and institutional regulations or requirements . Each informed consent form will be appropriately signed and dated by the patien t or the patien t’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent. The investigator will provide copies of the signed informed consent form to each patient (or to the patient’s legal representatives) and will maintain the signed original document within the patient’s record file per local requirements. The investigator will also fully document the informed consent process in the patient’s source records. 10.1.4. Confidentiality The investigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only patient number, date of birth, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screened and for all patien ts enrolled in the study. The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited to the Investigator Brochure, protocol, e CRFs and other study forms, the investigational drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly in volved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from the sponsor. The i nvestigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: 1) Investigator’s study file: The investigator’s study file will contain the Investigator Brochure , protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 2) Patient clinical source documents : The required source data should include the following for each patien t: • Patient identification (name, date of birth, gender); Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 183 CONFIDENTIAL"
184,page_184,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 2.0, 02 Jan 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 84 CONFIDENTIAL • Documentation that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); • Participation in the study (including study number); • Study discussed and date of informed consent; • Dates of all visits; • Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed; • Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol; • Start and end date (including dose regimen) of st udy medication (drug dispensing and return should be documented as well); • Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and causality and intensity as assigned by the investigator ); • Concomitant medication (including start an d end date); and • Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. All clinical study documentation must be retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, US, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with the sponsor. The investigator must notify the sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Clinical study documentation includes the I nvestigator Brochure, signed protocol and amendments, signed informed consents, notification of serious adverse events a nd related reports, any dispensing and accountability logs, shipping records of investigational product and study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory authorities as applicable, curriculum vitae and all training records of study site personnel, and all correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study. Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 10.1.5. Electronic Case Report Forms For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the i nvestigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 form and/or other appropriate local health authority documents within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-randomization Screening Period if an eCRF was initiated).

If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 10.1.6. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator or investigator’s designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability including dates and lot numbers of all study drug. This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, patient ID number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational med icinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconcil iation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor ( or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study. All records must be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate regulatory agencies, upon request. Current ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries from the s ponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following: • That such deliveries are recorded, for example, on the sponsor-approved drug accountability log, or other sponsor-approved pharmacy log; • That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the study protocol; • That study drug is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with the protocol; • That any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor- designated facility or standard procedures for the alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed and only after approval by the sponsor representative. Drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by the investigator/pharmacist. Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent: • The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any persons except the patients in this study; • The investigator/pharmacist will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to those authorized by the investigator to dispense these study drugs; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 185 CONFIDENTIAL"
186,page_186,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Version 2.0, 02 Jan 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 86 CONFIDENTIAL • The investigator/pharmacist will maintain a study drug inventory. The inventory will include details of material received and a clear record of when they were dispensed and to which patient; • The investigator/pharmacist agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory on the drug accountability record at the conclusion or termination of the study. It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and returned study drug. Any discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate forms of deliveries must be signed by the person responsible; • Used or unused study drug may be destroyed at the study site according to standard institutional procedures if the sponsor agrees with the procedure, and after drug accountability has been conducted by the sponsor or representative. Unused study drug not destroyed at the site must be returned to the sponsor- designated facility at the end of the study or upon expiration. 10.1.7. Inspections During the course of the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality assurance audits will be undertaken by authorized sponsor representatives. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was) conducted and monitored in compliance with the protocol as well as recognized Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. These audits will also increase the likelihood that the stud y data and all other study documentation can withstand a regulatory authority inspection. If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed time. By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee to conduct onsite audits of all appropriate facilities and study documentation. The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 10.1.8. Protocol Compliance The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 10.2. Sponso r Responsibilities 10.2.1. Protocol Modifications Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to patients , may be made only by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirem ents. Approval must be obtained before changes can be implemented. The investigator must not deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, if required. In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will remove the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 186 CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by the IRB or IEC, and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 10.2.2. Study Report A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies). The sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases. 10.2.3. Posting of Information on Publicly Available Clinical Trial Registers Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers (eg, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) before enrollment of patien ts begins. Results will be posted as required. 10.3. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities 10.3.1. Access to Information Monitoring In accordance with ICH G ood Clinical Practice guidelines, the s tudy monitor must have direct access to the investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the eCRFs for consistency. The study monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 10.3.2. Access to Information for Auditing or Inspection s Representatives of regulatory authorities or of the sponsor may conduct inspections or audits of the clinical study. If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory authority, the investigator agrees to notify the sponsor ’s medical moni tor immediately. The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or the s ponsor access to records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit.

Study Discontinuation The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. When the sponsor is aware of information on matters concerning the quality, efficacy, and safety of the study drugs, as well as other important information that may affect proper conduct of the clinical study, the sponsor may terminate the study and send a written notice of the termination along with the reasons to the investigator. Should this be necessary, the sponsor will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) and IRBs/IECs. In terminating the study, the sponsor and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the study p articipants’ interests. If the investigator intends to terminate participation in the study, the investigator must immediately inform the sponsor and provide the reason to it. 10.3.4. Publications After conclusion of the study and without prior written approval from the sponsor, investigators in this study may communicate, orally present, or publish in scientific journals or other scholarly media only after the following conditions have been met: • The results of the study in their entirety have been publicly disclosed by or with the consent of the sponsor in an abstract, manuscript, or presentation form; or • The study has been completed at all study sites for at least 5 years. No such communication, presentation, or publication will include Myovant Sciences GmbH confi dential information (see Section 10.1.4). The investigator will submit to the sponsor any proposed publication or presentation along with the respe ctive target scientific journal or presentation forum at least 30 days before submission of the publication or presentation. The i nvestigator will comply with sponsor requests to delete references to its confidential information (other than the study results) in any paper or presentation and agrees to withhold publication or presentation for an additional 60 days in order to obtain patent protection if deemed necessary.

Adverse Event Severity Grading When assessing adverse events, refer to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, June 14, 2010 (available at: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). A copy of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE table will be provided in the investigator site file . The National Cancer Institute CTCAE is a descriptive terminology that can be utilized for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term. Components and Organization of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE • System Or gan Class (SOC). SOC, the highest level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) hierarchy, is identified by anatomical or physiological system, etiology, or purpose (eg, SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms ar e grouped by MedDRA Primary SOCs. Within each SOC, adverse events are listed and accompanied by descriptions of severity (grade). • CTAE Terms. Each CTCAE term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term). • Definitions. A brief definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each adverse event term. • Grades. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event . The CTCAE displays grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each advers e event based on this general guideline: o Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. o Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate ins trumental activities of daily living; o Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living; o Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and o Grade 5 Death related to adverse event . A semi-colon indicates “or” within the description of the grade. A single dash (- ) indicates a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events . Therefore, some adverse events are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. • Grade 5. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some adverse events and therefore is not an option.

Exploratory: • To explore the overall survival of patients treated with relugolix; and • To explore the contribution of genetic variance on drug response. Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagon ist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) . Relugo lix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China), every 3 -months (3 -M) will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy . This study will evaluat e the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppress ion to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1 .7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer . To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investi gator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy . Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and /or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Pat ients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 18 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to the baseline visit . If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot . Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/dL ( 1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China) . After randomization, patien ts on the leuprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator . Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and age . Approximately 915 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment P eriod of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period o f up to 90 days . Additionally, unscheduled follow- up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient-reported outcomes (E uropean Organisation of Resea rch and Treatment of Cancer [E ORTC ] QLQ -C30, Euro pean Quality of Life 5 -Dimesion 5 -Level questionnaire [Euro Qol EQ-5D-5L]) will be Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 214 CONFIDENTIAL"

Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China (if enrolled) and Japan . Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laborat ory tests, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECG) , and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should remain on study and may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide. For patients requiring other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the m edical monitor.

Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of achieving testosterone suppression to castrate level s of ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 Day 1 (Study Day 337) . This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method wit h the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patient s who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1. 7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rule s will be pre specified in the statistical analysis plan. There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: t o determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet th is criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2 : to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The 2-sided type I error rate will be 0.05 for each individual evaluation criterion. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1. Castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) prior to dosing on Week 1 Day 4, and prior to dosing on Week 3 Day 1 ; 2. Profound castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 20 ng/dL ( 0.7 nmol/L) from Week 25 through Week 49; 3. PSA response rate: proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA from baseline at Week 3 and confirmed at Week 5; 4. Undetectable PSA rate: proportion of patients with PSA concentration < 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 µg/L) at the Week 25 visit; 5. Time to testosterone recovery in approximately 100 relugolix- treated and approximately 50 leuprolide acetate -treated patients who complete 48 weeks of treatment and do not start alternative androgen deprivation therapy within 12 weeks after the last dose of relugolix or within 24 weeks following the last received injection of leuprolide acetate. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions; 6.

The effect of polymorphisms in germline genes related to the hypothalamic- pituitary - androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter proteins on the efficacy and safety of relugolix will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. The methods and procedures needed to maintain a study -wide 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan. Pharmacokinetics Relugolix plasma concentrations will be summarized and described using population PK methods. Plasma PK parameters in a subset of patients from China (if enrolled) and Japan will be determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety Safety assessments, including adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs , will be summarized for the treatment -emergent period. The treatment -emergent period is defined as the time from first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last dose of leuprolide acetate . Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive an y amount of study drug (Safety population). Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the N ational Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) and will be coded to preferred term, higher- level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of pati ents with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity. Descriptive rather than inferential statistics will be used. Laboratory values also will be classified by toxicity grade based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. Laboratory shift tables of baseline versus post baseline results will be produced. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will monitor all available safety data on a periodic basis. The roles and responsibilities of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be described in detail in a separate charter. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 223 CONFIDENTIAL"

For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of ≤ 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at least 99% power in declaring the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed after at least 915 patients have had the opportunity to complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans.

Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the US [ Greenlee, 2001] and Europe [ Ferlay , 2007]. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years, and diagnosis before the age of 40 years is rare [ Cersosimo , 1996]. In Japanese men, prostate cancer was the fourth leading cancer diagnosis in 2007 [ Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research , 2012] . The incidence of invasive prostate cancer increases with age; a clear increase is seen among men aged 60 years or older [ Siegel , 2014]. If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as either: PSA biochemical relapse follow ing primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Androgens, such as testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone, are strong tumor promoters for prostate cancer [Bosland, 2014]. Through the androgen receptor, they synergistically augment the effect of other tumor promoters or carcinogens. Although prostate cancer is driven by presumed mutations in other tumor promoting pathways and/or by translocations leading to aberrant activation of the androgen recepto r pathway, most early- stage prostate cancer cells remain either sensitive to or dependent upon circulating androgens. Thus, for more than 60 years, androgen deprivation therapy with surgical or medical castration has been the foundational therapy for eith er advanced inoperable or metastatic cancer. Increasingly, androgen deprivation therapy is used earlier as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment to radiation therapy or for biochemical or clinical relapse after local therapies of curative or palliative intent. Mo re than 80% of men with progressive or advanced disease initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization [ Kreis , 1995]. The duration and depth of response to androgen deprivation therapy is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastases respond for an average of 2 years before any biochemical evi dence of castration resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical -only evidence of progressive disease may respond to androgen deprivation therapy for 5 years or more [ Klotz , 2015]. Currently, most patients in developed countries receive medical rather than surgical castration. GnRH (or LH-releasing hormone) agonists (ie, long- acting leuprolide acetate depot inject ions) are the current mainstay of medical castration, causing long -term desensitization and down regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary gonadal axis. One disadvantage of the agonist form of GnRH is the initial stimulation of the axis lasting 1 to 3 week s that occurs prior to desensitization. This results in a rise in LH and testosterone levels and an increase in clinical symptoms. In addition, at the time of repeat injection of GnRH agonist depot, microsurges of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 229 CONFIDENTIAL"
230,page_230,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 28 CONFIDENTIAL LH and testosterone may occur, although the apparent incidence is low [ Klotz , 2008]. The initial flare response may be managed with simultaneous antiandrogen administration, such as with bicalut amide . Recently, GnRH antagonists, in particular degarelix, [ Firmagon , 2016], have become available as an alternative form of medical castration. Degarelix, an injectable peptide, has been approved in some countries for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer . As a GnRH antagonist, degarelix achieves medical castration and PSA response with no initial agonist activity within the fir st 1 to 2 weeks of administration, and effectively can obviate the need for concomitant antiandrogen treatment. Post- hoc analyses of degarelix trials [ Tombal , 2010] suggest that it may have additional advantages regarding disease response or secondary relapse; however, such differences require confirmation in prospective studies. Because of the need for monthly depot injections, with large volumes and accompanying local reactions, the use of degarelix in clinical practice has remained low. Relugolix , previously known as TAK-385, is a potent and highly selective oral small molecule antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. For patients, relugolix may offer t he advantages conferred by a direct receptor antagonist, including a more rapid onset of action and the absence of clinical flare or worsening of symptoms from the initial rise in androgens caused by GnRH agonists, as well as having the added convenience and relative comfort of oral dosing. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The proposed dose of relugolix is 120 mg administered orally once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120-mg tablets) on Day 1. 2.2.2. Pharmacology Relugolix is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective, high -affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and init ially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH . Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotrophin- secreti ng cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH- stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH fall rapidly, followed by a decline over a few days in testosterone in men and estradiol and progesterone levels in women. Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock -in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, su ggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic- pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher.

231,page_231,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 29 CONFIDENTIAL 2.2.3. Nonclinical Toxicology A co mprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugolix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in ra ts (≥ 1000 mg/kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no-observed- effect level for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day, and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg/kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (area under the concentration -time curve [ AUC ]) in men receiving 120 mg once daily (0. 469 μg⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL ( 15 mg/kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg·hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugo lix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mouse and rat studies. Embryo-fetal death was observed only in relugolix-treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg/kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human Thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg ( C max of 0.181 µg/mL). 2.2.4. Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studies evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of relugolix, including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose -dependent suppression of testosterone in male subjects and estradiol in female subjects.

232,page_232,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 30 CONFIDENTIAL administration, the absolute bioavailability of relugolix was 12% (range 6 to 25%) with a predominant elimination half-life of 37 to 42 hours. In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The PK and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated, and appear to be similar in Western and Asian volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Asian volunteers. A relative bioavailability and food effect study was conducted using the global phase 3 pros tate cancer formulation of 120 mg relugolix. A fter administration with a high -fat, high -calorie breakfast, the Cmax and AUC of relugolix were reduced, on average, by 21.4% and 18.8%, respectively. In the phase 1 study C27001, serum LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and testosterone concentrations were determined in healthy men following single and multiple oral doses of relugolix or placebo for up to 28 days. Loading doses of ≥ 160 mg on Day 1 were used to shorten the time to testosterone suppression. Relugolix caused an immediate and effective suppression of LH, FSH, and testosterone. After 14 days of once daily dosing, mean LH and serum testosterone concentration profiles were similar for the 40, 80, and 180 mg relugolix dose cohorts. LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations began decreasing 2 to 6 hours postdose on Day 1 and remained suppressed through Day 14. However, the relugolix once daily maintenance dose was a major determinant of sustained testosterone suppression. Profound castration (defined as average testosterone levels < 20 ng/dL or 0.7 nmol/L) was achieved with 40, 80, or 180 mg once daily for 14 days; however, 20 mg once daily was insufficient in maintaining adequate suppression of serum LH and testosterone concentration levels during the second week. In healthy, older men receiving 14 or 28 days of dosing, effective castration was consistently achieved over 14 and 28 days dosing at daily doses of 40 to 180 mg (14 days) and 80 to 160 mg (28 days). Use of a loading dose for up to 3 days (or once daily doses of ≥ 160 mg) resulted in castration levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L) within 24 to 48 hours. Results obtained after 28 days of dosing suggested that the likely minimal, fully effe ctive maintenance dose for sustained castration would be relugolix ≥ 80 mg once daily. Doses of 80 mg and 120 mg were moved forward into phase 2 development. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a me al), as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption by approximately 20%. The exposure of relugolix is increased b y inhibitors of P-glycoprotein up to 6-fold, but relugolix does not significantly impact the exposure of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 substrates. In a dedicated study, relugolix did not prolong QTc at single doses of 60 or 360 mg . 2.2.4.2. Clinical Studies in Men with Prostate Cancer One phase 1 study and 2 phase 2 studies have been conducted evaluating relugolix in men with prostate cancer. Study TB -AK160108 is an ongoing multicenter phase 1, open-label, dose range-finding study conducted in hormone treatment-naïve Asian patients with non- metastatic prostate cancer. The study consists of a dose-rising phase (Part A) and an expansion phase (Part B). In Part A, a loading dose of relugolix (320 or 360 mg) was administered on Day 1 followed by once daily dosing on Days 2 through 28, with the dosage dependent on the individual cohort of 3 to 4 Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 232 CONFIDENTIAL"

In Part B, 30 patients receive a maximum of 96 weeks treatment at doses of 80 and 120 mg once daily (N = 15 each arm, loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1). Testosterone reduction by both doses of relugolix was rapid and sustained through 48 weeks. Both the 80- and 120- mg once daily doses were evaluated in phase 2 clinical studies. Study C27003 is a phase 2 study that enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiatio n therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily following a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks following a single loading dose of 240 mg (N = 38) for 24 weeks. External beam radiation therapy was initiated for most patients between Week 13 and Week 15. Relugolix 120 mg administered orally once daily rapidly suppressed testosterone levels below the castration threshold (50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels from the end of Week 4 through at least 24 weeks. The levels of testosterone suppression achieved by relugolix were similar to those achieved by monthly injections of degarelix. Profound castration rates below the lower testosterone threshold of < 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) were also similar in the relugolix and degarelix groups ( Table 2-1).

Study C27002 is a phase 2 study of relugolix an d leuprolide acetate in patients with prostate cancer who require first-line androgen deprivation therapy, which is ongoing in North America. This study was designed to help plan the population, dosing, and assessment schedules for phase 3 studies in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Eligible patients in C27002 have evidence of advanced prostate cancer including either: 1) PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; 2) newly diagnosed metastatic prost ate cancer ; or 3) advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. In this open-label, parallel group study, patients we re randomized to receive 1 of 2 dose levels of oral relugolix (80 or 120 mg [patients ran domized to relugolix received a loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1], N = 50 per group) or to an observation cohort to receive standard GnRH therapy with leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg administered by intramuscular injection every 12 weeks ( N = 25). R elugolix or leuprolide acetate was admi nistered for up to 48 weeks with patients randomized to leuprolide acetate receiving their last on -study 12-week depot injection at Week 37 . The primary objective of this phase 2 study was to evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain testosterone suppression (< 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) through Week 25. Results from the completed study C27002 demonstrate that both doses of relugolix, 80 mg and 120 mg once daily, rapidly reduced testosterone levels below the castratio n threshold within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels in 91% of patients through 24 weeks of treatment (Table 2-2).

Clinical Safety of Relugolix in Men with Prostate Cancer A full description of the safety data for relugolix from clinical trials is available in th e Investigator Brochure. Overall, approximately 632 healthy volunteers (330 women, 302 men), 535 female patients with uterine fibroids (N = 229) or endometriosis (N = 306), and 218 male patients with prostate cancer received at least 1 dose of relugolix. Data from the 175 patients with prostate cancer who received relugolix in randomized, open -label, parallel -group pha se 2 studies, C27002 and C27003, provide the basis for the frequency of expected adverse events associated with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. The adverse drug reactions in the prostate cancer indication observed in the phase 2 studies include hot flush (59%), fatigue (26%), arthralgia (10%), nausea (5%), and gynecomastia (3%). No clinical evidence of PLD has observed in any relugolix clinical study. Leuprolide Acetate 3 -Month Depot Leuprolide acetate depot is indicated for the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer. Leupro lide acetate acts as an agonist at pituitary GnRH (gonadotropin- releasing hormone) receptors. Leupro lide acetate has greater receptor affinity, reduced susceptibility to enzyma tic degradation, and is approximately 100-fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin- producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and FSH, which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leydig cells. Initially, leuprolide acetate stimulates LH production, which in turn causes a surge of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for 5 to 12 days before the ultimate inhibition of LH. This androgen s urge of male hormones can cause a flare reaction (“clinical flare”), which may lead to an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [Tolis , 1982; Schally , 1980; Waxman , 1985; Conn, 1991; Limonata , 2001]. Chronic stimulation by the GnRH agonist ultimately desensitizes the GnRH receptors, downregulating the secretion of gonadotropins, LH, and FSH, leading to hypogonadism and thus a dram atic reduction in testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on which continued growth of prostate cancer cells depends. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels within 3 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels. The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible over time upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors. The flare phenomenon can be effectively prevented with antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [ Loblaw , 2004] . First generation antiandrogens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide bind to androgen receptors and competitively inhibit their interaction with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. They are often used in an attempt to limit the clinical sequelae produced by th e hormonal surge resulting from GnRH agonist treatment .

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1. Overall Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open- label, parallel -group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin- releas ing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ) every 3 -months (3- M) will be administered to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy . This study will evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels ( ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen- sensi tive advanced prostate cancer. To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investigator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen-Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 241 CONFIDENTIAL"

Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 1 8 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to baseline. If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/ dL (1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ). After randomization, patients on the leuprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease, and a ge. Approximately 915 patients will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia- Pacific region. The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days. Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient -reported outcomes ( EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ -PR25, EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment Period and more frequently during the Follow-up Period. Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China (if enrolled) and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (testosterone level ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should remain on study and may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide. For patients requiring other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the medical monitor.

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is designed to establish the safety and efficacy of relugolix 120 mg orally once daily in men with advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for androgen -sensitive disease. This study will focus on the primary objective of evaluating the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in pati ents with advanced prostate cancer. During the Treatment Period of the study (Day 1 to Week 49 [Study Day 337]), patients will be randomized to one of the study treatment arms: oral loading dose of relugolix (360 mg) followed by 120 mg once daily of relugoli x or leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection of 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg Japan, Taiwan, and China) at 12 -week intervals for 48 weeks . Patients treated with leuprolide acetate will a lso receive an antiandrogen for 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. The study is designed to allow for global approvals, however, different regulatory agencies require different criteria for the demonstration of efficacy. The United States (US) Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) requires , for approval , a primary efficacy criterion to determine whether the sustained castration rate (defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L] while on relugolix study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 through Week 49 Day 1) is grea ter than or equal to 90%. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion.

The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non-inf eriority margin of -10% to meet this criterion. The dose of relugolix selected is based on data from phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrating that oral doses of 80 mg and 120 mg once daily following an oral loading dose of 320 mg were able to suppress testoster one to castrate level s (see Section 2.2.4.2 and the Inves tigator Brochure). A loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120- mg tablets) was selected for phase 3 so that only one tablet size was required. Leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection wa s selected as the comparator as this is the GnRH agonist used most commonly as standard of care in the population under evaluation. Degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist , was considered, but was not used as it has limited market uptake attributed at least in part to a significant number of injection site reactions. 4.3. Selection of Study Population Approximately 915 men with advanced prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . Enrollment is defined as the time at which a patient is randomized to a treatment group and receives at least one dose of study drug. Deviations from inclusion and exclusion cr iteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability, or patient safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential. Any questions regarding pat ient eligibility and entry criteria should be discussed with the medical monitor prior to randomizing the patient. 4.3.1. Inclusion Criteria A patient will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following inclusion criteria are met prior to ra ndomization, unless otherwise specified: 1. Has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form prior to initiation of any screening or study -specific procedures; 2. Is a male aged 18 years or older on the day of signing and dating the informed consent form; 3. Has histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate; 4. Is a candidate for, in the opinion of the investigator, at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer with one of the following clinical disease state presentations: a. Evidence of biochemical (PSA) or clinical relapse following local primary intervention with curative intent, such as surgery, radiation therapy, cryotherapy, or high- frequency ultrasound and not a candidate for salvage treatment by surgery; or b. Newly diagnosed androgen- sensitive metastatic disease; or c. Advanced localized disease unlikely to be cured by local primary intervention with either surgery o r radiation with curative intent ; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 244 CONFIDENTIAL"

Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient Identification Number After a patient is screened and the investigator determines that the patient is eligible for enrollment, the site staff will complete the Randomization Authorization Form and send it to the sponsor ( Myovant Sciences GmbH ) or sponsor designee per the instructions in the investigator site file . The sponsor (or designee) will approve the patient’s enrollment in wr iting. Once the site has received approval, the patient may undergo the Baseline Day 1 v isit. The site will randomize the patient to treatment by using the IWRS during the patient’s Baseline Day 1 visit. The IWRS will assign the patient identification (ID) number. This number will identify the patient for the duration of the study. A study treatment kit number will be available at the site accord ing to the randomization code. 4.7. Removal of Patients from Therapy Patients may withdraw consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason. Investigators or the m edical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below. Patients removed from thera py for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Week 49 visit on the Schedule of Activities . The End of Treatment is defined as the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks after the last leuprolide acetate injection . Follow-up visits to assess safety will be performed in all study patients. If the patient plans to start alternative androgen deprivation therapy less than 30 days after the End of Treatment visit, the Safety Follow -up visit may occur earlier, before the start of the alternative androgen deprivation therapy. Testosterone recovery will be evaluated in approximately 100 patients randomized to relugolix and approximately 50 patients to leuprolide acetate who complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment and, in the opinion of the investigator, are candidates for intermittent androgen deprivation therapy and will not be offered alternative androgen deprivation therapy upon completion of study therapy. The se patients will return for the 60- and 90-day follow-up Testosterone Recovery visits. The s afety and/or compliance events shown in Table 4-1 will result in the removal of patients from therapy either permanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved .

251,page_251,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 49 CONFIDENTIAL Once study drug has been discontinued, all study procedures outlined for the Week 49 visit will be completed as specifie d in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1). The primary reason for study drug discontinuation will be recorded on the eCRF. Patients who withdraw from treatment will not be replaced. Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol-defined window, the site should attempt to contact the patien t and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. Patients randomized to relugolix should be counseled to notify the investigator in the event of intercurrent illness to determine if the study drug treatment can be continued. Every effort should be made to ensure the patient’s compliance with study drug treatment, including calling patients to reschedule missed visits. In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the patient. The site should attempt at least 3 documented telephone calls and, if necessary , a certifi ed letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 4.8. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance It is not known what effects relugolix has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. A patient must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman. Patients must not donate sperm from first dose of study drug through 4 months afte r the last dose of study drug. Nonsterilized male patients should use a male condom, either alone or in addition to effective methods of contraception used by a female partner of childbearing potential, through defined periods during and after study treatm ent as specified below. Examples of effective contraceptive methods include condoms, hormonal contraceptives, and intrauterine devices. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to one of the following: • Use a male condom if having sex with a woman of childbearing age or a pregnant woman, during the entire study T reatment Period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug; or • Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and us ual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

Instructions for collection and processing of blood specimens are provided in the investigator site file. 6.6.1.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Relugolix Pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patients randomized to relugolix study drug. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of relugolix will be c ollected at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients may take their dose of study drug in the clinic at these visits. Study drug will be administered on an empty stomach or at least 2 hours before food, and food will be withheld for 1 hour after dosing. The date and time of their previous dose of study drug (ie, the dose the day before the clinic visit) will be accurately recorded. Ideally, predose s amples should be collected approximately 24 hours (±6 hours) after the previous dose of relugolix, although samples collected outside of this window would not be considered a protocol deviation. If the study patient inadvertently took the study drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the date and time of that dose should also be accurately recorded and the pharmacokinetic sample collected, which may be used for population PK modeling. Plasma from the Week 5 and Week 13 visits in all patients will be analyzed for relugolix plasma concentration. Analysis of other individual patient plasma samples will be performed on a case-by-case basis (such as those patients with non -castrate testosterone levels).

Pharmacogenomic s Sample Collection Whole Blood Sample for Germline Deoxyribonucleic Acid Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. P articipation of study patients in pharmacogenomic sample collection is optional. A pharmacogenomics sample will be collected from patients at all participating study centers, with individual patient consent and per local ethics and regulatory standards. The sample will be retained for germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of potential genetic determinants of drug safety, drug efficacy or disease response, and drug metabolism. Every patient must sign informed consent/be consented in order to partic ipate in the sampling of whole blood for DNA analysis. This research may be used to develop a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of relugolix and other study drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condition being studied, and for improving the efficiency, design and study methods of future research studies. Two venous whole blood sample (4 mL per sample) for the analysis of germline DNA will be collected at Day 1 from all patients who have provided informed consent . The DNA sample s are expected to be collected at the Day 1 visit, but if necessary, may be collected at any visit after randomization. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if isolation of DNA from the first sample was not successful or possible . Germline DNA analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or diseases, which may lead to additional hypothesis- generating exploratory research on stored samples. Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the resul t of any analyses and corresponding information will be identified only by a code in a computer database. The whole blood samples for DNA analysis will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated central laboratory vendor until 10 years after completion of this study (HERO, MVT -601-3201) and/or until the drug development of relugolix is no longer actively pursued by Myovant or its collaborators.

After that time, the samples will be properly destroyed by the central laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor. The investigator will keep records linking the patient identity with the samples for the time required by applicable law. Patients who consent and provide a pharmacogenomic sample for DNA analysis can withdraw their consent and request disposal of a stored sample at any time. Directions for sample collection and handling can be found in the investigator site file . 6.6.1.4. Quality of Life European Quality of Life 5- Dimension 5 -Level Assessment The EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L comprises 5 scales and an overall assessment of health status on a visual analogue scale ( Appendix 2). The 5 scales include: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The original version, the EQ-5D-3L, includes 3 response options for each scale. However, a new 5-level response-option version, the EQ-5D- 5L, has been developed with the following response options: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. It is believed that the EQ -5D-5L is superior to the EQ- 5D-3L in terms of feasibility, ceiling effects, discriminatory power, and convergent validity. The EQ-5D- 5L index values will be calculated from the EQ -5D- 5L descriptive system scores based on the Crosswalk value sets [EuroQol Group, 1990; Brooks , 1996; Herdman , 2011; Janssen , 2013]. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Assessments The EORTC -QLQ -C30 [ Fayers , 2001; Fayers , 2002] (Appendix 3) and the 25- item prostate cancer module EORTC -QLQ -PR25 [ Spry, 2006] (Appendix 4) will be administered as specified in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.1). The EORTC QLQ -C30 core measurement will be used to capture distal outcomes, including physical, social functioning, and overall health- related quality of life. The QLQ -C30 core questionnaire incorporates 30 questions comprising 9 multi- item scales: 5 fun ctional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality of life scale. Several single -item symptom measures are also included. It is a reliable and valid measure of health -related quality of life in patients with cancer and takes about 11 minutes to administer. The instrument has been validated and used in many countries [ Aaronson, 1993]. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 is the 25-item Prostate Cancer module (P25) of the EORTC. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 contains 3 additional symptom scales (urinary, bowel, sexual) and 5 treatment -related items. 6.6.2. Safety -Related Procedures 6.6.2.1.

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Study asse ssments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations including visual acuity assessment , vital signs , weight, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre -existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separ ate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately); and • An investigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms; o Requires active intervention; or o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet the definition of an adver se event include: o Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event; o The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression; o Pre-existing diseases or c onditions present or detected before the start of study drug administration that do not worsen; and o Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitalization for an elective procedure, with elective defined as known or planne d at the time of signing of the informed consent). Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the investigator and graded according to CTCAE (Appendix 5 ). Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are “intermittent”. All other events are “continuous”. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and repor ting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted ; however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 10 days for evaluation Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 269 CONFIDENTIAL"

The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is life -threatening ; NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug- induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patien t has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfe re or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Important medical events that jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.2. Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory authorities is a r equirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local I RB/I EC. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 270 CONFIDENTIAL"
271,page_271,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 69 CONFIDENTIAL Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient’s answers to the EQ-5D- 5L will not be used as a primary means to co llect adverse events, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow -up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event res ulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overdose and pregnancy in a partner will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively . 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will be collected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Safety Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the Safety F ollow- up visit approximatel y 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection , or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. Any event occurring between signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 271 CONFIDENTIAL"

Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The definitions in Table 7-1 are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug. Table 7-1 Causal Relationship to Study Drug Relationship Criteria Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re-administration (re-challeng e) or withdrawal (de -challenge). Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record. In the event a patient i s withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken. The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE (see Appendix 5). For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-2 should be used to determine the grade severity. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 272 CONFIDENTIAL"

Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting Adverse events of clinical interest in this study are defined as any increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN. Any ALT or AST elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the randomized T reatment Period or the Follow-up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the serious adverse event form within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event (see Section 7.6), even if the event does not meet serious adverse event criteria. Additional instructions for evaluating patients with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN may be found in Appendix 6. 7.5.1. Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug in Association with Liver Test Abnormalities Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA dru g-induced liver injury guidelines [FDA , 2009]. If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status), and the event reported as a serious adverse event: • ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or • ALT or AST > 5 x ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) >1.5 • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%). Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree with any decision to rechallenge. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 273 CONFIDENTIAL"

Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug in Association with Liver Test Abnormalities Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, potential severe drug -induced liver injury/Hy’s law case): 1) AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 x ULN; AND 2) Total bilirubin increases to > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5; A ND 3) Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 x ULN; AND 4) No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; important alternative causes include, but are not limited to the following: • Hepatobiliary tract disease ; • Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr virus); • Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms; • Alcoholic hepatitis ; • Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ; or • Autoimmune hepatitis . If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified, then it should be determined (based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity or event) whether study drug treatment should be withheld or permanently discontinued as appropriate for the safety of the patient. 7.6. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Using a serious adverse event report form , all serious adverse events must be reported within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event , regardless of the investigator assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment.

Do not delay reporting a suspected serious adverse event in order to obtain additional information. Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow-up to the initial report. All serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, until the event has stabilized, and/or reached a new baseline. All serious adverse events continuing at the completion of the study must be assessed or followed to determine outcome. 7.7. Study Drug Overdose Management The medical monitor must be contacted in the event of any study drug overdose. An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a study patient, at a d ose above that assigned to that individual patient according to the study protocol. For this study, any dose of relugolix > 240 mg within a 24-hour window is an overdose, except for the 360-mg loading dose. The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose; supportive treatment should be provided as clinically applicable. In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: • Contact the medical monitor immediately ; • Closely monitor the patient for adverse events and lab oratory abnormalities ; • All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by the study site, using a serious adverse event form, whether or not the overdose is associated with an adverse event; • If possible, obtain a plasma sample for PK an alysis within 2 days from the date of the last dose of study drug if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis); and Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 275 CONFIDENTIAL PPD"

The medical monitor, in consultation with the i nvestigator, will make decisions regarding patient status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patient. 7.8. Pregnancy Reporting If the partner of any patient becomes pregnant during the study or through 4 months after the last dose of study drug, the investigator must inform the sponsor of the pregnancy. The patient should remain on study drug treatment, unless otherwise indicated. If the patient agrees, the patient’s pregnant partner should be notified and requested to sign a Release of Information form, permitting transfer of information regarding the pregnancy and outcome to the sponsor. A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness by the s tudy site personnel, using the partner pregnancy report forms. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this information, as available. The investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, and will report the outcome to the sponsor. 7.9. Benefit/Risk Assessment Summaries of findings from both nonclinical and clinical studies conducted with relugolix c an be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure. The risk as sessment and mitigation strategies for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-3. Table 7-3 Relugolix Potential Risks and Mitigation Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Mitigation Strategy Impact on Eligibility Monitoring and Stopping Criteria Hepatic Enzyme Increases Isolated increases in hepatic enzymes have been observed in prior clinical studies. Hepatic enzyme increases, considered an important potential risk of treatment with relugolix, are closely monitored in accordance with FDA guidelines for assessing drug - induced liver injury [ FDA , 2009] in all relugolix studies. Exclusion criteria for AST and ALT > ULN; total bilirubin values > ULN unless consistent with Gilbert’s syndrome. Liver chemistry will be monitored during the study. Appropriate liver stopping criteria and follow-up procedures are detailed in Section 7.5.2.

Risks Associated with Medical Castration Acute and subsequent chronic symptoms of medical castration (reduction of testosterone to ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) include vasomotor symptoms or hot flushes, disturbed sleep related to vasomotor symptoms, decreased libido, and fatigue or loss of energy. These side effects are usually not severe and can be managed with anticipatory guidance. Long- term suppression of testosterone is associated with well- characterized risks including bone loss, decreased muscle mass, possible changes in insulin sensitivity with increased risk of diabetes, altered lipid metabolism, and possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ Oefelein , 2002; Lopez , 2005; Diamond ,1998; Keating , 2006; Braga - Basaria , 2006; Saigal , 2007; Tsai, 2007 ; D'Amico , 2007; Efstathiou , 2009]. - Effects can usually be managed with appropriate anticipatory guidance (eg, diet and exercise programs) or supportive therapy when required (e g, lipid-lowering or bone- sparing agents). Metabolic Changes Metabolic changes (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased weight) with increased risk of diabetes are a potential risk of the h ypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix. - Fasting lipids and glucose will be monitored during the study. Loss of Bone Mineral Density Loss of bone mineral density is considered a potential risk of treatment with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. - Fractures will be assessed through adverse event monitoring. Use of anti-resorptive bone therapy, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab , may be considered by the treating physician.

Clinical Procedures Sponsor personnel or designee(s) will visit the study site if necessary prior to initiation of the study to review information about the study drug, protocol requirements, eCRFs, monitoring requirements, reporting of serious adverse events, and to ensure a full understanding of the investigator site file with the site personnel. 8.2. Monitoring This study will be monitored by the sponsor (or designee) in accordance with current Good Clinical Practice regulations. By signing this protocol, the i nvestigator grants permission to Myovant Sciences GmbH (or designee) and appropriate regulat ory a uthorities to conduct on- site monitoring of all appropriate study documentation. In order to assure the accuracy of data collected in the eCRF , it is mandatory that representatives of the sponsor (or designee) have access to original source documents (eg, patient records, patient charts, and laboratory reports). During the review of these documents, the anonymity of the patient will be respected with strict adherence to professional standards of confidentiality. A study monitor will contact and visi t the site regularly and will be allowed, on request at a mutually acceptable time, to inspect the various records of the study. It will be the s tudy monitor’s responsibility to inspect the eCRF at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and accuracy of all eCRF entries , and to meet with the investigator to discuss study progress and compliance with the protocol and Good Clinical Practices. The study monitor should have access to laboratory test results and any other source records and data needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. For this study, patient data will be entered into a sponsor-approved electronic database and combined with data provided from other sources in validated datasets then transmitted electronically to the sponsor (or designee). Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable sponsor-approved standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data (eg, removing errors and inconsistencies in the data). Adverse events and concomitant medications terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced, respectively. The investigator will retain original source documents and the s ponsor will receive eCRF - required data as electronic datasets. Patient initials will not be collected or transmitted to the sponsor. 8.3.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES A statistical analysis plan will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for this study. The statistical analysis plan will be prepared an d finalized prior to database lock and analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. All confidence intervals will be 2 -sided at an alpha level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. The methodology to be used to maintain a study- wide type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan . All efficacy and safety measures over the course of the study will be presented. Continuous data will be summarized by means, standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients. Categorical data will be summarized by counts and percentages. 9.1. Randomization Methods Central randomization will be used and treatment allocation will be 2:1, relugolix to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot. Random ization will be stratified by the following factors: • Geographic Region: North and South America versus Europe versus Asia and Rest of World ; • Presence of Metastatic Disease: yes versus no; • Baseline Age: ≤ 75 years old versus > 75 years old. Stratified efficacy analyses will incorporate these 3 stratification factors unless otherwise specified. 9.2. Analysis Populations The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients randomized to treatment who have taken at least one dose of study treatment . This will be the primary population used for the efficacy analysis. Patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment. The Per -Protocol population will consist of those members of the ITT population who have no major protocol deviations as defined in the statistical analysis plan , considering the following protocol deviations but not limited to : • Those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria; • Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn; • Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; • Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment.

The Per -Protocol population will be used as a sensitivity analysis of the ITT population for the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary endpoints. The Per-Protocol population will be identified prior to the database lock. The primary population for safety analyses will be the Safety population, defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of any study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment assignment. 9.3. Efficacy Analyses 9.3.1. Primary Endpoint Analyses The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate, defined as the cumul ative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 (Study Day 337). This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method with the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation. Detailed censoring rules will be described in the statistical analysis plan . There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: to determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2: to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The confidence interval of the treatment difference will be calculated using the formula 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)−𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)�+ 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)� , where each of the variance of the Kaplan -Meier estimate will be calculated using the Greenwood's formula 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)2�∑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗�𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗−𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗�𝑗𝑗:𝑡𝑡(𝑗𝑗)≤𝑡𝑡 � ; nj denote the number of patients at risk at time t (j) and d j denote the number of events observed at time t(j)) [Lachin , 2000]. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans. The 2-sided type I error rates for the final analyses will be controlled at 0.05 separately for each regional analysis. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 280 CONFIDENTIAL"

The methods and procedures necessary to maintain a study- wide 2 -sided typ e I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan . • Castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) prior to dosing at Week 1 Day 4, and prior to dosing at Week 3 Day 1 will be summarized by treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method; • Profound castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression of ≤ 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) while on treatment from Week 25 Day 1 through Week 49 Day 1 will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method. The difference in the cumulative probabilities between the relugolix group and the leuprolide acetate group will be provided, along with the 95% confidence interval calculated in the same manner as in the primary analysis of the primary endpoint; • PSA response and percent change from baseline in PSA at Week 3 and Week 5 will be summarized and compared between the relugolix group and the leuprolide ace tate group ; • Proportions of patients who have a PSA concentration < 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 µg/L) at Week 25 will be summarized by treatment group. The proportions will be compared between the relugolix group and the leuprolide acetate group by constructing a 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions; • Time to testosterone recovery in approximately 100 patients randomized to relugolix and approximately 50 patients randomized to leuprolide acetate who complete 48 weeks of treatment and who do not start alternative androgen deprivation therapy within the following 12 weeks (or within 24 weeks following the last received leuprolide acetate 3-M depot injection) will be compared between the relugolix group and the leuprolide acetate grou p; • Absolute values and changes from baseline in the scores of the EOR TC-QLQ -C30 global health domain and the EORTC- QLQ -PR25 sexual activity and hormonal- treatment - related symptom subdomains will be summarized by treatment group. The least square means at Week 49 will be compared between the relugolix group and the leuprolide acetate group by constructing a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the least square means using a mixed model for repeated measures ; • Absolute values and changes from baseline of the remaining domains in the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QLQ- PR25, as well as EQ -5D- 5L will be summarized by treatment group.

Safety Analyses The safety analyses will be based on the Safety p opulation. Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing adverse events , laboratory analytes, vital signs, ECG parameters, and concomitant medications. The severity of all adverse events is to be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. All adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using MedDRA 19.1 or higher. The incidence of adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug treatment, and severity. A patient reporting the same adverse event more than once is counted once, and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to study drug treatment when calculating incidence. Laboratory data consist of chemistry, hematology , and hormonal tests. Only data collected by the central laboratory will be used for analyses. The National Cancer Institute CTCAE will be used to categorize toxicity grade for the laboratory parameters. Shift tables will be provided for each gradable parameter to summarize baseline toxicity grade versus post -baseline toxicity grade. For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by the CTCAE, a shift table based upon the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summ arize the baseline versus post- baseline results. 9.5. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Plasma relugolix concentration s will be listed and summarized and included in the clinical study report . PK data may be pooled with data from other studies in healthy male patient s and patients with prostate cancer for population PK analysis, including evaluation of covariates of relugolix PK parameters, and for input into a population PK /pharmacodynamics models describing the relationship between relugolix exposure and serum testosterone [ Ahsman , 2016]. These population PK analyses will be detailed further in a separate statistical analysis plan and report. For patients from China (if enrolled) and Japan in the PK subset, plasma relugolix PK parameters Cmax, AUC 0-τ, and t max from Day 1 and Day 14 of dosing will be determined. Population PK or PK/pharmacodynamic analyses may be conducted to explore the factors that affect relugolix exposure or to contribute to the assessment of the relationships between exposure and testosterone. 9.6. Endocrine Marker Analyses Endocrine markers will be analyzed to see effects of relugolix and leuprolide acetate as measured as absolute va lue and change from baseline for: • LH at Day 4 , Week 5, Week 25, and Week 49 visits and/or follow-up visit(s); • FSH at Day 4 , Week 5, Week 25, and Week 49 visits and/or follow-up visit (s); Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 282 CONFIDENTIAL"

Exploratory Analyses Overall survival : Overall survival defined as time from randomization to date of death prior to data cutoff date. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions for each treatment arm. Pharmacogenomic analys es may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety, pending availability of samples. Polymorphisms in germline genes related to the hypothalamic -pituitary -androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or to drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter proteins that might be implicated in the drug disposition, safety, or efficacy of relugolix . These analyses will be detailed in a separate statistical analysis plan and associated report s. 9.8. Interim Analyses There will be no planned interim e fficacy analysis for the study. 9.9. Sample Size To calculate the sample size required for the primary efficacy endpoint of this study, the following assumptions have been made: • True probabilities of sustained testosterone suppression are 94% and 96% for relugolix and leuprolide acetate, respectively ; • 2:1 randomization ratio ( relugolix:leuprolide acetate); and • Dropout rate of 15%. The assumed probability of sustained testosterone suppression for relugolix arm is 94%. It was estimated based on the predicted dose-response relationship for the effect of relugolix on testosterone suppression in patients w ith prostate cancer (data from phase 2 studies C27002 and C27003). The assumed castration rate of 96% for leuprolide acetate was based on the results from degarelix phase 3 registration program [Shore , 2013]. For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of < 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and an overall 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at le ast 99% power in declaring the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The final analysis will be performed separately for individual evaluation criterion using data collected through 48 weeks after enrollment of approximately 915 pa tients .

This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, patient ID number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational med icinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconcil iation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor ( or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study. All records must be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate regulatory agencies, upon request. Current ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries from the s ponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following: • That such deliveries are recorded, for example, on the sponsor-approved drug accountability log, or other sponsor-approved pharmacy log; • That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly in accordance with the study protocol; • That study drug is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with the protocol; • That any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor- designated facility or standard procedures for the alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed and only after approval by the sponsor representative. Drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by the investigator/pharmacist. Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent: • The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any persons except the patients in this study; • The investigator/pharmacist will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to those authorized by the investigator to dispense these study drugs; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 287 CONFIDENTIAL"
288,page_288,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 2, 18 January 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 86 CONFIDENTIAL • The investigator/pharmacist will maintain a study drug inventory. The inventory will include details of material received and a clear record of when they were dispensed and to which patient; • The investigator/pharmacist agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory on the drug accountability record at the conclusion or termination of the study. It must be possible to reconcile delivery records with those of used and returned study drug. Any discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate forms of deliveries must be signed by the person responsible; • Used or unused study drug may be destroyed at the study site according to standard institutional procedures if the sponsor agrees with the procedure, and after drug accountability has been conducted by the sponsor or representative. Unused study drug not destroyed at the site must be returned to the sponsor- designated facility at the end of the study or upon expiration. 10.1.7. Inspections During the course of the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality assurance audits will be undertaken by authorized sponsor representatives. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was) conducted and monitored in compliance with the protocol as well as recognized Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. These audits will also increase the likelihood that the stud y data and all other study documentation can withstand a regulatory authority inspection. If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed time. By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee to conduct onsite audits of all appropriate facilities and study documentation. The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 10.1.8. Protocol Compliance The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 10.2. Sponso r Responsibilities 10.2.1. Protocol Modifications Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to patients , may be made only by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirem ents. Approval must be obtained before changes can be implemented. The investigator must not deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, if required. In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will remove the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 288 CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by the IRB or IEC, and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 10.2.2. Study Report A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies). The sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases. 10.2.3. Posting of Information on Publicly Available Clinical Trial Registers Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial registers (eg, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov ) before enrollment of patien ts begins. Results will be posted as required. 10.3. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities 10.3.1. Access to Information Monitoring In accordance with ICH G ood Clinical Practice guidelines, the s tudy monitor must have direct access to the investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the eCRFs for consistency. The study monitor is responsible for routine review of the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to any patient records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. The i nvestigator agrees to cooperate with the study monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 10.3.2. Access to Information for Auditing or Inspection s Representatives of regulatory authorities or of the sponsor may conduct inspections or audits of the clinical study. If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a regulatory authority, the investigator agrees to notify the sponsor ’s medical moni tor immediately. The investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or the s ponsor access to records, facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit.

Study Discontinuation The sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study at any time. When the sponsor is aware of information on matters concerning the quality, efficacy, and safety of the study drugs, as well as other important information that may affect proper conduct of the clinical study, the sponsor may terminate the study and send a written notice of the termination along with the reasons to the investigator. Should this be necessary, the sponsor will arrange discontinuation procedures and notify the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) and IRBs/IECs. In terminating the study, the sponsor and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the study p articipants’ interests. If the investigator intends to terminate participation in the study, the investigator must immediately inform the sponsor and provide the reason to it. 10.3.4. Publications After conclusion of the study and without prior written approval from the sponsor, investigators in this study may communicate, orally present, or publish in scientific journals or other scholarly media only after the following conditions have been met: • The results of the study in their entirety have been publicly disclosed by or with the consent of the sponsor in an abstract, manuscript, or presentation form; or • The study has been completed at all study sites for at least 5 years. No such communication, presentation, or publication will include Myovant Sciences GmbH confi dential information (see Section 10.1.4). The investigator will submit to the sponsor any proposed publication or presentation along with the respe ctive target scientific journal or presentation forum at least 30 days before submission of the publication or presentation. The i nvestigator will comply with sponsor requests to delete references to its confidential information (other than the study results) in any paper or presentation and agrees to withhold publication or presentation for an additional 60 days in order to obtain patent protection if deemed necessary.

Adverse Event Severity Grading When assessing adverse events, refer to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, June 14, 2010 (available at: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). A copy of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE table will be provided in the investigator site file . The National Cancer Institute CTCAE is a descriptive terminology that can be utilized for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term. Components and Organization of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE • System Or gan Class (SOC). SOC, the highest level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) hierarchy, is identified by anatomical or physiological system, etiology, or purpose (eg, SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms ar e grouped by MedDRA Primary SOCs. Within each SOC, adverse events are listed and accompanied by descriptions of severity (grade). • CTAE Terms. Each CTCAE term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term). • Definitions. A brief definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each adverse event term. • Grades. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event . The CTCAE displays grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each advers e event based on this general guideline: o Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. o Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate ins trumental activities of daily living; o Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living; o Grade 4 Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and o Grade 5 Death related to adverse event . A semi-colon indicates “or” within the description of the grade. A single dash (- ) indicates a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events . Therefore, some adverse events are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. • Grade 5. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some adverse events and therefore is not an option.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS Stud y Title HERO: A Multinational Phase 3, Randomized, Open -label, Parallel -group Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Relugolix in Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer Protocol Number MVT -601-3201 Location Multinational, including North and South Amer ica, Europe, and Asia -Pacific Study Centers Approxi mately 200 sites Study phase Phase 3 Target Population Men aged 18 or older diagnosed with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer who are candidates for at least 1 year of continuous androgen depri vation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and who are not candidates for surgical therapy. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Number of Patients Planned A total of a pproximately 1100 patients will be enrolled , including approximately 390 patient s with metastatic advanced prostate cancer to support the analysis of the secondary endpoint of time to castration- resistance (TCR) , and 138 Chinese patients (enrolled in China and Taiwan) to support registration in China . • After the first 915 patients are enrolled , enrollment in China will continue for metastatic and non -metastatic patients until the target number of Chinese patients is reached (138). In the rest of the world, only metastatic patients will continue to be enrolled until approximately 390 me tastatic patients are accrued. • The primary analysis of efficacy and safety will be conducted after the first 915 patients, enrolled in all regions, have completed study treatment and will include metastatic and non- metastatic patients with advanced prostate cancer. • Analysis of the secondary endpoint of TCR will be conducted when all metastatic patients have completed study treatment. • An analysis will be conducted when all Chinese patients have completed study treatment. Study Obje ctives Primary : • To evaluat e the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in men with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer. Secondary : • To evaluate the time course and change in serum testosteron e dur ing treatment with relugolix; • To evaluate the time course and magnitude of prostate- specific antigen ( PSA) reduction during treatment with relugolix ; • To evaluate testosterone recovery following discontinuation of relugolix; • To evaluate quality of life using validated patient -reported outcome instruments; Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 315 CONFIDENTIAL"

Exploratory: • To explore the overall survival of patients treated with relugolix; and • To explore the contribution of genetic variance on drug response. Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open-label, parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of r elugolix in patients with androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that lowers testosterone by inhibi ting pituitary release of follicle - stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) . Relugo lix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension, 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ), every 3 -months (3-M) will be administe red to patients with prostate cancer who require androgen deprivation therapy. This study will evaluat e the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppress ion to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients w ith androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer . To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investi gator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanc ed prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy . Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative intent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and /or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 18 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to the baseline visit. If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy , are excluded, as are patients receiving Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 316 CONFIDENTIAL"

Baseline serum testosteron e must be ≥ 150 ng/dL (1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enrolled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg (or 1 1.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China) . After randomization, patients in the leuprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks, or longer if indicated , in the opinion of the investigator . Randomization will be stratified by geographi c region , presence of metastatic disease ( metastases in regional lymph node[s] are considered N1 and will, therefore, be stratified as non- metastatic) , and age for the initial 915 enrolled from all regions or among the approximately 138 Chinese patients. A total of approximately 1100 patients from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia- Pacific region are planned to be enrolled in this study. Included in the 1100 enrolled patients will be approximately 390 patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer to support the analysis of the secondary endpoint of TCR (these patients will be stratified by geographic region and age only), and 138 Chinese patients (enrolled in China and Taiwan) to support registration in Chin a. Approximately 138 Chinese patients will be enrolled (in China and Taiwan) . Similar to the initial 915 patients enrolled in the HERO study, these Chinese patients will include patients with metastatic and non-metastatic advanced prostate cancer . The stu dy includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment P eriod of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days . Additionally, unscheduled follow- up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient- reported outcomes (European Organisation of Resear ch and Treatment of Cancer [E ORTC ] QLQ-C30, European Quality of Life 5 -Dimesion 5- Level questionnaire [EuroQol EQ -5D-5L]) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment Period and more frequently during the F ollow -up Period. Additional serum endocrine evaluations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and se x hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment - emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12- lead electrocardiograms (ECG) , and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should be encouraged to remain on study and, if indicated, may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide after the confirmation of PSA progression . For patients requiring other systemic antineoplastic therapy during the treatment period, the investigator should contact the medical monitor.

These will be evaluated in a subset of patients. Statistical Methods A statistical analysis plan will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for this study. The statistical analysis plan will be prepared and finalized before database lock for the primary analysis. There will be two analyses for the study, a primary analysis and a final analysis. The primary analysis of efficacy and safety will occur after approximately the first 915 patients have been randomized to the study (ITT population) and have had the opportunity to be evaluated for 48 weeks and complete the 30-day safety follow -up visit. The final analysis will occur after appr oximately 390 metastatic patients have been randomized to the study and have had the opportunity to be evaluated for 48 weeks of study treatment and complete the 30-day safety follow-up visit or discontinued early. TCR in the subgroup of metastatic patients and the extended ITT population (approxi mately 1100 patients) will be analyzed only at the time of the final analysis. Efficacy The efficacy analyses will be conducted using an Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized patients who have taken at least on e dose of study treatment . Randomization will be stratified by geographic region (North and South America versu s Europe v ersus Asia and Rest of World) , presence of metastatic disease (metastases in regional lymph node [s] are considered N1 and will, therefore, be stratified as non -metastatic ) on baseline imaging (yes versu s no), and age (≤ 75 years old versus > 75 years old ). The 2-sided type I error rate for this study is 0.05. After the initial 915 patients have been enrolled, only patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer from other regions will continue to be enrolled (these patients will be stratified by geographic region and age only) , except for China, where both metastatic and non- metastatic patients will continue to be enrolled (these patients will continue to be stratified using all of the stratification factors ). Primary Efficacy Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate defined as the cumulative probability of achieving testosterone suppression to castrate level s of ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 Day 1 (Study Day 337) . This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan-Meier method wit h the confidence interval calculated usi ng the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinuation.

The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2 : to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion . The 2-sided type I error rate will be 0.05 for each individual evaluation criterion. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 1. Castration rate: the cumulative probabi lity of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) prior to dosing on Week 1 Day 4, and prior to dosing on Week 3 Day 1 ; 2. Profound castration rate: the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) from Week 25 through Week 49; 3. PSA response rate: proportion of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in PSA from baseline at Week 3 and confirmed at Week 5; 4. Undetectable PSA rate: proportion of patients with PSA concentration < 0.2 ng/mL (0.2 µg/L) at the Week 3 and Week 5 visits; 5. Time to testosterone recovery in approximately 100 relugolix- treated and approximately 50 leuprolide acetate- treated patients who complete 48 weeks of treatment and do not start alternative androgen deprivation therapy within 12 weeks after the last do se of relugolix or within 24 weeks following the last received injection of leuprolide acetate. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions ; 6. Quality of Life : absolute values and changes from baseline in the scores of the EORTC -QLQ-C30 global health domain, and the EORTC- QLQ -PR25 sexual activity and hormonal- treatment -related symptom subdomains, at regular intervals during treatment, and as applicable at the F ollow-up and/or End-of-Study visits will be presented. Additionally, abs olute values and changes from baseline of the remaining domains in the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ- PR25, as well as EQ -5D-5L, at regular intervals during treatment, and as applicable dur ing the F ollow-up visits will be presented . Change from baseline will be analyzed using mixed- model repeated measures methodology ; 7. Time to PSA progression : defined per Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 guidelines as the first increase in PSA of 25% or greater and 2 ng/mL or greater above the nadir with confirmation by a second PSA measurement at least 3 weeks later. For patients without declining PSA from baseline, PSA increase of 25% or greater and 2 ng/mL from baseline beyond 12 weeks will be considered PSA progression. 8. TCR in the subgroup of metastatic patients and the extended ITT population w ill only be evaluated at the time of final analysis, when approximately 1100 patients (reach ing at least 390 metastatic patients) have been randomized to the study and have had the opportunity to be evaluated for 48 we eks of study treatment and complete the 30-day safety follow-up or discontinued early. TCR is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of PSA progression while castrated or death due to any reason, whichever occurs earlier. TCR will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Treatment comparison with hazard ratios will be performed using Cox proportional hazards model.

Overall survival : Overall survival defined as time from randomization to date of death prior t o data cutoff date. Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to describe survival distributions; 2. The effect of polymorphisms in germline genes related to the hypothalamic- pituitary -androgen pathway, prostate cancer risk, or drug metabolizing enzymes and transpor ter proteins on the efficacy and safety of relugolix will be described in a separate statistical analysis plan. The methods and procedures needed to maintain a study -wide 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan. Pharmacokinetics Relugolix plasma concentrations will be summarized and described using population PK methods. Plasma PK parameters in a subset of patients from China and Japan will be determined using noncompartmental methods. Safety Safety assessments, including adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and ECGs , will be summarized for the treatment -emergent period. The treatment -emergent period is defined as the time from first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last dose of leuprolide acetate . Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive an y amount of study drug (Safety population). Drug exposure wil l be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the N ational Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) and will be coded to preferred term, higher- level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship t o study drug, and severity. Descriptive rather than inferential statistics will be used. Laboratory values also will be classified by toxicity grade based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. Laboratory shift tables of baseline versus post baseline results will be produced. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will monitor all available safety data on a periodic basis. The roles and responsibilities of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be described in detail in a separate charter. Sample Size To calculate the sample size required for the primary efficacy endpoint of this study, the following assumptions have been made: • True probabilities of sustained castration rates are 94% and 96% for relugolix and leuprolide acetate, respectively ; • 2:1 randomization ratio (relugolix:leuprolide acetate) ; • Dropout rate of 15%. For Evaluation Criterion 1, 610 patients in the relugolix group will provide approximately 90% power to rule out a fixed probability of sustained testosterone suppression of ≤ 90% at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. For Evaluation Criterion 2, with the non- inferiority margin of -10% and a 2- sided type I error rate of 0.05, a total of approximately 915 patients (610 relugolix, 305 leuprolide acetate) will yield at least 99% power in declaring the non- inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate. The primary analysis will be performed separately for individual evaluation criterion using data collected through 48 weeks after enrollment of approximately 915 patients.

The study is also powered for the secondary endpoint of TCR in the high -risk subgroup of metastatic patients. Approximately 107 confirmed castration -resistance events (PSA progressions while castrated or deaths due to any cause) will need to be observed (or approximately 390 metastatic patients will need to be enrolled) to d etect a hazard ratio of 0.55 (relugolix versus leuprolide acetate) with 85% power with a two-sided type I error of 5%, assuming a castration -resistant event -free rate of 60% at 48 weeks for the control arm, 18-month enrollment period, 12 months of additional follow -up, and a 15% dropout rate. With a total of approximately 1100 patients (metastatic or non -metastatic) randomized into the study including approximately 138 Chinese patients, it is anticipated to observe approximately 149 confirmed castration -resistant even ts (PSA progression while castrated or deaths due to any cause). Assuming an 18-month enrollment period, 12 months of additional follow-up, and a 10% dropout rate, the study will provide approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 ( relugolix versus leuprolide acetate) with a two -sided type I error of 5%.

Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the US [ Greenlee, 2001] and Europe [ Ferlay , 2012]. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years, and diagnosis before the age of 40 y ears is rare [Cersosimo , 1996]. In Japanese men, prostate cancer was the fourth leading cancer diagnosis in 2007 [Foundation for Promotion of Cancer Research, 2012]. The incidence of invasive prostate cancer increases with age; a clear increase is seen among men aged 60 years or older [Siegel , 2014]. If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland, or prostatectomy, or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses aft er prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as either: PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. The cure rate following surgery, depending on the stage of the cancer, is about 70% overall and, following radiation, about 50% to 60%. Approximately 25% to 30% of men will, therefore, progress to advanced disease, excluding those with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Androgens, such as testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone, are strong tumor promoters for prostate cance r [Bosland, 2014]. Through the androgen receptor, they synergistically augment the effect of other tumor promoters or carcinogens. Although prostate cancer is driven by presumed mutations in other tumor promoting pathways and/or by translocations leading to aberrant activation of the androgen receptor pathway, most early- stage prostate cancer cells remain either sensitive to or dependent upon circulating androgens. Thus, for more than 60 years, androgen deprivation therapy with surgical or medical castration has been the foundational therapy for either advanced inoperable or metastatic cancer. Increasingly, androgen deprivation therapy is used earlier as a neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment to radiation therapy or for biochemical or clinical relapse after local therapies of curative or palliative intent. Mo re than 80% of men with progressive or advanced disease initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy with varying degrees of tumor regression or stabilization [Kreis , 1995]. The duration and depth of response to androgen deprivation therapy is presumably dependent on the underlying tumor biology and burden. Thus, patients with metastases respond for an average of 2 year s before any biochemical evidence of castration -resistance occurs. By contrast, patients with biochemical -only evidence of progressive disease may respond to androgen deprivation therapy for 5 years or more [Klotz , 2015]. Currently, most patients in developed countries receive medical rather than surgical castration. GnRH (or LH-releasing hormone) agonists (ie, long- acting leuprolide acetate depot injections) are the current mainstay of medical castration, causing l ong-term desensitization and down regulation of the hypothalamic -pituitary gonadal axis. One disadvantage of the agonist form of GnRH is the initial stimulation of the axis lasting 1 to 3 weeks that occurs prior to desensitization. This results in a rise in LH and testosterone levels and an increase in clinical symptoms. In addition, at the time of repeat injection of GnRH agonist depot, microsurges of Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 332 CONFIDENTIAL"
333,page_333,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 3, 23 October 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 29 CONFIDENTIAL LH and testosterone may occur, although the apparent incidence is low [ Klotz , 2008]. The initial flare response may be managed with simultaneous antiandrogen administration, such as with bicalutamide . Recently, GnRH antagonists, in particular degarelix, [Firmagon , 2016], hav e become available as an alternative form of medical castration. Degarelix, an injectable peptide, has been approved in some countries for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer . As a GnRH antagonist, degarelix achieves medical castratio n and PSA response with no initial agonist activity within the first 1 to 2 weeks of administration, and effectively can obviate the need for concomitant antiandrogen treatment. Post- hoc analyses of degarelix trials [Tombal, 2010] suggest that it may have additional advantages regarding disease response or secondary relapse; however, such differences require confirmation in prospective studies. Because of the need for monthly depot injections, with large volumes and accompanying local reactions, the use of degarelix in clinical practice has remained low. Relugolix , previously known as TAK-385, is a potent and highly selective oral small molecule antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. For patients, relugolix may offer the advantages conferred by a direct receptor antagonist, including a more rapid onset of action and the absence of clinical flare or worsening of symptoms from the initial rise in androgens caused by GnRH agonists, as well as having the added convenience and relative comfort of oral dosing. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The proposed dose of relugolix is 120 mg administered orally once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120-mg tablets) on Day 1. 2.2.2. Pharmacology Relugolix is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective, high -affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH . Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotrophin- secreting cells of the ant erior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH- stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH fall rapidly, followed by a decline over a few days in testo sterone in men and estradiol and progesterone levels in women. Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50 -fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock -in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relug olix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 333 CONFIDENTIAL"

Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic- pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher. 2.2.3. Nonclinical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugolix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in rats (≥ 1000 mg/kg/da y), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no-observed- effect level for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day, and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg/kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (area under the concentration -time curve [ AUC ]) in men receiving 120 mg once daily (0. 469 μg⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL ( 15 mg/kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg·hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mouse and rat studies. Embryo-fetal death was observed only in relugolix- treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg/kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human Thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg ( C max of 0.181 µg/mL). 2.2.4. Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studies evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of relugolix, including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks.

Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in ra pid, dose-dependent suppression of testosterone in male subjects and estradiol in female subjects. After oral administration, the absolute bioavailability of relugolix was 12% (range 6 to 25%) with a predominant elimination half-life of 37 to 42 hours. In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The PK and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated and appear to be similar in Western and Asian volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Asian volunteers. A relative bioavailability and food effect study was conducted using the global phase 3 prostate cancer formulation of 120 mg relugolix. A fter administration with a high -fat, high -calorie breakfast, the C max and AUC of relugolix were reduced, on average, by 21.4% and 18.8%, respectively. In the phase 1 study C27001, serum LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and testosterone concentrations were determined in healthy men following single and multiple oral doses of relugolix or placebo for up to 28 days. Loading doses of ≥ 160 mg on Day 1 were used to shorten the time to testosterone suppression. Relugolix caused an immediate and effective suppression of LH, FSH, and te stosterone. After 14 days of once daily dosing, mean LH and serum testosterone concentration profiles were similar for the 40, 80, and 180 mg relugolix dose cohorts. LH, FSH, and testosterone concentrations began decreasing 2 to 6 hours postdose on Day 1 a nd remained suppressed through Day 14. However, the relugolix once daily maintenance dose was a major determinant of sustained testosterone suppression. Profound castration (defined as average testosterone levels < 20 ng/dL or 0.7 nmol/L) was achieved with 40, 80, or 180 mg once daily for 14 days; however, 20 mg once daily was insufficient in maintaining adequate suppression of serum LH and testosterone concentration levels during the second week. In healthy, older men receiving 14 or 28 days of dosing, e ffective castration was consistently achieved over 14 and 28 days dosing at daily doses of 40 to 180 mg (14 days) and 80 to 160 mg (28 days). Use of a loading dose for up to 3 days (or once daily doses of ≥ 160 mg) resulted in castration levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL or 1.7 nmol/L) within 24 to 48 hours. Results obtained after 28 days of dosing suggested that the likely minimal, fully effective maintenance dose for sustained castration would be relugolix ≥ 80 mg once daily. Doses of 80 mg and 120 mg were moved forward into phase 2 development. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal), as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption by approximately 20%. The exposure of relugolix is increased b y inhibitors of P-glycoprotein up to 6-fold, but relugolix does not significantly impact the exposure of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2C9, 2D6, or 3A4 substrates. In a dedicated study, relugolix did not prolong QTc at single doses of 60 or 360 mg . 2.2.4.2.

The study consists of a dose-rising phase (Part A) and an expansion phase (Part B). In Part A, a loading dose of relugolix (320 or 360 mg) was administered on Day 1 followed by once daily dosing on Days 2 through 28, with the dosage dependent on the individual cohort of 3 to 4 patients each. In Part B, 30 patients receive a maximum of 96 weeks treatment at doses of 80 and 120 mg once daily (N = 15 each arm, loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1). Testosterone reduction by both doses of relugolix was rapid and sustained through 48 weeks. Both the 80- and 120- mg once daily doses were evaluated in phase 2 clinical studies. Study C27003 is a phase 2 study that enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring 6 months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg on ce daily following a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every 4 weeks following a single loading dose of 240 mg (N = 38) for 24 weeks. External beam radiation therapy was initiated for most patients between Week 13 and Week 15. Relugolix 120 mg administered orally once daily rapidly suppressed testosterone levels below the castration threshold (50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) within the first week of therapy and maintained those levels from the end of Week 4 through at least 24 weeks. The levels of testosterone suppression achieved by relugolix were similar to those achieved by monthly injections of degarelix. Profound castration rates below the lower testosterone threshold of < 20 ng/dL (0.7 nmol/L) were also similar in the relugolix and degarelix groups (Table 2-1).

Study C27002 is a phase 2 study of relugolix and leuprolide acetate in patients with prost ate cancer who require first-line androgen deprivation therapy, which is ongoing in North America. This study was designed to help plan the population, dosing, and assessment schedules for phase 3 studies in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Eligible patients in C27002 have evidence of advanced prostate cancer including either: 1) PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; 2) newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or 3) advanced localized diseas e for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated. In this open-label, parallel group study, patients we re randomized to receive 1 of 2 dose levels of oral relugolix (80 or 120 mg [patients randomized to relugolix received a loading dose of 320 mg on Day 1], N = 50 per group) or to an observation cohort to receive standard GnRH therapy with leuprolide acetate 22. 5 mg administered by intramuscular injection every 12 weeks ( N = 25).

Clinical Safety of Relu golix in Men with Prostate Cancer A full description of the safety data for relugolix from clinical trials is available in th e Investigator Brochure. Overall, approximately 632 healthy volunteers (330 women, 302 men), 535 female patients with uterine fibr oids (N = 229) or endometriosis (N = 306), and 218 male patients with prostate cancer received at least 1 dose of relugolix. Data from the 175 patients with prostate cancer who received relugolix in randomized, open -label, parallel -group phase 2 studies, C27002 and C27003, provide the basis for the frequency of expected adverse events associated with relugolix in the prostate cancer indication. The adverse drug reactions in the prostate cancer indication observed in the phase 2 studies include hot flush (59%), fatigue (26%), arthralgia (10%), nausea (5%), and gynecomastia (3%). No clinical evidence of PLD has observed in any relugolix clinical study. Leuprolide Acetate 3 -Month Depot Leuprolide acetate depot is indicated for the palliative treatment of adv anced prostatic cancer. Leupro lide acetate acts as an agonist at pituitary GnRH (gonadotropin- releasing hormone) receptors. Leupro lide acetate has greater receptor affinity, reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and is approximately 100-fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin- producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and FSH, which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leyd ig cells. Initially, leuprolide acetate stimulates LH production, which in turn causes a surge of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for 5 to 12 days before the ultimate inhibition of LH. This androgen surge of male hormones can cause a flare reaction (“clinical flare”), which may lead to an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [Tolis , 1982; Schally , 1980; Waxman , 1985; Conn, 1991; Limonata , 2001]. Chronic stimulation by the GnRH agonist ultimately desensitizes the GnRH receptors, downregulating the secretion of gonadotropins, LH, and FSH, leading to hypogonadism and thus a dramatic reduction in testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, on which continued growth of prostate cancer cells depends. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate level s within 3 to 4 weeks after the start of treatment. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels. The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible over time upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors. The flare phenomenon can be effectively prevented with antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [Loblaw, 2004] . First generation antiandrogens such as flutamide, bicalutamide, and nilutamide bind to androgen receptors and competitively inhibit their interaction with testosterone a nd dihydrotestosterone. They are often used in an attempt to limit the clinical sequelae produced by th e hormonal surge resulting from GnRH agonist treatment .

STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS This phase 3 trial has 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit as listed briefly below and described in detail in the statistical analysis plan. Patients enrolled into this phase 3 trial will be ran domized 2:1 to either relugolix 120 mg once daily following an oral loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1, or to leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg Japan, Taiwan, and China) 3- M depot injection . Patients randomized to leuprolide acetate will also receive an antiandrogen if indicated at the discretion of the investigator. The first criterion for the primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate only patients randomized to relugolix . The second criterion for the primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate the non-inferiority of patients randomized to relugolix to those randomized to leuprolide acetate as described below.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1. Overall Study Design The HERO study is a phase 3 multinational randomized, open- label, parallel -group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix in patients with androgen -sensitive advanced prostate cancer who require at leas t 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy. Relugolix is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist that lowers testosterone by inhibiting pituitary release of follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide acetate depot suspension 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ) every 3 -months (3- M) will be administered Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 344 CONFIDENTIAL"

This study will evaluate the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels ( ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) for 48 weeks in patients with androgen- sensi tive advanced prostate cancer. To be eligible for the study, a patient must be, in the opinion of the investigator, a candidate for at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for the management of androgen- sensitive advanced prostate cancer and must not be a candidate for surgical therapy. Eligible patients include those with evidence of biochemical relapse (rising PSA) following local primary intervention with curative in tent, newly diagnosed metastatic disease (excluding metastases to the brain), and/or advanced localized disease. Patients may receive radiotherapy, cryotherapy or high frequency ultrasound no sooner than 2 months after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients may be included if they have not previously received androgen deprivation therapy for more than 1 8 months, and if the androgen deprivation therapy was completed at least 3 months prior to baseline. If the dosing interval of the depot is longer than 3 months, then the prior androgen deprivation therapy must have been completed at least as long as the dosing interval of the depot. Patients previously treated with taxanes or expected to receive taxanes after initiation of androgen deprivati on therapy are excluded, as are patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy adjuvant or neoadjuvant to radiotherapy as primary definitive therapy. Baseline serum testosterone must be ≥ 150 ng/ dL (1.50 ng/mL or 5.2 nmol/L) to be enrolled. Patients enro lled in this study will be randomized 2:1 to receive oral relugolix 120 mg once daily following a loading dose of 360 mg on Day 1 or 3-M depot of leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg in Japan, Taiwan, and China ). After randomization, patients in the le uprolide acetate arm may receive an antiandrogen for the first 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. Randomization will be stratified by geographic region, presence of metastatic disease (metastases in regional lymph node[s] are considered N1 and will, therefore, be stratified as non- metastatic ), and age. A total of approximately 1100 patients from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region are planned to be enrolled in this study, including approximately 390 patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer and approximately 138 Chinese patients (enrolled in China and Taiwan). The study includes a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a Treatment Period of 48 weeks, and a Follow-up Period of up to 90 days. Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns as needed. Eligible patients will receive study treatment for 48 weeks. During that time, testosterone and PSA will be assessed monthly and patient-reported outcomes ( EORTC -QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ -PR25, EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L) will be assessed approximately every 3 months during the Treatment Period and more frequently during the Follow-up Period. Additional serum endocrine eval uations will include: LH, FSH, dihydrotestosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin. Relugolix PK samples will be collected throughout the study. Full PK profiles will be determined in a subset of patients in China and Japan. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead ECG, and visual acuity tests. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to cast rate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should be encouraged to remain on study and, if indicated, may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator.

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is designed to establish the safety and efficacy of re lugolix 120 mg orally once daily in men with advanced prostate cancer who require at least 1 year of continuous androgen deprivation therapy for androgen -sensitive disease. This study will focus on the primary objective of evaluating the ability of relugolix to achieve and maintain suppression of serum testosterone to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) in patients with advanced prostate cancer. During the Treatment Period of the study (Day 1 to Week 49 [Study Day 337]), patients will be randomized to one of the study treatment arms: oral l oading dose of relugolix (360 mg) followed by 120 mg once daily of relugoli x or leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection of 22.5 mg (or 11.25 mg Japan, Taiwan, and China) at 12 -week intervals for 48 weeks . Patients treated with leuprolide acetate will a lso receive an antiandrogen for 4 weeks or longer if indicated in the opinion of the investigator. The study is designed to allow for global approvals, however, different regulatory agencies require different criteria for the demonstration of efficacy. The United States (US) Food and Drug Admin istration (FDA) requires , for approval , a primary efficacy criterion to determine whether the sustained castration rate (defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 346 CONFIDENTIAL"

The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion. The study includes a leuprolide acetate arm to meet the regulatory requirement of other regions to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3- M depot injection as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority margin of -10% to meet this criterion. In amendment 3, an additional secondary endpoint of TCR is included in the final analysis . TCR is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of PSA progression while castrated (PSA progression is defined by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3 guidelines [Scher , 2016] as the first increase in PSA of 25% or greater and 2 ng/mL or greater above the nadir with confirmat ion by a second PSA measurement at least 3 weeks later ; for patients without declining PSA from baseline, PSA increase of 25% or greater and 2 ng/mL from baseline beyond 12 weeks will be considered PSA progression) or deaths due any reasons . PSA progressi on is indicative of castration -resistance, the onset of which signals a higher risk of negative clinical outcomes in prostate cancer. It has been shown that patients with low FSH levels have significantly longer TCR [Hoare, 2015]. Furthermore, prior GnRH receptor antagonist treatment has demonstrated an increased sustained suppression of FSH, compared with a GnRH receptor agonist, and a 45% reduction in risk of castration- resistance events at 1 year (HR = 0.55) [ Crawford , 2011]. In previous clinical trials , relugolix was associated with greater suppression of FSH than leuprolide. This endpoint is regarded as clinically meaningful by both patients and physicians and is an independent predictor of survival [Williams , 2004; Hussain , 2006; Hussain , 2009; Proust Lima , 2008]. To further explore the potential for relugolix to delay the TCR , this protocol is being amended so that additional patients with metastatic advanced prostate cancer will be enrolled (to enroll approximately 390 metastatic patients). The choice to enrich the study with metastatic patients is due to a higher incidence of castration -resistance (PSA progression) in patients with metastatic disease. The dose of relugolix selected is based on data from phase 1 and 2 studies demonstrating that oral doses of 80 mg and 120 mg once daily following an oral loading dose of 320 mg were able to suppress testosterone to castrate level s (see Section 2.2.4.2 and the Inves tigator Brochure). A loading dose of 360 mg ( three 120- mg tablets) was selected for phase 3 so that only one tablet size was required. Leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot injection was selected as the comparator as this is the GnRH agonist used most commonly as standard of care in the population under evaluation. Degarelix, an injectable GnRH antagonist , was considered, but was not used as it has limited market uptake attributed at least in part to a significant number of injection site reactions. 4.3. Selection of Study Population Approximately 1100 men with advanced prostate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy will be enrolled in this study from approximately 200 study centers in North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region . Enrollment is defined as the time at which a patient i s randomized to a treatment group and receives at least one dose of study drug.

Screening Screening numbers will be assigned to each patient who signs an informed consent form and begins the Screening Period. Study site personnel will access the interactive voice/web recognition system (I WRS) to assign a screening identification number to a potential patient. For patients who provide informed consent and subsequently do not meet eligibility criteria, or withdraw consent are considered screen failures and are not randomized. Study site personnel should ensure that the source record includes documentation for the screen failure (eg, medical history, eligibility criteria, procedures performed). Patient numbers assigned to patients who become screen failures are not to be reused. Patient identification numbers will be assigned to eligible patients at randomization, as described in Section 4.6. 4.6. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Group and Patient Identification Number After a patient is screened and the investigator determines that the patient is eligible for enrollment, the site staff will complete the Randomization Authorization Form and send it to the sponsor ( Myovant Sciences GmbH ) or sponsor designee per the instructions in the investigator site file . The sponsor (or designee) will approve the patient’s enrollment in writing. Once the site has received approval, the patient may undergo the Baseline Day 1 v isit.

Removal of Patients from Therapy Patients may withdraw consent to participate in the study and discontinue treatment at any time for any reason. Investigators or the m edical monitor may remove patients from therapy under this protocol for reasons of safety and/or lack of compliance as discussed below. Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Week 49 visit on the Schedule of Activities . The End of Treatment is defined as the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks after the last leuprolide acetate injection . Follow-up visits to assess safety will be performed in all study patients. If the patient plans to start alternative androgen deprivation therapy less than 30 days after the End of Treatment visit, the Safety Follow -up visit may occur earlier, before the start of the alternative androgen deprivation therapy. Testosterone recovery will be evaluated in approximately 100 patients randomized to relugolix and approximately 50 patients to leuprolide acetate who complete 48 weeks of study drug treatment and, in the opinion of the investigator, are candidates for intermittent androgen deprivation therapy and will not be offered alternative androgen deprivation therapy upon completion of study therapy. The se patients will return for the 60- and 90-day follow -up Testosterone Recovery visits.

The site should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patient can and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. Patients randomized to relugolix should be counseled to notify the investigator in the event of intercurrent illness to determine if the study drug treatment can be continued. Every effort should be made to ensure the patient’s compliance with study drug treatment, including calling patients to reschedule missed visits. In cases where the patient does not return for the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain contact with the patient. The site should attempt at least 3 documented telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address so that they can appropriately be withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up.” 4.8. Contraception/Pregnancy Avoidance It is not known what effects relugolix has on human pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus. Therefore, male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner. A patient must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman. Patients must not donate sperm from first dose of study drug through 4 months after the last dose of study drug. Nonsterilized male patients should use a male condom, either alone or in addition to effective methods of contraception used by a female partner of childbearing potential, through defined periods during and after study treatment as specified below. Examples of effective contraceptive methods include condoms, hormonal contraceptives, and intrauterine devices. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, statu s postvasectomy) must agree to one of the following: • Use a male condom if having sex with a woman of childbearing age or a pregnant woman, during the entire study T reatment Period and through 4 months after the last dose of study drug; or • Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the female partner, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. 5. TREATMENTS 5.1.

High -Dose Biotin Supplements In November 2017, the FDA issued a safety communication on biotin inte rference intended for healthcare professionals [FDA , 2017]. Briefly, the communication made the following recommendations: • Talk to your patients about any biotin supplements they may be taking, including supplements marketed for hair, skin, and nail growth. • Be aware that many laboratory tests, including but not limited to cardiovascular diagnostic tests and hormone tests, that use biotin technology are potentially affected, and incorrect test results may be generated i f there is biotin in the patient’s specimen. • Communicate to the lab oratory conducting the testing if your patient is taking biotin. • If a lab oratory test result doesn’t match the clinical presentation of your patient, consider biotin interference as a possi ble source of error. • Know that biotin is found in multivitamins, including prenatal multivitamins, biotin supplements, and dietary supplements for hair, skin, and nail growth in levels that may interfere with lab oratory tests. • Report to the laboratory test manufacturer and the FDA if you become aware of a patient experiencing an adverse event following potentially incorrect laboratory test results due to biotin interference. A threshold ‘high level’ biotin dose has not yet been defined by FDA. Study Investi gators should discuss with study patients about any biotin supplements they may be taking. For patients taking biotin supplements, the investigator should assess if it is possible to discontinue use of these supplements. In cases where the investigator b elieve s a patient is taking high doses of biotin and discontinuation of this supplementation is not in the best interest of the patient , the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to assess the potential impact on study laboratory test result s. 5.10.2. Permitted Medications All concomitant medications used during the study will be recorded. At a minimum, the drug generic name, dose amount, route of administration, start date, and stop date will be recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. If alternative androgen deprivation therapy is initiated prior to 30 days after the last relugolix dose, record the alternative androgen deprivation therapy as a concomitant medication. Patients with disease progression during the treatment period, in the setting of testosterone suppression to castrate levels (≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]), should be encouraged to remain on study and, if indicated, may receive radiotherapy as prescribed by the investigator. In the setting of rising PSA patients may also receive enzalutamide after the confirmation of PSA progression.

Testosterone will be assayed using a liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry method sensitive at least as low as 5 ng/dL (0.17 nmol/L) for all measurements. Between Week 5 and Week 49 visits (inclusive), testosterone samples that are above castrate level (> 50 ng/dL) will be reported to the investigator at the respective study site . Testosterone samples may be subject to reanalysis by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and/or immunoassay sensitive to at least as low as 10 ng/dL. Instructions for collection and processing of blood specimens are provided in the investigator site file. 6.6.1.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample Collection Relugolix Pharmacokinetic samples will only be collected in patient s randomized to relugolix study drug. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of relugolix will be collected at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1 ). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients may take their dose of study drug in the clinic at these visits. Study drug will be administered on an empty stomach or at least 2 hours before food, and food will be withheld for 1 hour after dosing. The date and time of their previous dose of study drug (ie, the dose the day before the clinic visit) will be accurately recorded. Ideally, predose samples should be collected approximately 24 hours (±6 hours) after the previous dose of relugolix, although samples collected outside of this window would not be considered a protocol deviation. If the study patient inadvertently took the study drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the date and time of that dose should also be accurately recorded and the PK sample collected, which may be used for population PK modeling. Plasma from the Week 5 and Week 13 visits in all patients will be analyzed for relugolix plasma concentration. Analysis of other individual patient plasma samples will be performed on a case- by-case basis (such as those patients with non -castrate testosterone levels). Collection, processing, storage, and shipping instructions will be provided in the investigator site file. Plasma analysis of relugolix will be performed by the sponsor (or designee). Leuprolide Acetate For patients on leuprolide acetate, in the event of non -castrate testosterone levels, a blood sample may be taken for potential analysis of leuprolide acetate plasma concentration, following discussion with the medical monitor Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 368 CONFIDENTIAL"

The actual date and time of study drug administration and the date and time of each PK sample will be accurately recorded. All samples from the China and Japan subset will be analyzed for plasma relugolix concentrations. Collection, processing, storage, and shipping instructions will be provided in the investigator site file. Plasma analysis of relugolix will be performed by the sponsor (or designee). 6.6.1.3. Pharmacogenomic s Sample Collection Whole Blood Sample for Germline Deoxyribonucleic Acid Pharmacogenomic analysis may be conducted to examine the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. P articipation of study patients in pharmacogenomic sample collection is optional. A pha rmacogenomics sample will be collected from patients at all participating study centers, with individual patient consent and per local ethics and regulatory standards. The sample will be retained for germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of potent ial genetic determinants of drug safety, drug efficacy or disease response, and drug metabolism. Every patient must sign informed consent/be consented in order to participate in the sampling of whole blood for DNA analysis. This research may be used to develop a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of relugolix and other study drugs, to increase understanding of the disease/condition being studied, and for improving the efficiency, design and study methods of future research studies. Two venous whole blood sample (4 mL per sample) for the analysis of germline DNA will be collected at Day 1 from all patients who have provided informed consent . The DNA sample s are expected to be collected at the Day 1 visit, but if necessary, may be collected at any visit after randomization. If necessary and feasible, a second aliquot of blood may be taken if isolation of DNA from the first sample was not successful or possible. Germline DNA analysis may be conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variance on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safety. As pharmacogenomics is an evolving science, currently many genes and their function are not yet fully understood. Future data may suggest a role of some of these genes in drug response or diseases, which may lead to additional hypothesis- generating exploratory research on stored samples. Individual blood samples for germline DNA analysis, including the result of any analyses and corresponding information will be identified only by a code in a computer database. The whole blood samples for DNA analysis will be stored securely at the sponsor’s location or its designated central laboratory vendor until 10 years after completion of this study (HERO, MVT -601-3201) and/or until the drug development of relugolix is no longer actively pursued by Myovant or its collaborators. The storage period for these samples may be adjusted by country in accordance with local regulatory and/or legal requirements for the storage of research samples.

After that time, the samples will be properly destroyed by the central laboratory or designee following approval by the sponsor. The investigator will keep records linking the patient identity with the samples for the time required by applicable law. Patients who consent and provide a pharmacogenomic sample for DNA analysis can withdraw their consent and request disposal of a stored sample at any time. Directions for sample collection and handling can be found in the investigator site file . 6.6.1.4. Quality of Life European Quality of Life 5- Dimension 5 -Level Assessment The EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L comprises 5 scales and an overall assessment of health status on a visual analogue scale (Appendix 2) . The 5 scales include: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression. The original version, the EQ-5D-3L, incl udes 3 response options for each scale. However, a new 5 level -response-option version, the EQ-5D-5L, has been developed with the following response options: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. It is believed that the EQ -5D-5L is superior to the EQ- 5D-3L in terms of feasibility, ceiling effects, discriminatory power, and convergent validity. The EQ-5D- 5L index values will be calculated from the EQ -5D-5L descriptive system scores based on the Crosswalk value sets [Eligard , 2016; EuroQol Group, 1990; Brooks, 1996; Herdman , 2011; Janssen , 2013]. European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Assessments The EORTC -QLQ -C30 [ Fayers , 2001; Fayers , 2002] (Appendix 3) and the 25- item prostate cancer module EORTC -QLQ -PR25 [Spry, 2006] (Appendix 4) will be administered as specified in the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.1). The EORTC QLQ -C30 core measurement will be used to capture distal outcomes, including physical, social functioning, and overall health- related quality of life. The QLQ -C30 core questionnaire incorporates 30 questions comprising 9 multi- item scales: 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality of life scale. Several single -item symptom measures are also included. It is a reliable and valid measure of health- related quality of life in patients with cancer and takes about 11 minutes to administer. The instrument has been validated and used in many countries [ Aaron son, 1993]. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 is the 25-item Prostate Cancer module (P25) of the EORTC. The EORTC -QLQ -PR25 contains 3 additional symptom scales (urinary, bowel, sexual) and 5 treatment -related items. 6.6.2. Safety -Related Procedures 6.6.2.1. Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index Height and weight will be measured during screening (within 28 days before the first dose of study drug).

Patients should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes removed. 6.6.2.2. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements include temperature, pulse rate, and seated measurement of diastolic and systolic blood pressure. For each patient, temperature should be recorded using the same modality throughout the entire study. Patients should be sitting at rest for 5 minutes before blood pressure is measured. When vital sign measurements are scheduled at the same time as an ECG and blood draw, the vital signs, when possible, will be obtained immediately prior to the ECG and blood draw, and the blood draw will be collected at the scheduled time. 6.6.2.3. Physical Exams and Visual Acuity A complete physical examination will include head, e ars, eyes, nose, mouth, thyroid, skin, heart, and lung examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, skeletal, and neurological systems. All subsequent physical examinations should focus on signs and symptoms reported by the patient to assess for clinically significant changes from the baseline assessment. Visual acuity will be evaluated at Screening, Week 25 , and Week 49 by a standard visual eye chart. Presenting visual acuity must be assessed with the supplied study eye chart. If the patient uses corrective lenses, he should wear his usual prescription glasses or contact lenses during the assessment, and the same prescription lenses should be worn at subsequent visual testing, as possible. Perform the visual acuity testing using the entire eye chart. D o not stop at a visual acuity of 100 – continue as far as the patient can go per the testing instructions (see the investigator site file for additional details). Patients whose presenting visual acuity score is 90 or lower at the screening visit should be encouraged to obtain a diagnostic evaluation from an eye care provider (ie, an ophthalmologist or an optometrist). Any findings (ie, diagnoses) from the eye examination should be recorded as medical history. Patients whose presenting visual acuity score at Week 25, Week 49, or Early Termination has decreased by 10 or more points from the screening visit must be referred to an ophthalmologist for a diagnostic evaluation. A copy of the ophthalmology consultation must be submitted to the sponsor. 6.6.2.4. Clinical Laboratory Samples All protocol-required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the investigator site file and the protocol Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.1). Laboratory requisition forms must be completed and samples mus t be clearly labelled with the p atient ID number, protocol number, site/center number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided. Reference ranges for all safety parameters will be provided to the site by the central laboratory.

Radiologic Assessment CT imaging or MRI of the abdominopelvic region with contrast (except where contrast is medically contraindicated) and a bone scan must be obtained prior to randomization for each patient to determine the presence or absence of metastatic disease ( metastases in regional lymph node[s] are considered N1 and will, therefore, be stratified as non- metastatic ). The scans should be read locally and do not need to be repeated if a scan exists within 60 days prior to the Baseline Day 1 visit. However, if CT or MRI demonstrates presence of metastatic disease, a bone scan is not required. If metastatic disease is not present on CT or MRI, then a bone scan is also required. Radiologic assessment is not included as part of the Schedule of Activities after randomization . 6.7. Biological Sample Retention and Destruction Biological samples present at the conclusion of this study may be retained in storage by the sponsor for a period up to 10 years for purposes of this study. Exploratory testing for markers of cardiovascular disease, including tests such as plasma N- terminal pro - brain natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP) or markers for isch emia, may be conducted using stored samples from patients who provided consent for this testing, to explore whether there are differences in measures of cardiovascular function between patients treated with relugolix and patients treated with leuprolide, to inform future studies. Samples of 8 mL of whole blood for pharmacogenomics testing (see Section 6.6.1.3 ) will be collected. The need to conduct pharmacogenomic analysis may be identified after this study Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 373 CONFIDENTIAL"

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations including visual acuity assessment , vital signs , weight, ECGs, and clinical laboratory tests. 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre -existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the st udy; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately); and • An investigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms; o Requires active intervention; or o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet the definition of an adverse event include: o Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event; o The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression; o Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug administration that do not worsen; and o Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitalization for an elective procedure, with elective def ined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent).

375,page_375,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 3, 23 October 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 71 CONFIDENTIAL Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the investigator and graded according to CTCAE (Appendix 5) . Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are “intermittent”. All other events are “continuous”. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted ; however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 10 days for evaluation and treatment of an adverse event. The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is life -threatening ; NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an even t in which the study patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Important medical events that jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events a re invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to regulatory authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local I RB/I EC. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious adverse events. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient’s answers to the EQ-5D- 5L will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse events, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow-up with the patient for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow-up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow- up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented o n the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overd ose and pregnancy in a partner will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively . 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will be colle cted from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Safety Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first. Serious adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form until the Safety F ollow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of relugolix or 12 weeks plus 30 days after the last leuprolide acetate injection , or the date of initiation of another Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 376 CONFIDENTIAL"

Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. Any event occurring between signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug w ill be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who continues to meet eligibility criteria and proceeds to dosing with study drug; the exception to this includes procedure- related pretreatment -emergent events which s hould be recorded as adverse events in the electronic data capture (EDC) system for those patients who remain eligible for study participation . 7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The definitions in Table 7-1 are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug . Table 7-1 Causal Relationship to Study Drug Relationship Criteria Probable A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on re-administration (re-challenge) or withdrawal (de- challenge). Possible A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a rea sonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory test abno rmality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record. In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Sever ity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken. Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 377 CONFIDENTIAL"

Hepatic enzyme increases, considered an important potential risk of treatment with relugolix, are closely monitored in accordance with FDA guidelines for assessing drug - induced liver injury [ FDA , 2009] in all relugolix studies. Exclusion criteria for AST and ALT > ULN; total bilirubin values > ULN unless consistent with Gilbert’s syndrome. Liver chemistry will be monitored during the study. Appropriate liver stopping criteria and follow-up procedures are detailed in Section 7.5.2. Phospholipidosis Data from nonclinical studies in rats and monkeys showed histopathological changes consist ent with PLD. PLD by itself is not adverse. No clinical evidence of relugolix- related PLD -associated toxicity has been observed nor was there a clinically meaningful increase in a biomarker of PLD assessed in phase 2 clinical studies. Patients with significant underlying medical conditions are excluded. Routine safety monitoring including laboratory assessments, ECGs, and assessment of adverse events; visual acuity will be evaluated during the study. Risks Associated with Medical Castration Acute and sub sequent chronic symptoms of medical castration (reduction of testosterone to ≤ 50 ng/dL [1.7 nmol/L]) include vasomotor symptoms or hot flushes, disturbed sleep related to vasomotor symptoms, decreased libido, and fatigue or loss of energy. These side effects are usually not severe and can be managed with anticipatory guidance. Long- term suppression of testosterone is associated with well- characterized risks including bone loss, decreased muscle mass, possible changes in insulin sensitivity with increased risk of diabetes, altered lipid metabolism, and possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease [ Oefelein , 2002; Lopez , 2005; Diam ond,1998; Keating , 2006; Braga - Basaria , 2006; Saigal , 2007; Tsai, 2007; D'Amico , 2007; Efstathiou , 2009]. - Effects can usually be managed with appropriate anticipatory guidance (eg, diet and exercise programs) or supportive therapy when required (e g, lipid-lowering or bone- sparing agents). Metabolic Changes Metabolic changes (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and increased weight) with increased risk of diabetes are a potential risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix. - Fasting lipids and glucose will be monitored during the study.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES A statistical analysis plan will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for this study. The statistical analysis plan will be prepared and finalized before database lock for the primary analysis. There will be two analyses for the study, a primary analysis and a final analysis. The primary analysis of efficacy and safety will occur after approximately the first 915 patients have been randomized to the study and have had the opportunity to be evaluated for 48 weeks and complete the 30-day safety follow-up visit or discontinued early. The secondary analysis will occur after approximately 390 metastatic patients have been to the study and have had the opportunity to be evaluated for 48 weeks of study treatment and complete the 30-day safety follow-up visit. TCR in the subgroup of metastatic patients and the extended ITT population will be analyzed only at the time of the final analysis. All confidence intervals will be 2 -sided at an alpha level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified. The methodology to be used to maintain a study- wide type I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan . All efficacy and safety measures over the course of the study will be presented. Continuous data will be summariz ed by means, standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patients.

Randomization Methods Central randomization will be used and treatment allocation will be 2:1, relugolix to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot. Randomization will be stratified by the following factors : • Geographic Region: North and South America versus Europe versus Asia and Rest of World ; • Presence of Metastatic Disease (metastases in regional lymph node[s] are con sidered N1 and will, therefore, be stratified as non- metastatic ): yes versus no; • Baseline Age: ≤ 75 years old versus > 75 years old. Stratified efficacy analyses will incorporate these 3 stratification factors unless otherwise specified. After the first 915 patients are enrolled, enrollment in China will continue for metastatic and non-metastatic patients until the target number of Chinese patients is reached (138 patients). In the rest of the world, only metastatic patients will continue to be e nrolled until approximately 390 metastatic patients are accrued . 9.2. Analysis Populations The Intent -To-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all patients randomized to treatment who have taken at least one dose of study treatment . This will be the primary populatio n used for the efficacy analysis. Patients will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment. The Per -Protocol population will consist of those members of the ITT population who have no major protocol deviations as defined in the statistical analysis plan , considering the following protocol deviations but not limited to : • Those who entered the study even though they did not satisfy the entry criteria; • Those who developed withdrawal criteria during the study but were not withdrawn; • Those who received the wrong treatment or incorrect dose; • Those who received an excluded concomitant treatment. The Per -Protocol population will not be analyzed if this population comprises more than 95% or less than 50% of the ITT population. The Per -Protocol population will be used as a sensitivity analysis of the ITT population for the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary endpoints. The Per-Protocol population will be identified prior to the database lock. The primary population for safety analyses will be the Safety population, defined as all patients who receive at least one dose of any study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment assignment.

Primary En dpoint Analys es The primary endpoint will be analyzed in the initial 915 patients enrolled to the study. The primary efficacy endpoint is the sustained castration rate, defined as the cumulative probability of testosterone suppression to ≤ 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) while on study treatment from Week 5 Day 1 (Study Day 29) through Week 49 (Study Day 337) . This probability will be estimated for each treatment group using the Kaplan -Meier method with the confidence interval calculated using the exponential Greenwood formula via log-log transformation of the survival function. Patients who discontinue treatment prior to observing a testosterone level > 50 ng/dL (1.7 nmol/L) will be censored at the last testosterone assessment prior to discontinu ation. Detailed censoring rules will be described in the statistical analysis plan . There are 2 separate evaluation criteria for the primary efficacy endpoint to support different regulatory requirements for assessing benefit: • Evaluation Criterion 1: to determine whether the sustained castration rate for relugolix is greater than or equal to 90%. T he lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression in the relugolix treatment group will be cal culated and must be greater than or equal to 90% to meet this criterion . • Evaluation Criterion 2: to establish the non-inferiority of relugolix compared to leuprolide acetate 3 -M depot as assessed by the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression. The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the cumulative probability of sustained testosterone suppression between the 2 treatment groups will be calculated and must be greater than or equal to the non- inferiority marg in of -10% to meet this criterion . The confidence interval of the treatment difference will be calculated using the formula 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)−𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆1�(𝑡𝑡)�+ 𝑉𝑉��𝑆𝑆2�(𝑡𝑡)� , where each of the variance of the Kaplan -Meier estimate will be calculated using the Greenwood's formula 𝑉𝑉 ��𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)�=𝑆𝑆̂(𝑡𝑡)2�∑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗�𝑛𝑛𝑗𝑗−𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗�𝑗𝑗:𝑡𝑡(𝑗𝑗)≤𝑡𝑡 � ; nj denote the number of patients at risk at time t (j) and d j denote the number of events observed at time t(j)) [Lachin , 2000]. The evaluation criteria used for the primary efficacy endpoint assessment will be determined by regional regulatory requirements and will be prespecified in separate regional statistical analysis plans. The 2-sided type I error rates for the final analyses will be controlled at 0.05 separately for each regional analysis. 9.3.2. Secondary Endpoint Analyses If the result of the primary endpoint is statistically significant, the secondary endpoints will be analyzed . The methods and procedures necessary to maintain a study- wide 2 -sided typ e I error rate of 0.05 across primary and secondary endpoi nt testing will be described in the statistical analysis plan .

Safety will be assessed by summarizing and analyzing adverse events , laboratory analytes, vital signs, ECG parameters, and concomit ant medications. The severity of all adverse events is to be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. All adverse events will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using MedDRA 19.1 or higher. The incidence of adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug treatment, and severity. A patient reporting the same adverse event more than once is counted once, and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to study drug treatment when calculating incidence. Laboratory data consist of chemistry, hematology, and hormonal tests. Only data collected by the central laboratory will be used for analyses. The National Cancer Institute CTCAE will be used to categorize toxicity grade for the laboratory parameters. Shift tables will be provided for each gradable parameter to summarize baseline toxicity grade versus post -baseline toxicity grade. For laboratory parameters that are not gradable by the CTCA E, a shift table based upon the normal range (low, normal, and high) will be provided for each parameter to summarize the baseline versus post- baseline results. 9.5.

The primary analysis will be performed separately for individual evaluation criterion using data colle cted through 48 weeks after enrollment of approximately 915 patients. Approximately 915 patients will be randomized in order to fulfill the regulatory requirements of all participating countries included in the primary efficacy endpoint of this study. The study is also powered for the secondary endpoint of TCR in the high-risk subgroup of metastatic patients. Approximately 107 confirmed castration -resistance events (PSA progressions while castrated or deaths due to any cause) will need to be observed (or approximately 390 metastatic patients will need to be enrolled) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 (relugolix versus leuprolide acetate) with 85% power with a two -sided type I error of 5%, assuming a castration -resistant event -free rate of 60% at 48 weeks for the control arm, an 18-month enrollment period, 12 months of additional follow-up, and a 15% dropout rate. With a total of approximately 1100 patients (metastatic or non -metastatic) randomized into the study including approximately 138 Chinese patients , it is anticipated to observe approximately 149 confirmed castration -resistant events (PSA progression while castrated or deaths due to any cause). Assuming an 18-month enrollment period, 12 months of additional follow-up, and a 10% dropout rate the study will provide approximately 85% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.6 (relugolix versus leuprolide acetate) with a two -sided type I error of 5%. 10. RESPONSIBILITIES 10.1. Investigator Responsibilities 10.1.1. Good Clinical Practice The investigator will ensure that this stud y is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant. For studies conducted under a US investigational new drug application, the i nvestigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) Part 312 , subpart D, “Responsibilities of sponsors and investigators,” 21 CFR Part 50, and 21 CFR Part 56, are adhered to. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR Part 54, is adhered to; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 390 CONFIDENTIAL"

This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator. The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study . 10.1.2. Institutional Review Board/Independe nt Ethics Committee Approval This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the patient (such as advertisements, patien t information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by the investigator to an IRB or IEC. Approval from the IRB or IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the c ommittee met and granted the approval. Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 10.1.3. Informed Consent A properly executed, written informed consent, in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH Good Clinical Practice , US CFR for Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50.25[a,b], CFR 50.27), and local regulations, will be obtained from each patient before entering the patient in the trial. The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study- related proced ures. The investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting written informed consent that contains all elements required by national, state, local , and institutional regulations or requirements . Each informed consent form will be appropriately signed and dated by the patien t or the patien t’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent. The investigator will provide copies of the signed informed consent form to each patient (or to the patient’s legal representatives) and will maintain the signed original document within the patient’s record file per local requirements. The investigator will also fully document the informed consent process in the patient’s source records. 10.1.4. Confidentiality The inves tigator must assure that patient s’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only patient number, date of birth, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or bi ological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory.

This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from the sponsor. The i nvestigato r further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: 1) Investigator’s study file: The investigator’s study file will contain the Investigator Brochure , protocol/amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 2) Patien t clinical so urce documents : The required source data should include the following for each patien t: • Patient identification (name, date of birth, gender); • Documentation that the patien t meets eligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); • Participation in the study (including study number); • Study discussed and date of informed consent; • Dates of all visits; • Documentation that protocol- specific procedures were performed; • Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol; • Start and end date (including dose regimen) of study medication (drug dispensing and return should be documented as well); • Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and caus ality and intensity as assigned by the investigator ); • Concomitant medication (including start and end date); and • Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. All clinical study documentation must be retained by the investig ator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, US , Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, b y local regulations, or by an agreement with the sponsor. The investigator must notify the sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Clinical study documentation includes the I nvestigator Brochure, signed protocol and amendments, signed informed consents, notification of serious adverse events and related reports, any dispensing and accountability logs, shipping records of investigational product and Clinical Study Report MVT-601-3201 Myovant Sciences GmbH 392 CONFIDENTIAL"

Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 10.1.5. Electronic Case Report Forms For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the i nvestigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 form and/or other appropriate local health authority documents within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-randomization Screening Period if an eCRF was initiated). If a patien t withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 10.1.6. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator or investigator’s designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability including dates and lot numbers of all study drug. This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, patient ID number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational medicinal product dispos al/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor ( or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study. All records m ust be made available to the sponsor, authorized representatives, and appropriate regulatory agencies, upon request.

394,page_394,"Clinical Study Protocol: HERO (MVT -601-3201) Amendment 3, 23 October 2018 Myovant Sciences GmbH 90 CONFIDENTIAL Current ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines require the investigator to ensure that study drug deliveries from the sponsor are received by a responsible person (eg, pharmacist), and the following: • That such deliveries are recorded, for example, on the sponsor-approved drug accountability log, or other sponsor-approved pharmacy log; • That study drug is handled and stored safely and properly i n accordance with the study protocol; • That study drug is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with the protocol; • That any unused study drug is returned to the sponsor- designated facility or standard procedures for the alternative disposition of unused study drug are followed and only after approval by the sponsor representative. Drug inventory and accountability records for the study drugs will be kept by the investigator/pharmacist. Study drug accountability throughout the study must be documented. The following guidelines are therefore pertinent: • The investigator agrees not to supply study drug to any persons except the patients in this study; • The investigator/pharmacist will keep the study drugs in a pharmacy or other locked and secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only to those authorized by the investigator to dispense these study drugs; • The investigator/pharmacist will maintain a study drug inventory. The inventory will include details of material received and a clear record of when they were dispensed and to which patient; • The investigator/pharmacist agrees to conduct a final drug supply inventory on the drug accountability record at the conclusion or termination of the study. It must be possible to recon cile delivery records with those of used and returned study drug. Any discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate forms of deliveries must be signed by the person responsible; • Used or unused study drug may be destroyed at the study site according to standard institutional procedures if the sponsor agrees with the procedure, and after drug accountability has been conducted by the sponsor or representative. Unused study drug not destroyed at the site must be returned to the sponsor- designated facility at the end of the study or upon expiration. 10.1.7. Inspections During the course of the study and after study completion, it is likely that one or more quality assurance audits will be undertaken by authorized sponsor representatives. The purpose of the audit is to ensure that the study is (or was) conducted and monitored in compliance with the protocol as well as recognized Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. These audits will also increase the likelihood that the study data and all other study documentation can withstand a regulatory authority inspection. If such audits are to occur, they will be arranged for a reasonable and agreed time. By signing this protocol, the investigator grants permission to the sponsor or designee to conduct onsite audits of all appropriate facilities and study documentation.

Sponsor Responsibilities 10.2.1. Protocol Modifications Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to patients , may be made only by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirements. Approval must be obt ained before changes can be implemented. The investigator must not deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, if required. In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will re move the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of emergency and the course of action taken. The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by the IRB or IEC, and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent. 10.2.2. Study Report A clinical study report will be prepared and provided to the regulatory authority (ies). The sponsor will ensure that the report meets the standards set out in the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3). Note that an abbreviated report may be prepared in certain cases. 10.2.3.

Adverse Event Severity Grading When assessing adverse events, refer to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03, June 14, 2010 (available at: http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf ). A copy of the National Cancer Institute CTCA E table will be provided in the investigator site file . The National Cancer Institute CTCAE is a descriptive terminology that can be utilized for adverse event reporting. A grading (severity) scale is provided for each adverse event term. Components and Organization of the National Cancer Institute CTCAE • System Organ Class (SOC). SOC, the highest level of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) hierarchy, is identified by anatomical or physiological system, etiology, or purpose (eg , SOC Investigations for laboratory test results). CTCAE terms are grouped by MedDRA Primary SOCs. Within each SOC, adverse events are listed and accompanied by descriptions of severity (grade). • CTAE Terms. Each CTCAE term is a MedDRA LLT (Lowest Level Term). • Definitions. A brief definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each adverse event term. • Grades. Grade refers to the severity of the adverse event . The CTCAE displays grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each adver se event based on this general guideline: o Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. o Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate in strumental activities of daily living; o Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living; o Grade 4 Life- threat ening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and o Grade 5 Death related to adverse event . A semi-colon indicates “or” within the description of the grade. A single dash (- ) indicates a grade is not available. Not all grades are appropriate for all adverse events . Therefore, some adverse events are listed with fewer than 5 options for grade selection. • Grade 5. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some adverse events and therefore is not an option.

Guidelines for Elevations in Hepatic Enzymes Study drug treatment should be withheld for any liver test abnormality listed in Section 7.5.1, pending investigation of alternative causes of liver injury. Follow-up should continue until the liver test abnormalities resolve to baseline. For this purpose, local labs can be used. However, duplicate samples should be taken for central analysis. Monitor liver tests per the applicable schedule in Appendix Table 1, and per the investigations in Appendix Table 2. If close monitoring is not possible, study drug should be withheld, even if the results do not meet the criteria for withholding in Section 7.5.1. The medical monitor should be contacted for questions regarding adequate follow-up tests and frequency of follow-up tests for a patient.
