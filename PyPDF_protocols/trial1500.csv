The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term TEZ/IVA treatment in pediatric subjects aged 6 years and older. During the course of study conduct, if TEZ/IVA receives marketing authorization and is available for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in this study , subjects with the approved CFTR genotypes may be discontinued from this rollover study at the discretion of the sponsor. If a subject continues onto a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator , the Early Treatment Termination (ETT) Visit will be completed before dosing with commercia l drug begins, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -sponsored managed access program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with TEZ/IVA via the MAP, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. Alternatively, if local health authorities decline to grant marketing authorization , or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in this study , sub jects with the relevant CFTR genotypes"

In people with CF, loss of chloride transport due to defects in CFTR result in the accumulation of thick, sticky mucus in the bronchi of the lungs, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, impaired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunction, and elevated sweat chloride concentration. Lung disease is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in people with CF. The median predicted age of survival of individuals born today with CF is approximately 40 years of age.1, 2 Two complementary approaches to increase CFTR -mediated Cl− secretion in the airway epithelia have been studied.3 One approach is to treat with a c ompound that will modify the cellular processing and trafficking of the CFTR protein to increase the amount of functional CFTR at the cell surface. This kind of compound has been termed a CFTR corrector. Another approach is to treat with a compound that in creases the channel gating activity of CFTR at the cell surface to enhance ion transport. This kind of compound has been termed a potentiator. Tezacaftor (TEZ) and ivacaftor (IVA) are CFTR modulators with interdependent mechanisms of action in treating CF patients with CFTR mutations that require a combination therapy approach. TEZ and IVA both address the underlying cause of CF, and each has a different and essential role as a corrector (TEZ) or potentiator (IVA) of the CFTR protein in CF patients. TEZ (V X-661) and IVA (VX -770) were developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex). TEZ/ IVA combination therapy (trade names Symdeko™ and Symkevi™) is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 6 years of age homozygous for F508del or wh o have another indicated CFTR genotype. IVA monotherapy ( Kalydeco ™) is indicated for the treatment of CF in patients as young as 2 years old with specific CFTR mutations including certain gating mutations as well the R117H mutation. The indicated mutations and approved populations for Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco vary by country. Please refer to local prescribing information or summary of product characteristics for your region for the current approved use of Symdeko/Symkevi and Kalydeco. Results from 2 piv otal Phase 3 Studies , VX14 -661-106 (Study 106) and VX14 -661-108 (Study 108), that evaluated TEZ in combination with IVA (TEZ/IVA) demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function and key secondary endpoints along with favorable safety and benefit/risk profiles with the TEZ daily (qd)/IVA every 12 hours (q12h) regimen in CF subjects homozygous for F508 del (F/F) , or heterozygous for F508del and a second mutation that results in residual CFTR function (F/RF), aged ≥12 years. Additional details about TEZ/IVA can be found in the TEZ /IVA Investigator's Brochure. 5.2 Study Rationale To date, the long -term safety of TEZ/IVA has not yet been evaluated in subjects with CF aged 6 to 11 years. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF in this age group, who are homozygous or"

The Day 1 Visit of Study 116 will be on the same day as the last scheduled visit of the parent study; this will occur at the Week 24 Visit for subjects from Study 113B and at the Week 8 Visit for subjects from Study 115. Subjects will NOT have to repeat any Study 116 Day 1 Visit assessments that were specif ied to be performed at the last scheduled visit in the parent study. Subjects who were enrolled in Study 116, but had Day 1 study drug administration procedures delayed (e.g., due to an AE), will repeat the safety, LCI (if applicable), assessments that were specified to be performed at the Day 1 Visit before receiving their first dose of study drug. For subjects at Study 116 sites that have NOT been activated by the time the subject has completed the last scheduled visit in the parent study, the Day 1 Visit of Study 116 will NOT coincide with the last schedul ed visit of the parent study. Subjects at these sites with delayed activation will have to repeat any Study 116 Day 1 assessments that were specified to be performed at the last scheduled visit in the parent study. All subjects will have study visits on Da y 1 and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96. Study Visits on Day 15 and Week 4 are only required for subjects from Study 115. 9.1.2 Safety Follow -up Subjects will have a Safety Follow -up Visit 28 (±7) days after the last dose of study drug. Safety Follow -up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1. If a subject chooses to continue onto a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator (i.e., TEZ/IVA [if approved for marketing], Kalydeco, Orkambi ™ [lumacaftor/IVA], or another approved TEZ/ IVA-containing regimen), the Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit will be completed before dosing with the commercial drug begins, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -spon sored managed access program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with TEZ/IVA via the MAP, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required (see Section 9.1.3 )."
21,page_21,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 22 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.1.3 Early Termination of Treatment If the subject prematurely discontinues study treatment, an ETT Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the subject /caregiver decides to terminate study treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow -up Visit, approximately 28 (± 7) days after their last dose of study drug. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT V isit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. If a subject chooses to continue onto a commercially available Vertex CFTR modulator (i.e., TEZ/IVA [Symdeko] , Kalydeco, Orkambi ™, or another approved TEZ/IVA -containing drug ), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with the commercial drug begins, and the Safety Follow -up Visit (Section 9.1.2 ) will not be required. If a subject is continuing onto TEZ/IVA supplied via a Vertex -sponsored managed access program (MAP), the ETT Visit will be completed before dosing with TEZ/IVA via the MAP, and the Safety Follow -up Visit will not be re quired. Alternatively, if local health authorities decline to approve, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in populations enrolled in Study 116, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be disconti nued after communication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the subset of subjects concerned. If subjects are discontinued from the study, an ETT Visit should occur within 7 days of the last dose of study drug and a Safety Follow -up Visit should occur within 28 (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug. If the subject /caregiver withdraws consent for the study, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be col lected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.1.4 Independent Data Monitoring Committee Safety and tolerability data will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to ensure the safety of the subjects in the study (Section 12.3.5.2 ). Procedural details of the IDMC's structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before t he first subject is enrolled . 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups This is an open -label study. Randomization is not required. 9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design This is a Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, rollover study in subjects with C F aged 6 years and older , who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del , and who completed the Week 24 Visit in Study 113B or the Week 8 Visit in Study 115."
22,page_22,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 23 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Approximately 56 subjects from Study 113B and 65 subjects from Study 115 will be enrolled in the study. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long -term TEZ/IVA treatment in subjects who were aged 6 through 11 years at the start of the parent study. Study 113B and Study 115 were designed to evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics , and efficacy to support an expanded indication for TEZ/IVA in subjects 6 through 11 years of age, inclusive, who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del . The long-term safety and efficacy of TEZ/IVA treatment has not yet been evaluated in this age group. Therefore, r esults from Study 116 will provide information on the safety and efficacy of long-term TEZ/IVA treatment in subjects with CF aged 6 years and older, homozygous or heterozygous for F508del . Interim analyses (IAs) , as described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), may occur at any time during the study (Section 12.3.5.1 ). 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration The approved Symdeko dosing regimen for this age group will be used. 9.3.2.1 Subjects ≥12 Years of Age Subjects who are ≥12 years of age at enrollment, or who turn 12 years of age during the study, will receive a morning dose of TEZ 1 00 mg/IVA 150 mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 150 mg (tablet) . 9.3.2.2 Subjects <12 Years of Age Subjects who are <12 years of age and weigh <30 kg at the Day 1 Visit will receive a morning dose of TEZ 50 mg/IVA 75 mg (fixed -dose combination [FDC] tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 75 mg (tablet). Subjects who are <12 years of age and ≥ 30 kg at the Day 1 Visit will receive a morning dose of TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg (FDC tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 1 50 mg (tablet). If a subject who weighs < 30 kg at enrollment subsequently weighs ≥30 kg at 2 consecutive study visits, the study drug dose will be adjusted upward at the second visit such that the subject receives a morning dose of TEZ 100 mg/IVA 150 mg (FD C tablet) and an evening dose of IVA 150 mg (tablet). 9.3.3 Rationale for Study Assessments The safety and efficacy assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development. The efficacy assessments are widely accepted and generally recogniz ed as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of patients with CF. Ophthalmologic Examinations: A juvenile rat toxicity study performed to support dosing of IVA in subjects <2 years of age demonstrated lens opacities in some animals. Prior studies in rats and dogs of older age did not demonstrate similar findings. Given substantial differences between human and rat lens development, the finding is of unlikely relevance to humans. To confirm this interpretation, periodic ophthalmologic examinations wil l be performed in this study. The overall data acquired to date do not suggest an association between IVA treatment and cataract development; however, a potential association has not been fully excluded. LCI Assessment (Subjects From Study 113B LCI Substud y and Study 115 Only): LCI is a measure of ventilation inhomogeneity that is based on tidal breathing techniques which have been evaluated in patients as young as infants.4, 5 Studies have shown that LCI correlates with"
23,page_23,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 24 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) in its ability to measure airway di sease in patients with impacted spirometry assessment, but can also detect lung disease at an earlier stage than spirometry.6, 7 Furthermore, data from Study VX10 -770-106 in CF subjects with an FEV 1 >90% showed LCI to be a more sensitive outcome measure than FEV 1. Sweat Chloride: In patients with CF, the underlying CFTR ion transport defect results in elevated sweat electrolyte levels.8, 9 The sweat chloride test (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) is the most common diagnostic tool for CF. A sweat chloride concentration of 60 mmol/L is considered to be diagnostic of CF, whereas <40 mmol/L is considered normal. Based on the mechanisms of action of TEZ and IVA, the sweat chloride test is included in this study as a measure of the effect o f TEZ/IVA on CFTR activity. Nutritional Status ( Measured by Weight and BMI): Malnutrition is common in patients with CF because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption. Given that TEZ/IVA is a systemic therapy, it has the potential to improve extrapulmonary manifestations of CF, including those in the gastrointestinal system. Improved nutritional status, defined as an increase in weight and/or BMI, is considered an appropriate endpoint for therapies targeting CFTR and was used in previous clinical studies of CFTR -targeted therapies. To evaluate the effect of TEZ/IVA on growth, change in weight and BMI will be determined. As children gain weight and height as part of normal growth, adjustment for age and sex is necessary to assess changes in nutritional status. Height and weight will be collected at the study visits indicated in the schedule of assessments. CFQ -R: The CFQ -R is a validated CF -specific instrument that measures the health -related quality of life of patients with CF.3, 10, 11 The CFQ -R measures quality -of-life domains including respiratory symptoms, digestive symptoms, emotion, and health perception. Furthermore, the CFQ -R has been evaluated in clinical studies involving therapies for CF lung disease.12-14 Linguistically validated versions of the CFQ -R15, 16 are available, thereby allowing consistent interpretation of the results in global studies."
24,page_24,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 25 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.4 Study Restrictions Study restrictions are summarized in Table 9-1. Both TEZ and IVA are metabolized predominantly via the hepatic enzymatic pathway utilizing CYP3A4. C o-administration of TEZ and IVA with moderate and strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) has the potential to significantly reduce TEZ and IVA exposure and is restricted in this study. Case -by-case exceptions for concomitant use of a moderate CYP3A inducer with TEZ/IVA may be granted by the Vertex medical monitor if it is the principal investigator ’s opinion that the benefits outweigh the risks for the subject in question. A more detailed, but non -exhaustive, list of study prohibitions and cautions for food and medication will be provided in the Study Reference Manual .

25,page_25,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 26 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medicinal products affected by TEZ/IVA (CYP3A, P -glycoprotein , or CYP2C9 substrates) Co-administration of TEZ/IVA with (oral) midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, did not affect midazolam exposure. No dose adjustment is required when co -administered with CYP3A substrates. Based on in vitro data, IVA and its M1 metabolite have the potent ial to inhibit P -glycoprotein (P-gp). Co -administration of TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3 -fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P -gp by IVA. Administration of TEZ/IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P -gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When using concomitant digoxin or other substrates of P -gp with a narrow therapeutic index, TEZ/IVA should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring. IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio during co -administration of TEZ/IVA with warfarin is recommended. Information regarding all prior and concomitant m edications, including the subject's CF medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies administered at or after completion of treatment in the parent study through the Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable, will be recorded in each sub ject's source documents.  Subjects should remain on a stable CF medication (and supplement) regimen through the Safety Follow -up Visit. Stable medication regimen is defined as the current medication regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at l east 28 days before Day 1. Medication changes required for clinical management are allowed during the course of the study and will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Restricted/prohibited medication guidelines should still be followed ( see Section 9.4 and Table 9-1). Guidelines for stable medication regimens for CF are as follows: o Subjects who are taking daily inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o Subjects who are on inhaled cycling antibiotics s hould continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of inhaled cycling antibiotics in the cycle. o Subjects who alternate 2 different antibiotics monthly should rem ain on the same schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug should be synchronized as closely as possible to the first day of 1 of the inhaled alternating antibiotics.  There are no restrictions on the concomitant use of corticoste roids. 9.6 Administration On Day 1 through the last dose of study drug (the evening dose administered the day before the Week 96 Visit), study drug tablets will be administered orally as shown in Table 9-2."
26,page_26,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 27 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated At each study visit the TEZ/IVA dose for each subject will be reassessed based on body weight and age and adjusted upward if necessary. Study drug should be administered within 30 minutes after starting a meal with fat -containing food such as a standard “CF” high -fat, high -calorie meal or snack according to the following guidelines: Table 9-2 Study Drug Administration Subjects Treatment Time Drug(s) and Dose(s) Administered  6 to 11 years of age and <30 kg at enrollmenta,b TEZ 50 mg qd + IVA 75 mg q12h AM 1 × TEZ 50 -mg/ IVA 75 -mg FDC tablet PM 1 × IVA 75 -mg tablet  6 to 11 years of age and ≥ 30 kg at enrollmenta,b  6 to 11 years of age and < 30 kg at enrollment who subsequently weighs ≥ 30 kg during the studya,b  ≥12 years of age at enrollment, or subjects who turn 12 years of age during the study TEZ 100 mg qd + IVA 150 mg q12h AM 1 × TEZ 100 -mg/ IVA 150 -mg FDC tablet PM 1 × IVA 150 -mg tablet FDC: fixed -dose combination, IVA: ivacaftor, q12h: every 12 hours, qd: daily, TEZ: tezacaftor Note: Additional details regarding study drug administration for TEZ and IVA will be included in the Pharmacy Manual. a No downward dose adjustments will be made if a subject’s weight decreases. b Doses may be adjusted upward as follows: if a subject who is 6 to 11 years of age and weighs < 30 kg at enrollment subsequently weighs ≥ 30 kg at 2 consecutive visits, the study drug dose will be adjusted upward at the sec ond visit such that the subject receives TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h. 1. Study drug should be administered q12h (± 2 hours). For each subject, all doses (morning and evening) of study drugs should be administered at approximately the same time each day. For example, if the morning dose of study drug is administered at 08:00 on Day 1, all subsequent morning doses should be administered between 06:00 and 10:00. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of study drug. 2. If a subject's scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used for administering either the morning or evening dose :  If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject's scheduled morning dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of study drug, and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic."
27,page_27,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 28 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject's scheduled morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose at home, and the evening dose will be administered in the clinic. In this event, all assessments will be collected relative to the evening dose. 3. For visits after Day 1, subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused study drug and materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate . 4. At the Week 96 Visit, the morning dose of study drug will NOT be ad ministered. The last dose of study drug will be the evening dose administered the day before the Week 96 Visit. Providing a meal or snack during this visit i s optional. 9.7 Missed Doses If a subject misses a dose and recalls the missed dose within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. For example :  If the morning dose of study drug shou ld have been taken at approximately 08:00, and the subject remembers at 12:00 that he/she forgot to take his/her dose, he/she should take the dose with food as soon as possible.  If the morning dose of study drug should have been taken at approximately 08:0 0, and greater than 6 hours have elapsed beyond the scheduled dosing time (i.e., the time is past 14:00), the subject would resume dosing with the evening dose at approximately 20:00. 9.8 Dose Modification for Use With Concomitant CYP3A Inhibitors Dosing reco mmendations for subjects taking concomitant CYP3A inhibitors are described in Table 9-3. The dosage of TEZ/IVA can be altered only when co -administered with moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A. The dosage of TEZ/IVA cannot be otherwise altered, but the investigator can interrupt or stop treatment.

In addition, if evaluation of efficacy data from Phase 3 Study VX14 -661-110 sugg ests that the TEZ/IVA treatment does not provide clinically meaningful benefit for a population enrolled in Study 116, Vertex may recommend that subjects with relevant CFTR genotypes discontinue the study. Subjects who become eligible to receive commercial ly available TEZ/IVA by prescription of a physician may be discontinued from this rollover study at the discretion of the sponsor. The timing of assessments after study discontinuation is described in Section 9.1.2 and Section 9.1.3 . 9.10 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request or at the caregiver’s request . Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reason s. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided the subject has not withdrawn consent. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subje ct/caregiver . In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject /caregiver return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow -up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.3 ), and follow up with the subject /caregiver regarding any unresolved A Es.

H owever, subjects and their pa rent/caregiver should not be informed of their study -related LCI, or sweat chloride result s during the study regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment or not. 11 ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Timing of Assessments All information regarding the timing assessments is shown in the schedule of assessments (Table 3-1). The following assessments must be performed in the order specifie d below when more than 1 assessment is required at a particular time point: 1. The CFQ -R must be completed before the start of any other assessments scheduled at that visit. 2. Height and weight measurements should be performed before dosing. 3. ECGs will be perfo rmed before dosing and before any other procedures that may affect heart rate (e.g., blood draws). 4. The multiple -breath washout ( MBW ) assessment (performed for subjects from Study 115 and the Study 113B LCI Substudy only) will be performed 5. Both MBW will be performed before dosing and should be performed before use of bronchodilators. 6. Blood sampling for clinical laboratory assessments at all visits, except the Day 1 Visit, may be conducted at any time during the visit after the ECG is performed and before the meal or snack . 7. No other assessments should overlap with sweat chloride collection. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight. Select demographic and baseline characteristic data and medical history will be derived from the parent study. Age, sex, race, and ethnicity will be derived from the parent study ,"

LCI 2.5 represents the number of lung turnovers required to reduce the end tidal inert gas concentration to 1/40th of its s tarting value, Pre-bronchodilator MBW testing is defined as MBW testing performed for subjects who have  withheld their short -acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., Atrovent®) for more than 4 hours before the MBW testing;  withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) more than 12 hours before the MBW testing; and  withheld their once -daily, long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the MBW testing. MBW testing should be performed “pre -bronchodilator.” MBW testing must be performed before dosing, unless noted otherwise. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), MBW testing should be performed accord ing to the following:  If a subject's Day 1 MBW testing is pre -bronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, post -bronchodilator MBW testing will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be res cheduled.  If on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, MBW testing should be performed post -bronchodilator and all subsequent MBW testing (according to the Schedule of Assessments detailed for LCI in Table 3-1) should be performed post-bronchodilator.  Each MBW test will be recorded in the source documents as pre -bronchodilator or post-bronchodilator. MBW assessments will be performed in multiple replicates. Detailed LCI procedures will be supplied in a separate study manual. Subjects and their parent/caregiver should not be informed of their study -related LCI results during the Treatment Period."

Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedures for documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE CRF completion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided. 11.4.2 Clinical Laboratory A ssessments Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory assessments will be collected as shown in Table 3-1. On Day 1, blood samples will be collected before the first dose of study drug. At all other scheduled visits, these samples will be collected at any time during the visit, but not before the ECG is performed (Section 11.1). Subjects are not required to fast before collection of blood samples ; however the meal or snack should be provide d after blood collection . Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a local or central laboratory. For purposes of study data collection , only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion o f the local investigator only for management of urgent medical issues . If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes awa re of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value . Laboratory test results th at are abnormal and considered clinically significant will be reported as AEs (see Section 13.1). The safety laboratory test panels are shown in Table 11-1.

CFTR Genotype : The CFTR genotype result can be taken from Study 113 or Study 115. If the genotype result is not available, subjects will be tested for CFTR genotype; if the genotype result from the confirmatory test is exclusionary, then the subject will be removed from the stud y. Instructions for collecting a sample for CFTR genotyping will be included in the Laboratory Manual. Pregnancy Testing for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential Who Are Not Abstinent (Section 11.4.8.1 ): Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the Day 1 Visit. Serum pregnancy tests will be conducted at other visits specified in Table 3-1. If the urine pregnancy test is positive on Day 1, study drug will not be administered and the pregnancy will be confirmed with a serum beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) test. If pregnancy is confirmed , the subject will not be eligible for the study. For pregnancy tests conducted after dosing, if a serum β -HCG test is positive, the pregnancy will be reported and the subject will be permanently withdrawn from study drug dosing as dis cussed in Section 11.4.8.2 . If a pregnancy test is positive, the procedures outlined in Section 11.4.8.2 will be followed. Additional Evaluations : Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged by the investigator to be clinically appropriate. 11.4.3 Liver Funct ion Test Parameters Liver function testing (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], gamma - glutamyl transferase [GGT], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], direct bilirubin, and total bilirubin) must be performed as noted in Table 3-1 for serum chemistry while subjects are receiving study drug treatment and at the Safety Follow -up Visit. These blood samples should be processed and shipped immediately per the Laboratory Manual."
37,page_37,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 38 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) and clinical symptoms must be followed closely, including repeat confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT and AST levels , as clinically indicated. In addition, if ALT or AST is >5 × ULN, repeat follow -up levels must be obtained within 7 ± 2 days. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory liver function testing, a local laboratory may be used. Elevations in LFT s at the local laboratory must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study Drug Interruption : Study drug administ ration must be interrupted immediately ( before confirmatory testing), and the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria is met:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. If no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol ingestion) for the elevated transaminases is identified, regardless of whether ALT or AST levels have improved, study drug treatment must be permanently discontinued if repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours confirms the initial elevati on. Subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases should have their transaminases monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. Resumption of Study Drug : If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevatio n has been identified, study drug may be resumed once transaminases values decrease to ≤2 × ULN or to baseline levels (as defined in Section 12.3.1 ). Approval of the medical monitor is required before resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol -defined transaminase elevation occurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with con firmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 11.4.4 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessmen t will be performed at select study visits (see Table 3-1). At other visits, symptom -directed PE s and symptom -directed vital sign assessments can be pe rformed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider . PEs will also occur at any time during the study if trig gered by AEs . A PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory ; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After consenting , any clinically significant abnormal findings in PE s will be reported as AEs."

The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before vital signs are assessed. 11.4.5 Pulse Oximetry This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured at visits noted in Table 3-1. This will be assessed following a t least a 5-minute rest and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before study drug administra tion. 11.4.6 Electrocardiograms Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3-1). Additional standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed at any other time, if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs will adhere to the following guidelines:  The subject will be instructed to rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG performed.  The ECG will be performed before any other procedures that may affect heart rate, such as blood draws.  ECGs will be performed in triplicate on Day 1. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Sa fety Follow -up Visit will be recorded as AEs. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to Study 116 Day 1 measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >45 msec from Day 1 or an absolute QTcF value is ≥5 00 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>45 msec from Day 1 or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. A subject with a QTcF value above the threshold value will discontinue dosing. Further detai ls pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites i n the ECG Manual . 11.4.7 Ophthalmologic Examination Ophthalmologic examinations will be performed by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist. Subjects with documentation of bilateral lens removal do not need the ophthalmologic examination. Subjects who did not have an ophthalmologic examination at the end of the parent study will have an ophthalmologic examination at the Day 1 Visit of Study 116 or no more than 28 days after. If a subject had an ophthalmological exam ination in the parent study less than 28 days before the Day 1 Visit of Study 116, the exam ination does not need to be repe ated on Day 1. The examination includes:  measurement of best corrected distance visual acuity of each eye"

An ophthalmologic examination will be performed at the Week 48 Visit. Subjects will also have an examination at either the Week 96 Visit (± 28 days) OR the Safety Follow -up Visit, but the exam ination must be completed by the date of the Safety Follow -up Visit. For subjects who discontinue treatment after receiving at least 1 dose of study drug, this examination may be completed at the ETT Visit or the Safety Follow -up Visit (if applicable [Section 9.1.2 ]), but must be completed by the date of the Safety Follow -up Visit. If a cataract or lens opacity is identified and determined to be clinically significant by the ophthalmologist or optometrist within Study 116, the subject /caregiver and Vertex medical monitor will be notified. The subject /caregiver may elect to continue or discontinue study drug treatment. If the subject discontinues study drug treatment, the subject should complete the ETT and the Safety Follow -up Visits (see Sections 9.1.2 and 9.1.3 ). If the subject continues study drug treatment, more frequent ophthalmologic monitoring should be considered. 11.4.8 Contraception and Pregnanc y Standard contraception - and pregnancy -related information and requirements are provided below. It should be noted that some of this information and requirements may have limited applicability in this pediatric population. 11.4.8.1 Contraception For subjects with an appropriate need for contraception, as determined by their physician, participation in this study requires a commitment from the subject and his/her partner to use at least 1 acceptable method of contraception, which must be used correctly with every ac t of sexual intercourse. Methods of contraception should be in successful use from at least 14 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. For female subjects using oral hormon al contraceptives: 1. The oral hormonal contraceptives should be in successful use from at least 60 days before the first dose of study drug (unless otherwise noted) and until 90 days following the last dose of study drug. 2. Female subjects who change their met hod of contraception to hormonal contraceptive during Study 116 must use a second form of approved contraception for at least 60 days after beginning oral contraceptives. Contraception for the couple is waived for the following:  True abstinence for the sub ject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  If the male is infertile (e. g., bilateral orchiectomy). Infertility may be documented through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound before the first dose of study drug."
40,page_40,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 41 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  If the female is of non -childbearing potential, per the following: o Documented hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo -oophorectomy. o Has not achieved menarche (has not had her first menstrual period). If a female achieves menarche during the study, she will need to follow acceptable methods of cont raception or abstinence.  For subjects for whom contraception methods are not waived due to at least 1 of the reasons cited above, the following are acceptable contraceptive methods for male subjects and their female (non -study) partners, and for female sub jects and their male (non -study) partners: Table 11-2 Acceptable Methods of Contraception  Male vasectomy at least 6 months previously, with a documented negative post -vasectomy semen analysis for sperm.  Male or female condom with or without spermicide (either as a single product if commercially available and/or as allowed according to local regulations; otherwise condom and spermicide as separate products).  Female bilateral tubal ligation performed at least 6 months previously.  Female diaphragm, cervical cap, or vaginal sponge, each with spermicide (where available).  Female continuous use of an intrauterine device (non -hormone releasing or hormone releasing) for at least 90 days before the first dose of study d rug  Female combined (estrogen and progestogen -containing) or progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation if successfully used for at least 60 days before the first dose of study drug or with a second form of approve d contraception for at least 60 days after beginning hormonal contraception. Important notes:  Local requirements may prohibit the use of some of these acceptable methods listed above. Please contact the medical monitor with any questions.  If applicable, additional contraception requirements may need to be followed according to local regulations and/or requirements.  Male and female subjects who are not sexually active at the time of informed consent signature must agree to follow the contraceptive require ments of this study if they become sexually active.  Female condom used with male condom (as a double method of contraception) is not an acceptable method of contraception due to risk of tearing; a different acceptable method of birth control must be used a s described in Table 11-2.  Female subjects and female partners of male subjects should not plan to become pregnant during the study through 90 days fo llowing the last dose of study drug.  Female subjects should not nurse a child from the start of study drug dosing through 90 days following the last dose of study drug. Other situations that do not fall within the above specifications may be discussed with the Vertex medical monitor on an individual basis."

The safety analysis period is defined as the treatment -emergent (TE) Period . The safety analysis period begins at the first dose of study drug in Study 116 and ends 28 days after the last dose of study drug in Study 116, or at the date of Study 116 participation completion, whichever occurs first. Completion of Study 116 participation will be defined in the SAP. The safety analyses will be perf ormed on the Safety Set over the Safety Analysis Period, unless otherwise specified. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, PEs, ophthalmologic examinations, clinical laboratory values, vital s igns, ECG measurements, and pulse oximetry. Only descriptive summaries will be presented and no statistical testing is planned. The efficacy analysis period begins at the first dose of study drug in Study 116 and ends at the last study visit at which effic acy data are collected in Study 116. The efficacy analysis will be performed on all subjects in the FAS by parent study for the efficacy analysis period, unless specified otherwise . Methods of efficacy analyses will be similar for those used in the parent studies. Each of the secondary endpoints (LCI 2.5, sweat chloride, CFQ -R, and BMI) will be analyzed using a mixed -effect s model for repeated measures (MMRM) with absolute change from baseline during the efficacy analysis period as the dependent variable. T he least square (LS) mean and the associated 95% CI at each defined analysis visit will be provided for the corresponding efficacy endpoints. In addition, descriptive summary statistics will be provided for relevant safety and efficacy parameters. 12.3.1 General Considerations The precision standards for reporting safety and efficacy variables are provided in an internal Biometrics document that specifies the programming rules including the precision for derived variables. All individual subject data for subjects who were enrolled in a parent study and who received at least 1 dose of TEZ/IVA in either parent study or in Study 116 will be presented in individual subject data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary s tatistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, SE, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Day 1, unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the day of the first dos e of TEZ/IVA, whether the first dose was taken in the parent study or in Study 116. Baseline value , unless specified otherwise, will be defined as the most recent non -missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of TEZ/IVA , whether the first dose was taken in the parent study or in Study 116. For ECGs, the baseline value will be defined as the average of the last non-missing pretreatment measurements ( scheduled or"

Change (absolute change) from baseline will be calculated as Post-baseline value − Baseline value . Relative change from baseline will be calculated and expressed in percentage as 100% × (Post -baseline value − Baseline value)/Baseline value . The data from Study 116 will be integrated with data from the parent studies for the purpose of providing robust safety an d efficacy analyses. Unscheduled visits: Unscheduled visit measurements will be included in analysis as follows:  In scheduled visit windows per specified visit windowing rules.  In the derivation of baseline/last on -treatment measurements.  In the derivation of maximum/minimum on -treatment values and maximum/minimum change from baseline values for safety analyses.  In individual subject data listings as appropriate.

The analysis will include all available measurements during the efficacy analysis period . 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Variables Not applicable . 12.3.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Variables Methods of efficacy analyses will be similar for those used in the parent studies. Each of the secondary endpoints (LCI 2.5, sweat chl oride, BMI, and CFQ -R) will be analyzed using a MMRM , with absolute change from baseline during the efficacy analysis period as the dependent variable. For subjects from Study 115, only those who were randomized to TEZ/IVA treatment group will be included in the MMRM model. The model will include the absolute change from baseline as the dependent variable; visit as a fixed effect; and subject as a random effect , with or without adjustment f or age, genotype mutation group , and baseline value. In the model, v isit will be treated as a class variable, assuming an unstructured covariance matrix to model the within -subject variability. This model imposes no assumptions on the correlational structure and is considered robust. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. If there is a convergence problem due to the use of an unstructured covariance matrix, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject error s. With a mixed -effects model based on a restricted maximum likelihood estimation used for the primary analysis and assuming that, conditional on fixed and random effects, data are missing at random, no imputation of missing data will be performed."

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre -existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity o r frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1 . 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessme nts Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnorma l study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following:  Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention"
49,page_49,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 50 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  A change in the dose o f study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assess ment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Docum entation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  For subjects who do not enroll: until time of withdrawal of consent  For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow -up Visit: through the Safet y Follow -up Visit  For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit, the earliest of o 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug (see Section 9.1.3 )  For enrolled subjects who do not have a Safety Follow -up Visit because they will transition to commercially available CFTR modulator , or if the subject will receive TEZ/IVA through a Vertex -sponsored MAP: through the ETT Visit (Section 9.1.3 ) All subjects /caregivers will be queried, using nonleadin g questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. For sub jects who consent , but do not subsequently enroll in the study, AEs will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  Description of the event  Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  Severity  Causal relationship to study drug(s)  Action taken  Outcome  Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity o f all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed September 2017) . AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life threatening.” In"
50,page_50,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 51 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated considering the severity of an AE in a pe diatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definit ions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as cha racteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3."
51,page_51,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 52 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/not resolved (continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at least possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include tr eatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  Fatal ( death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immedi ate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred"
52,page_52,"Protocol VX1 7-661-116, Version 2.3 US Page 53 of 63 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions)  Congenital anomaly or birth defect  Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e.g., an allergic br onchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject /caregiver signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject /caregiver signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be reschedule d sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made betw een the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of rela tively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow -up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow -up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be r ecorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow -up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to hea lth authorities."

64,page_64,"Clinical Study Protocol Addendum for Cystic Fibrosis, Addendum Version 3.0 Page 2 of 8 Vertex Pharmac euticals Incorporated Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant improvements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects. During this COVID -19 pand emic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize any unnecessary risk to COVID -19 exposure through travel to study sites. This addendum summarizes the measures taken for ongoing CF clinical studies. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with G CP and minimizing impact to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable. Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. There are no operational changes to the study protocols for subjects who can travel to the study sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot travel to the study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies. Addendum Vers ion 3.0 summarizes additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety."
