Follow up activities, including overall survival assessments, End of Treatment visits and AE/SAE reporting must occur no later than 12 February 2020. Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy: Overall Survival (OS): After the End of treatment, survival information will be collected at approximately 6-week intervals (or as requested by sponsor to support data analysis) continuing until the endpoint of death, the subject becomes lost to follow-up, AbbVie terminates the study, or until 12 February 2020. Progression-Free Survival (PFS): will be derived according to progressive disease per RECIST version 1.1 or death. Radiographic tumor assessments for response will be conducted by CT scanning.Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO): health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom assessment will be assessed at baseline, during the treatment cycle, at the end of treatment visit and every 6 weeks thereafter until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), EORTC QLQ-LC13, and EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires. Objective Response Rate (ORR): will be derived per RECIST version 1.1.

10,page_10,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 11 Criteria for Evaluation (Continued): Pharmacokinetic:Serum concentrations of rovalpituzumab tesirine antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and the presence of anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) will be determined. Biomarkers/Pharmacogenetics: Biomarker assessments will include analyses of tumor material and circulating tumor cells for DLL3 expression, blood samples for inflammatory, tumor and safety markers. Samples may also be used for other nucleic acid or protein based exploratory biomarkers to understand the sensitivity or resistance to rovalpituzumab tesirine and biology of SCLC. Statistical Methods: Efficacy: Following the fourth safety review by the IDMC, on 04 December 2018, the IDMC recommended that enrollment in the study is discontinued due to overall survival concerns associated with the study drug. For patients currently on treatment in Arm A, the IDMC recommends that sites and patients make individual decisions as to whether or not to continue treatment based on patient level response. The data collection plan has been minimized given the status change of this study. With all these changes, no statistical testing will be performed for the efficacy endpoints. The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the original statistical methodologies as appropriate. The efficacy endpoints for which there is not enough data to implement the statistical models will be summarized by treatment arms. The statisticalsection remains unchanged to reflect the original analysis plan. Efficacy analyses will be performed in the randomized set, including all randomized subjects, with subjects grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization, following intent-to-treat principle, unless otherwise specified. Assessment of response and progression will be determined by the CRAC according to RECIST v1.1. Overall survival (OS) is the primary efficacy endpoint. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause (i.e., date of subject's death – date of randomization + 1). For subjects who are alive at the time of the analysis, the data will be censored at the last date they were documented to be alive. Subjects with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. Comparison between the two treatment arms will be performed via a one-sided log-rank test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, testing the null hypothesis (rovalpituzumab tesirine arm (Arm A) is not superior to topotecan arm (Arm B) in OS). The hazard ratio (HR) of Arm A over Arm B will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The OS curves for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method. Two-sided, 95% confidence interval for median OS will be computed. Landmark survival rate, defined as the survival rate estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach at pre-defined timepoints from randomization (e.g., 6, 12 and 18 months), will be summarized, presenting two-sided 95% CIs. Secondary time-to-event endpoints of PFS and DOR will be analyzed using the same statistical method described for the analysis of OS. Analysis of categorical endpoints such as ORR and CBR will be performed for the randomized subjects with measureable disease at baseline. Comparison of the categorical endpoints will be carried out using a one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors."
11,page_11,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 12 Statistical Methods (Continued): Testing Strategy:To meet global regulatory requirements, a multiple testing strategy will be implemented to control the family-wise type I error for comparisons of rovalpituzumab tesirine arm versus topotecan arm with respect to the primary and secondary endpoints in the order specified below. The following null hypotheses are considered: H1: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in OS.H2: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in PFS per CRAC. H3: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in PRO physical functioning scale at C2D1 for rovalpituzumab tesirine arm and C3D1 for topotecan arm. H4: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in ORR per CRAC.H5: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in CBR per CRAC. H6: Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm is not superior to topotecan arm in DOR per CRAC. The family of null hypotheses will be tested using a hierarchical procedure, i.e., in a fixed sequence of {H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6}. Hypothesis H1 will be tested first, and no further tests will be performed if H1 is not rejected. Thereafter, each hypothesis will be tested in the order specified if and only if H1 and all preceding null hypotheses are rejected. Otherwise testing in the hierarchical sequence will stop. Safety: A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects treated with the study drug. For the study as a whole, adverse events will be evaluated and summarized. Laboratory test results and vital signs will be summarized as appropriate. Sample Size: Following the fourth safety review by the IDMC, on 04 December 2018 the IDMC recommended that enrollment in the study is discontinued due to overall survival concerns associated with the study drug. 444 subjects were enrolled in the study. The following paragraph describes how the sample size was determined for the study. The sample size of the study is primarily determined by the analysis of OS. Approximately 600 subjects in total will be randomized to rovalpituzumab tesirine (Arm A) or topotecan (Arm B) in a 2:1 ratio. It is assumed that median overall survival in the topotecan arm (Arm B) will be around 6.5 months. Based on a log-rank test, at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 85%, a total of 489 deaths are needed to detect an increase in median OS to 8.67 months in rovalpituzumab tesirine arm (Arm A), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.75 (i.e., a reduction in the hazard death of 25%). It is projected that an observed hazard ratio of 0.829 or less, corresponding to 1.34 months or greater improvement in median OS, would result in statistical significance in the final analysis of OS. Interim Analysis: No interim analysis is planned. Biomarkers:Biomarkers will be measured at baseline and post-treatment, with analyses performed to identify markers associated with rovalpituzumab tesirine response, sensitivity, pharmacodynamics, or safety."

Historically, SCLC has been staged using Veterans Administration Lung Study Group (VA LG) classification as limited versus extensive stage disease, the former being defined as disease limited to the chest that can be encompassed by a radiation field while the latter includes all other cases. Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed subjects will have limited stage disease while the rest will be extensive. TNM classification is also used to stage SCLC. Systemic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of therapy for all stages of SCLC. Standard initial chemotherapy for all subjects with a suitable performance status consists of a platinum salt (carboplatin or cisplatin) in combination with a second agent, usually etoposide or irinotecan. For subjects with limited stage disease, concurrent or sequential involved-field thoracic radiotherapy is indicated. Response rates to initial therapy are high, ranging from 70 –90% for limited stage and 60 – 70% for extensive stage; however, responses are typically not durable and recurrence rates are high in the limited stage disease and nearly universal in the extensive stage disease, leading to median survivals of 14 – 20 months and 9 –11 months, respectively. 3 Options for subjects with relapsed/recurrent SCLC disease are limited. The only agent with several global regulatory approvals is topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, but its activity is less than impressive, and associated toxicity is significant. 4 Response rate with topotecan is approximately 14%, while median PFS and OS are 2.7 and 6.5 months, respectively. The strongest predictor of topotecan efficacy is sensitivity to front line therapy: subjects with relapse after more than 90 days from the completion of front line therapy (sensitive) have better results with topotecan compared to subjects that progress while receiving front line therapy or in less than 90 days of its completion (refractory/resistant). Several other single agent or combination regimens used in second line SCLC offer efficacy similar to topotecan."
23,page_23,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 24 Therefore, exploration of new therapies in second line SCLC is warranted, with the goals of extending disease control and improving overall survival. 3.2 Delta-Like Protein 3 Delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is an atypical, inhibitory ligand of the Notch receptor family, discovered by AbbVie Stemcentrx scientists as a novel therapeutic target in SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. It was identified by whole transcriptome sequencing of tumor initiating cells (TICs) isolated from SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine cancer (LCNEC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and found to be expressed in the majority of SCLC and LCNEC tumors, but with no detectable protein expression in normal tissues or non-neuroendocrine tumor types. 5 DLL3 has been implicated in the regulation of cell fate decisions during development, and likely acts as an oncogene in high-grade neuroendocrine tumors where it is a downstream transcriptional target of the achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) transcription factor in SCLC tumor cells, and acts to inhibit the Notch receptor pathway, thereby facilitating neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. 5-7 3.3 Rovalpituzumab Tesirine Rovalpituzumab tesirine (SC16LD6.5) is a DLL3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of the humanized DLL3-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibody SC16; the DNA cross linking pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) agent SC-DR002 (D6.5); and a protease-cleavable linker that covalently links SC DR002 to SC16. The primary mechanism of rovalpituzumab tesirine is binding of the ADC to DLL3 on target-expressing cells, followed by internalization of the ADC-DLL3 complex and release of SC-DR002 via proteolytic cleavage in late endosomes. Interstrand crosslinks of cellular DNA induced by intercalated SC-DR002 leads to cellular cytotoxicity. In a Phase 1 study (Study SCRX16-001), rovalpituzumab tesirine dosed at 0.2 – 0.4 mg/kg exhibited encouraging efficacy in recurrent SCLC, achieving a 31% (8/26) and 85% (22/26) central review-adjudicated confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR), respectively, in subjects whose tumors expressed DLL3 in"

Median overall survival was 7.7 months in DLL3 ≥ 50% subjects at all dose levels, with a 1-year survival rate of 30% (AbbVie Stemcentrx, data on file). In a Phase 2 SCRX001-002 (TRINITY) study in patients with SCLC recurrent after at least two systemic chemotherapy regimens, rovalpituzumab tesirine dosed at 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks for two cycles (with an option for additional two cycles upon progression occurring ≥ 12 weeks after the second dose) had shown confirmed objective response rate of 16%, progression-free survival of 3.9 months and overall survival of 5.6 months in 3 rd line DLL3Highpatients. Of note, prolonged stable disease with target lesion size reduction has been observed in a significant number of patients receiving additional post-progression cycles of rovalpituzumab tesirine (AbbVie Stemcentrx, data on file). Therefore, rovalpituzumab tesirine appears to be an active anti-cancer therapy in SCLC. 3.4 Differences Statement This is the first randomized, open-label, multicenter, Phase 3 study comparing rovalpituzumab tesirine to topotecan in subjects with advanced or metastatic SCLC with high DLL3 expression (DLL3 high) in tumor and who have had first disease progression during or following front-line platinum based chemotherapy. 3.5 Benefits and Risks Activity of the current second line standard of care topotecan is suboptimal and high unmet need in this setting is widely recognized. Based on the Phase 1 results of rovalpituzumab tesirine, this agent may offer improved efficacy over current second line standard. This study will assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of rovalpituzumab tesirine in SCLC subjects with first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide). The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) terms considered related to rovalpituzumab tesirine have included fatigue (37.6%), pleural effusion (29.4%) peripheral edema (29.1%) and decreased appetite (27.3%), while the most frequent,"
25,page_25,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 26 related TEAE groups of Grade 3 is thrombocytopenia (10.3%), pleural effusions (6.2%), and anaemia (5.4%). In addition, preclinical toxicology studies conducted in the rat and the cynomolgus monkey have identified bone marrow, lung, liver and kidney as potentialsources of clinical adverse events (AEs) (AbbVie Stemcentrx data on file). Accordingly, safety assessments will include regular assessments at protocol-specified time points of routine physical examination, laboratory and imaging tests, echocardiograms, a fluid retention questionnaire, daily weights, and spot urine protein testing. 4.0 Study Objectives The primary objectives of the study are to assess if treatment with rovalpituzumab tesirine improves overall survival (OS) compared to topotecan in subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3 highSCLC who have first disease progression during or following front- line platinum based chemotherapy. The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: to assess if the treatment with rovalpituzumab tesirine improves progression free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan; to assess the effect on patient reported outcomes (i.e., health-related quality of life and symptom assessment) between two arms; to assess if treatment with rovalpituzumab tesirine improves objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) compared to topotecan; and to compare the duration of objective response between two arms in subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3 highSCLC who have first disease progression during or following front-line platinum based chemotherapy. The exploratory objectives are to compare the safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine to topotecan; to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of rovalpituzumab tesirine; to evaluate DLL3 expression in circulating tumor cells and to evaluate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers for association with efficacy and safety."

DLL3highis defined as ≥75% tumor cells staining positive according to the VENTANA DLL3 (SP347) IHC Assay. This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multinational, and multicenter study comparing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rovalpituzumab tesirine versus topotecan in subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3 highSCLC who have first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Approximately 225 clinical sites will participate. All subjects must have tumor samples analyzed to confirm eligibility. Tumors must be DLL3 highas determined by the AbbVie designated central immunohistochemistry (IHC) laboratory. Archived or fresh tumor material can be used for the DLL3 testing. Testing for DLL3 status may occur at any time after initial diagnosis. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive rovalpituzumab tesirine (Arm A) or topotecan (Arm B): ●Subjects assigned to Arm A will receive 0.3 mg/kg rovalpituzumab tesirine (IV) on Day 1 of a 42-Day cycle for 2 cycles, along with 8 mg orally (PO) of dexamethasone twice daily on Day –1, Day 1, and Day 2. Regimen of Arm A will be administered for the 2 cycles planned unless earlier discontinuation is warranted due to disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other reason. Up to two additional cycles of rovalpituzumab tesirine may be permitted, however the last dose on study must be administered no later than 04 December 2019 for subjects in Arm A meeting certain criteria, as described in Section 5.3.1.1."
27,page_27,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 28 ●Arm B subjects will receive 1.5 mg/m2topotecan (IV) on Days 1 – 5 of each 21-Day cycle. Topotecan may be administered at a lower dose if required by the local label. The Arm B regimen will be administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other reason requiring treatment discontinuation, or no later than 04 December 2019, whichever comes first. Subjects will be stratified by prior history of brain metastases (yes vs. no), prior PCI (yes vs. no) for subjects with no prior history of brain metastases, sensitivity to first line platinum-based regimen [sensitive (OR/SD after first line therapy and progression/recurrence-free interval ≥ 90 days) vs. refractory/resistant (PD as best response or < 90 days 8progression/recurrence-free interval after first line therapy)] and LDH level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) at screening. Post-baseline radiographic assessments will be performed every 6 weeks for the first 30 weeks and then every 9 weeks until radiographic progression or death. Radiographic information will be collected to determine response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. For subjects receiving post-progression doses of rovalpituzumab tesirine radiographic assessments will continue until the second event of disease progression as outlined in Section 5.3.1.1. If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory results or adverse event is achieved. Subjects no longer undergoing clinical assessments will have survival information reported approximately every 6 weeks (or as requested by sponsor to support data analysis) beginning at the last clinical assessment and continuing until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost to follow-up, or termination of the study by AbbVie.

Effusion (pleural, pericardial, etc.) assessments will be performed at each radiographical assessment and any new findings communicated to the investigator prior to the next dose of investigational product. Effusions should contribute to disease status assessment per RECIST v.1.1 only if confirmed malignant by cytology or otherwise clearly disease-related; if disease progression is suspected solely based on the appearance of new or increase of existing effusions, confirmation of malignant nature of such effusions is strongly recommended prior to making the decision on treatment discontinuation due to known adverse event profile of rovalpituzumab tesirine. If collected, effusion fluid must be tested centrally and/or locally for cytology if disease progression due to appearance/worsening of effusion is suspected. For subjects whose tumors meet the criteria of partial or complete response (PR or CR), tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 and no more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Isolated CNS-only progression will not require removal of the subject from therapy. Refer to Section 5.2.3.3, Allowed Concomitant Therapy for details associated with CNS only progression.

Dexamethasone will be co-administered orally (PO) twice daily at a dose of 8 mg to all subjects randomized to Arm A on Day –1, Day 1, and Day 2 of each 42-day cycle in which rovalpituzumab tesirine is administered. Dexamethasone dosing should occur such that there are approximately 12-hours (i.e., 10 – 14 hours) between AM and PM doses. The first dose of the dexamethasone on the day of dosing should be at least 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours prior to the rovalpituzumab tesirine infusion. If the dose of dexamethasone is vomited within 15 minutes of taking the medication, the subject should retake the medication. In the event that a subject arrives for rovalpituzumab tesirine administration on Day 1, but has not taken any or all required dexamethasone doses on Day –1 and/or Day 1, rovalpituzumab tesirine administration may not proceed, and rovalpituzumab tesirine will be held until the required dexamethasone dosing has occurred. Dosing is based on actual body weight of the subject to the nearest kilogram, assessed in the clinic on Day 1 of each cycle, and administered according to the calculated dose. In cases of weight gain due to fluid retention, dosing should be based on most recent pre-fluid retention actual weight. Subjects must meet all of the following on infusion day before receiving study drug: ●Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/μ L ●Platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL"

In cases of treatment delays of > 28 days due to toxicity, the subject will be discontinued from treatment. In cases where treatment benefit is observed, longer dose delays due to toxicity, if required, can be discussed with the TAMD. For subjects in Arm A, in the event of isolated CNS progression during Cycle 1 (see Section 5.3.2.3 ), Cycle 2 of the investigational product may be administered no sooner than 1 week after the completion of CNS disease-directed local therapy. 5.5.6.1.2 Dose Reduction Guidelines (Arm A, Rovalpituzumab Tesirine) Investigational product dose reductions and discontinuation of investigational product for specific toxicities should occur as outlined in Table 5 , Dose Reductions for rovalpituzumab tesirine Investigational Product (IP) and Table 6, Dose Reductions and Discontinuation for Unacceptable Toxicities. Dose reductions for unacceptable toxicities described in Table 6 are mandatory. Reduced dose levels are described in ( Table 5). Generally, if an unacceptable toxicity recurs after two dose reductions, treatment will be discontinued (for further details, refer to Table 6 ). If the investigational product dose is reduced, no re-escalation will be allowed. If different unacceptable toxicities occur in sequential treatment cycles (e.g., Grade 3 LFT after the first dose and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting more than 7 days after the second dose), dose reduction will proceed to the next lower dose level. If different unacceptable toxicities occur within one cycle, maximum specified dose reduction will be implemented. Dose reductions and discontinuation are not allowed for dexamethasone. If the full dose of dexamethasone cannot be administered due to an AE, the rovalpituzumab tesirine infusion should be delayed until the full dose of dexamethasone can be administered. Exceptions to the dose modification guidelines should be discussed with the TA MD prior to implementation."

If the investigative site has received topotecan centrally sourced by AbbVie, site inventory and accountability of these drugs will be performed in the IRT system and drug accountability forms will be provided. Upon receipt of a shipment of rovalpituzumab tesirine and, if applicable, topotecan, the representative at each site will; 1) open and inspect the shipment; 2) verify that the study drug has been received intact, in the correct amounts and at the correct address; 3) sign and date the Proof of Receipt (POR) or similar documentation accompanying the shipment; 4) register the shipment as received via the IRT; 5) if applicable, transfer the Temptale files (shipment temperature record) to AbbVie CDSM. Note: some regions may receive drug in shipment containers without the use of Temptales. In these instances, a special validated shipping container will be used. All study drugs must be retained in the designated secure area under proper storage conditions. This will be documented by signing and dating the POR or similar document or via direct recording in the IRT.

Rovalpituzumab tesirine has previously demonstrated promising preliminarily efficacy and tolerability in Phase 1 and 2 trials in second and later lines SCLC. Topotecan has been chosen as the comparator chemotherapy since it is currently the only approved treatment for second line SCLC. 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements The safety measures that will be used in this trial are considered standard procedures for evaluating the potential adverse effects of study medications. Adverse events and, when applicable, clinical laboratory data will be graded using NCI CTCAE, version 4.0. 9 Response will be assessed according to RECIST v1.110which includes standard criteria for evaluating response in solid tumors. The intervals of evaluation in this protocol are appropriate for disease management. Standard tests will be performed to detect the possible presence of specific antibodies to investigational product. Pharmacokinetic assessments for drug activity are also common in clinical studies. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3 highSCLC experiencing first disease progression during or following front-line platinum-based chemotherapy and meeting inclusion and exclusion selection criteria as outlined in the Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 are appropriate for this study. Such subjects are appropriate to define efficacy and safety"

This population is also suitable for topotecan treatment since it is the second line standard of care in this tumor type. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study In a recent Phase 1 study (Study SCRX16-001) with rovalpituzumab tesirine, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 0.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks based on the incidence of Cycle 1 toxicities, while the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in SCLC was chosen as 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks for a total of two doses with the allowance to retreat at the same dose level and schedule upon progression. The RPTD is based on the toxicity and efficacy profile during multiple cycles of dosing (AbbVie Stemcentrx data on file). The chosen dose regimen, two doses of 0.3 mg/kg rovalpituzumab tesirine administered 6 weeks apart, is based on the safety and efficacy observed in Study SCRX16-001, where delayed and/or cumulative toxicities were observed with both q3wk and q6wk schedules and appeared to be related to total dose administered. The dosing regimens of 0.2 mg/kg q3wk for a total of 3 doses (q3wk × 3) and 0.3 mg/kg q6wk for a total of 2 doses (q6wk × 2) were evaluated in expansion cohorts. Both regimens were tolerated, but the 0.3 mg/kg q 6wk regimen demonstrated a trend towards lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), related TEAEs, Grade 3/4 TEAEs and related Grade 3/4 TEAEs. In addition, although the 0.3 mg/kg regimen appeared to have a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, this AE was generally clinically manageable. On the other hand, objective responses appear to be more durable in subjects treated with the 0.3 mg/kg q6wk regimen based on preliminary data. Therefore, 0.3 mg/kg q6wk × 2 is the chosen dose regimen for this study. The maximum dose of rovalpituzumab tesirine in this study will not exceed 0.3 mg/kg at each dose."

Topotecan may be administered at a lower dose if required by the local label. Subjects may continue receiving topotecan until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other reason for study discontinuations. 6.0 Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for distribution. The investigational product in this study is defined as rovalpituzumab tesirine or topotecan, depending on country specific requirements. Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2). For AEs, please refer to Sections 6.1.1 through 6.1.6 . For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2. 6.1 Medical Complaints The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a routine basis throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious adverse events considered as having ""no reasonable possibility"" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide another cause of the event. For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion."

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE. Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject."

This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life- threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form."

These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered expected adverse events for regulatory reporting in SCLC subjects for this protocol. The term ""disease progression"" should not be used when reporting AEs or SAEs, instead associated symptoms should be reported. However, in cases of fatal events clearly related to the progression of disease under study the terms ""malignant neoplasm progression"" or ""disease progression"" are acceptable when the immediate cause of death is not known. 6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0). 9 If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given an outcome date and a new adverse event reported on a different date from the end date of the previous adverse event to reflect the change in severity. For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated to reflect the change in severity. When CTCAE criteria cannot be used, the event should be graded as defined below: Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject (mild). Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities (moderate). Grade 3/4 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening (severe). Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe)."

No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated. If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is given, an ""Other"" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious adverse event. 6.1.4 Deaths For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Deaths that occur during the protocol specified AE reporting period (Section 6.1.6) that are more likely related to disease progression will therefore be considered as an expected SAE and will not be subject to expedited reporting. These events should be recorded on the AE eCRF as described in Section 6.1.1.3. After the AE reporting period, deaths"

Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the AE eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term ""sudden death"" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the AE eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. 6.1.5 Adverse Event Collection Period All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 70 days, following discontinuation of study drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. In addition, protocol-related serious adverse events and protocol-related non-serious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent, only if considered by the investigator to be casually related to study-required procedures.

Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4.1). All subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures (refer to Section 5.2.4, Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing for the details on contraception) should be taken throughout the study and for at least 6 months after the last dose of study drug. Male subjects should be informed that contraceptive measures should be taken by their female partner. Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. In the event of a pregnancy occurring in the partner of an enrolled subject, written informed consent for release of medical information from the partner must be obtained prior to the collection of any pregnancy-specific information, and the pregnancy will be followed to outcome. Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.

Toxicity will be assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 4.0. 9 If a subject has an AE possibly related to investigational product administration, then dose interruptions/holds with possible modifications as described below may be implemented. Adjustments to these guidelines may occur based on the clinical judgment of the investigator with notification to the TA MD. 6.1.8.1 Management of Serosal Effusions/Serositis Serosal effusions (pleural or pericardial, or ascites) have been observed with rovalpituzumab tesirine and have the potential to be life-threatening (e.g., cardiac tamponade). Therefore, development of any of these events or worsening from baseline warrants prompt evaluation by the investigator or designee. Alternative causes such as infection, congestive heart failure, or disease progression, should be ruled out. When appropriate, a unifying diagnosis should be reported, e.g., ""heart failure,"" not the signs and symptoms ""pleural effusion"" and ""edema limbs."" When considered clinically significant (e.g., Grade 2 or higher and considered related to investigational product): ●Systemic corticosteroids, when initiated promptly, have been reported to be beneficial in some prior cases. The investigator should consider a tapering regimen, such as dexamethasone up to 8 mg orally twice a day for 5 days, followed by 4 mg orally twice a day for 5 days, then 2 mg orally twice a day for 5 days. Alternatively, nonsteroidal therapies for serositis may be considered, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen 400 – 600 mg orally three to four times daily) or colchicine (e.g., 0.6 mg orally two to three times daily) given for 1 – 2 weeks. ●Until clinical experience suggests otherwise, guidance for dose delay and/or reduction, as well as criteria for ongoing dosing, should follow Section 5.5.6.1"

Skin toxicity with rovalpituzumab tesirine may consist of photosensitivity but possibly other reactions such as palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia or erythema multiforme. As such, development of a cutaneous reaction during treatment warrants prompt evaluation by the investigator or designee. Photosensitivity reactions may occur hours to days after sun exposure. Patients should be advised to avoid direct and indirect sun exposure as much as possible from Cycle 1 Day 1 until 30 days after the final dose. When sun exposure is unavoidable, patients should wear protective clothing and sunglasses, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen and lip balm (SPF 30 or greater). 31 – 90 days after last dose, the patient may resume outdoor activities with appropriate sun protection including broad brimmed hat, protective clothing and sunscreen SPF 30 or higher If clinically consistent with photosensitivity, the AE should be reported as such (using medically accurate and descriptive AE terminology), and managed as described in Table 7. Photodocumentation of skin toxicity should be available upon request by the TA MD. The investigative site will take measures to protect the identity of the patient. These measures include taking the photograph very close to the affected skin region to exclude facial features, or if facial features cannot be excluded due to the location of the skin reaction, covering identifying features (such as the eyes) with a black rectangle. Formal evaluation by a dermatologist, including possible skin biopsy, to rule out alternative etiologies such as erythema multiforme (which may warrant discontinuation of investigational product) and to facilitate the most appropriate terminology for AE reporting, is recommended. All events of cutaneous toxicity should be monitored until resolution or return to baseline. Recommendations for management of photosensitivity reactions are outlined in Table 7."

An inquiry regarding symptoms should also be made (e.g., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash). Subjects may be retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded and results made available to the investigator immediately. All data must be recorded in the CRF. If symptoms persist or repeat testing shows AT > 3 × ULN for subjects with normal baseline measures or 2-fold increases above baseline values for subjects with elevated values before drug exposure, close observation should be initiated. If close monitoring is not possible, investigational product should be discontinued. Close observation includes: ●Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly. Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial drug has been discontinued and the subject is asymptomatic. ●Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases ●Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets"

Physical exams and monitoring of weight gain and signs or symptoms of fluid retention should be conducted during treatment. Consistent with institutional guidelines or standard practice, the use of diuretics with or without albumin may be considered in subjects with clinically significant edema and hypoalbuminemia. The selection and use of diuretics in subjects should be based on individual clinical characteristics and include monitoring of electrolyte status and signs or symptoms of intravascular volume depletion such as hypotension and impaired renal function."

Although the causal role of rovalpituzumab tesirine could not be ruled out, the reports of pneumonitis had one or more confounders including underlying pulmonary disease/cancer, prior thoracic radiation, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or clinical evidence suggestive of an alternative diagnosis including pneumonia. Heavily pretreated SCLC patients and patients with a history of pneumonitis may be at increased risk, and careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis is important. The risk of pneumonitis is increased with prior radiation to lung. In general, signs and symptoms coinciding with or preceding pneumonitis may include new or worsening cough, chest pain and/or shortness of breath, fever, and radiographic changes (reticular markings, ground glass opacities). Protocol defined disease assessments providethe opportunity for on study pulmonary monitoring with ""gold standard"" diagnostic method for detection of pneumonitis. The protocol allows for additional imaging per physician discretion for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. The diagnosis of drug induced pneumonitis is one of exclusion. Other etiologies including infection, which is a common cause of pulmonary infiltrates with clinical and radiographic appearance similar to drug-induced pneumonitis, need to be carefully considered and excluded before the diagnosis of drug induced pneumonitis can be established. If pneumonitis is suspected, close monitoring including additional laboratory and imaging investigation per institutional guidelines may be necessary. Systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial for rapidly progressive or more severe pneumonitis. For events of Grade 1 pneumonitis close monitoring is recommended; while dose modifications for Grade 2 or discontinuation of Rova-T for Grades 3 and 4 are required, please see Section 5.5.6.1 of the protocol."

The data collection plan has been minimized given the status change of this study. With all these changes, no statistical testing will be performed for the efficacy endpoints. The efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the original statistical methodologies as appropriate. The efficacy endpoints for which there is not enough data to implement the statistical models will be summarized by treatment arms. The statistical section remains unchanged to reflect the original analysis plan. 8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans This section describes the planned statistical analyses to be performed using data captured according to this protocol. A complete statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing in more detail all planned analyses will be finalized prior to database lock. The final analysis will be performed when at least 489 deaths have occurred, which is projected to be approximately 35 months after study initiation. The following analysis populations are considered: ●Randomized Set: It includes all randomized subjects, with subjects grouped according the treatment arm to which they are randomized regardless the actual treatment received, following intent-to-treat principle. The randomized set will be the analysis set for the efficacy endpoints. ●Per Protocol Set: It includes all subjects in the randomized set without any major protocol violations which may affect the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint. Major protocol violations will be defined in the SAP prior to the database lock. Subjects will be classified according to treatment assigned at the time of randomization. This set will be used for supportive analysis of efficacy endpoints. ●Safety Set: It includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and subjects will be classified according to treatment received."

A baseline measurement and at least one blood sample following a dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in this analysis. 8.1.1 Disposition of Study Subjects The disposition of subjects will be summarized by treatment arm for the randomized set. The subject disposition includes the number of subjects for whom study drug was permanently discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation), and the number of subjects who discontinued early from the study. 8.1.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized in the randomized set. 8.1.3 Efficacy Endpoints Efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the randomized set, including all randomized subjects, with subjects grouped according to the treatment assigned at randomization, following intent-to-treat principle, unless otherwise specified. Assessment of response and progression will be determined by the CRAC according to RECIST v1.1. 8.1.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis Overall survival (OS) is the primary efficacy endpoint. OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause (i.e., date of subject's death –date of randomization + 1). For subjects who are alive at the time of analysis, the data will be censored at the last date they were documented to be alive. Subjects with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. Comparison between the two treatment arms at the final analysis will be performed via a one-sided log-rank test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, testing the null hypothesis (rovalpituzumab tesirine arm (Arm A) is not superior to topotecan arm"

The hazard ratio (HR) of Arm A over Arm B will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The OS curves for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method. Two-sided, 95% confidence interval for median OS will be computed. Landmark survival rate, defined as the survival rate estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach at pre-defined timepoints from randomization (e.g., 6, 12 and 18 months), will be summarized, presenting two-sided 95% CIs. 8.1.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints are: ●Progression-free survival (PFS) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.1 ●Patient reported outcomes (PROs) – physical functioning domain at C2D1 for Rovalpituzumab tesirine arm and C3D1 for topotecan arm ●Objective response rate (ORR: CR + PR) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.1 ●Clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR + PR + SD) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.1 ●Duration of objective response (DOR) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.1 PFS is defined as the time from randomization to documented CRAC-assessed disease progression based on RECIST v1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs earlier). For the analysis of PFS, data for subjects without disease progression or death will be censored at the time of the last radiographic assessment (or, if no radiographic assessment was performed after the baseline visit, subject's data will be censored at the time of randomization plus 1 day). Data from subjects who are lost to follow-up will be included in the analysis as censored observations on the last date of radiographic assessment that the subject was documented to be progression free. The PFS rates at 6 and 12 months and corresponding 95% CIs will also be estimated using KM estimates on the PFS curve for each arm. Methods for PFS analysis are similar to those described for the OS endpoint."

Accounting for subjects who initiated a new anti-cancer therapy prior to progressive disease or death, an additional sensitivity analysis of PFS will be performed, considering the date of last radiographic assessment by CRAC prior to or on the start date of new anti-cancer therapy/procedure, as a censoring date. Analyses of ORR and CBR will be performed for the randomized subjects with at least one measureable disease at baseline. For subjects whose tumors meet the criteria of partial or complete response (PR or CR), tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 and no more than 6 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Objective response rate includes confirmed complete response (CR) and confirmed partial response (PR) assessed by the CRAC based on RECIST v1.1 from the date of randomization until disease progression or death, whichever comes first. A subject who did not meet CR or PR, including those who did not have post-baseline radiological assessments will be considered as non-responder. Comparison of ORR will be carried out using a one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors. Odds ratio will be presented with two-sided 95% CI. The difference in ORR will be provided with two-sided 95% CI. Rates and corresponding 95% exact CI will be calculated by Clopper-Pearson method for each arm.

Modified endpoints of ORR and CBR, defined as rates of response from the date of randomization until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy/procedure, disease progression, or death, whichever comes first, will be analyzed using the same methodology as that for the endpoints of ORR and CBR. Only subjects with an objective response will be included in the analysis of duration of response (DOR). DOR is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR by CRAC, whichever is recorded first) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (assessed by CRAC per RECIST 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. If a subject is still responding (i.e., has not progressed nor died after CR or PR), then the subject's data will be censored at date of the last radiographic assessment by CRAC. Methods for DOR analysis are similar to those described for the OS endpoint. 8.1.6 Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) The EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL/LC13 scoring manual will be used to transform the raw scores into the domain scores (global heath, functional scales, symptom scales/items). Physical functioning domain of the QLQ-C15-PAL PRO questionnaire is a secondary endpoint in the hypothesis testing hierarchy (see Section 8.3). The other scales will be analyzed on an exploratory basis. Change from baseline of the items and domains of the QLQ-C15-PAL/LC13 will be summarized by tr eatment arm. The EQ-5D-5L manual and the published weights will be used to convert the individual items to the utility scores. Change from baseline of the EQ-5D-5L utility score and VAS will be summarized by treatment arm. Treatment group differences will be evaluated by analyzing the change from baseline using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. Proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning will be compared between the treatment arms."

Based on a log-rank test, at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 85%, a total of 489 deaths are needed to detect an increase in median OS to 8.67 months in rovalpituzumab tesirine arm (Arm A), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.75 (i.e., a reduction in the hazard death of 25%). It is projected that an observed hazard ratio of 0.829 or less, corresponding to 1.34 months or greater improvement in median OS, would result in statistically significance in the final analysis of OS. 8.5 Interim Analysis No interim efficacy analysis is planned. 8.6 Accrual/Study Duration Considerations The total study duration and accrual duration are approximately projected to be 35 months and 24 months, respectively.

Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1 for Tumor Response Response criteria will be assessed using RECIST (version 1.1).10 Changes in the measurable lesions over the course of therapy must be evaluated using the criteria listed below. Eligibility Subjects with measurable disease at baseline can have objective tumor response evaluated by RECIST (version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology if possible. Measurability Measurable Lesions Lesions accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum size of: •Longest diameter ≥ 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm) •10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam Non-Measurable LesionsAll other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques. Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesTo be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Non-Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesPathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis."
131,page_131,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 132 Special Considerations Regarding Lesion MeasurabilityBone lesions Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as MRI/CT can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. Cystic lesions Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. 'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions with prior local treatment Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 28 days before randomization. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended."
132,page_132,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 133 Methods of Measurement Conventional CT should be performed with cuts of 5 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. This applies to tumors of the chest and abdomen. A scale should be incorporated into all radiographic measurements. MRI can be performed if required by local law, but should have sponsor approval. If prior to enrollment, it is known a subject is not able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, the decision as to whether a non-contrast CT or MRI should be used to evaluate the subject at baseline and follow-up should be guided by the tumor type under investigation and the anatomic location of the disease. For subjects who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done, the decision as to whether non-contrast CT or MRI should be made based upon discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor. For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions. The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained. Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response (PR) and complete response (CR) in rare cases. Baseline Documentation of ""Target"" and ""Non-Target"" Lesions All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other"
133,page_133,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 134 loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ 15 mm by CT scan. Only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. The short axis of the node is the diameter normally used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence (stable, increasing or decreasing) or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up. Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm."
134,page_134,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 135 Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after) or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started (baseline or after). Assessment of Target Lesions: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the 'sum' of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (< 5 mm). However, sometimes target lesions or lymph nodes become too small to measure. If it is in the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore"
135,page_135,"Rovalpituzumab Tesirine M16-289 Protocol Amendment 4 EudraCT 2016-003726-17 136 providing this default value will prevent false responses or progression based upon measurement error. Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): The disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis). Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. In this setting, to achieve 'unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest 'increase' in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. New Lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. While there are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions, the findings of a new lesion should be unequivocal; i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imaging modality or finding thought to represent something other than tumor (e.g., some 'new' bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). A lesion identified on a follow-up"

An example of this is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases. The subject's brain metastases are considered evidence of progressive disease even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. If a new lesion is equivocal (e.g., too small to measure), continued therapy and follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan."
