Synopsis Protocol Title: A Ph ase IIb, Multicenter, Open -label, Rollover Study Evaluating the Efficacy , Safet y and Tolerability of Long -acting Cabotegravir Plus Long -acting Rilpivirine Administered Every Two Months in HIV -1 infected Adults who are Virologically Suppressed and Participa ted in Study LAI116482 Short Title: Phase 2b, open -label, multicenter, rollover study to assess antiviral activity and safet y of CAB LA + RPV L A, administered every 2 months, in HIV positive participants from the LATTE study . Rationale: While advances in t hedevelopment of new anti -retroviral therapies (ART) provide extensive insights into the management of HIV -infected individuals, chronic HIV infection in adults continues to be characterized by increased development of resistant virus, increasing transmis sion of resistant virus and issues associated with the long -term toxicity of ART. The current paradigm in the treatment of HIV involves life -long therap y with multiple antiretrovirals. There is an enduring need to develop new agents with improved safet y and resistance profiles with convenient dosing for both antiretroviral treatment -naive and treatment -experienced participant s. This clinical trial, 20 9035 ( Oral ( PO) to Long Acting ( LA) Rollover -POLAR ), will evaluate a nantiretroviral treatment approach that is potentially more convenient for the participant . Participants will rollover from the LAI116482 (LATTE) study with demonstrated HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA )suppression while receiving a two-drug regimen consisting of once -daily oral CAB 30mg + RPV 25mg. The participant s will be offered the option to switch to the L A formulations of the regimen consisting of CAB LA + RPV LA for the continued maintenance of HIV -1 RNA suppression , being dosed by intramuscular injection every 2months (Q2M) or the or alfixed dose combination (FDC )of DTG + RPV for the continued maintenance of HIV -1 RNA suppression . Those entering this study who do not wish to receive injectable CAB LA + RPV L A are eligible to elect to transition to once -daily oral therapy with a sing letablet regimen (STR) of DTG + RPV for a period of at least 12 months, or until commercial availability . The efficacy of DTG + RPV , or Juluca ,is supported by data from 2 open label, controlled trials (SWORD -1 and SWORD -2) in virologically suppressed pa rticipants switching from their current antiretroviral regimen. The overall objective of t his study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of CAB LA + RPV L A every 2months in virally -suppressed HIV -1 infected antiretroviral therapy ART -experienced participant s. An evaluation of the antiviral activit y, tolerability , durability and safet y of the IM dosing regimen will be performed. This study consists of aMaintenance Period and a Long-Term Follow Up Period for participant s who withdraw and have recei ved at least one dose of CAB LA and / or RPV LA."

Change from Baseline (Day 1) in HIV dependent quality of life(HIVDQoL)at Months 6 and 12 (or Withdrawal) Change from baseline (Day 1) in total “treatment satisfaction” score, and individual item scores of the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Status Questionnaire (HIVTSQs) at Months 6 and 12 (or Withdrawal) Change in treatment satisfaction over time using the HIV Treatment Satisfaction Change Questionnaire (HIVTSQc )at Month 12 (or Withdrawal). Exploratory Explore the concept of a digital assistance program and the effect on participant participation and adherence to timeliness of injections given every 2 monthsThe number of participant swho utilize the program Adherence to scheduled date of injection To assess re ason for switching using a single question. To assess preference using a single questionThe ‘Preference” question will be used to assess preference for CAB LA + RPV LA every 2 months compared to prior oral CAB + RPV regimen, at Month 12 using a single d ichotomous preference question . The “Reason for Switch” question will be administered at Day 1 (Baseline) to assess the reasons for willingness to switch to LA injectable ART. Overall Design: Study 209035(POLAR ) is a Phase IIb, open -label, multicenter rollover study designed to assess the antiviral activity and safet y of CAB LA + RPV L A administered every 2 months in approximately 100 adult HIV -1 infected participant sfrom the LATTE study . Participant s who fulfill eligibility requirements will be enter ed intothe study to receive either CAB LA + RPV LA Q2M or the oral DTG + RPV regimen for at least 12 months, until commercially available. Participant s currently receiving oral CAB + RPV within LATTE will enter POL ARat Day 1 and choose to either transition toQ2M administration of injectable CAB LA +"
12,page_12,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 13RPV L Aor take oral DTG + RPV daily for 12 months . Eligible participant s include those originall y randomized to oral CAB + RPV in the Maintenance phase and transitioned to the Extension Phase of LATTE . The fir stinjection visit for POL ARcan be performed once the most recent central lab results from LATTE are available and safet y parameters have been reviewed, and the LATTE Week 312visit (close -out visit) has been completed (or Week 324 in the event of unavoid able delay s). Participant s will continue to receive oral CAB + RPV as scheduled within the LATTE trial until their eligibility for POLAR can be fully evaluated and the participant has chosen the new regimen. If determined to be ineligible for POLAR or participant elects to not participate in the study those participant swill be withdraw nfrom the LATTE study . Participant s in POL ARwho successfull y complete Week 300 in the LATTE study (without meeting stud y defined withdrawal criteria) will be given the op tion to receive either CAB LA + RPV LA (administered Q 2M) or oral DTG + RPV daily until study intervention is either locally approved and commercially available within the local sector (including through local public/government health sectors), the partici pantno longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA + RPV LA Q 2Mis terminated. Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discon tinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason will enter a 52 -week Long- Term Follow -Up(LTFU )Phase. Those participant s must remain on suppressive highl y active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA. The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of participant s with HIV -RNA greater than or equal to 50 c/mL at Month 12 as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm using the Intent -to-Treat Exposed (I TT-E) population.

Should a participant be allowed a repeat, results of this repeat m ust be available prior to Day 1 of this study , therefore the time needed for scheduling the Day 1 visit, lab draws and lab anal ysis should be considered. In addition to the viral load criteria above, if in the opinion of the Investigator, a participant experiences a significant safet y event while taking either CAB or RPV, study eligibility will be determined ONLY in consultation with the medical monitor. Participant s ineligible for this study will be withdrawn from LATTE. Maintenance Phase (Day 1 up t o Commercial Approval) At the Day 1visit (the start of the first month of the study ),participant s will return to the clinic, take the last dose of their oral (CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg) , and receive the first CAB LA (600 mg)+ RPV LA (900 mg) injections (wit hin 2 hours of the final oral dose of CAB + RPV ). The second loading injections will be administered 1 month (Month 2 visit, the start of the second month of the study )after initial loading dose (CAB LA 600mg + RPV LA 900 mg), with subsequent injections (CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900mg) occurring every 2 months thereafter. The dosing window for the second injection will be -7 day s from the projected dosing visit. After Month 2, a dosing window ( 7 day s) for injections is stipulated. Doses outside of the window may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval. Participant s will continue CAB LA + RPV LA until:"

Participant s will continue study intervention until: study intervention is locally approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontin uation Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted as per the Time and Events schedule. Dosing will occur according to the selected regimen. LTFU Phase –IM Regimen Only Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason must remain on suppressive HAART for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA in order to prevent selective pressure on HIV and the potential for selection of resistant mutants. Investigators must discuss the choice of the follow -up HAART regimen with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating the new regimen with the participant . HAART therapy should be initiated within 8 weeks after the last Q 2Minjection , however if withdrawn due tovirologic failure, HAART should be initiated as soon as virologic failure is confirmed. Discuss with medical monitor . The LTFU will begin the day of the last CAB LA and/or RPV L A dose and continue for 52 weeks. These participant s will not complete a Withdrawal visit, but will instead move directly into the LTFU as per the Time and Events Schedule. In addition, for participant s who withdraw during the LTFU, the final visit will be considered the study withdrawal visit. Participant s will be assessed w ith clinic visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 during the LTFU Phase. Female participant s of child bearing potential must continue to use adequate contraception methods for the entire year of follow up. In order to assure that participant s have access t o HAART during the LTFU, ViiV Healthcare may suppl y HAART regionall y or reimbursement will be provided as needed during this phase. The LTFU Phase may be shortened or terminated at any time during"

A withdrawal visit is not required for participant s who do not complete the L TFU Phase. The participant s’ last on study visit will be considered as their withdrawal visit. Dose Modifications No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed d uring the study beyond what is allowed within the protocol or directl y approved by the study Medical Monitor. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for study conduc t. In exceptional circumstances, and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, Investigators may provide oral CAB and/or RPV as a short -term “bridging” strategy for participant s who have begun CAB LA + RPV L A. Should a participant need “oral bridging”, si tes must contact the Medical Monitor for guidance on treatment strategies prior to a missed CAB LA + RPV LA dose. Should a participant not notify the site in advance, the Medical Monitor must be contacted for further treatment guidance. Supplementary stud y conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompany ing Study Procedures Manual (SPM), which is available on the online Study Web Portal.

Stud y Rationale While advances in the development of new anti -retroviral therapies (ART) provide extensive insights into the management of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV)- infected individuals, chronic HIV infection in adults continues to be characterized by increased development of resistant virus, increasing transmission of resistan t virus and issues associated with the long -term toxicity of ART. The current paradigm in the treatment of HIV involves life -long therap y with multiple antiretrovirals. There is an enduring need to develop new agents with improved safet y and resistance p rofiles with convenient dosing for both antiretroviral treatment -naive and treatment -experienced participant s. This clinical trial, 20 9035 (Oral ( PO) to Long Acting ( LA) Rollover -POLAR ), will evaluate a nantiretroviral treatment approach that may bemore convenient for the participant (see Section 4.1for study schematic). Participant s will rollover from the LAI116482 (LATTE) study with demonstrated HIV-1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) suppression while receiving a two-drug regimen co nsisting of once -daily oral cabotegravir ( CAB )30mg + rilpivirine ( RPV )25mg. The participant swill be offered the option to switch to the LA intramuscular injections of CAB LA + RPV LA every 2months (Q2M) or the oral fixed dose combination ( FDC )of dolutegravir (DTG )+ RPV for the continued maintenance of HIV -1 RNA suppression . Those enter ingthis study who do not wish to receive injectable CAB LA + RPV L A are eligible to elect to transition to once -daily oral therapy with a single tablet regimen of DTG+ RPV for a period of at least 12months, or until commercial availability .The efficacy of DTG + RPV , or Juluca ,is supported by data from 2 open label, controlled trials ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2016N287382_03 [SWORD -1]and GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2016N287539_02 [SWORD -2])in virologicall y suppressed participants switching from their current antiretroviral regimen . The overall objective of t his study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of CAB LA + RPV L A every 2months in virally -suppressed HIV -1 infected antiretroviral therapy ART -experienced participant s. An evaluation of the antiviral activit y, tolerabilit y, durability and safet y of the intramuscular ( IM)dosing regimen will be performed . This study consists of aMaintenance Period and a Long-Term Follow Up Period for participant s who withdraw and have received at least one dose of CAB LA and / or RPV LA. 2.2. Background It is estimated that 36. 7million people are currently living with HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and that the worldwide epidemic continues to grow at a rate of two million new infections and cause 1. 1million deaths per y ear [UNAIDS , 2016]. Chronic HI V infection in adults continues to be characterized by increased development of resistant virus, increasing transmission of resistant virus and issues"
26,page_26,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 27associated with long term toxicity of ART. The current paradi gmin the treatment of HIV involves life -long therapy with multiple antiretrovirals. This dependency on medical therap y requires a need for continuous improvement on the durability, tolerability and convenience of all antiretroviral classes. One approach issimplifying from an oral 3 -drug regimen to a long -acting 2 -drug injectable regimen. The 200056 study (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N168152_09 , Study [LATTE -2]) is an ongoing Phase 2b study designed to assess the indu ction of virologic suppression with CAB 30 mg dail y + two NRT Is, followed by a maintenance period where participant s are randomized (1:2:2) to continue on oral CAB 30mg + two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI s)or switch to an IM injection ofCAB LA + RPV L A administered every 4weeks (Q4W )or once every 8weeks (Q8W ). A total of 309participant s were enrolled and treated. During the Induction Phase, there was a rapid and sustained decline in HIV -1 RNA, with 91% of participant s (282/309) ac hieving HIV -1 RNA < 50c/mL through 20 weeks of therap y. There was a single participant (with known compliance issues) with confirmed virologic failure during the Induction period. Virologic testing revealed no treatment emergent phenot ypic or genot ypic r esistance in this participant . The primary endpoint for 200056 was the Week 32 proportion of participant s with HI V-1 RNA <50c/mL (Snapshot, I ntent -to-Treat Maintenance Exposed population [I TT-ME]). Following virologic suppression on three drug oral thera pyin the Induction Phase, 286participant s qualified to enter randomization at the Day 1 visit, and were subsequently randomized 2:2:1 onto once Q4W IM injections with CAB LA + RPV L A Q4W, Q8W I M injections with CAB LA + RPV LA or continuation of oral CAB + NRTI s, respectively . Through 32weeks of two -drug maintenance therapy , 95% (Q8W) and 94% (Q4W) of participant s on injectable dosing were virologic successes, compared to 91% of participant s continuing three drug oral CAB + NRTIs, meeting pre -specified criteria for comparability between the dosing arms. At Week 96, 94% (Q8W IM) and 87% (Q4W) of participant s receiving injectable dosing maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA < 50c/mL ) compared to 84% of participant s receiving oral CAB plus ABC/ lamivudine (3TC). Of the participant s receiving Q8W IM dosing, 4% failed snapshot for virologic reasons (n=2, HIV -1 RNA >50c/mL ; n=1, lack of efficacy ; n=2, withdrawal for other reasons with HI V-1 RNA >50c/mL). No participant s on Q4W I M dosing failed snaps hot due to virologic reasons. There were 2protocol -defined virologic failure (PDVFs )on Q8W dosing, and 1PDVF on the oral dosing arm, with evolution of resistance ( treatment -emergent reverse transcriptase mutations K103N, E138G, and K238T ; integrase mut ation Q148R ). A good response was observed across all arms with no significant differences between arms with regard to increases in mean Cluster of Differentiation 4 (CD4 +)cell count from Baseline. CAB LA + RPV LA was well tolerated through Week 96 for both the Q8W and Q4W dosing regimens, as demonstrated b y a low discontinuation rate due to adverse events (AEs), including injection site reaction (I SR) related AEs in either dosing arm, with no significant dose -dependent trends in safet y parameters. Thr ough Week 96, the proportion of AEs leading to withdrawal during the stud y Maintenance Period was low across all"
27,page_27,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 28arms (Q8W IM: n=2, 2%; Q4W I M: n=8, 7%; Oral CAB; n=1, 2%), with only one additional AE leading to withdrawal since the Week 48 anal ysis. Long-acting two class therap y consisting of CAB LA + RPV LA as an IM regimen has the benefit of being a NRTI -sparing regimen for long -term treatment of HIV infection which will avoid known NRTI -associated adverse drug reactions and long -term toxicities. Addi tionally , a two -drug combination therapy with CAB LA plus RPV L A may offer a better tolerability and resistance profile, as well as improved adherence and treatment satisfaction in virologicall y suppressed participant s improving the quality of life for participant s with living with HIV. Two Phase 3 studies FLAI R and ATLAS are currentl y ongoing. 2.3. Benefit/Risk A sses sment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non -clinical studies conducted with oral and CAB LA or RPV LA can be found in the Investigator’ s Brochures ( 2017 CAB IB: GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RH2009/00003/07 ;RPV IB ,2017). The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigati on strategy for this protocol: 2.3.1. Risk Assessment Oral CAB and CAB LA (GSK1265744/GSK1265744 LA) Since CAB is in clinical development and exposure in humans with or without HIV infection is limited, the clinical safet y profile in humans has yet to be full y elucidated. The following risks have primarily been identified during routine preclinical testing and/or from the clinical trial experience to date and are considered of potential relevance to clinical usage in the context of this protocol. Additional information about the clinical experien ceto date and possible risks associated with treatment using CAB can be found in the Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator section of the investigator’s brochure ( IB)."
28,page_28,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 29Potential Risk of Clinical SignificanceSummary of Data/Rationale for Ris k Mitigation Strategy Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)A small proportion of participant s in the CAB program to date (total exposure approximately 2376 to 17 Dec 2017) have developed transaminitis (elevated liver transaminases characterised by predominan t alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation). In most participant s, transient transaminitis was explained by acute hepatitis C infection (majority) and other systemic infections. In a small number of participant s, there was not an alternative explanation, suggesting a mild form of drug induced liver injury (DILI) without hepatic dysfunction, which resolved upon withdrawal of treatment with CAB. All four participant s with suspected DILI identified in Phase 2 HIV treatment studies, were receiving oral CAB.  Exclusion criteria as described in Section 5.2will prohibit participants with significant liver impairment based on screening liver chemistry including transaminases (ALT and Aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) as well on prio r medical history . Participant s with a history of chronic liver disease with ongoing inflammation and/or fibrosis will have additional confirmatory assessments to confirm suitability for entry into the study. Liver transaminases (ALT and AST) will be mo nitored throughout this study (refer to Time & Events Table) and the liver chemistry stopping criteria will be adopted as described in Section 7.1.1.1 of this protocol. Participant s will be withdrawn from CAB treatment where no compelling alternative cause is identified and DILI is suspected. Participant s who develop ALT ≥5times the upper limit of normal (ULN) while on study must consult with Medical Monitor prior to initiation or continuation of CAB LA + RPV LA. Injection Site Reactions (ISRs)Clinical, experience to date has demonstrated ISRs occur in the majority of exposed participant s treated with CAB LA but are generally mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) and include events of pain, tenderness, erythema, or nodule formation of several days duration (median duration for individual events <1 wee k).

Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSR)Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported as uncommon occurrences with integrase inhibitors (INI), including the closely relat ed compound dolutegravir, and were characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including liver injury. While there have been no clinical cases of hypersensitivity to CAB to date, there is a theoretical risk of systemi c or severe hypersensitivity reactions with or without hepatic symptoms associated with use of IM CAB. The long exposures anticipated after IM CAB injection may complicate the management of a drug hypersensitivity reaction, were it to occur. The risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction post administration of IM CAB isminimized since the participant s in this study have been administered oral CAB 30 mg + oral RPV 25 mg within the LATTE study for at least 192 weeks . Clinical assessments, laboratory tests (including liver transaminases) and vital signs will be performed throughout this study (refer to Time & Events Table, Section 8.1). Results from these assessments may aid early detection of HSR. Participant s receiving the injection would not receive further injections. During oral (oral bridge) and IM CAB"

In Phase III clinical trials, skin e vents of interest were reported at a lower incidence and grades, and resulted in fewer subject withdrawals, in the RPV group than in the EFV group and were mostly driven by the individual preferred term Rash. (and not to study drug) or to a concomitant infection, subjects must permanently discontinue study drug and be withdrawn from the study. DTG & RPV: Drug induced liver injury (DILI) and other clinically significant liver chemistry elevationsDTG:Non-clinical data suggested a possible, albeit low, risk for hepatobiliary toxicity with DTG. Drug -related hepatitis is considered an uncommon risk for ART containing DTG regardless of dose or treatment population. For subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV) co -infection, improvements in immunosuppression as a result of HIV virologic and immunologic responses to DTG -containing ART, along with inadequate therapy for HBV co -infected subjects, likely contributed to significan t elevations in liver chemistries. RPV: Hepatic events have been reported in patients receiving a RPV containing regimen. Patients with underlying HBV or HCV, or marked elevations in transaminases prior to treatment may be at increased risk for worsenin g or development of transaminase elevations with use of RPV. A few cases of hepatic toxicity have been reported in patients receiving a RPV containing regimen who had no pre -existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors.Specific/detailed liv er stopping criteria and toxicity management guidance is provided for suspected DILI or other clinically significant liver chemistry elevations (Section 7.1.1 ). DTG & RPV: Psychiatric disordersDTG: Psychiatr ic disorders including suicidal ideation and behaviors are common in HIV -infected patients. The psychiatric profile for DTG (including suicidality, depression, bipolar and hypomania, anxiety and abnormal dreams) was similar to RAL -or favorable compared wi th EFV -based regimens. The reporting rate for insomnia was statistically higher for blinded DTG+ abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) compared to efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine ( EFV/TDF/FTC )in ING114467; however, this was not duplicated in any other Phase IIb/III study conducted with DTG. RPV: In Phase 3 clinical trials the incidence and grading of depressive disorders (regardless of causality), and the incidence of episodes resulting in subject withdrawal, were comparable between the R PV and EFV treatment Subjects who i n the investigator’s judgment, pose a significant suicidality risk, are excluded from participating (Section 5.2). Because of the elevated risk in the HIV -infected population, treatment emergent assessment of suicidality will be monitored during this study through the end of the study participation . Investigators are advised to consider mental health consultation or referral for subjects who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior (Section 8.4.6 )."

DTG & RPV: Increased rates of virologic failure/ Observed ResistanceVirologically suppressed subjects switching from oral CAB + RPV to DTG + RPV may experience virologic failure/breakthrough and development of resistance. DTG: Week 96 and Week 144 analyses for the Phase III/IIIb clinical studies supported the efficacy findings from earlier analyses, and demonstrated robust maintenance of viral suppression with no finding of HIV -1 resistance in treatment -naïve subjects. RPV: In Phase III clinical trials (pooled Week 96 analyses), 3.2% of patients in the RPV arm experienced virologic failure between Week 48 and Week 96 (2.3 % on EFV).Subjects will have HIV -1 RNA measured at each study visit. Management of subjects experiencing increase in viral lo ad is described in Section 7.1.5 . DTG: Theoretical serious drug interaction with dofetilide and pilsicainideCo-administration of DTG may increase dofetilide/pilsicainide plasma concentration via inhibition of organic cation transporter (OCT -2), resulting in potentially life -threatening toxicity. The co -administration of DTG with dofetilide or pilsicainide is prohibited in the study (Section 6.11.2.4 ). DTG: Renal function Mild elevations of crea tinine have been observed with DTG which are related to a likely benign effect on creatinine secretion with blockade of OCT -2. DTG has been shown to have no significant effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or effective renal plasma flow.Specific/de tailed toxicity management guidance is provided for subjects who develop a decline in renal function (Section 8.7.7 ).

Other Clinically Relevant Information Additional details concerning safet y observations from clinical studies and for which a causal association has not been established or which are of minimal clinical significance may be found in the Investigator’s Brochures (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RH2009/00003/07 [CAB IB , 2017 ], RPV IB , 2017 , GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RM2007/00683/ 11[DTG IB, 2017 ]). Adverse Events of Special Interest: Seizure Four cases of seizures have occurred in the cabotegravir programme cumulatively through 04 May 2018 (update Date). Two of the cases occurred in HIV uninfected subjects with a prior history of seizure, of which one had CAB drug levels belo w the level of quantification 6 months prior to the event and one case involved a subject in study 200056 with circumstantial and anecdotal evidence of illicit drug use. Another case occurred in FLAIR in the context of influenza A meningoencephalitis. Over all, there is not convincing evidence that cabotegravir exposure may be causall y associated with seizure or with reduction of seizure threshold, due to the low frequency of reports, the confounders present in the cases received to date and lack of an y pre -clinical signal or identified plausible mechanism. However, seizure and seizure -like events are considered as AEs of special interest for close monitoring in studies.

42,page_42,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 432.3.2. Benefit A ssessment The antiviral activit y against HI V-1 of CAB has been well established through Phase 2a and Phase 2b studies. RPV is an established antiviral agent against HIV -1 in treatment naive participant s, with long term durabili ty (>96 weeks in Phase 3 and >240 weeks in Phase IIb). Participant s receiving CAB LA + RPV LA are anticipated to benefit from maintenance of virological suppression using LA agents. Participant s who receive CAB LA+ RPV L A Q2M dosing will not need to take c oncomitant daily oral therap y. Adherence in these participant s is expected to be improved and will be directl y observed during IM injections. Efficacy of this two -drug regimen, as IM agents, has been demonstrated through Week 96 of the ongoing 200056 stud y. This regimen may continue to offer long term safet y and tolerability benefits in these participant s. Participant swho will receiv ePO DTG and RPV are anticipated to benefit from the fact that both are conveniently dosed as a single tablet once dail y, wi thout need for a pharmacokinetic ( PK)booster, and with limited safety implications resulting from theoretical or actual drug:drug interactions compared to other ART agents (including efavirenz (EFV )and those requiring a PK booster). I n addition, the hig h barrier to resistance observed with DTG should help protect against the development of resistance to both components of the DTG + RPV regimen.

Eligibility for the POLA R Study for Participant s Entering from the LATTE Study Informed consent must be obtained prior to an y study procedures, including an y Day 1 assessment. All participant s with an undetectable HIV -1 RNA (<50c/mL) at Week 300 in the L ATTE study are eligible to enter this study . A single repeat to determine eligibility may be allowed ONLY after consultation with the medical monitor. Participant s with HI V-1 RNA 200c/mL at Week 300are not eligible to e nter the study and will not be allowed a repeat to determine eligibility . The Day 1 visit of the POL AR study will be performed in parallel with the final closeout visit for the LATTE study , Week 312 or (if contracts have not been finalized and/or institut ional review board ( IRB)approval has not been obtained by Week 312 in the LATTE study ) Week 324 .

Should a participant be allowed a repeat, results of this repeat must be available prior to Day 1 of this study , therefore the time needed for scheduling the Day 1 visit, lab draws and lab anal ysis should be considered. In addit ion to the viral load criteria above, if in the opinion of the Investigator, a participant experiences a significant safet y event while taking either CAB or RPV, study eligibility will be determined ONLY in consultation with the medical monitor. Particip ants ineligible for this study will be withdrawn from LATTE . 4.2.2. Maintenance Phase (Day 1 up to Commercial A pproval) At the Day 1 visit (the start of the first month of the study ),participant s will return to the clinic, take the last dose of their oral (CAB 30mg + RPV 25mg), and receive the first"
47,page_47,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 48CAB LA (600 mg)+ RPV LA (900 mg) injections (within 2 hours of the final oral dose of CAB + RPV ). The second loading injections will be administered 1 month (Month 2 visit, start of the second month of the study )after initial loading dose (CAB LA 600 mg + RPV L A 900 mg), with subsequent injections (CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg) occurring every 2 months thereafter. The dosing window for the second injection will be -7 day s from the projected dosing visit . After Month 2, a dosing window ( 7 day s) for injections is stipulated . Doses outside of the window may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval . Participant s will continue CAB LA + RPV LA until: study intervention is locally approved and commercially availabl e, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation the development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated. Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted as per the Time and Events schedule (Section 8.1for more information). Dosing will occur according to the selected regimen. If the IM dosing regimen ( Q2M ) is discontinued as a result of an independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC )from anot her study evaluating the same regimen, review any subsequent analy sis, or any other programmatic anal ysis, those participant s who have not met any clinical management criteria for discontinuation will be discontinue d permanentl y from the study and will ent er into the long-term follow -up(LTFU )Phase of the study . 4.2.2.1. Participant s electing to receive oral DTG + RPV once daily The DTG + RPV oralregimen will be administered in an open -label fashion starting on Day 1until Month 12 . Participant s will continue study intervention until: study intervention is locally approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted as per the Time and Events schedule (Section 8.1for more information). Dosing will occur according to the selected regimen. 4.2.3. LTFU Phase –IM Regimen Only Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/o r RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason must remain on suppressive HAART for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA in order to prevent selective pressure on HIV and the potential for selection of resista nt mutants. Investigators must discuss the choice of the follow -up HAART regimen with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating the new regimen with the participant . HAART therapy should be initiated within 8 weeks after the last Q 2Minjection , however if withdrawn due to virologic failure ,HAART should be initiated as soon as virologic"
48,page_48,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 49failure is confirmed. Discuss with medical monitor . The LTFU will begin the day of the last CAB LA and/or RPV L A dose and continue for 52 weeks. These participant s will n ot complete a Withdrawal visit, but will instead move directly into the LTFU as per the Time and Events Schedule. In addition, for participant s who withdraw during the LTFU, the final visit will be considered the study withdrawal visit. Participant s will be assessed with clinic visits at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 during the LTFU Phase. Female participant s of child bearing potential must continue to use adequate contraception methods (see Study Procedures Manual for list of accepted forms of contraception ) for the entire y ear of follow up. In order to assure that participant s have access to HAART during the LTFU, ViiV may supply HAART regionally or reimbursement will be provided as needed during this phase. The LTFU Phase may be shortened or terminated at an y time during the study for various reasons, e.g., better understanding of risks of development of resistance as CAB and RPV exposures decline, end of study timings, etc. This phase is considered study participation and participant s will be followed o n study during this time. A withdrawal visit is not required for participant s who do not complete the L TFU Phase. The participant s’ last on study visit will be considered as their withdrawal visit. 4.3. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The design of this study (open -label, multicenter rollover study )will allow for the collection of longer term efficacy , safet y and tolerability data for the CAB LA + RPV LA Q2Mregimen. This study will also allow participants in the L ATTE study who are on the oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg regimen, which will not be submitted to the regulatory agencies as a maintenance regimen for the treatment of HIV -1 infection, to be placed on a regimen currentl y being studied for those purposes (CAB LA +RPV L A). Those participants who want to remain on oral 2 drug therapy will be administered the regulatory -approved regimen of oral DTG + RPV for at least a year, until commercial approval of said regimen is met. The primary endpoint, proportion of participants defined as virologic failures by the FDA Snapshot algorithm is recommended in the FDA’s 2015 guidance document ( FDA , 2015) for assessing efficacy in Switch Trials. The key secondary endpoints, proportion with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Month 12, is also a well -established surrogate endpoint for prognosis of HIV -1 infection and disease progression. Various approaches to simplify a participant 's ART regimen, after achieving viral suppression, have been studied. Previous studies have evaluated switc hes to ritonavir - boosted PI monotherapy therap y in virologicall y suppressed patients [ Bierman , 2009 and Arribas , 2012]. While the data from these studies have shown both long -term non - inferiority and inferiority to continual HAART, they suggest that simplify ing from a three -drug dual class regimen to a single boosted protease inhibitor may be a safe and effective option for the majority of participants studied who have effectiv ely maintained viral suppression."
49,page_49,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 50The 200056 (LATTE -2) (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N168152_05 ) clinical trial evaluated a different simplification approach and served as proof of concept for POLAR. I n 200056, HIV -1 RNA suppression was induced with a three -drug antiretroviral regimen consisting of CAB + ABC/3TC FDC, and then participants switched to a two -drug two -class regimen consisting of CAB LA + RPV LA for the maintenance of HIV -1 RNA suppression. Results demonstrate that through 96 weeks on two-drug maintenance therap y, 94% (Q8W IM arm) and 87% (Q4W IM) of participants maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL ) compared to 84% of participants continuing oral CAB + 2 NRTIs. CAB LA + RPV LA was well tolerated through Week 96 for both the Q8W and Q4W dosing regimens, as demonstrated by a low discontinuation rate due to AEs, including injection site reaction (I SR) related AEs in either dosing arm, with no significant dose -dependent trends i n safet y parameters. On the basis of 200056 Week 48, and Week 96 data, Q4W and Q8W I M dosing are being progressed into Phase 3 for further clinical development, respectivel y. The CAB LA + RPV L A Q8W regimen is currentl y under evaluation in the ongoing Ph ase IIIb ATLAS - 2M study . Participants electing to receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q2M IM administration will be required to participate in clinic visits approximately every 2 months while participants electing to receive oral DTG + RPV administration will be requi red to participate in clinic visits approximately every 3 months. Importantly , secondary objectives of this study are to understand the acceptability , tolerability , and patient reported preferences to the novel injectable regimen. An unblinded study desi gn supports collection of participant preference data in a way that would not be possible if a double -blind, double - dummy design were implemented. If the Q2M arm were required to receive blinded placebo tablets every day, the value of comparing safet y, tol erabilit y, and convenience of Q2M compared to oral administrations would be limited and include overly burdensome visit requirements for those randomized to Q2M administration. Additionally , the perceived value for participants to transition from the L ATT E study to POLAR to receive the Q 2Mregimen would also be limited and may result in loss of patients with prior oral 2 drug regimen experience, thereby limiting the ability to compare and evaluate the experience gained after 6 years of treatment on an oral 2 drug regimen plus Q2Mregimen administration within individual participants . Due to the complexities, lack of feasibility and limitations of blinding CAB LA and RPV LA injections for Q 2Mcompared to oral DTG + RPV administration, this Phase 2b study is planned as open label. To maintain the integrit y of the trial, data aggregated by actual treatment group will not be made available to members of the Study Team nor Investigators in advance of the primary anal ysis. Lastl y, ascertainment bias affecting the primary efficacy analysis is unlikely since the primary endpoint is inherently objective, being primaril y determined by HIV-1 RNA laboratory assessment. The open label design should therefore have no impact on the anal ysis of study endpoints."
50,page_50,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 514.4. Justific ation for Dose 4.4.1. Long A cting Injectable for Maintenance Phase LATTE demonstrated that a 2-drug, 2-class regimen could safely maintain virologic suppression with oral CAB and RPV , which informed CAB LA and RPV LA dose selection for the Phase 2b study 200056 (LATTE -2). LATTE -2 is currently ongoing with two dosing regimens of CAB LA + RPV LA given Q4W or Q8W .Following a 20-week Induction Phase (16 weeks of oral CAB + 2 NRTIs, 4 weeks of CAB + 2 NRTI s + oral RPV) , participant s who were eligible to continue into the Maintenance Phase were then randomized (2:2:1) to receive IM injections of CAB LA Q4W (800 mg Day 1 then 400mg Q4W) )or Q8W (800 mg Day 1, 600 mg Week 4, 600 mg Week 8, then 600 mg Q8W) in combination with I M RPV LA Q4W (600 mg Day 1 then 600 mg Q4W) or Q8W (900 mg Day 1, 900 mg Week 8, then 900 mg Q8W), respectivel y, or to continue on their triple ART regimen. The Q4W dosing strategy was selected for further investigation in Phase 3 based on observed viral suppression , safet y, and tolerability at We ek 48. Both Q4W and Q8W regimens were continued throughout the Maintenance Phase of LATTE -2 as planned, and Week 96 results ( Table 1) were supportive of further evaluation of the Q2Mregimen in the present stud y. Moreover, LATTE -2 was amended to permit participant s to remain on their randomized LA regimen (either Q4W or Q8W) during the Extension Phase (post Week 96), and those participant s randomized to the oral comparator arm were allowed transition to either LA regimen at Week 96. Fort y-four participant s were transitioned from the oral comparator arm to LA treatments in the Extension Phase; 34 (77%) opted for the Q8W regimen and 10 (23%) for the Q4W regimen. Initial LA injections for these subjects were administered at Week 100.

Modeling and simulation was used to enable simplification and alignment of loading dose strategy used in LATTE -2 for both Q4W and Q8W CAB L A and RPV LA do sing regimens, resulting in selection of optimized loading dosing strategy for use in the Extension Phase of L ATTE -2 and Phase 3 studies . The Phase 3 studies FLAI R and ALTAS adopted a monthly (QM) dosing strategy with a regimen of CAB LA 600 mg IM and RPV LA 900 mg IM as initial loading doses followed by CAB LA 400 mg IM and RPV L A 600 mg IM QM. Based on positive results from the W eek96 analy sis of"
51,page_51,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 52LATTE -2, an additional Phase 3 bstudy ATLAS 2M was initiated to further evaluate bimonthly (Q2M) dosing of CAB LA 600 mg IM and RPV L A 900 mg IM administered upon initiation of long -acting treatment and again one month after the initial injection then Q2M thereafter. POLAR will transition subjects in L ATTE receiving oral CAB 30mg and RPV 25mg once dail y to t he Q2M regimen. 4.4.1.1. CAB LA Q2M The CAB LA 600 mg Q2Mregimen is predicted to achieve concentrations above 1.35 g/mL , the geometric mean trough concentration ( C)following oral CAB 10 mg once dail y,which was shown to be efficacious in the LATTE study . The lower bound of the 90% prediction interval is approximately 0.166 g/mL , indicating that 95% of participant s on this regimen should remain above the PA -IC90throughout dosing ( Figure 2). The CAB LA Q2M regimen con sists of identical 600 mg doses administered at Day 1, Month 2, and Q2Mthereafter. Observed data for the optimized Q2M regimen in LATTE -2 Extension Phase were consistent with predictions, with a geometric mean CAB trough concentration of 1.58 g/mL 4 wee ks following the reduced 600 mg IM loading dose and of 2.03 g/mL following the fourth injection.

52,page_52,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 534.4.1.2. RPV LA Q2M The RPV L A Q2Mregimen for this study (POLAR ) was selected based on safet y and efficacy data from study 200056 (LATTE -2) and supported by modeling and simulation of pha rmacokinetic data obtained following administration RPV LA administration in healthy participant s (Phase 1 studies C158, and LAI115428 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2011N112455_03 ]) and in HIV -infected partic ipant s (Phase 2 study LATTE -2), the majority of the data coming from 200056 (LATTE -2). The RPV L A 900 mg Q2Mregimen is predicted to achieve median (90% PI) stead y-state Cof 54 ng/mL (23 –112ng/mL ) (Figure 3). With this regimen, 100% of participant s remain above the RPV protein -adjusted 90% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC90)during the whole dose interval at steady -state. These data are similar to the observed Week 32 median stead y-state C in LATTE -2 for Q8W which was also 54 ng/mL and the mean C  was 58 ng/mL . The RPV L A Q2Mregimen consists of identical 900 mg doses administered at Day 1, Month 2, and Q2Mthereafter. With the second RPV L A dose administered 1month after the first dose, the anticipated me dian RPV C at Week 4 (prior to second injection) is 40 ng/mL (versus 30 ng/mL observed prior to second injection at Week 8 in LATTE -2, where the RPV L A dose at Week 4 was not included), with >92% of participant s above the RPV PA -IC90 of 12 ng/mL . Observe d data for the optimized Q2M regimen in L ATTE -2 Extension Phase were consistent with predictions, with a geometric mean RPV trough concentration of 49.9 ng/mL 4 weeks following the 900mg IM loading dose and of 57.5 ng/mL following the fourth injection."

T his supports allowance of some flexibility in the dosing regimen similar to what is currentl y practiced in ongoing LATTE -2 and ATLAS 2M studies. 4.4.1.3. DTG + RPV To date, the efficacy , PK, safet y, and drug interaction potential of DTG and RPV as individual agents have been evaluated in two extensive clinical development programs of Phase I to III clinical trials. As individual agents, DTG and RPV are both approved and marketed as T IVICAY 50 mg once dail y and Edurant 25 mg once dail y, respectively, the doses used i n the current study . Clinical data showed the absence of a drug:drug interaction between DTG and RPV. Study ING116181 was a Phase I, open -label, crossover study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of GSK1265744 and RPV and DTG and RPV in healthy adult participant s. The study showed that co -administration of RPV with DTG had no clinically meaningful effect on DTG or RPV pharmacokinetics [ Ford , 2013]."
54,page_54,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 55Co-administration of RPV with DTG had no effect on DTG area under the concentration curve from 0 hours to the time of next dosing (AUC [0-]) or maximum concentration (Cmax), and increased DTG C by 22%, while co -administration of DTG with RPV had no effect on RPV AUC(0 -) or Cmax and increased RPV C by 21%. Hen ce, based on this data there is no need for a dose adjustment from approved doses when both products are used in combination. A summary of the overall clinical development for both products is available in the IBs for the respective products [see DTG IB: G laxoSmithKline Document Number RM2007/00683/ 11, 2017 and RPV IB , 2017 ]as well as the Juluca Prescribing Information , 2017 . 4.5. End of Study Definitio n The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant ’s medical condition. Study Completion Participant s are considered to have completed the study if they remain on therap y (i.e., have not permanently discontinued study intervention ) and satisfy one of the following: Assigned to either treatment group, completed the Maintenance Phase (Month 12 for DTG +RPV participants only ), remaining on study until commercial supplies of CAB LA + RPV L A Q2Mor DTG + RPV regimen sbecome locally available or development of CAB LA+ RPV L A is terminated ; Additionally , participan ts will continue this study until: the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation Participant s who withdraw from CAB LA + RPV LA and go into the LTFU Phase will be considered to have prematurel y withdrawn from the study intervention . In addition to the 52 -week Follow -Up phase required for participant s who re ceive one or more injections with CAB LA or RPV LA, an in -clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted approximately 4weeks after the last dose of stud y medication for participant s who withdraw from the DTG + RPV regimen with ongoing AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and also an y laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant , at the last on -study visit. Assessments at the Follow -up visit should reflect an y ongoing complaints (e.g., blood draws to follow a laboratory abnormality ). Follow -Up visits are not required for successful completion of the study . 5.

64,page_64,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 656.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention received and an y discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention . Only participant s enrolled in the study may receive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention . All study intervention s must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. In accordance with local regulato ry requirements, the investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition recor ds). The amount of I P dispensed and/or administered to study participant s, the amount returned b y study participant s, and the amount received from and returned to GSK must be documented. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study intervention are provided in the Study Reference Manual. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study intervention is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff . Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or sk in contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. Product accountabilit y records must be maintained throughout the course of the study . IP accountabil ity will be evaluated using pill counts of unused I P for participant s receiving oral treatment (oral CAB andoral RPV). This assessment will be conducted each time the participant receives a new (refill) supply of IP through the withdrawal or study comple tion. IP accountability for participant s receiving CAB LA + RPV LA will be performed at the ‘vial’ level (e.g., correct number of vials were used for each injection). There may be a small amount of solution remaining in the vial which does not require qua ntification. Used vials may be discarded at the site once accountability is complete. No special preparation of study intervention is required for DTG + RPV. 6.5.1. Dosing Considerations for CA B LA + RPV LA Vials of CAB LA and RPV L A are each supplied as a suspe nsion and need no further dilution or reconstitution. Since RPV L A requires refrigeration, sites should allow the"
65,page_65,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 66vial to come to approximately room temperature prior to injecting. The vials should be gentl y inverted a few times to re -suspend sediments an d allow bubbles to subside, and then use a s yringe to withdraw the required volume of suspension for IM injection. All injections must be given intramuscularl y in the gluteus medius. Sites may use their discretion as to where in the gluteus muscle each injection is given according to individual participant circumstance. If possible, injections should be spaced approximately 2cm from one another, from the site of an y previous injection or an y injection site reaction. The time and location of injection will be captured in the eCRF. Intermuscular injections should be administered at a 90-degree angle into the gluteus medius muscle using a needle of appropriate gauge and length (In most participant s, a 1.5” 23gauge needle for CAB LA and a 1.5” 23gauge needle for RPV LA is recommended). The needle should be long enough to reach the muscle mass and prevent study drug from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underly ing nerves, blood vessels, or bone. Variable needle lengths an d/or needles with different gauge (CAB LA: 21 to 25 gauge; RPV LA: 21 to 23gauge) are permitted if needed to accommodate individual body types. Longer needle lengths may be required for participant s with higher body mass indexes (BMI s, example > 30), to ensure that injections are administered intramuscularl y as opposed to subcutaneousl y. BMI, needle gauge and length used will be collected in the eCRF. Additional details of the injection device used b y sites for IM administration including, but not limit ed to functional performance, may also be collected within the eCRF. At the Day 1visit, participant s transitioning from oral CAB + RPV should be dosed with the IM regimen within 2 hours of taking the last oral regimen dose where possible. Should I M malad ministration be suspected at any time (e.g., suspected under or overdose or inadvertent IV dosing), the investigator may consider requesting the participant stay onsite for approximately 2-3hours post dose for safet y monitoring and notifying the Medical M onitor. An ECG or any other supportive testing may be obtained at the discretion of the investigator. Additionally , a PK sample may be drawn approximately 2hours post dosing for future evaluation of CAB and RPV plasma concentrations. Additional dosing i nstructions and considerations can be found in the SPM. 6.6. Compliance with Stud y Intervention Administration When participant s are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the participant ’s eCRF. The dose of study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other tha n the person administering the study intervention . When participant s self -administer oral study intervention s at home , compliance with CAB + RPV and DTG + RPV dosing will be assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and documented i n the source documents and CRF. IP accountability will be evaluated using pill counts of unused IP (CAB ,RPV and DTG + RPV tablets). This assessment will be conducted each time the participant receives a new"
66,page_66,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 67(refill) s upply of oral study medication o r any oral bridging phase. A record of the number of CAB , RPV and DTG + RPV tablets dispensed to and taken b y each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates will also be recor ded in the eCRF. Due to the long acting nature of the CAB LA and RPV L A it will be imperative that the participant is compliant with dosing instructions. As part of the screening and participant selection process, it is imperative that Investigators disc uss with potential participant s the long-term commitments for the trial, and the importance of adhering to treatment regimens. Sites are to have plans in place for adherence counselling for both treatment arms of the stud y for the duration of the study in cluding the LTFU Phase. In addition, Investigators must have plans in place to perform visit reminders, utilizing participant trackers provided b y the study team as needed, and to verify the participant ’s contact information at each visit. I nvestigators should contact participant s directly in the event that a participant misses any scheduled visit. 6.7. Dose Modifications No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during the stud y beyond wh at is allowed within the protocol or directl y approved by the study Medical Monitor. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements is essential and required for study conduct. See Section 4.4for the justification of dose. Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompany ing Study Procedures Manual (SPM), which is available on the online Study Web Portal. Th e SPM will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information. Please refer to Appendix 10in Section 12.10 for study management information d uring the COVID -19 pandemic. 6.7.1. Protocol Permitted Substitutions 6.7.1.1. Oral Bridging In exceptional circumstances, to address pre -planned missed CAB LA + RPV L A dosing visits, in consultation with the medical monitor, Investigators may provide daily oral CAB 30mg and RPV 25mg as a short -term “bridging” strategy for participant s who have begun CAB LA + RPV L A. In certain circumstances (e.g., prior to stead y state dosing and following a > 4week oral bridge) repeating the loading doses of CAB IM and RPV I M may be re quired. Should a participant require “oral bridging”, sites must contact the study Medical Monitor for guidance with treatment and dosing strategies prior to a missed CAB LA + RPV LA dose. Please refer to Appendix 10in Section 12.10 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic."
67,page_67,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 686.8. Interruption of Study Intervention and Visit/Dosing Windows IP may be interrupted at the discretion of the Investigator in the eve nt of an AE, according to the severit y of the AE. If one or more antiretroviral medications is held due to toxicity or adverse events, all antiretroviral medications must be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance taking into account both the length of the planned interruption and the pharmacokinetic half-life of each antiretroviral of the regimen, in a way to minimize the risk of development of resistance. It is important to note that keeping to the participant ’s visit schedule is a very impor tant component to the study. Note : All decisions regarding dose interruption / resumption must be discussed with the medical monitor in advance. 6.8.1. IM Dosing Participant s receiving CAB LA and/or RPV LA are anticipated to be at risk for development of virolo gic resistance if ART is interrupted. The time period during which participant s are at risk for development of virologic resistance may be determined by the period between when drug levels fall below therapeutic values and when they fall below levels whic h exert selective pressure on HIV. This time period will vary by ART agent and is dependent upon effective concentration, inhibitory concentration, and half -life. Plasma concentrations of both L A drugs may be measurable for more than one y ear following I M injections . Any interruption in I M dosing should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Investigators should ensure that the participant initiates alternative highl y active ART to minimize the risk of developing resistance as concentrations of CAB and R PV decline over time. IM dosing is expected to occur during the week in which the participant ’s projected visit falls (as according to the date of the first injection). The first injections for participant s from LATTE on oral CAB + RPV will occur at Day 1. Since the first injection visit ( Day 1) will determine the future injection visit schedule for participant s, planning for the first injection visit date (within allowed visit windows) should take into consideration the availability of the participant s toadhere to future visit windows (planned vacations, business trips, etc.). CAB LA + RPV LA dosing for participant s transitioning from oral CAB + RPV is as follows: All injections should be planned as single injections per drug."
68,page_68,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 696.8.1.1. IM injections every 2 months (Q2M): On Day 1, participant s will return to the clinic, take the last dose of their oral (CAB 30mg + RPV 25mg), and receive the first CAB LA (600 mg) + RPV LA (900 mg) injections (within 2hours of the final oral dose of CAB + RPV). The second loading injection will be administered at Month 2(CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg, with subsequent injections (CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg) occurring every 2months thereafter. The dosing window for the second injection allows administration between -7days of t he proposed Month 2 injection visit and the proposed Month 2 injection visit date , but preferabl y not later than the proposed Month 2 injection visit date . After Month 2, a dosing window ( 7days) for injections is stipulated . the Medical Monitor must be contacted to discuss individual participant case management if a dose has to be administered outside of the window. 6.8.2. Oral Dosing Any interruption in therapy (scheduling conflicts, life circumstances, etc.) during any oral dosing period that is greater th an 7consecutive day s must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to resumption of therap y. The Medical Monitor must be contacted upon site staff becoming aware of resumption in therapy, if therap y was resumed without prior approval. Visits for participant s in LTFU are expected to occur as projected according to the last injection. 6.9. Treatment of Study Intervention Overdose For participant s receiving Oral CAB, any tablet intake exceeding a total daily dose of 30mg will be considered an overdose. For participant s receiving oral RPV, any dose exceeding a total daily dose of 25mg will be considered an overdose. For participant s receiving DTG + RPV, any tablet intake exceeding the daily number of tablets will be considered an overdose. For CAB LA and RP V LA, any single dose in excess of the studied doses will be considered an overdose. Should I M maladministration, specificall y overdose or inadvertent IV dosing, be suspected at an y time, the participant will stay onsite for approximately 2-3hours post dose for safet y monitoring and an ECG will be performed at 2hours post dose. The Medical Monitor will be notified in the event of a suspected maladministration. In the event of suspected maladministration, additional PK samples will be drawn at 2hours po st dosing for evaluation of CAB and RPV concentrations. For the purposes of this study , an overdose is not an AE (refer to Section 12.4.1 ) unless it is accompanied b y a clinical manifestation associated with the overdose. If t he clinical manifestation presents with serious criteria, the event is a SAE (see Section 12.4.2 )."
69,page_69,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 70If an overdose occurs and is associated with an adverse event requiring action, all study medications must be temporaril y discon tinued until the adverse event resolves. The Investigator should use clinical judgement in treating overdose, as ViiV Healthcare is unable to recommend specific treatment. In the event of an overdose the investigator or treating phy sician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately 2.Closely monitor the participant for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities until the I P can no longer be detected systemicall y (at least 5days for oral CAB ,oral RPV and DTG + RPV , and 52weeks for CAB LA and RPV LA 3.Obtain a plasma sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis if possible within 2days from the date of the last dose of study intervention if requested b y the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant . 6.10. Intervention after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant ’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific post -study intervention . Participant s who have successfull y completed IM dosing and 12months of oral DTG + RPV will continue to have access to both CAB LA and RPV L A and oral DTG + RPV until study intervention is either locally approved and commerciall y available, the particip antno longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA or RPV L A is terminated. 6.11. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Participant s must be advised to notify their Investigator of an y current or proposed concomitant medication, whether prescribed or over -the-counter, because of the potential for interactions between such treatments and the study medications. Concomitant medications (prescription and non -presc ription) will be permitted during the course of the study at the investigator’s discretion (except for prohibited medications described in Section 6.11.2 and should be administered onl y as medically necessary during the stud y. All concomitant medication, blood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that the drug name, route, and the dates of administration are to be recorded. For DTG + RPV, The investigator should evaluate any potential drug:drug interactions at every visit, including reviewing the most current version of the U.S and local prescribing"
70,page_70,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 71information for DTG and RPV, especially if any new concomitant medications are reported b y participant s. Any medica tion or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the stud y must be recorded along with: reason for use dates of admini stration including start and end dates dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . 6.11.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Chemoprophy laxis for HIV -associated conditions is encouraged, if appropriate, at the discretion of the participant and their ph ysician. All concomitant medications, blood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with dates of administrat ion. Because non -HIV vaccines may cause a temporary increase in the level of plasma HIV -1 RNA, it is recommended that a vaccine, if necessary , be given during or immediately after a scheduled visit after all laboratory tests have been drawn. This approach will minimize the risk of non -specific increases in the level of plasma HIV -1 RNA at the next scheduled assessment. Other IM injectables (with exceptions below) are permitted but must be administered away from the site of IP administration (should be spac ed 2 cm or more away from site of IP injection). Antacid and H2 Antagonist Use: The most restrictive dosing requirements must be taken into consideration to account for the co -administration of oral CAB and RPV . The marketed approved recommendation for ad ministration of antacids and H2 antagonists with the FDC of DTG + RPV incorporates the most restrictive dosing requirements. CAB oral administration only : Antacid products containing divalent cations (e.g., aluminium, calcium and magnesium) must be taken a t least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after CAB. Concurrent administration of multivitamins is acceptable. RPV oral administration only: Antacid products must be taken at least 2hours before or at least 4hours after RPV. H2-Receptor antagonists (e .g. cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine) may cause significant decreases in RPV plasma concentrations. H2-receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12hours before or at least 4hours after RPV. RPV should not be co -administere d with proton pump inhibitors, such as esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole."

Where possible, alternatives such as azithromycin should be considered. Please refer to the local rilpivirine prescribing information for guidance regarding other drugs that are prohibited, should be used with caution , require dose adjustment, or increased clinical monitoring if taken with rilpivirine. Drugs with a known risk of Torsade des Pointes (TdP) should be used with caution when on rilpivirine (see SPM for list of drugs associated with TdP). 6.11.2. Prohibited Medicati ons and Non -Drug Therapies The following concomitant medications or therapies are not permitted at any time during the study : HIV immunotherapeutic vaccines are not permitted at an y time during the study . Other experimental agents, antiretroviral drugs no t otherwise specified in the protocol, cy totoxic chemotherapy , or radiation therapy may not be admin istered (see Exclusion Criteria: Section 5.2). Systemicall y administered immunomodulators (such as interleukin and interferon agents) are prohibited (a list of examples is provided in the SPM). This includes topical agents with substantial sy stemic exposure and sy stemic effects. Use of topical imiquimod is permitted. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) cannot be used in participant s with acute viral hepatitis ( James , 2009). Chronic use of s ystemic (oral or parenteral) glucocorticoids must be avoided due to their immunosuppressive effect; however, short treatment courses with oral prednisone/ predn isolone/methy lprednisolone (e.g. adjunctive treatment of Pneumocy stis pneumonia with ≤ 21days of tapering prednisone) are allowed. A single dose of sy stemic dexamethasone is permitted (more than a single dose in a treatment course may cause significant decrease in RPV plasma concentration and is prohibited). Topical, inhaled or intranasal use of glucocorticoids will be allowed. Hepatitis C infection therapy is allowed , and interferon -based HCV therapy or use of an y drugs that have a potential for adverse drug:drug interactions with study intervention is prohibited t hroughout the entire stud y. For information on concurrent therapies and interactions suspected to be relevant to other antiretroviral therap y in the regimen, please consult the local prescribing information. 6.11.2.1. Concurrent with CA B and/or RPV and DTG + RPV For participant s receiving either formulation of CAB and RPV and DTG +RPV , the following medications could significantl y decrease the levels of CAB and/or RPV due to enzy me induction and therefore must not be administered concurrentl y: Carbamazepine Oxcarba zepine"

Safety data for a ll participant s who receive an y amount of study drug, including participant s who withdraw from the study , will be included in evaluations of safet y. If a participant is prematurely or permanentl y withdrawn from the study, the procedures described in the Ti me and Events Table for the in -clinic Withdrawal visit are to be performed. An in -clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication for participant s with ongoing AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) related & not r elated to study drug and also an y laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant , at the last on -study visit. All data from the Withdrawal visit will be recorded, as they comprise an essential evaluation t hat should be done prior to discharging an y participant from the study . The following actions must be taken in relation to a participant who fails to attend the clinic for a required study visit: a.The site must attempt to contact the participant and re -schedule the missed visit as soon as possible."
75,page_75,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 76b.The site must counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . c.In cases where the participant is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the participant ’s last known mailing address or l ocal equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant ’s medical record. d.Should the participant continue to be unreachable, only then will he/she be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lo st to Follow -up”. A participant may withdraw from study intervention at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioral or administrative reasons. If a participant withdraws fro m the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records . 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention Participant s unable to manage drug toxicity or tolerate investigational product (I P, either formulations of CAB or RPV , or DTG + RPV ) must have I P discontinued. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV L A who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART enter the LTFU Phase for 52 weeks of follow u p (see Section 4.2.3 ). 7.1.1.

IP will be stopped if an y ofthe following liver chemistry criteria are met: ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xUL N (>35% direct bilirubin, bilirubin fractionation required). NOTE: serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, sites s hould evaluate the presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury . If testing is unavailable and a participant meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xUL N, then the event meets li ver stopping criteria. ALT 8xULN. ALT ≥3xULN (if Baseline ALT is <ULN) with sy mptoms or worsening of acute hepatitis or hy persensitivity such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia, OR;"

ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for >2 weeks. 7.1.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria, Participant Management and Follow - up Participant s who develop AL T ≥5xULN must be followed weekl y until resolution or stabilization (ALT <5xULN on 2 consecutive evaluations). When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria is met, do the following: Immediately hold I P. If on L A therap y, do not administer another injecti on until approval is received from the ViiV Safety and Labelling Committee. Report the event to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of learning its occurrence. Complete the liver event eCRF and SAE eCRF, where applicable. Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy eCRFs if these tests are performed. Perform liver event follow up assessments (described below), and monitor the participant until liver chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to Baseline values as described below. Make every reasonable att empt to have participant s return to clinic within 24 hours for repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow -up assessments (see below), and close monitoring. A specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended. Monitor participant s twice weekl y until li ver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within Baseline values.

The site must contact GSK when this test is required. Please refer to the central laboratory manual. Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis, obtained during follow up assessments. Record the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of investigational product prior to blood sample draw on the eCRF. If the date or time of the last dose is unclear, provide the participant ’s best approximation. I f the date/time of the last dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample. Inst ructions for sample handling and shipping are in the SPM. Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehy drogenase (LDH); Fractionated bilirubin, if total bilirubin is greater than 1.5xUL N; Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosino philia; Anti-nuclear antibody , anti -smooth muscle antibody , and Ty pe 1 anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma globulins); Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography ) and /or liver biopsy to evaluate liver disease; complete Liver Imaging and/or Liver Biopsy CRF forms. Record the appearance or worsening of clinical s ymptoms of hepatitis, or hypersensitivity , fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, fever, or rash as relevant on the AE report form; Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over the counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the concomitant medications report form.

Drug Restart / Rechallenge. Following Liver Events that are Possibly Related and not related to Study intervention Following drug -induced liver injury , drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with nearl y 50% fatalit y with halothane readministered within one month of initial injury . However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y. Risk factors for a fatal drug re challenge outcome include: Hypersensitivity [Andrade , 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bilirubin >35% of total) subject currently exhibi ts severe liver injury defined by : ALT 3xUL N, bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), orINR1.5 serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenges [Hunt , 2010; Papay , 2009] evidence of drug -related preclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [Hunt , 2010]. Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI). Because of the risks asso ciated with rechallenge after DILI this should only be considered for a subject for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favourable. Approval by the VSLC for drug rechallenge can be considered where : Principal I nvestigator (PI) requests consideration of rechallenge with study treatment for a subject is receiving compelling benefit, benefit of drug restart exceeds risk, and no effective alternative therap y is available. Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of drug restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required. If the restart/rechallenge is approved b y the VSLC in writing, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the IP restart/rechallenge. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by the VSL C."
79,page_79,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 80Subjects approved b y the VSL Cfor rechallenge of I P must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as long as clinically indicated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If after study treatment rechallenge, subject meets protocol defined liver chemistry stopping criteria , study drug must be permanentl y discontinued . The Medical Monitor and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board as required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following stud y treatment rechallenge Any adverse events should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF(s) , and reported where applicable, as per Section 8.5. 7.1.1.3.2. Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study intervention Restart refers to resuming stud y treatment fol lowing liver stopping events in which there is a clear underl ying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hy persensitivity, and the study treatment should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury . Approval by the VSLC for drug restart can be considered where: Investigator requests consideration for study treatment restart if Liver chemistries have a clear underly ing cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hypotension and liver chemistries have impro ved to normal or are within 1.5 xbaseline and ALT<5xULN). Furthermore, there should be no evidence of fever, rash, eosinophilia, hypersensitivity , alcoholi c hepatitis or possible study treatment -induced liver , and the drug should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury . (If restart of TRIUMEQ or any other abacavir -containing product is being considered then the Subject must be HLA -B*5701 negativ e). Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Board approval of drug restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required. If restart of drug is approved by the VSL Cin writing, the subject must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The subject must also provide signed informed consent specificall y for the restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by the VSL C. Subjects approved b y the VSL Cfor restarting IP must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as"

QTc Stopping Criteria A participant who has a QTc interval >550 msec considered causall y related to I P will be withdrawn from the study. The QTc should be based on averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e. g., 5 to 10 minute) recording period. If an alternative cause of the QT prolongation is determined (e.g., participant receiving drug known to cause prolonged QT or TdP), the IP may be restarted (or continued) after consultation and agreement with the Med ical Monitor. RPV and RPV L A should not be administered to participant s who are receiving a drug known to be associated with TdP. When performing ECGs, the same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for, and discontinuation from, the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB, then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this indi vidual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant ’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis .Safety ECGs and other non -protoc ol specified ECGs are an exception. 7.1.3. Virologic Failure Only plasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory will be used to assess virologic failure. 7.1.4. Definition of Protocol -Defined Confirmed Virologic Failure For the purposes of clinical man agement in this study , CVF is defined as: Rebound as indicated b y two consecutive plasma HIV -1 RNA levels 200c/mL after prior suppression to <200 c/mL ."
81,page_81,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 827.1.5. Managing Virologic Failure Following stud y entr y, no changes, or intensification of ART will be permi tted prior to protocol -defined virologic failure, outside of the planned protocol regimens. Only plasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory will be used to assess virologic failure. Baseline plasma HIV -1 RNA is the assessment completed on study Day 1. The definition of confirmed virologic failure does not appl y to participants in the LTFU Phase. These participants will be followed for the emergence of viral resistance. Inadequate adherence is a common cause for virologic failure, and should be explored as a first step in the management of study participants (e.g., at the first indication of inadequate virologic response or rebound). Upon notification that a participant’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level qualifies him/her as a suspected virologic failure (SVF) , the Investigator should query the participant regarding intercurrent illness, recent immunization, or interruption of oral therap y. 7.1.5.1. HIV-1 RNA Blips HIV-1 RNA “blips” are not usually associated with subsequent virologic failure [ DHHS , 2016]. Although the implications of persistent HIV -1 RNA levels between the lower level of detection and <200 c/mL are unclear, the risk of emerging resistance is believed to be relativel y low. Participant s with transient increases in HIV -1 RNA (‘blips’ HIV -1 RNA <200 c/mL ) are not considered suspected virologic failures and do not require a change in therap y. Participant s who have a HIV -1 RNA ≥50c/mL and <200 c/mL at the key anal ysis timepoints ( Month 12and End of study must return to the clinic as soon as possible (but no later than 4 weeks after the date of the Month 12and End of study visit, respectivel y) for a repe at HIV -1 RNA test such that the result falls within the same analysis window. In order to better characterize HIV -1 RNA ‘blips,’ if there is a known reason / explanation for the blip (e.g., immunization, allergies, etc), the stud y team should be notified o f the reason and case context. If the Investigator has concerns regarding persistent low level viremia (HIV -1 RNA ≥50c/mL and <200 c/mL), the Medical Monitor should be contacted to discuss participant management. Following discussion with the Medical Monitor, additional viral load testing may be performed between visits to determine the appropriate participant disposition for the next scheduled visit 7.1.5.2. Suspected Virologic Failure Upon notification that a participant ’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level meets the definition of virologic failure, the Investigator should confirm the definition is met by initiating a repea t of the HIV -1 RNA assessment. The following guidelines should be followed for scheduling confirmatory HIV -1 RNA testing in an effort to avoid false -positive results:"
82,page_82,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 83Confirmatory testing should be scheduled within 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of an y intercurrent illness, during which time the participant should receive full dose of all study intervention . Confirmatory testing should be scheduled at least 4 weeks following an y immunization, during which time the participant should receive full dose of all study intervention . If therap y is interrupted* due to toxicity management, non -compliance, or other reasons, confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following resumption of full dose of all study intervention . The participant should have received full dose of study intervention for at least 2weeks at the time confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA testing is done. *Note: treatment interruption guidelines above may not apply for participant s on CAB LA + RPV LA treatment. The study team should be contacted to discuss any treatment interruptions for participant s meeting the definition of virologic failure. In addition, the Investigator should query the participant regarding intercurrent illness, recent immunization, or interruption of therap y. Sites should contact the Medical Monitor to discuss individual participant s, whenever necessary. 7.1.5.3. Confirmed Virologic Failure Participant s with CVF must be discontinued from study intervention . However, participant s who have received at least one dose of CAB LA or RPV L A prior to confirming virologic failure will remain in the study on oral HAART in the LTFU Phase. A plasma sample from the suspected virologic failure visit as well as Day 1 (if baseline HIV-1 RNA level 200c/mL ) will be sent for genoty pic and ph enotypic resistance testing and the result made known to the Investigator when available. A plasma sample from the confirmation visit will be obtained for storage. This sample may be used for possible future anal yses, e.g., for genot ypic and phenoty pic a nalyses of participant s who experience virologic failure. For all participant s who meet CVF, baseline and suspected virologic failure plasma samples with HIV -1 RNA level 200c/mL will be anal yzed in an attempt to obtain genot ype/phenot ype data on as man y samples as possible. Plasma samples for storage will also be obtained at unscheduled visits including confirmation of CVF. Participant s may continue to receive study drug at the discretion of the investigator until results of resistance testing are avail able at which time the participant must be discontinued from the study . Even if genot ype/phenotype data cannot be generated, participant must also be discontinued from the study intervention . If a participant is prematurely discontinued from the study intervention , the investigator must make every effort to perform the Withdrawal Visit evaluations outlined in the Time and Events These data will be recorded as they comprise essential evaluations needed to be done before discharging an y participant from the s tudy."

Refer to t he Time and Events Table for collection timepoints (Section 8.1). Refer to Section 7.1.2 for [QTc] withdrawal criteria and additional [QTc] readings that may be nece ssary . 8.4.6. Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour Risk Monitoring Participant s with HIV infection may occasionally present with s ymptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior. In addition, there have been some reports of depression, suicidal ideation an d behavior (particularly in participant s with a pre -existing history of depression or psy chiatric illness) in some participant s being treated with INIs including DTG . Additionally , depression and anxiety has been reported in some participant s being treate d with RPV. Therefore, it is appropriate to monitor and closel y observe participant s prospectivel y before and during treatment for suicidal ideation and/or behavior, or an y other unusual changes in behavior. It is recommended that the Investigator consid er mental health consultation or referral for participant s who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Participant s presenting with new onset/treatment emergent depression should be advised to contact the investigator immediately if symptoms of severe acute depression (including"
97,page_97,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 98suicidal ideation/attempts) develop, because medical intervention and discontinuation of the study medication may be required. The investigator will collect information using the Possible Suicidality -Related AE (PSRAE) eC RF form in addition to the Adverse Event (non -serious or Serious Adverse Events) eCRF form on any participant that experiences a possible suicidality -related adverse event while participating in this study . This may include, but is not limited to, an even t that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly suicide - related. PSRAE forms should be completed and reported to ViiV/GSK within one week of the investigator diagnosing a possible suicidality -related adverse event. All sites should have a plan in place for managing possible risks for suicide related events. 8.4.7. Pregnancy 8.4.7.1. Pregnancy testing Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening, and at Baseline ( Day 1). Pregnancy testing will also be conducted as per the Time and Events Table (Section 8.1) and a t any time during the trial when pregnancy is suspected. Additionally , the Medical Monitor may request that a urine pregnancy test be performed in the event of a treatment interruption greater than 7days. 8.4.7.2. Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information Pregnancy information will be collected from Day 1 until the last follow -up assessment. This includes the entiret y of the LTFU Phase. Female participant s that have received at least one dose of CAB LA or RPV LA and do not enter the LTFU Phase should use a highly -effective method of contraception ( see the SPM and Appendix 5(Section 12.5)for a listing of examples of highl y-effective hormonal contraception) until at least 52weeks after the last dose of stud y drug. If a participant becomes pregnant within 52weeks of the last dose of stud y drug the participant should notify the study site. 8.4.7.3. Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs Any individual who becomes pregnant (intrauterine) while participating in this st udy must be withdrawn from the study and must immediately discontinue study drug. Participant s who have received at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA should discontinue further dosing and continue oral HAART in the L TFU Phase (see Section 4.2.3 above), after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Any pregnancy that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinical trial pregnancy form. The investigator should inform GSK within 24hours of learning of thepregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 12.5, Appendix 5."
98,page_98,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 99Participant s who have received at least one IM injection of CAB LA and RPV L A and become pregnant during the study will hav e additional PK samples collections to monitor CAB LA and RPV LA exposure throughout the pregnancy and at the time of delivery . Additionally , there will be an optional umbilical cord blood collection at time of delivery and/or breast milk after delivery , requiring additional parental informed consent. Cord blood and breast milk samples would be used to better understand the level of PK exposure to the neonate, if any . The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination ) and status of mother and child(ren). Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the participant has completed the study and considered by the investigator as possibly related to the study intervention , must be promptly reported to ViiV/GSK. GSK’s central safet y department will also forward this information to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry . The international registry is jointly sponsored by manufacturers or licensees of ARV products. Additional infor mation and a list of participating manufacturers/licensees are available from http://apregistry .com/index.htm. 8.5. Adverse Events and Serious A dverse Events The investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events th at meet the definition of an AE or SAE. Please refer to Appendix 10in Section 12.10 for study management information during the COVID -19 pandemic. 8.5.1. Time Period and Frequenc y for Collecting A E and SA E Information Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a participant consent s to participate in the study up to and including an y follow -up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. AEs will be collected from the start of Study intervention until the final follow - up contact, at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 8.1). Medica l occurrences that begin prior to the start of study intervention but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF."
99,page_99,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 100The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in Section 12.4, Appendix 4. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study particip ants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigato r must promptly notify GSK. 8.5.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4, Section 12.4 Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions i nclude: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since y our last visit/contact?” 8.5.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initi al AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts.

SAE reporting to GSK via electronic data collec tion tool Primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for greater than 24hours, the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool and fax it to the Medical Monitor. Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic s ystem as soon as it becomes available. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool (e.g., InForm s ystem) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, the site can report this inform ation on a paper SAE form or to the Medical Monitor by telephone. Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page. The investigator will be required to confirm review of the SA E causality by ticking the ‘reviewed’ box at the bottom of the eCRF page within 72hours of submission of the SAE. The method of recording, evaluating, and follow -up of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to the medical monitor are provided in the SPM.

Disease -Relat ed Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as SA Es Disease related events (DREs) or outcomes listed in the CDC Classification Sy stem for HIV-1 Infections ( Section 12.8) can be serious/life threatening and will be recorded on the HIV -Associated Conditions eCRF page if they occur. However, these individual events or outcomes, as well as an y sign, s ymptom, diagnosis, illness, and/or clinical laboratory abnormality that can be linked to any of these events or outcomes are not reported to GSK as AEs and SAEs even though such event or outcome may meet the definition of an AE or SAE. However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The inve stigator determines that the event or outcome qualifies as an SAE under part ‘other situations’ of the SAE definition (see Section 12.4.2 ), or The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , frequency , or dur ation than expected for the individual participant , or The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to treatment with the investigational product, or Death occurring for an y reason during a stud y, including d eath due to a disease -related event, will alway s be reported promptly . Lym phomas and invasive cervical carcinomas are excluded from this exemption; they must be reported as SAEs even if they are considered to be HIV -related. If any of the above conditions is met then record the DRE on the SAE page rather than the HIV Associated Conditions eCRF page and report promptly (i.e., expedited reporting, see Section 8.5.4 ) to GSK. 8.5.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notific ation by the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study intervention (even for non -interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participant s and the safet y of a product under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a product under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific reg ulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority , IRB/ IEC and investigators."
103,page_103,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 104Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the I RB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.5.7. Cardiovascular and Death Events Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive hea rt failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularisation This information should be recorded in th e specific cardiovascular eCRF within one week of when the AE/SAE(s) are first reported. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA )terms. For an y cardiovascular events detailed above, whether or not they are considered SAEs, and all deaths, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac dea th) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data q uery prompting its completion. 8.5.8. Death Events The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. In addition, all deaths will require a specific death data collection tool to be completed. The death data collection tool includes questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and noncardiovascular death."
104,page_104,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 1058.6. Toxicit y Management Adverse e vents that occur during the trial should be evaluated b y the Investigator and graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity scales (See Section 12.3. “Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and Ped iatric Adverse Events”). Additional information regarding detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs are available in Section 8.5and Section 12.4. 8.6.1. Treatment Interruption Due to an A dverse E vent IP may be interrupted at the discretion of the investigator and according to the severit y of the AE. If one or more ART medication is held due to toxicity or AEs, all ART medications should be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance takin g into account the length of the planned interruptions and the PK half -life of each ART of the regimen, in order to minimize the risk of development of resistance. No toxicity -related dose reductions of IP will be allowed. I P should be restarted as soon as medicall y appropriate; in general, for oral dosing, this should be no longer than 14days after discontinuation (unless Grade 3 or 4 toxicities persist). Any interruption in therap y during the Maintenance Phase, oral dosing, of greater than 7consecutiv e day s must be discussed with and agreed b y the Medical Monitor prior to resumption of therap y. The Medical Monitor must be contacted upon becoming aware of resumption in therap y, if therap y was resumed without prior approval (Section 6.8). IM dosing is expected to occur during the month in which the participant ’s projected visit falls (as according to the first injection visit). An additional (+ or -) 7day window ,from the projected visit date, is stipulated for IM dosing . Any interruption outside of this guidance MUST be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to reinitiating IM IP (see Section 6.8.1 ). Guidance is provided below on general participant management and IP interruptions based on the severity of the AE. Information regarding permitted substitutions \is provided in Section 6.7.1.1 . All changes in the IP regimen must be accurately recorded in the participant ’s eCRF. Note : For participan ts receiving an ABC -containing product as part of the background regimen during the Long -Term Follow -Up (LTFU )Phase, in the event of a discontinuation of ABC for any reason, re -initiation of this drug should be undertaken with caution. The investigator sh ould obtain a complete history of the events surrounding the discontinuation of the ABC -containing product, evaluate for the possibility of a clinically suspected HSR, and initiate participant management as outlined in the L ocal Country Prescribing Informa tion, regardless of a participant ’s human leukocy te antigen (HLA )-B*5701 status. Screening for the presence of HLA -B*5701 is recommended prior to reinitiating treatment with ABC -containing products in participant s of unknown HLA - B*5701 status who have pre viously tolerated ABC but is not required to confirm study eligibility ."
105,page_105,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 1068.6.2. Grade 1 or Grade 2 Toxicity /Adverse Event Participant s who develop a Grade 1 or Grade 2 AE or toxicity may continue study drug at the discretion of the investigator. Participant s who choose to withdraw from the study due to a Grade 1 or 2 AE should have study withdrawal and follow -up evaluations completed. Participant s who develop ALT ≥3times ULN while on study must consult with Medical Monitor prior to initiation or continuation of C AB LA + RPV LA 8.6.3. Grade 3 Toxicity /Adverse Event Participant s who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity should be managed as follows: If the Investigator has compelling evidence that the Grade 3 AE or toxicity has not been caused b y IP, dosing may continue after d iscussion with the Medical Monitor. Participant s who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity, which the Investigator considers related or possibly related to the IP, should have the IP withheld and be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Once the AE is Grade 2, IP may be re -started. Should the same Grade 3 AE recur within 28days in the same participant , the I P should be permanentl y discontinued and the participant withdrawn from study . Participant s experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of I P should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and to have withdrawal study evaluations completed. A follow -up visit should be performed 4weeks after the last dose of IP. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and/or RPV L A who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFU Phase for 52weeks of follow up. Participant s with Grade 3 asy mptomatic laboratory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related ca uses, and, following discussion with the Medical Monitor, may continue IP if the Investigator has compelling evidence that the toxicity is not related to I P, with the exception of liver chemistry stopping criteria (See Section 8.7.1 ). Isolated Grade 3 lipid abnormalities do not require withdrawal of IP. 8.6.4. Grade 4 Toxicity /Adverse Event Participant s who develop a Grade 4 AE or toxicity must have I P permanently discontinued. However, if the Investigator has compell ing evidence that the AE is not causally related to the I P, dosing may continue after discussion with, and assent from, the Medical Monitor. Participant s should be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Participant s experiencing Grade 4 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of I P should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and follow -up study evaluations as noted above.

An in-clinic follow -up visit will be performed approximately 4weeks after the last dose of study medication if AEs, SAEs, or laboratory abnormalities considered potentially harmful to the participant are ongoing at the last on -study visit. Isolated Grade 4 lipid abnormalities do not require withdrawal of IP. 8.7. Specific Toxicities/A dverse Event Management General guidelines for the management of specific toxicities that are considered to be associated with treatment of HIV participant s. Parti cipant s who permanently discontinue study drug for reasons of toxicity should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and Follow -up study evaluations as noted in Section 8.5.3 . 8.7.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follow -up Criteria Liver chemistry threshold stopping criteria have been designed to assure participant safet y and to evaluate liver event etiology during administration of study drug and the follow -up phase. All Phase 3 particip ants who meet liver stopping criteria will be adjudicated b y the ViiV Safety and Labelling Committee (VSL C) –resulting in a case summary , adjudication, and management plan. The VSL C contains an external expert hepatologist, familiar with both DILI and ca botegravir, who will participate in this review. This committee meets on a 3 -weekl y basis, and can be convened on an ad hoc basis as needed. 8.7.2. Diarrhea Participant s with Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea may continue study intervention without interruption. Participa nts with diarrhea of an y toxicity grade may be treated symptomaticall y with anti -motility agents; however, the recommended dail y dose of the chosen anti -motility agent must not be exceeded. If s ymptoms persist or get worse on the recommended daily dose of the chosen anti -motility agent, then the anti -motility agent must be discontinued and consultation made with the Medical Monitor. For participant s with Grade 3 diarrhea that is unresponsive to the recommended dose of the anti -motility agents and for whic h an alternative etiology (e.g., infectious diarrhea) is not established, the treatment with the anti -motility agent and IP must be interrupted until resolution of diarrhea to Grade 2 or Baseline, after which IP and background ART may be resumed after dis cussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor. If Grade 3 diarrhea recurs within 28days upon the resumption of I P, the I P should be permanentl y discontinued and the participant withdrawn from the study . Any participant receiving at"
107,page_107,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 108least one dose of C AB LA and /or RPV LA who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFU Phase for 52weeks of follow up. If loperamide is used for treatment of diarrhea, local prescribing information should be followed with respect to dose and frequency of administration. L operamide dosing should not exceed local prescribing information. 8.7.3. Hypertriglyceridemia/ Hypercholesterolemia Samples for lipid measurements must be obtained in a fasted state according to the Time and Events table (Secti on8.1). Participant s who experience as ymptomatic trigl yceride or cholesterol elevations may continue to receive IP. Clinical management of participant s with hy pertrigl yceridemia/hy percholesterolemia should not be based upon non-fasting samples (obtained in the fed state). A confirmatory fasting trigl yceride and/or cholesterol level should be obtained prior to the institution of medical therap y for h yperlipidemia. Isolated Grade 3 and Grade 4 lipid abnormalities do not requi re withdrawal of I P. Please see the Recommendations of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group Cardiovascular Disease Focus Group [ Dube , 2003] for full discussion of management of hyperlipidemia in the context of HI V therap y. 8.7.4. Seizures Four cases of seizures have occurred in the CAB program cumulativel y through 04 May 2018. ViiV Healthcare has reviewed these cases in detail and does not believe they constitute a reasonable likelihood of causation associated with CAB. This assessment is supported by the lack of preclinical signal, class effect or known central nervous s ystem ( CNS ) mechanism, the relatively low frequency of seizures relative to expected rates in both healthy and HIV positive participant s and clinical confound ers in each case. The Sponsor considers the risk of developing seizures on the study as being no higher than that of the rest of the HIV -1 infected population. Seizures that occur on study should be managed according to the local guidelines on emergency seizure management which may include treatment with benzodiazepines, general supportive treatment, exclusion of metabolic and toxicological abnormalities using laboratory tests, septic workup and excluding underly ing structural abnormalities with neuroima ging. Where seizures occur, the Sponsor would like to better characterize these occurrences to enable s ystematic anal yses. Investigators are requested to document and report seizure or possible seizure events promptly (within 24hours of learning of the ev ent) to the Sponsor for evaluation and onward reporting. Data should be documented on the appropriate eCRF seizure page."

Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation A Grade 3 or higher elevation in CPK should result in a repeat assessment within 2 - 4weeks to e nsure the result is transient or due to exercise and will not require a change in study intervention . A history regarding use of drugs known to cause increase of CPK (such as statins) ph ysical activity or exercise preceding the CPK evaluation should be obtained. Grade 4 elevations in CPK should have a repeat assessment after the participant has abstained from exercise for > 24hours. For persistent Grade 4 CPK elevations that are considered possibl y or probably related to the IP, IP should be discontinued and the participant withdrawn from the study . Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV LA who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART enter the LTFU Phase for 52weeks of follow -up. 8.7.6. Lipase Elevations and Panc reatitis Participant s with asy mptomatic Grade 1 or 2 elevations in lipase may be followed closely for the development of sy mptoms. Participant s with asy mptomatic Grade ≥3 elevations in lipase that are considered possibl y or probabl y related to IP should ha ve IP interrupted until serum lipase returns to Grade 2. The lipase assay should be repeated within 2weeks of an y Grade ≥3 result. Participant s with persistence of Grade ≥3 lipase in the absence of other diagnoses or reoccurrence of lipase elevation (at Grade ≥2) following reintroduction of IP should permanentl y discontinue IP. Participant s with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical pancreatitis that is considered possib ly or probabl y related to IP should have I P held. After complete resolution of the episode, participant s may be re -challenged with I P after discussion with the Medical Monitor, only if the Investigator has compelling evidence that the event was not caused by IP. Upon re -challenge, lipase determinations should be performed every 2weeks for at least 6weeks after re -initiation of treatment. With any elevation of lipase of Grade ≥2 or an y recurrence of s ymptoms, the participant should discontinue I P and be withdrawn from study . Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and /or RPV LA who discontinue IP / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFU Ph ase for 52weeks of follow up. Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study Drug Approval b y VS LC for drug restart can be considered where: Liver chemistries have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hy potens ion, and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 ×baseline and ALT<3×ULN). Ethics Committee or I RB approval of drug restart must be obtained, as required."
109,page_109,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 110If restart of drug is approved by VSL C in writing, the participant must be pr ovided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by VSL C. Participant s approved b y VSL C for restarting study drug must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as long as clinically indicated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stopping criteria for liver chemistry elevations are met, study drug must be stopped.

Decline in Renal Function Participant s who experience an increase in serum creatinine from Baseline of 45micromoles/liter ( Mol/L ) (or 0.5 milligrams/decilite r [mg/dL ]) should return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 to 4 weeks. A urinaly sis and urine albumin/creatinine and urine total protein/albumin ratios should also be done at this confirmatory visit. If the creatinine increase is confirmed, the inve stigator should contact the study medical monitor to discuss additional follow -up and medical management. Participant s who have a decline in the estimated GFR (using the CKD -EPI method) of >50% from Baseline must return for a confirmatory assessment as soo n as possible [Leve y, 2009]. A urinal ysis and urine albumin/creatinine and urine protein/creatinine ratios should also be done at this confirmatory visit. I f the estimated GFR has declined b y >50% (confirmed), then stu dy drug should be withheld and the investigator should contact the stud y medical monitor to discuss the rationale for restarting study drugs (if appropriate). Consideration for confounding factors (e.g., background therap y, other medications, deh ydration, concurrent conditions) should be taken into account, and a nephrology consult may be obtained. 8.7.7.1. Proximal Renal Tubule Dy sfunctions (PRTD) PRTD is defined as: Confirmed rise in serum creatinine of ≥0.5mg/dL from Baseline AND serum phosphate <2.0mg/dL;"
110,page_110,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 111Either of the above accompanied by any two of the following: Glycosuria ( ≥250mg/dL) in a non -diabetic; Low serum potassium (< 3mEq/L ); Low serum bicarbonate (< 19mEq/L ). Participant s meeting criteria for PRTD must return for a confirmatory assessment with in 2weeks of diagnosis. A urinaly sis should also be performed at the time of the confirmatory assessment. If PRTD is confirmed participant s should have study drug withheld and the investigator should contact the Study medical monitor to discuss the rationale for restarting study drugs (if appropriate). Consideration for confounding factors (e.g., NRTI backbone, other medications, deh ydration, concurrent conditions) should be taken into account, and a nephrology consult may be obtained. If study drug is reinitiated, it should have been withheld for no more than 4 weeks. 8.7.7.2. Proteinuria Participant s with an abnormal urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, >300 mg/g, or >34 mg/mmol) that represents a change from Baseline and no associated increase in cr eatinine, should have a repeat spot urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio performed within 2 -4weeks. If confirmed, then consideration should be given to additional evaluation after consultation with the study medical monitor. Additional evaluation may inclu de a 24 -hour urine protein and creatinine measurement and nephrology referral. Participant s with an abnormal urine albumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, 300 mg/g, or >34mg/mmol and representing a change from Baseline) and a serum creatinine increase >45μmol/L (or 0.5 mg/dL) should have confirmation of both results within 2 weeks. If confirmed, the stud y medical monitor should be contacted immediatel y. Agreement on further management should be agreed between the investigator and medical monitor. 8.7.8. QTc Prolo ngation Participant s with an average QTc interval > 550msec from three or more tracings separated b y at least 5minutes should have IP discontinued. These criteria are based on an average QTc value of triplicate ECGs. If an ECG demonstrates a prolonged Q T interval, obtain 2 more ECGs over a brief period (~5 -10minutes) and use the averaged QTc values of the 3ECGs to determine whether the participant should be discontinued from the study . If an alternative cause of the QT prolongation is determined (e.g. , participant receiving drug known to cause prolonged QT or TdP), then IP may be restarted after consultation with, and agreement b y, the Medical Monitor. 8.7.9. Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) Injection site reactions will be managed through investigator assess ment throughout the study . All I SRs that are either serious, Grade 3 or higher, or persisting beyond 2weeks must be discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine etiology and assess appropriate continued study participation."
111,page_111,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 112Digital photographs may be documented where possible on all participant s who have an injection site reaction, with observable findings, that is either serious or Grade 3 or higher, or that persists beyond 2weeks. Dermatology will be consulted on all participant s who have an inje ction site reaction considered serious, Grade 3 or above, or if clinically significant and persistent bey ond 30 days and others if the Investigator or Medical Monitor feels it is medically necessary . Details regarding photo collection and an y other follow up will be given by the Medical Monitor at the time of assessment. ISR discomfort can be managed s ymptomaticall y (e.g., cold/warm compress, acetaminophen, ibuprofen) if the reaction is interfering with the participant ’s ability to perform activities of dai ly living. The required intervention should be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. 8.7.10. Allergic reaction Participant s may continue study drug for Grade 1 or 2 allergic reactions at the discretion of the Investigator. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is any worsening of s ymptoms or if further s ystemic signs or symptoms develop. Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or antipruritic agents may be prescribed. Participant s with Grade ≥3 allergic reactions that are considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug should permanently discontinue the CAB L A+ RPV LA regimen and the participant should be withdrawn from the study . Participant s should be treated as clinicall y appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. 8.7.11. Abacav ir Hypersensitivity Reaction (A BC HSR) *This section applies to participant s who discontinue LA treatment and enter L TFU and are administered a regimen containing ABC.* The most significant toxicit y associated with ABC is the well -characterized drug -related hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). A detailed clinical description of this reaction (including the t ype and severit y of events that can occur on re -challenge or reintroduction following ABC interr uption for non -HSR reasons) and guidance regarding its management are included in the L ocal Country Prescribing Information for EPZICOM. Investigators must familiarize themselves with this information on ABC HSR in the Local Country Prescribing Informatio n for each of these products prior to initiating participant s on ABC therapy . Studies have shown that carriage of the HLA -B*5701 allele is associated with a significantl y increased risk of a HSR to ABC. In the prospective stud y CNA106030 (PREDI CT-1), the use of pre -therapy screening for the presence of HLA -B*5701 and subsequently avoiding ABC in HLA -B*5701 positive participant s, significantly reduced the incidence of clinically suspected ABC HSR from 7.8% (66 of 847) to 3.4% (27 of 803) (p<0.0001). In cli nical studies EPZ108859 (ARI ES) and CNA109586 (ASSERT),"
112,page_112,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 1130.8% (4/515) and 3.1% (6/192) of participant s who were HLA -B*5701 negative and who received ABC developed a clinically suspected ABC HSR, respectivel y. In any participant treated with ABC, the clinica l diagnosis of suspected HSR (as detailed in the Local Country Prescribing Information) must remain the basis of clinical decision making. Regardless of HLA -B*5701 status, it is important to permanently discontinue ABC and not re -challenge with ABC (i.e., ZIAGEN, EPZICOM/KIVEXA, TRIZIVIR, or TRIUMEQ) if a HSR cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction. 8.7.11.1. Essential Participant Information With reference to Local Country Prescribing Information and the ‘ Participant Information and Consent Form’, Investigators must ensure that participant s are full y informed regarding the following information on the h ypersensitivity reaction prior to commencing ABC therap y: Participant s must be made aware of the possibility of a h ypersensitivity reaction to abacavir that may result in a life -threatening reaction or death and that the risk of a h ypersensitivity reaction is increased in individuals who are HLA -B*5701 positive. Participant s must also be informed that HLA -B*5701 negative individuals can also experience abacavir hy persensitivity reaction. Therefore, ANY participant who develops signs or s ymptoms consistent with a possible hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir MUST CONTACT their doctor IMMEDIATELY. Participant s who are h ypersensitive to abacavir should be reminded that they must never take an y abacavir containing medicinal products (e.g., ZIAGEN, EPZICOM, KIVEXA, TRIZIVIR, or TRIUMEQ) again, regardless of their HLA - B*5701 status. In order to avoid restarting abacav ir, participant s who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction should be asked to return any remaining EPZICOM / KIVEXA tablets to the Investigator or site staff. Participant s, who have stopped abacavir for an y reason, and particularl y due to possible a dverse reactions or illness, must be advised to contact their doctor before restarting EPZICOM / KIVEXA as more severe s ymptoms may recur within hours and may include life -threatening hy potension and death. Each participant should be reminded to read the P ackage Leaflet included in the EPZICOM / KIVEXA pack. They should be reminded of the importance of removing the Alert Card included in the pack, and keeping it with them at all times. 8.7.11.2. Reporting of Hy persensitivity Reactions If a clinically suspected case of HSR to ABC meets one of the International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH E2A , 1994 definitions of seriousness listed in Section 12.4.2 then, in addition to reporting the case as an S AE, the ABC HSR eCRF should also be"
113,page_113,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 114completed within one week of the onset of the h ypersensitivity reaction. Clinically suspected cases of HSR to ABC that do not meet criteria as an SAE can be recorded as an AE. 8.7.12. Rash Without A BC HSR Sy mptoms Including ser ious skin reactions such as Stevens -Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Erythema Multiforme or rash with significant liver dysfunction. Participant s should be instructed to contact the Investigator as soon as possible if they develop a rash on s tudy. Participant s who develop rash of an y grade should be evaluated for the possibility of an ABC HSR or a serious skin reaction such as Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrol ysis (TEN) or Ery thema Multiforme. SJS, TEN, and Ery thema Multiforme have been reported very rarely in participant s taking ABC -containing products. These participant s generally do not have the cluster of additional sy mptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal and respiratory ) that characterize the ABC HSR, but they do have features ty pical of these serious skin reactions. If a serious skin reaction develops, ABC (and / or all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the Investigators causalit y assessment) should be discontinued, and the participant should not be re -challenge d with an y ABC -containing medicinal product (i.e., ZIAGEN, TRIZIVIR, EPZICOM, or KIVEXA). As many products, other than abacavir ,also cause rash and/or serious skin reactions, all other medicinal products that the participant is receiving should also be re viewed and discontinued as appropriate. The following guidance is provided for clinical management of participant s who experience rash alone in the absence of accompany ing diagnosis of ABC HSR, sy stemic or allergic s ymptoms or signs of mucosal or target le sions. CAB is an analogue of DTG and mild to moderate rash is an expected adverse reaction for DTG -containing ART. Episodes generally occur within the first 10weeks of treatment, rarel y require interruptions or discontinuations of therap y and tend to res olve within two to three weeks. No instances of serious skin reaction, including SJS, TEN and erythema multiforme, have been reported for DTG in clinical trials. For further characterization of HSR and rash observed with DTG -containing ART, please see th e current version of the IB [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RH2009/00003/07 ]. Rash is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) for RPV. I n clinical trials, most rashes emerged during the first 4weeks of treatment, were transient, and usually mild ( Grade 1) to moderate ( Grade 2). There were no Grade 4 rashes and none were serious. Treatment - related Grade 3 rash was reported in 0.1% of participant s in the RPV group. Treatment - related rash led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% of participant s in the RPV group. No cases of ery thema multiforme, SJS or TEN have been reported during clinical development of RPV."
114,page_114,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 115Participant s with an isolated Grade 1 rash may continue study drug at the Investigator’s discretion. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is an y worsening of the rash, if an y systemic signs or s ymptoms appear, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participant s may continue study drug for an isolated Grade 2 rash. However, study drug (and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causality assessment) should be permanently discontinued for any Grade ≥2 rash that is associated with an increase in ALT. The participant should be advised to contact the phy sician immediately if rash fails to resolve (after more than 2weeks), if there is any worsening of the rash, if an y systemic signs or allergic s ymptom s develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participant s should permanently discontinue study drug [and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causality assessment] for an isolated Grade 3 or 4 rash, except where the etiology of the rash has been definitivel y diagnosed as NOT attributable to study drug (see below), and the participant should be withdrawn from the study . Participant s should be treated as clinicall y appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. Every effort should be made to collect as much information as possible about the evolution of the event and an y relationship with potentially related medical events (e.g., viral infection) or start of concomitant medication. The rash and an y associated sy mptoms sho uld be reported as adverse events and appropriate toxicity ratings should be used to grade the events (based on DAIDS toxicity gradings –see Section 12.3,Appendix 3). However, if the etiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as being unrelated to study drug and due to a specific medical event or a concomitant infection or a concomitant non -study medication, routine management should be performed and documentation of the diagnosis provided. In this situation, the study drug should be continued. Participant s in the Follow -Up Phase who are receiving ABC as part of their regimen should be evaluated for the possibility of a clinically suspected ABC HSR and managed appropriatel y as outlined in the l ocal prescribing information for ABC. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and /or RPV LA who discontinue IP / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFU Phase for 52weeks of follow -up. 8.8. Pharmacokinetics Plasma samples for determination of CAB and RPV concentrations will be collected at Day 1, Month 12 and Withdrawal visits of the study . For participants receiving oral DTG + RPV, plasma samples for determination of DTG and RPV concentrations will be collected at the With drawal visit of the study . Additional s amples will be collected for storage during the LTFU Phase (blood and plasma). Samples (blood and plasma) for determination of RPV concentrations will be protected from light at all times, from sampling collection thr ough anal ysis."

PK Sample Collection Blood samples for evaluation of CAB (2 mL each) ,RPV (2 mL each) and DTG (2 mL each) plasma PK concentrations will be collected from Q2M and oral DTG + RPV study participant s as described in Table 5. For participant s transitioning from the LATTE study and receiving the CAB LA + RPV LA Q2M regimen at Day 1, PK samples should be collected within the window of 20 - 28hours after the last oral dose of CAB + RPV was taken the day prior to the clinic visit. Participant s will take their final dose of oral CAB + RPV in the clinic at Day 1 after the pre-dose PK sample. These participant s will be expected to complete a PK dosing diary card noting the date and time of the last three oral dos es of IP prior to the scheduled clinic visits at Day 1. The information from the diary card and the actual date and time of the PK samples will be recorded in the eCRF. Additionally , dosing information on the clinic day , including dosing and the actual d ate and time of the PK samples, must be recorded on the eCRF . Plasma concentrations will be summarized and used to evaluate potential exposure - response relationships. The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring.

Samples for determination of RPV will be protected from light until anal yzed. 8.8.2. Rationale for PK Sampling Strategy Blood sampling for CAB ,DTG andRPV concentrations will be performed during the course of the stud y to evaluate PK in HIV infected participant s. The proposed PK visits and sampling scheme at each visit presented in Section 8.1is based on consideration of available PK data to support interim and final PK anal ysis planned in this study . 8.8.3. Sample A nalysis 8.8.3.1. CAB and DTG Sample A nalysis Plasma CAB and DTG analy sis will be performed under the control of PTS -DMPK, GlaxoSmithKline, the details of which will be included in the S PM.Concentrations of CAB and DTG will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved bioanaly tical methodology .Raw data will be archived at the bioanal ytical site (detailed in the S PM). Once the plasma has been anal yzed for CAB and DTG ,any remaining plasma may be analyzed for other compound -related metabolites and the results reported under a separate GSK platform technology and science -drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PTS-DMPK ), GSK protocol. No human deox yribonucleic ac id (DNA )analy sis will be performed on these samples. 8.8.3.2. RPV Sample A nalysis Plasma RPV analy sis will be performed under the control of Janssen R&D. Concentrations of RPV will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved bioanaly tical methodol ogy. Raw data will be archived at the bioanaly tical site.

Genot ypic and phenotypic anal yses may be carried out by Monogram Biosciences using, but not limited to, their Standard PhenoSense and GenoSure testing methods for protease (PRO), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase assays. 8.10.1. HIV-1 Poly merase Viral Genoty ping and Phenotyping Participant s meeting confirmed virologic failure will have plasma sa mples tested for HIV-1 PRO and RT genoty pe and phenot ype and HIV -1 integrase genot ype and phenoty pe from samples collected at the time of meeting suspected virologic failure; these results will be reported to the investigator as soon as available to provid e guidance for election of an alternative regimen. 8.10.2. HIV-1 Exploratory Analysis Additional analy ses for HIV -1 resistance may , for example, be carried out on PBMC samples collected at Baseline and/or on stored blood samples from other relevant time points. T hese anal yses may include but are not limited to additional viral genot yping and/or phenot yping, as well as other virologic evaluations such as linkage and minority species analyses, low level HIV -1 RNA quantitation and measurement of viral replicative capacity . HIV -1 PRO and RT genot ype and phenoty pe and HIV -1 integrase genot ype and phenoty pe will also be determined on the last on -treatment isolates from participants who have HIV -1 RNA 200c/mL regardless of confirmatory HIV-1 RNA. 8.11. Value Evidence and Outc omes Health outcomes assessments will be conducted according to the Time and Events Table (Section 8.1). Assessments are recommended to be administered at the beginning of the visit prior to collection of blood for anal ysis and other scheduled assessments. The original HIVTSQ included 10 items and underwent two stages of ps ychometric validation ( Woodcock , 2001; Woodcock 2006). Recently, the HIVTSQ was adapted to include injectab le treatment for HIV following a qualitative study with HIV participants in five European countries. The adaptation of the HIVTSQ included two additional items related to the mode of administration (ie: long acting intramuscular injection). These are:   Psychometric anal yses from three datasets (one from the UK, one from the USA, and one from the LATTE -2 trial) reveal that the addition of the two items in the original version of the HIVTSQ is suitable and does not reduce the overall validity of the questionnaire. The current study will be using the HIVTSQs (status version) and the revised HIVTSQc (change version) of this recentl y developed HIVTSQ 12 -item questionnaire. The HIVTSQ 12-item questionnaire retains the option of calculating the total score as if it only had the original 10 items (as the original 10 items are included in the HIVTSQ 12). CCI - This section contained Clinical Outcome Assessment data collection questionnaires or indices, which are protected by third party copyright laws and therefore have been excluded."
118,page_118,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 119In addition, it allows for calculation of an 11 -item scale score including the item (item -). The item (item - will be included in the questionnaire as a stand- alone item to evaluat e potentially painful injectables. These measures will assess change in treatment satisfaction over time (in the same subjects) and compare current satisfaction with previous treatment satisfaction, from an earlier time point. The HIV Dependent Quality ofLife (HIVDQoL) is an individualised, self- completion questionnaire, specifically designed to measure quality of life in people living with HIV. The HIVDQoL was based on Audit of Diabetes -Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) – a widel y used questionnaire desig ned previously for participant s with diabetes and linguistically validated in more than 60 languages (Bradley ,1999; Speight , 2001, Wee, 2006). The HIVDQoL includes two overview items, 26 condition- specific domain items and a free text box. The overview items ask participants to rate their generic ‘present QoL’ (7 -point Likert scale, ranging from to ) and HIV-specific ‘impact of HIV on QoL’ (5- point L ikert scale, ranging from to ). The“Preference” question will contain a single item exploring whether participants prefer the CAB LA + RPV LA injectable to the oral CAB + RPV regime nadministered in LATTE . The “Reason for Switch” question will contain a single item exploring the reasons wh y participants are interested in switching to the CAB LA + RPV LA. 8.11.1. Value Evidence and Outcomes Endpoints (Secondary) Change from Baseline (Day 1) in total “treatment satisfaction” score, and individual item scores of the HIVTSQs at Months 6, 12(or Withdrawal). Change in treatment satisfaction over time (using the HIVTSQc) at Month 12(or Withdrawal). Change from Baseline (Day 1) in HIVD QoL at Months 6, and 12, (or Withdrawal). 8.11.2. Value Evidence and Outcomes Endpoints (Exploratory ) The “Preference” question will be assessed in participant s from LATTE , to assess prefe rence for CAB LA + RPV L A Q2M to oral CAB + RPV regimen, at Month 12 using a single dich otomous preference question. The “Reason for Switch” question will be administered at Day 1 (Baseline) to assess the reasons for willingness to switch to LA injectable ART. 8.12.

Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant , temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new o r exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator ( i.e., not related to progression of underl ying disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or interm ittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinic al sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" constitutes an AE or SAE."
160,page_160,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 161Events NOT Meeting the AE Definit ion Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. The dise ase/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition tha t leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 12.4.2. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to pro gression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: oResults in death oIs life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires in patien thospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur dur ing hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalizati on for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."
161,page_161,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 162Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fu nctions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definiti on. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi talization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xUL N (>35% direct), or ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation sh ould be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required p er protocol and the threshold value does not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.4.3. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investig ators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias"
162,page_162,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 163 Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transi ent ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization 12.4.4. Recording and Follow -Up of A E and S AE AE and SAE Recording  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review a ll documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant ’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the particip antnumber, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (n ot the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An even t that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents norm al every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets a t least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe."
163,page_163,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 164Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SA E. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relation ship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also con sult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causa lity. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event befo re the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the cr iteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE  The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information."

Appendix 6: Genetics Research Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate a relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including CAB + RPV (LA and oral), DTG + RPV (oral) or an y concomitant medicines; HIV-1 susceptibility , severity and progression and related conditions. Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study . Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analy ses may be performed using data from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analy sis methods will be used. A detailed description of an y planned anal yses will be documented in a RAP pr ior to initiation of the analysis. Planned anal yses and results of genetic investigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Population Any participant who i s enrolled in the clinical study can participate in genetic research. Any participant who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic resea rch is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. A 6mL blood sample will be taken for deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the participant has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and shi pping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sample may be destro yed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample."
169,page_169,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 170The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label other samp les and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the participant by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 y ears after the last participant completes the study , or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this pr otocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Participant s can request their sample to be destro yed at an y time. Informed Consent Participant s who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the study . Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to an y blood being taken. Participant Withdrawal from Study If a participant who has consented to participate in genetic r esearch withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the participant will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if alread y collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample. If a participant withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for any reason, the inv estigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified by ViiV/GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. If a participant withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analy zed, it will not be anal yzed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been analyzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate."
170,page_170,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 171Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the participant does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then the investigator should instruct the participant that their genetic sample will be destroy ed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Participant ’s Genetic Data ViiV/GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the CSR, or separately , and may publish the results in scientific journals. ViiV/GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the participant, famil y members, insurers, or e mploy ers of individual genot yping results that are not known to be relevant to the participant’s medical care at the time of the study ,unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally prelimi nary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care."

VSLC Guidelines for Drug Restart or Rechallenge after stop for Liver criteria Drug Rechallenge refers to resuming study intervention following drug induced liver injury (DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI (see Drug Rechallenge Background below) this should only be considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine availab le, and a benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favorable ( Table 8, Figure 4). Drug Restart refers to resuming study intervention following liver events meeting stopp ing criteria in which there is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g., biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis) . Furthermore, there should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensiti vity, and the drug should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury . (Table 9; Figure 5). As this determination can be difficult, for the purpose of these guidelines, cases should be treated as rechallenges if there is any reasonable likelihood that the liver event is related to study drug. Restarts should be limited to cases in which there is clear evidence that the underlying cause of the liver event is not related to study drug. DRUG RECHALLENGE Background: Following drug -induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [ Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with ne arly 50% fatalit y with halothane re -administered within one month of initial injury . However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatalit y. Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include: hypersensitivity [Andrade , 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bilirubin >35% of total) participant currentl y exhibits severe liver injury defined by: ALT 3xUL N, bilirubin 2xUL N (direct bilirubin >35% of total), orINR1.5 prior serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenge [ Papay , 2009; Hunt , 2010] evide nce of drug -related nonclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [ Hunt , 2010])"

Appendix 10: COVID -19 Pandemic and Clinical Trial Continuit y Background The COVID -19 pandemic presents signi ficant logistical challenges for many clinical sites around the world, with variable restrictions being placed on site resources and operations, and on an individual participants ability to attend clinic visits. I n some places, medical visits are occurrin g, and in others, research clinics are operating with only emergency staff. Based on these challenges, it may be necessary to adopt additional measures and procedures to protect participant safet y,and to ensure that there are no gaps in HIV -1 treatment for participants enrolled in this clinical study , through continuous access to antiretroviral therap y. In order to maintain the scientific integrity of the study , and adhere to updated guidance from regulators, procedures have also been put into place to ens ure that the actions taken to mitigate against an y impact of COVID -19 are well documented in the trial database. A “Memo to Investigators” was issued on March 18th, 2020 and served as a record of approved emergency actions being taken within this clinical trial to manage issues related to COVI D-19. That memo continues to serve as record of approved actions which can be fully implemented b y Investigators, in advance of this protocol guidance. This appendix will remain consistent with the guidance provided within the “Memo to I nvestigators” and will also serve to provide additional protocol documentation requirements and procedures. This appendix outlines the measures which are approved for implementation within this clinical trial, to protect patient safet yand to ensure the integrity of the clinical trial, as a result of COVID -19 onl y. These measures may be implemented in accordance with an y requirements and expectations set out by local Independent Review Boards/I ndependent Ethics Committees and National C ompetent Authorities, as necessary . This appendix does not apply to participant management issues that are unrelated to a specific, and documented, impact from COVID -19. 12.10.1. Changes to Study Visits and Study Procedures Where site staff resource is constrained due to COVID -19, IM dosing visits may proceed with limited or no other protocol -defined assessments (e.g. lab tests, questionnaires, etc.). If lab tests will be missed for more than one consecutive visit, the medical monitor must be contacted, to provide guidance for safet y monitoring. For WOCBP, point of care pregnancy testing should be performed, prior to I M dosing. If central laboratory testing cannot be performed at a particular visit, and monitoring for safet y is required, tests may be performed at a n appropriately"

The site should proactivel y inform the sponsor about such instances. L ocal laboratory result s may be used to inform safety decisions. Results should be retained in source records. When on -site visits are reduced, it is important that the investigator continue collecting relevant clinical information, including adverse events, from the participant through alternative means, e.g. b y telephone contact. There may be cases where the current principal investigator (PI) of a site is indisposed for a period and may need to delegate parts of his/her duties temporaril y, e.g. to a sub -investigator. An y such changes should be documented in the site’s source records . Any permanent changes in PI should be communicated to the sponsor. There may alsobe circumstances where immediate actions are required by the sponsor and/or investigator, outside of what is contem plated in the protocol, in order to protect a stud y participant from immediate hazard. Any such measures will be carefully documented and conducted in accordance with the National Competent Authority (NCA)/I RB/IEC regulations. 12.10.2. Changes to Informed Consent Informed consent should continue per normal procedure and as described in the main body of the protocol, to the extent possible. However, there may be circumstances where re-consent of participants is needed, and a phy sical signature on site is not possibl e. In these cases, alternative way s of obtaining such re -consent should be considered, such as the participant sending a picture of his/her written consent to the investigator, or the investigator contacting the participant b y telephone or video call and o btaining verbal consent, supplemented with email confirmation. Any updated informed consent form or other subject -facing materials should be provided to participants by e-mail, mail or courier before re -consent is obtained. An y consent obtained this way should be documented in source records and confirmed by way of normal consent procedure at the earliest opportunity when participants attend their next on-site study visit. Any alternative informed consent procedure must be undertaken only after site IRB/Ethics Committee agreement and approval. 12.10.3. Permissible Use of A ntiretroviral Therapy In order to minimize the risk of gaps in HIV -1 antiretroviral therapy (ART) for participants impacted b y COVID -19 in the clinical trial, the following options can be conside red with regards to ART dosing, in order of preference:"
183,page_183,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 1841.Where possible, and safe to do, please continue to prioritize I M dosing visits in order to keep the participants on the protocol -defined regimen a.Qualified healthcare professionals (HCP s) trained on s tudy procedures can administer I M injections outside of the study clinic setting (e.g. home, nursing facility , hospital) , assuming this can be done safel y, without compromising investigational product preparation/handling/storage/accountability requirement s and done in accordance with local requirements. Please seek approval by the study team on a case -by-case basis. 2.If a participant is not able to attend an IM injection visit due to COVI D-19 related restrictions, the gap in IM dosing should be covered wi th oral ART , until IM dosing can resume. Participants should be reminded of the importance of adhering with daily oral dosing. Two options can be approved for oral bridging therapy in consultation with the Medical Monitor, listed in order of preference: a.Oral CAB + RPV i.Investigator should request availability of oral CAB + RPV supplies, prior to pursuing option b. b.Oral standard of care (SOC) commercial ART (prescribed locall y) Oral bridging with CAB + RPV The protocol permits oral bridging to cover planne d missed injections with oral CAB + RPV, only until IM dosing can be resumed. The start date of oral bridging should be within the dosing window for the missed IM dosing visit. This recommendation can be used to accommodate requests for oral dosing due to COVI D-19. Oral bridging recommendations should be followed as per protocol Section 6.7.1.1 . The process and required information for requesting oral bridging can be found in your Study Reference/Procedure Manual. Please conti nue to reach out to your stud y medical monitor for approval of oral bridging, in order to document use and to ensure expeditious shipment of oral CAB + RPV to y our site. Participants who use oral CAB + RPV as short -term oral bridging are permitted to retu rn to IM dosing, on protocol, once the COVID -19 conditions permit resumption of site activities. The investigator should reach out to the medical monitor to confirm I M restart instructions, and to ensure the participant remains appropriate for resumption of IM dosing. If oral bridging with CAB/RPV is anticipated to continue for > 2 months, additional approval and guidance should be obtained from the medical monitor to continue with oral bridging therap y. Loading/Re -initiation doses of CAB + RPV I M may be required, depending on the length of oral bridging."
184,page_184,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 185Oral bridging with Standard of Care Antiretroviral Therap y (SOC ART) For participants impacted by COVID -19, where the participant is unable to receive IM injections, andoral CAB + RPV is not available for use, oral bridging with any commerciall y available, guideline -recommended, SOC ART regimen is permitted. The start date of oral bridging should be within the dosing window for the missed I M dosing visit. Please reach out to y our study medical monitor for approval of SOC ART as oral bridging, in order to document the use of commercially available SOC ART within the study . Participants who use oral SOC ART as short -term oral bridging as a result of COVID -19 will not be considered formally withdrawn insofar as they wish to continue on the study . Individuals who bridge with SOC ART will be permitted to return to IM dosing, on study , once the COVID -19 conditions permit resumption of site activities. The investigator should reach out to the medical monitor to confirm I M restart instructions, and to ensure the participant remains appropriate for resumption of IM dosing. If oral bridging with SOC ART is anticipated to continue for > 2 months, additional approval and guidance should be obtained from the medical m onitor to continue with oral bridging therap y. Loading/Re -initiation doses of CAB + RPV I M may be required, depending on the length of oral bridging. 12.10.4. Direct -To-Patient (DTP) Shipment of Oral Study IP If a participant is unable to travel to the clinic, ei ther to receive IM injections or to be dispensed oral bridging, sites are encouraged to consider DTP shipments of drug, from the site, to the participant, to ensure access to medicines. If the stud y site is considering DTP shipment of oral CAB + RPV inves tigational product (IP), the site must first verify if DTP IP dispensing b y investigators/hospital pharmacies is locally permitted and whether it requires regulatory and/or local ethics pre -approval, or post -hoc notification. The study participant should e xpress his/her agreement for DTP shipment and the sharing of their personal information with any third -party couriers (as applicable), in accordance with local requirements. This agreement should be documented in source records. Oral CAB + RPV I P can be s hipped at ambient temperatures via ground transport without a temperature monitoring device, with low risk of temperature excursions. Sites are encouraged to use discretion in determining the need for in -transit temperature monitoring based on the labelled storage requirements and the planned mode of transport and appl y this as appropriate. Shipment of oral CAB + RPV via air courier continues to require appropriate temperature monitoring. For shipment conditions of oral medications other than oral CAB + R PV, please consult the product labelling. In all cases IP accountability must be maintained, and all DTP dispensing documentation should be reflected in source records and dispensing logs per GCP."
185,page_185,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 186Please refer to your CRA or local study manager for support with the DTP process, ensuring reference to current sponsor guidance and arrangement of a courier that can support shipment of I MP directly to participants. 12.10.5. COVID -19 Experimental A gents If any treatments for COVID -19 are planned for a study participant, please consult with the study medical monitor to ensure that relevant drug interactions are considered and to ensure that continued study participation remains appropriate. 12.10.6. COVID -19 Specific Data Capture 12.10.6.1. Capturing COVID -19 Specific Protocol Deviations In order to summarise the impact of COVID -19 in a sy stematic way and in line with regulatory authorities’ recommendations, any study -level impact around COVID -19 will be documented as a protocol deviation. This will include the permissible actions summarized in this Appendix, which are taken to protect patient safet y, including the use of CAB + RPV or SOC ART as oral bridging as well as missed visits and assessments as a result of logistical challenges resulting from COVID -19. Although the conduct of remote vi sits and the continuity of antiretroviral therap y, via oral bridging, are being utilized to protect patient safety , these events fall outside of the intent of the original protocol design, may have an impact on data interpretation, and thus will be charact erized as protocol deviations for the purposes of data summary and anal ysis. Any protocol deviations resulting from COVID -19 will be clearl y identified as such within the protocol deviation description and summarised separatel y. Please refer to your stud y procedure manual for specific details on capturing protocol deviations as a result of COVID -19. 12.10.6.2. Capturing COVID -19 Specific A Es and SA Es It is important for the study team to describe COVID -19 related adverse events/serious adverse and their impact on s tudy data and outcomes. Standardization of case definitions will facilitate future data anal ysis. Please use the following guidance: 1.AEs should continue to be evaluated as to whether they meet SAE criteria as defined in the protocol, and if so, submitted according to established SAE reporting requirements. SAEs and AEs should be submitted following usual study procedures and timelines."
186,page_186,"2018N356280_0 2 CONFIDENTIA L 209035 1872.When an in -person clinic visit is not possible, please conduct a remote telehealth visit to assess for, and document an y AEs/SAEs. 3.Investigators should use the WHO definition to classify COVID -19 cases . The definition below, released March 20, 2020, represents a time point for standardized collection. We recognize definitions are likel y to continue to evolve. When reporti ng both serious and non -serious adverse events (related to COVI D-19 infection, investigators should use the following Verbatim terms: a)Suspected COVID -19 infection; or b)Probable COVID -19 infection; or c)Confirmed COVID -19 infection 4.Sites should contact t he study Medical Monitor for questions related to definitions and reporting, and decisions around impact to study drug continuation. 5.A new COVID -19 infection Case Report Form will be added to the eCRF to collect additional details about the reported COVI D-19 AE or SAE data. It is important to collect the correct information from each participant reporting a COVID -19 AE or SAE . Therefore ,please use the CRF templates to help you collect this information , once available. WHO Case Definition -March 20, 20 20 Version ( https://www.who.int/publications - detail/global -surveillance -for-human -infection -with-novel -coronavirus -(2019 -ncov)) : Suspected case: A.A patient with acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/sy mptom of respiratory disease, e.g., cough, shortness of breath), AND a history of travel to or residence in a location reporting community transmission of COVI D-19 disease during the 14 day s prior to sy mptom onset; OR B.A patient with an y acute respiratory illness AND in contact (see definit ion of “contact” below) with a confirmed or probable COVID -19 case (see definition of contact) in the last 14 days prior to s ymptom onset; OR C.A patient with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and at least one sign/sy mptom of respiratory disease, e.g ., cough, shortness of breath; AND requiring hospitalization) AND in the absence of an alternative diagnosis that fully explains the clinical presentation."
