Participants will be randomly assigned to timing o f surgery (early – within 6 weeks of injury vs. delayed – surgery 3 to 4 months after injury ) and timing of post-operative rehabilitation (early – weightbearing as tolerated [WBAT] gait and unrestricted range of motion [ROM] exercises starting within one week of surgery or delayed – non- weightbearing [NWB] gait and limited ROM for four weeks). Subjects that cannot be randomized to timing of surgery will be randomized to only timing of rehabilitation in a separate parallel trial. Participants return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports participation and patient -reported physical function will be monitored over 24 months follow -up. Objectives: To investigate the effects of timing of surgery (early vs. delayed) and timing of post -op rehabilitation (early vs. delayed) for the treatment of military personnel and civilians that have sustained a MLKI on time to return to pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports participation and patient reported physical function. Secondary outcome measures will include additional knee- specific and general patient -reported measures of physical function and health related quality of life, recovery of range of motion (ROM), arthrofibrosis, residual laxity, complications/adverse events, re- injury and additional surgical procedures. The specific aims are: Aim 1 : Determine the effects of timing of surgery and post - operative rehabilitation on time to return to pre -injury level of military duty, work and sports and patient -reported physical function. We hypothesize that early surgery, early rehabilitation and the combination of early surgery with early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports and better patient - reported physical function. Aim 2 : Determine the effects of timing of rehabilitation on time to return pre -injury level of military duty, work and"

We hypothesize that early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports activity and better patient -reported physical function. Population: A total of 690 (392 for Aim 1 and 298 for Aim 2) male and female military personnel and civilians between the ages of 16 and 55 with a MLKI (complete grade III injury of two or more ligaments) without a history of prior knee ligament reconstruction will be eligible to participate in the clinical trials. Individuals with a torn or avulsed patellar or quadriceps tendon, fracture that precludes adherence to post -operative care guidelines or use of an external fixator to maintain reduction of the knee for greater than 10 days, that are unable to WB on the con tralateral uninjured leg or have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) that limits their ability to participate in their post-operative care will be excluded from participation in these studies. Phase: III Number of Sites: 25 Description of Intervention: To address Aim 1, individuals with a MLKI that present within 6 weeks of injury will be randomized to early (within 6 weeks of injury) or delayed (12 to 16 weeks after injury) surgery and early (WB and unrestricted ROM exercises starting first week after surgery) vs. delayed (non- WB and knee locked in extension for the first four post -op weeks) rehabilitation. To address Aim 2, individuals with a MLKI that present greater than 6 weeks after injury, have an injury that precludes randomization to early or delayed surgery as well as those that refuse surgical randomization will be eligible to participate in the trial that compares only early vs. delayed rehabilitation.

These injuries are potentially devastating and are often associated with significant injury to multiple structures of the knee including the capsule, tendons, menisci, chondral surfaces, bone, nerves and blood vessels. Concomitant injuries may include those to the popliteal artery, 1 tibial nerve, peroneal nerve,1,2 joint capsule, patellar, quadriceps, biceps and/or popliteus tendons, iliotibial band, medial or lateral menisci and/or fractures. 3 Because of the extensive nature of injury, treatment for MLKIs creates multiple complex problems fraught with complications4-6 As such, MLKIs often have adverse effects on the long -term healt h of the knee7,8and frequently lead to restricted participation in military duty, work and sports.9,10 and early separation from the military. While multiple studies have reported treatment algorithms and outcomes for MLKIs, many of these studies are retrospective in nature with small sample sizes. Only a few prospective studies have been published and t o date there are no randomized controlled studies that have investigated optimal treatment methods for these complex knee injuries. The lack of high -level evidence related to treatment of MLKIs is due to both the heterogeneity of the injury and the relatively low incidence of MLKIs compared to isolated ligament injury. A precise estimate of the number of knee dislocations has not been determined , however it has been estimated that for every 1400 orthopaedic injuries there is one knee dislocation. 11 Furthermore, the incidence of MLKIs is likely under -estimated because many of the knee dislocations spontaneously reduce and are misdiagnosed.

Despite their relatively low incidence, MLKIs and knee dislocations are associated with a high rate of adverse outcomes due to poor wound healing, arthrofibrosis, neurovascular injuries, persistent pain and instability and PTOA, resulting in residual disability and high direct and indirect health care costs. Functionally, patients have few limitations with activities of daily liv ing but are frequently limited with higher demand activities such as those associated with military training, physical labor and sports. 9 Impact of Multiple Ligament Knee Injuries on Military Duty, Work, and Sports Multiple ligament knee injuries result in significant time lost from military duty, work and sports.9,13-15 In many cases, patients are unable to return to their pre- injury military duty, work, or sports. In fact, the return to duty rate after combat -related MLKIs has been reported as low as 41% 13to 50%9 and is substantially lower than the average reported civilian return to work rate of 81%.10,16,17 The most commonly cited reasons for individuals not being able to return to work after a MLKI are knee pain (53%), instability (26%) and concurrent injuries (26%).16 While these studies indicate the majority of civilians with a MLKI return to work, neither the influence of the physical work demands or the prec ise time for return to work have been considered, which are both needed to fully understand the economic and societal costs of these devastating injuries. Reported return to sports rates after MLKI are generally lower than return to work rates, ranging f rom 17% to 81%, with a mean of 50%. 10 For competitive athletes, only 22% were able to return to the same level of competitive sports.18 A similarly low return to sports rate of 17% was observed among military service members after MLKI.9 The ability to return to sports after a MLKI appears to depend on the pre- injury level of sports in which the individual participates. A greater percentage of individuals with a low level of pre -injury activity were able to return to a similar level of activity compared to patients with a higher pre -injury activity level. 18 Factors associated with the inability to return to"

Furthe rmore, the majority of the studies are retrospective in nature with limited sample sizes and none have prospectively determined the time required to return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports, which from the military’s perspective is of primary in terest and highly relevant to unit readiness and return to duty capabilities. Association Between Multiple Ligament Knee Injuries and Premature Development of Arthritis Post- traumatic osteoarthritis arthritis (PTOA) is the most common long -term complicatio n of a MLKI.8,19 At a minimum of two years follow -up, 87% of knees with a MLKI had grade 2 or worse Kellgren & Lawrence arthritic changes on radiographs, in contrast to only 35% of uninjured knees. 8 Richter et al. reported similar rates of arthritis (68% Grade 2 or worse) at a mean of 8- years follow -up, and perhaps most importantly found an inverse relationship between PTOA and knee stability at follow -up, suggesting that surgical restoration of native knee stability may decrease the risk of PTOA. The robust link between MLKI and premature development of knee osteoarthritis (OA) is especially pertinent for the military population. Knee OA represents an exceptionally large occupational burden for military personnel, 7 and affects military service members at higher rates than their civilian counterparts.20,21 The overall rate of arthritis in military service members has been rising, and the incidence of PTOA in the military has risen 100% since 2005. 7 A recent review of U.S. Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) data for 1566 combat -injured service members reported that 100% of battlefield knee injuries resulted in PTOA.21 The implications of this rising incidence are staggering considering that the most com mon reason for disability -related medical separation for military service members is OA.21,22 The development of PTOA following a MLKI is at least in part due to the inability to restore normal structure and function of the knee.

We believe that determining the optimal time for surgery and initiation of post -op rehabilitation may reduce residual knee impairments that contribute to development of PTOA. Because of the extended time to develop PTOA, PTOA as an outcome measure will not be included in this study, however we will consider follow -on studies to assess long -term outcomes, including PTOA, of the subjects that participate in this study. Rivera et al. 21 provided a fitting summar y for this study by stating that “PTOA is common in the battlefield population,” and recommended that future studies should focus on “identification of clear treatment -related factors” that contribute to the development of PTOA, including “timing of surger y for intra -articular injuries” and “optimum rehabilitation strategies.” Controversies in Surgical Management of Multiple Ligament Knee Injuries While there are a number of controversies related to treatment of MKLIs, the literature has consistently demonstrated that operative management is superior to non- operative management of MLKIs. 10,16,23,24 Patients treated surgically were significantly more likely to return to work25,26and sports.16,26,27 Furthermore, patients who underwent operative treatment for MLKI have shown lower rates of endstage arthritis and higher patient - reported outcomes (PROs) scores than those who underwent non- operative management for the same types of injury.16 However, the optimal timing of surgery is less well understood and remains the subject of intense debate. Postoperative Rehabilitation of Multiple Ligament Knee Injuries The timing of rehabilitation after surgery for a MLKI has not been investigated. The best available evidence for the timing of post -operative rehabilitation for knee ligament surgery is based on evidence from the ACL literature. Early (accelerated) rehabilitation (immediate WB , ROM, quadriceps exercises) after ACL reconstruction is the current standard of care.28 Early (accelera ted) rehabilitation has been found to reduce post - operative stiffness,29 and is either s uperior or equivalent to delayed rehabilitation in"

Rationale The timing of surgical intervention is a crucial consideration for treatment of MLKIs, and the ideal timing for surgery has yet to be conclusively determined. While certain circumstances require early intervention (irreducible knee dislocation, vascular injury, etc.), the majority of MLKIs create a treatment conundrum. Recently, authors have suggested early surgical intervention within 3 to 6 weeks of injury, because within this time period tissue planes are more easily identifiable, tissue quality is sufficient to hold sutures for repair, and retraction of tissues such as ruptured tendons is minimized. 24 However, other authors have agreed with the conventional wisdom that delayed surgery for MLKI can decrease perioperative risks, such as compartment syndrome (from capsular fluid extravasation during surgery) and arthrofibrosis. 35-37 Although several studies have compared the results of early vs. delayed surgery for MLKIs, the overwhelming majority of these studies were retrospective. 3,38-42 Notably, no Level I prospective randomized trials have compared outcomes of early vs. delayed surgery for MLKI, and results from existing studies vary widely. A systematic review of 12 retrospective studies found no difference in outcomes based on the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) Knee Ligament grade between early (58.4% good/excellent) and delayed (45.5% good/excellent) surgical management of KD -III injuries. 36 However, the authors pooled results across studies that did not directly compare early vs. delayed surgery. A second systematic review of 24 Level III and IV retrospective studies that compared early vs. delayed surgery found increased post -op anterior laxity and more frequent flexion deficits in those undergoing"

There were a greater number of patients ultimately needing manipulation under anesthesia for post -op stiffness in the early compared to delayed surgery group.43 A third systematic review of five retrospective studies involving 130 patients that underwent early (within 3 weeks of injury) or delayed surgery for a MLKI found that that early surgery resulted in higher Lysholm scores (90 versus 82) and a greater percentage of “excellent/good” IKDC results (47% verus 31%). No differences in ROM between the early and delayed surgery groups were found.24 In summary, there is a trend in published studies toward improved patient -reported outcomes and laxity in early compared to delayed surgery, but there is an increased risk of postoperative stiffness. However, non- randomized and retrospective studies that have investigated the timing of surgery for MLKIs are inherently limited because patients were selected for early versus delayed surgery based on the time of presentation and the expected or perceived soft tissue quality. As such, it is not possible to directly compare the early vs. delayed surgery and inferences from the data must be made with caution. Furthermore, none of the studies that examined early vs. delayed surgery precisely measured time to return to military duty, work and sports as an outcome, which of paramount importance from the perspective of unit readiness and the social and economic impact of these injuries. Due to the conflicting evidence regarding early versus delayed surgical management of MLKIs, there is a need for a large randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal timing of surgery for these devastating injuries that can only be achieved in a large multicenter trial. Rational for Early vs. Delayed Post -Operative Rehabi litation for Multiple Ligament Knee Injuries Mook and colleagues systematically reviewed the available literature through 2008 concerning the timing of post -operative rehabilitation. In individuals treated with early surgery and immediate motion compared to immobilization, there were fewer instances of posterior, varus and valgus laxity, loss of flexion >10º, loss of extension >5o, and poor outcome scores.43 These results are specific only to the mobility component of"

It should be noted that all of the studies included in the review by Mook et al were non- randomized comparative or single cohort retrospective studies. Currently there are no randomized trials comparing early vs. delayed motion. Mook and colleagues43 did not review the effects of weight bearing status. Many published rehabilitation protocols for MLKIs call for an extended period of non- weight bearing (NWB) ranging from 4 weeks to 6 weeks.33,44-50 Very few protocols recommend weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT)51 and some recommend early partial weight bearing (PWB)3,8,16,34,40,52,53 or toe- touch weight bearing (TTWB).54-56 Considering the variability with the current expert recommendations for weight bearing (ranging from NWB, TTWD, PWB tor WBAT) and the lack of established outcomes after MLKI surgery, there is little evidence to support the need for non- weight bearing status. Conversely, controlled weight bearing benefits cartilage and meniscus nutrition,57 can provide beneficial proprioceptive input to the knee joint, and promote muscle activity. Given the variability in weight bearing after MLKI surgery and its potential benefits, we will test a method to dose early weight bearing for the reconstructed knee based on the cardinal signs of inflammation (effusion, pain, warmth & redness). Therefore, given the above information, we have designed this study to determine if early controlled WB and ROM exercises within the first week after surgery will allow for restoration of normal ROM of the knee with no increased risk of laxity or instability, leading to an earlier and more complete return to military duty, work and sports. We hypothesize that early WB and ROM exercises initiated within the first week after surgery will shorten the time to return to pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports.

The risks of surgery include the risks associated with anesthesia as well as post -operative pain and swelling, loss of motion or joint stiffness, recurrent laxity and instability, infection, deep vein thrombosis and injury to neurovascular structures. Because subjects participating in this study would be undergoing surgery regardless of whether they participate in this study, the risks associated with the surgery itself are no greater than the risks had the subject not participated in this study. While the current standard of care for MLKIs includes early or delayed surgery and early or delayed post-operative rehabilitation, there is no definitive evidence of the risks associated with these methods of treatment. However, randomization to these standard of care methods for surgical treatment and rehabilitation of MLKIs may carry associated risks t hat are currently unknown. These may include the risk of joint stiffness and contracture for those in the early surgery and/or delayed rehabilitation groups as well as increased joint laxity and instability of the knee for those undergoing delayed surgery and/or early rehabilitation. To mitigate these risks, we will closely monitor post -operative recovery of the individual and will intervene as necessary. This could include additional surgery and/or physical therapy to address arthrofibrosis or instability. Follow -up activities involved with this study include the completion of patient -reported outcome measures and evaluation of return to activity by subjects at multiple intervals throughout the duration of the study.

To achieve this objective, we will conduct two parallel randomized, controlled trials. The aims and hypothes es for these trials are: Specific Aim 1 To determine the effects of timing of surgery and post -op rehabilitation on time to return to pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports and patient -reported physical function. We hypothesize that early surgery, early rehabilitation and the combination of early surgery with early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre-injury military duty, work and sports and better patient -reported physical function. 3.1.2 Specific Aim 2 To det ermine the effects of timing of rehabilitation on time to return pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports and patient -reported physical function.

Primary Outcome The primary outcome will be time return to full pre- injury military duty, work and sports. For military personnel, to assess return to duty we will ask three questions from the Injury Surveillance Survey (ability to perform Annual Physical Fitness Test; deployability, ability to perform specific military occupational specialty [ MOS ] duties). Additionally, we will record the milita ry subject’s MOS physical demand classification. The physical demands of work and sports activity will be assessed using the Cincinnati Occupational Rating58 and Marx Activity Scales,59 respectively. To further assess return to work, we will also record the individual’s current employment status and specific occupation. To assess sports participation, we will record the type (very strenuous, strenuous etc.) and frequency (4- 7 times per week, 1- 3 times per week etc.) of sports. Because of the expected heterogeneity of pre- injury activity lev el of individuals that sustain a MLKI we will combine return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports into an overall Return to Activity and Participation variable. Individuals will be classified as having returned to activity if and when they have returned to their pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports. Successful return to activity will be assessed using the patient -reported measures of military duty, work and sports and will be compared to the individual’s pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports. Individuals in the military will achieve a “Full Return to Activity and Participation” designation if and when they indicate they have returned to full pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports without any restrictions bas ed on their: • Reported ability to pass an Annual Physical Fitness Test at a level similar to pre-injury and are as deployable and mission capable as they were prior to injury (per the ISS); • Achievement of the same or better score on the Cincinnati Occupational Rating Scale and;"

Any individual who does not meet all of these criteria will be designated as having “Not Returned to Full Activity and Participation”. Participants reporting that they have returned to military duty, work and sports in a limited or modified role will be considered as having “Not Returned to Full Activity and Participati on”. Co-Primary Outcome – Patient Reported Physical Function The Multiple Ligament Quality of Life (MLQoL) Questionnaire60 is a condition-specific patient -reported outcome measure for individuals that have sustained a MLKI. It was developed with stakeholder input from patients with a MLKI and clinicians that treat those patients to address the limitations of existing knee- specific patient -reported outcome measures that do not represent the full spectrum of content that is pertinent to individuals with a MLKI. The MLQoL questionnaire consists of 52 items that are divided into 4 domains: physical impairment (19 items), emotional impairment (15 items), activity limitations (12 items) and social involvement (6 items). Lower scores represent the best outcomes for each subscale. To measure physical function, we selected the Activity Limitation scale of the MLQoL Questionnaire as the primary outcome based on input from patients with a MLKI that indicated items contained in this scale were most important and relevant over the long - term. 60 Psychometric testing of the Activity Limitation scale in individuals with a MLKI"

Additionally, based upon the preliminary retrospective study we expect that approximately 78% of the patients will present to orthopaedics within 6 weeks of injury, making it possible to randomize the individual to early surgery, defined as surgery within 6 weeks of injury. We utilized the prevalence of polytrauma; soft tissue and skin, vascular and quadriceps and patellar tendon injuries and use of an external fixator to estimate the number of individuals we would expect to meet our eligibility criteria for Aim 1 . In doing so, we estimated that 50% of the individuals with polytrauma would be able to undergo surgery within six weeks of injury if randomized to early surgery. After these exclusions , we estimated that there will be approximately 650 eligible individuals with a MLKI that present to orthopaedic surgery in time to make it possible to perform surgery within 6 weeks if randomized to early surgery. If approximately 60% of the eligible subjects agree to participate in the study, this would provide a total sample size of 392 (n= 98 per cell). Assuming 10% lost to follow -up over two years, we expect to have 352 subjects (n=88 per cell) for the final analysis. To achieve the required sample size for the trial that randomizes both timing of surgery and post -operative rehabilitation, with 25 clinical sites, we expect that each site will recruit and randomize approximately 16 subjects . Recruitment of Participants for the Trial for Aim 2 that Randomizes Timing of Rehabilitation After accounting for those included in the trial that randomizes surgery and rehabilitation and applying the exclusions described above w e estimate that approximately 440 individuals with a MLKI will be eligible for participation in the trial that randomizes only timing of post -op rehabilitation. If approximately 68% of the eligible subjects agree to participate in the study that randomizes only timing of post -operative rehabilitation, this"

To achieve the required sample size for the trial that randomizes only the timing of post -operative rehabilitation, with 25 clinical sites, we expect that each site will recruit and randomize approximately 12 subjects . Recruitment Process Potentially eligible patients will be informed of the study by their orthopaedic surgeon or the surgeon’s clinical designee, either during an office visit or in the Emergency Department . To identify potentially eligible individuals that present to the Emergency Department, the study team will work closely with the orthopaedic residents and orthopaedic trauma attending surgeons and fellows to identify and inform individuals with a MLKI that are eligible for the study. Individuals with a MLKI interested in learning more about the study will be introduced to a research coordinator who together with the surgeon- investigator will explain the study details to the participant . If the individual is willing to participate in the study, he/she will review and sign the consent form, which will also be signed by the surgeon- investigator. The participant will be given as much time as necessary to review the consent form and ask questions. Prior to signing the cons ent form, all questions will be answered to the satisfaction of the individual by research coordinator and/or surgeon- investigator. For active duty military personnel, no individuals in the participant ’s chain of command will be involved in the recruitment process. Because the surgeon is also an investigator in the study, we recognize that the surgeon may be conflicted in their attempts to recruit the individual into the study. During the recruitment and consent process, subjects will be informed of this potential conflict and offered the opportunity to discuss their care with another surgeon that is not associated with the study. Once informed consent has been obtained, screening procedures will be performed to confirm final eligibility for participati on in the trial for Aim 1 or 2."

We will review all study procedures with an emphasis on successful recruitment methods at the first in -person Investigators’ Meeting as well as to the Research Coordinator during the Site Initiation Visit. Recruitment materials, such as flyers, recruitment scripts and laminated reference cards that summarize eligibility criteria will be developed and distributed to the sites . To keep all study personnel engaged we will produce and distribute a quarterly newsletter that highlight s study successes, provide s recruitment tips and list s the recruitment results for each site. As part of the Clinical Monitoring Plan, we will closely monitor monthly recruitment at each of the sites. Sites that achieve or exceed the recruitment goals will be encouraged to recruit additional subjects beyond their targeted enrollment and will be rewarded accordingly based on the budget model that reimburses sites based on the number of subjects enrolled and followed. For those sites that lag in recruitment, we will work closely with them to increase enrollment. Strategies to improve recruitment will vary based upon the barriers encountered by the site. Site participation in the study will be reconsidered if recruitment drops below 50% of site target enrollment after 3 quarters of recruitment (i.e. enrolled less than 6 subjects by the end of year 1). If overall recruitment for the study lags behind targeted enrollment we will consider adding sites and will re- allocate financial support for additional sites from those sites that are not meeting recruitment projections or have been terminated f rom the study. A Recruitment Committee has been established a nd consists of investigators and research coordinators from the Coordinating Center and the collaborating clinical research sites. The Recruitment Committee will establish a plan for and monitor recruitment throughout the duration of the trial. The committee will review and approve recruitment materials , such as cards with eligibility criteria, posters that can be used at the sites. The Committee will also encourage each site to do a presentation related to MLKIs and the STaR Trial at the site’s Grand Rounds . Additionally, should a site be"

If recruitment fails to improve, the Recruitment Committee will make a recommendation to the Executive Committee to terminate the site. Subject Payment Individuals will be compensated for participation in the study. The participating clinical sites will be responsible for payment of subjects enrolled by the site. All participant payments will be processed by each site. 5.3.5.1 Pro-Rated Payments for Subjects Recruited at Civilian Research Site If individuals participate and complete all research- related activities, they will receive up to $400.

Dependents of active military personnel and retired military person nel will be paid for participation in the study as described above for civilians. Efforts to Maximize Subject Retention 5.3.6.1 Research Follow -ups For US Sites, a ll resear ch follow -ups starting 6 months after randomization will be initiated by the Coordinating Center at the University of Pittsburgh utilizing text and/or e- mail messages. Contact information, including the participant’s primary and secondary e-mail accounts and home and cell phone numbers will be obtained at the time of enrollment in the study. Individuals will also indicate their preferred method for communicating with the study investigators (i.e. e- mail, text messaging, phone). Additionally, we will ask participants to identify and provide contact information for two family members or close friends that do not live with the participant but know and will most likely always know how to contact the participant. Access to identifiable information will be limited to the site local research team and to research team at the Coordinating Center. Canadian sites will enter de- identified clinical data including screening, baseline clinical examination, surgical findings and procedures and information from all clinical follow -up visits into the University of Pittsburgh electronic data capture system ( REDCap). Contact information for each participant (email and/or phone number) is needed for the research follow -ups; however due to Canadian privacy laws that information for Canadian participants cannot be maintained on the University of Pittsburgh server s. Therefore, a copy of the REDCap project structure for the surveys involving patient reported outcomes will be sent to each Canadian site so that they can create their own survey project in the REDCap instance at their institution. Once the surveys have been administered, each Canadian site will be responsible for regularly exporting de-identified survey data and sending it to the STaR Trial DCC. The DCC will send reports back to"

Multiple attempts to contact non- responders will be utilized . Generally, participants will be contacted by their preferred method (either via e- mail or text messaging) one week prior to the follow -up due date, at the due date, and up to three times after the due date. If the participant does not respond to the third contact to their preferred contact, phone calls will be made by the Coordinating Center and/or by the site research staff. 5.3.6.2 Clinical Visit Follow -Ups Standard of care c linical follow -up of participants will occur approximately 1 week and 1, 3, 6, and 9 to 12 months after surgery. This follow -up will make use of a standardized clinical examination and will be document ed on the Clinical Visit Form. Sites will be paid upon complet ion and submission of the c linical forms . The electronic data capture system will generate regular reports of missing forms and missing data points. These reports will be shared with the site research coordinator for adjudication and resolution. Should participants move or not attend follow up visits, efforts will be made by the research team to access the electronic health records to collect data from the follow -up clinical visit s to complete the Clinical Follow -Up Visit form. The collection and use of clinical information from the medical record for research purposes is included in the IRB protocol and study participants agree to this in the informed consent process. Treatment Assignment Procedures To address Aim 1, 392 individuals with a MLKI that present within 6 weeks of injury will be randomized to early (within 6 weeks of injury) or delayed (12 to 16 weeks after injury) surgery and early (WB as tolerated and unrestricted ROM exercises starting first week after surgery) vs. delayed (non- WB and limited ROM exercises for the first four post -op weeks) rehabilitation.

Subjects will be randomized in 1:1 allocation for both factors (timing of surgery and timing of rehabilitation) in the two by two trial (Aim 1) and for timing of rehabilitation in the two-arm trial (Aim 2). Therefore, participants will have an equal chanc e of being randomized to one of four groups in the trial that randomizes timing of surgery and timing of post -operative rehabilitation and to one of two groups for the trial that randomizes only timing of post -operative rehabilitation. For those enrolled in the trial for Specific Aim 1, randomization to early versus delayed surgery will occur after the informed consent process in individuals who are eligible for randomization to early surgery and agree to be randomized. To prevent the allocated rehabil itation intervention from influencing the surgical intervention, allocation to early vs. delayed rehabilitation will not be disclosed to the participant until after surgery. Randomization for the rehabilitation only trial (Aim 2) will remain pending until the participant has undergone surgery and eligibility criteria are re- confirmed. The allocated rehabilitation protocol will be communicated to the physical therapist by the surgeon and/or research coordinator at the time when the subject is referred to physical therapy one week after surgery . Randomization Procedures Randomization will occur at the subject level. The randomization schedule will be created by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) statisticians using permuted blocks with random block sizes stratified by site and injury pattern (KD I, KD II- KDIV , KD-V). The randomization lists will be created using SAS version 9.4 using a random number generat or and fixed seed. The list s will be uploaded into the REDCap randomization module.

The SAS program used to generate the randomization schedule will be stored in the DCC STaR network folder which is only accessible by DCC s taff. Masking Procedures These are unblinded trials as the participants and care providers will know when they are receiving surgery and when they are receiving rehabilitation. Both interventions being tested (early versus delayed surgery, early versus delayed rehabilitation) cannot be masked to the site coordinators because of these individuals are responsible for scheduling (or assisting with scheduling). The rehabilitation assignment will only be communicated to the surgeon after the surgery so as not to influence surgery. The dates of the surgery and rehabilitation are collected as part of the standard of care and will be available to the surgeons during follow -up. The primary outcome and most of the secondary outcomes are patient self -report, therefore, the health providers and research team have no influence on the response. Given that our interventions are either early or delayed surgery and/or rehabilitation, it is difficult for us to estimate the direction of potential bias (if any) that could come from the unblinded nat ure of this study.

Delayed surgery to has been operationally defined as repair and/or reconstruction of the torn structures 12 and 16 weeks after injury. Although early surgery is defined as within 6 weeks, every effort will be made to perform surgery as soon as possible, if randomized to early surgery. Staged surgery will not be considered an option for surgical treatment of MLKIs in this study and will render a potential participant ineligible . All surgical findings and procedures will be documented on elect ronic surgical case report forms . As the QC for Surgery, Dr. Musahl will be available to answer any questions from surgeons regarding a subject’s participation in the study. Definitive surgical treatment of soft tissue injuries will follow a standardized algorithm (Figure 2) comprising primary repair and/or reconstruction. Surgery will be performed in accordance with the principles of anatomic repair and/or reconstruction of injured structures in a manner that will allow for early range of motion. Graft choice for reconstruction of injured tissues will be at the discretion of the operating surgeon and will not be standardized; however, graft choice will be recorded on the surgical case report form. Examination Under Anesthesia – A complete assessment of knee function will be performed after anesthesia has been induced. The surgeon will assess Examination Under Anesthesia Meniscus Findings and Procedures Cartilage Findings and Procedures Ligament Findings and Procedures Peroneal Nerve Findings and Procedures Figure 2.

Meniscus and Cartilage - The status of the menisci and cartilage will be assessed arthroscopic ally. Injuries to the menisci or cartilage may be left in situ, or surgery may be performed to repair or debride the tissue at the discretion of the operating surgeon. Meniscus and car tilage f indings and procedures will be documented on form . Cruciate Ligaments - Primary suture repair may be performed in cases of complete soft tissue avulsions or bony avulsions of either the ACL and/or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). These injuries may also be reconstructed or augmented with an autograft or allograft. Anatomic single - or double- bundle reconstruction will be used for mid- substance disruptions of the ACL and/or PCL. Tunnels will be created in the footprints of the ACL and PCL on the femur and tibia using standard arthroscopic equipment, drill guides, and reamers. Grafts will be anchored either within the tunnels using interference screws or outside the tunnels using cortical suspensory buttons or suture post screws. For reconstruction of PCL injuries, PCL fixation will be performed with the tibia reduced at 90 degrees of knee flexion. Fixation of grafts for ACL reconstruction will be performed near extension. Medial Injuries – Open approaches will be used for repair and/or reconstruct ion of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and posteromedial corner. Soft tissue planes will be separated to facilitate layer -by-layer repair of the sartorius facia, superficial MCL and posterior oblique ligament (POL), as well as deep MCL and capsular structures. Suture anchors will be used as indicated for soft tissue or bony avulsions. Reconstruction of the medial structures will be performed as necessary depending on soft tissue quality and size of the zone of injury. Grafts will be placed into the MCL footprint s on the femur and tibia. Fixation will be performed at 30° of knee flexion under varus stress following ACL and/or PCL fixation as described above. Lateral Injuries – Open approaches will be used for repair and/or reconstruction of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and posterolateral corner structures [popliteus tendon and popliteofibular ligament (PFL )].

Grafts will be placed into the anatomic footprint s of the LCL, PFL, and popliteus on femur/fibula, tibia/fibula, and femur/tibia, respectively. Fixation will be performed at 30° of knee flexion under valgus stress following ACL and/or PCL fixation as described above. Peroneal Nerve Injury – During open lateral surgery, the peroneal nerve will be identified and protected from further injury. In cases of existing injury, the type of injury and any treatment provided will be documented. Complications – Complications that occur during surgery will be documented . Intraoperative complications that are expected include nerve or vascular injury, loose hardware, and intraoperative fracture. Other unexpected complications that occur will also be documented. At the conclusion of surgery, a hinged, long -leg brace will be placed on the participant’s leg. This brace will be locked in extension (anatomic 0o) until the first post -operative visit with the surgeon. The brace will be worn for a minimum of 6 weeks and will be unlocked based on the rehabilitation program to which the participant was randomized. Medication for pain control, anti -coagulation/deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and antibiotics will be prescribed at the discretion of the operating surgeon. The decision to discharge the patient to home or to admit to the hospital for monitoring will also be made at this time. Each of these decisions will be document ed at the first post - operative visit.

Early rehabilitation will be characterized by weight bearing and unrestricted motion starting after the first post -operativ e visit with the orthopaedic surgeon. After introduction of weight bearing and unrestricted ROM, all trial participants will follow the same criterion- based rehabilitation progression with three phases – Tissue Protection, Restoration of Motor Control, and Optimization of Function (Figure 3). The randomized intervention is nested inside of the Tissue Protection Phase; however, the Motor Control and Optimization of Function phases are the same for both groups. The goals of the criterion- based rehabilitation progression are to return individuals to: 1. Normal activities of daily living, and 2. Work, military duty, and sports activities at the same level of participation as prior to injury. 6.1.2.1 Tissue Protection Phase The Tissue Protection Phase begins immediately after surgery with a focus on restoring function while not disrupting the tissues addressed during surgery. The study rehabilitation interventions are nested in the Tissue Protection Phase; therefore, each group will have a different experience during this phase. Both groups will be managed identically between surgery and the first post -operative visit with the surgeon. Generally, the Tissue Protection Phase ends when the participant meets the criteria to discharge all post -operative assistive devices for ambulation. In cases where hamstrings exercise must be limited, the Tissue Protection Phase ends when the participant meets the criteria to initiate non- resisted hamstrings exercise. 6.1.2.2 Immediate Post -Operative Rehabilitation The brace will be locked in extension for the first week after surgery and participants will be non- weight bearing.

The participant will be referred for standard of care physical therapy, with the instructions for WB and ROM as randomized. The physical therapist will be provided with the criterion- based protocol to advance gait and exercise activity as indicated by perform ance. 6.1.2.3 Delayed Rehabilitation Intervention Participants randomized to the delayed rehabilitation treatment arm will be instructed not to bear any weight on the surgical limb for 4 weeks after surgery. For ambulation, the brace will be locked in extension. Participants will keep the brace locked in extension for four weeks and will continue the exercise program described in Section 6.1.2.2. After four weeks, the brace will be unlocked per the rehabilitation guidelines for gait and exercise. At this time, pa rticipants will also transition to a weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT) gait for ambulation. Four weeks after surgery, the participant ’s exercise and ambulation will be advanced based on the tissue response to treatment in a fashion that is identical to the progression of participants in the early rehabilitation treatment group. 6.1.2.4 Early Rehabilitation Intervention Participants randomized to the early rehabilitation treatment group will be instructed to bear weight on the surgical limb as tolerated in the post -operative rehabilitation brace beginning one- week after surgery at the first post -operative visit with the orthopaedic surgeon. Participants will be able to perform unrestricted ROM exercise in the post - operative brace both in rehabilitation and at home. The early rehabilitation intervention will not be confused with “accelerated” rehabilitation after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, in which range of motion is targeted aggressively after surgery and is generally the current standard of care. 28,71 The post - operative rehabilitation for the early rehabilitation group was developed to pro mote"

The time for initiation of weight bearing on the surgical knee will be based on the allocated rehabilitation group (early – starting at the first post- operative appointment with the physician; delayed – starting 4 weeks after surgery). When initiati ng weight bearing, participants will be instructed to bear weight on their surgical limb as tolerated. Tolerance is defined as the amount of weight bearing that does not appreciably increase knee joint pain, effusion, or warmth. Initially, weight bearing will be performed with an assistive device in a locked, double upright knee brace to prevent excessive sagittal or frontal plane motion. When participants can bear full weight on the leg without signs of increased inflammation and can demonstrate appropriate control of the knee when walking with the brace unlocked, gait training with a less restrictive assistive device (i.e. single crutch or cane) and with the brace unlocked brace will be initiated, and progressed as safely tolerated. Progression of Ex ercise Activities The immediate goal of exercise is to restore quadriceps activity and increase and/or maintain range of motion within the post -operative guidelines. Exercises progress from non-weight bearing quadriceps exercise through bilateral and unilateral weight bearing exercises. Weight bearing exercise recommendations and gait activit y recommendations follow similar trajectories and complement each other. All participants will begin exercises to restore quadriceps function immediately after surgery (e.g. quadriceps sets, straight leg raises)."

After 8 weeks, active contraction of the hamstrings without external resistance may begin. After 12 weeks, resistive exercises for the hamstrings may be initiated. Because of the relatively long period of low -intensity cardiovascular training that allows the tissues to recover, conditioning exercises are important to initiate when safe cycling for aerobic conditioning can be initiated – 10 weeks after surgery, and when the individual has the necessary range of motion and control of the lower extremity to initiate and safely stop cycling. This is a direct progression from cycling for range of motion. 6.1.2.8 Optimization of Function Phase Advanced training for general conditioning, lower extremity strength, and military, work and/or athletic movements is progressed from as early as 12 weeks after surgery through discharge from physical therapy. Progression is based on time from surgery, the inflammatory response of the knee joint, and mastery of more basic skill s (e.g. the patient must master jumping on two legs before beginning hopping on one leg). This progression follows standard approaches after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

In cases where the surgery was performed outside of the time window that corresponds with random ization, a protocol deviation will be filed, and the case will be flagged as non- adherent to timing of surgery. All surgeons will follow the same general procedures for anatomic repair or reconstruction of torn structures; however, due to the variability of injury patterns in MLKIs, it is not possible to strictly standardize the surgical protocol for all participants. Rather, we will use surgical CRFs to thoroughly document the surgical findings and procedures. Assessment of Participant Adherence with Rehabilitation as Randomized in the first Month after Surgery To determine whether the participant was adherent to the allocated rehabilitation program, we will utilize a three- part mo nitoring process in the first month after surgery. We will consider participant self-report and the opinions and conclusions of the orthopedic surgeon and physical therapist.

To improve reporting, we have implemented a picture- based reporting mechanism to accompany written descriptions. In the one- month Clinical Visit Form and one -month Physical Therapy Case Report Form, the surgeon and physical therapist, respectively will be asked to comment on the participant ’s WB and ROM status. By obtaining information from the participant , surgeon, and physical therapist, we will be able to determine with reasonable certainty the participant ’s adherence with the allocated rehabilitation program. In cases of agreement among all three data sources, there is a clear indication of adherence. In cases of discord between the three parties, the general rule is to take the opinion of the majority (i.e. 2 of 3 reports results in determination of adherence). However, if the participant self -reports that he /she was not adherent to recommendations, we will designate the participant as non- adherent . Assessment o f Patient Reported Adherence to Rehabilitation as Prescribed after the First Month after Surgery Using the 3- month and 6- month Patient Reported Rehabilitation Activities Forms , we will determine how participants progressed through rehabilitation activities after surgery. We will compare this to the suggested beginning times for activities in the rehabilitation protocol. Specifically, we want to know how often p articipants begin impact activities (e.g. running, jumping, or cutting/pivoting) and advanced training prior to 3 months after surgery. The rehabilitation program delays initiation of these activities in an effort to promote appropriate healing of surgical procedures, however, the impact of these activities on healing and outcome is unknown. We wi ll also identify participants that have demonstrated poor progression of activity and have not initiated advanced training by 6 months after surgery. We will assess for predictors of individuals who have not returned to advanced training to identify those who may need more intensive rehabilitation or closer monitoring."

Delayed surgery to has been operationally defined as repair and/or reconstruction of the torn structures 12 and 16 weeks after injury. Although early surgery is defined as within 6 weeks, every effort will be made to perform surgery as soon as possible, if randomized to early surgery. Staged surgery will not be considered an option for surgical treatment of MLKIs in this study. In all cases, surgery will be performed in accordance with the principles of anatomic repair/reconstruction of injured structures in a manner that will allow for early range of motion. Surgical reconstruction with allograft or autograft will be planned for mid- substance tears of the ACL and/or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) , as previous studies have demonstrated suboptimal outcomes with primary repair. 77,78 Repair/reconstruction will also be planned for injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL) and the posterolateral corner (PLC) structures (fibular collateral ligament, popliteus tendon, and popliteofibular ligament). Injuries to the biceps femoris tendon or iliotibial band will be addressed as necessary. Medial and lateral meniscus tears will be repaired or debrided at the time of surgery. Neuropraxic nerve injuries will not necessitate early intervention; however, if a neurotmesis injury is discovered on MRI, then early intervention for primary repair, grafting or benign neglect may be warranted. All surgical findings and procedures will be documented on electronic surgical case report forms. As the Qualified Clinical Investigator for Surgery, Dr. Musahl will be available to answer any questions from surgeons regarding a subject’s participation in the study.

After surgery, all individuals will be placed in a hinged brace that is locked in extension. Individuals randomized to early rehabilitation will begin WBAT with the brace locked in full extension and unrestricted ROM within 1 week after surgery. Individuals in this group will be allowed to unlock the brace for ROM exercises but will keep the brace locked at all other times until the criteria to unlock the brace are met. Weightbearing will be gradually progressed to full WB no earlier than 3 weeks after surgery pending achievement of the criteria for doing so. Participants allocated to delayed rehabilitation will be non- WB and with no knee motion for four weeks after which time they will progress to WBAT and perform unrestricted ROM exercises. Immediately after surgery both groups will begin isometric quadriceps exercises with the knee in full extension (quad sets, straight leg raises) and high intensity neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NME S) for the quadriceps will be utilized. Use of the post - operative brace will be discontinued no earlier than 6 weeks after surgery pending achievement of the criteria to do so. In the Motor Control and Functional Optimization phases of rehabilitation, progression to increasingly demanding activities will be time- and criterion- based to ensure that the individual is advanced safely, reducing the risk for further injury."

Assessment of Outcomes 8.1.7.1 Primary Outcome • Return to Pre -Injury Military Duty, Work and Sport Because of the expected heterogeneity of pre- injury activity level of individuals that sustain a MLKI, similar to our work related to return to pre- injury sports activity and participation for individuals following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, we will combine return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports into an overall Return to Activity and Participation variable. Individuals will be classified as having returned to activity if and when they have returned to their pre- injury lev el of military duty, work and sports. Successful return to activity will be assessed using the patient -reported measures of military duty, work and sports described above and will be determined based on comparison of the individual’s pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports. Individuals in the military will achieve a “Full Return to Activity and Participation” designation if and when they indicate they have returned to full pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports without any restrictions based on their: • Reported ability to pass an Annual Physical Fitness Test at a level similar to pre- injury status and are as deployable and mission capable as they were prior to injury (per the ISS); • Achievement of the same or higher Military Occupat ional Specialty Physical Demand Classification • Achievement of the same or better score on the Cincinnati Occupational Rating Scale and; • Achievement of the same or better score on the Marx Activity Rating Scale and participation in the same type and freque ncy of sports as prior to injury."

Any individual who does not meet all these criteria will be designated as having “Not Returned to Full Activity and Participation”. Participants reporting that they have returned to military duty, work and sports in a limited or modified role will be considered as having “Not Returned to Full Activity and Participation”. Longitudinal Collection of Return to Military Duty, Work and Sports Activity and Participation Outcomes – To more precisely measure time to return to military duty, work and sports, we will administer a brief Return to Activity Monitoring Survey on a monthly basis, starting 6 months after randomization continuing through the 24- month follow -up. To promote compliance with data collection and ease the burden of completion that is placed on study participants, the Return to Activity Monitoring Survey is a responsive branching survey. At each follow -up time point, participants will be presented with three simple questions about returning to military duty, work and sports. They will be asked to indicate if they have not returned, returned in a limited fashion, or returned without any restrictions. Participants indicating that they have returned in a limited role or without restrictions will be asked to complete the three -question scale from the Injury Surveillance System and Cincinnati Occupational Rating and Marx Activity Rating scales, as appropriate (see Figure 5). This responsive branching design seeks to limit the questions asked in the monthly, recurring survey while still providing sufficient detail to make a true determination of the participant’s return to military duty, work and sports status."

Qualitative research involving individuals with a MLKI has demonstrated that existing knee- specific or generic patient -reported outcome measures lack items that represent the full spectrum of symptoms and activity limitations associated with vascular and neurological injuries. Additionally, existing knee- specific patient -reported outcome measures focus on sports activity and participation with few items related to participation in social roles and the profound emotional effect that MLKIs have on individuals. 60 The MLQoL Questionnaire was developed with stakeholder input from patients with a MLKI and clinicians that treat those patients to address the limitations of existing knee- specific and generic patient - reported outcome measures that do not represent the full spectrum of content that is pertinent to individuals with a MLKI. The MLQoL questionnaire consists of 52 items that are divided into 4 domains: physical impairment (19 items), emotional impairment (15 items), activity limitations (12 items) and social involvement (6 items). Items representing impairments are phrased in terms of frequency and activity limitations and social involvement are worded in terms of degree of difficulty or extent of limitation. The item responses are based on a five- point Likert scale . Separate scores are calculated for each domain by summing the item response scores within each domain and dividing the sum by the total possible score for the domain then multiplying by 100 to provide a score that ranges from 0 to 100 with lower scores representing better outcomes (less impairment or limitations). Interviews with patients that have a MLKI reveal that the content of the items is relevant to individuals with a MLKI. We selected the Activity Limitation s scale of the MLQoL Questionnaire as a secondary primary outcome measure based on input from patients with a MLKI that indicated items contained in this scale were most important and relevant over the long -term. 60 Psychometric testing of the Activity Limitations scale in individuals with MLKI found no floor and cei ling effects and acceptable levels of internal"

Evidence for construct validity was demonstrated by acceptance of seven of eight a priori hypotheses for the Activity Limitations sca le.60 8.1.7.2 Secondary Outcomes – Patient -Reported Outcomes We will also collect several patient -reported measures of physical functions and health- related quality. These patient -reported outcome measures will be collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months follow -up from time of randomization. The measures are described in detail below. • International Knee Documentation Com mittee (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC -SKF) is an 18- question measure of symptoms, function and sports activities for individuals with a variety of knee conditions, including MLIKs injur ies. Individuals complete the IKDC Subjective Knee Form from the perspective of “the past 4 weeks or since your injury”. Each item is scored using an ordinal scale, such that a score of 0 is given to responses that represent the highest level of symptoms or the lowest level of function or activity. The IKDC -SKF is scored by summing the scores for the 18 items and then transforming the score to a scale from 0 to 100 by dividing the sum of the scores by the maximum possible score, which is 87 if the individual responds to all 18 questions. Higher IKDC - SKF scores indicate the absence of symptoms and higher levels of function and sports activities. If there are missing item responses, the IKDC -SKF score can still be calculated if there are responses to at le ast 90% of the items (i.e. when responses have been provided for at least 16 of the questions). In the presence of up to 2 missing item responses, the IKDC- SKF score is calculated as the (sum of the completed items)/(maximum possible sum of the completed items) times 100. The IKDC -SKF has undergone extensive psychometric testing 61-63 and normative data in a representative sample of the US population has been determined.64 Test re -test reliability was high (ICC .94) with a standard error of measurement of 4.6. The IKDC -"

A change score of 11.5 was found to distinguish between those who were improved and those who were not over an average of 19 months follow -up.62 Since its development, the IKDC -SKF has be found to include questions that are important to individuals with an ACL injury82. Most recently, the threshold for the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) for the IKDC -SKF for individuals that are 1 to 5 years after ACL reconstruction have been established.65 • Physical Impairment, Emotional Impairment and Social Involvement Scales of the MLQoL Questionnaire We will also administer the other three scales as secondary outcomes to capture the full range of physical and emotional impairments and social impact that a MLKI has on people’s lives. The p sychometric testing for the physical impairment, emotional impairment, and social involvement scales found no floor and ceiling effects and acceptable levels of internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha 0.94, 0.93 and 0.91 , respectively) and test re- test reliability (ICC 0.89, 0.86 and 0.88, respectively). 60 • Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Scale The Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Scale was developed by the PROMIS Network, which was an NIH Roadmap Initiative, to assess physical function regardless of the health condition present. In contrast to classical test theory, which focuses on the total scale score, IRT focuses on individual items and models the probability of a response to an item as a function of the properties of the item and the ability level of the individual responding to the item. The PROMIS PF item bank consists of 121 items and can be administered as a computer adaptive test (CAT) or through short forms. The CAT version of the PROMIS Physical Function Scale utilizes a computer algorithm to adaptively select items that provide the most information about an individual. Selection of each item is dependent"

The advantage of the CAT version of the PROMIS Physical Function Scale is that it allows for shorter, more efficient and potentially more precise measurement of an individual’s level of physical function. The PROMI S Physical Function scores are presented as standardized T -scores that are normalized to the United States population. A T -score of 50 is equal to the population average with a standard deviation of 10. Thus, a score of 55 represents an individual with a physical function score that is one- half of a standard deviation above the population average. We will utilize the CAT version of the PROMIS Physical Function Scale that is available free through the REDCap library. The PROMIS PF Scale has been shown to be well suited to assess patient -reported outcomes in those with a variety of orthopaedic disorders. The PROMIS Physical Function CATs have been used for patients with foot and ankle disorders 66, following ACL reconstruction67, osteoarthritis,68 and knee osteoarthritis69and have demonstrated adequate internal consistency,66 test re -test reliability,68 decreased ceiling and floor effects,66 and sho rter completion times,66,67 As part of an NIAMS -funded study, we recently demonstrated the PROMIS Physical Function CAT had moderate test re- test reliability (ICCs 0.55 to 0.68) over a 1 and 3 month time period in a stable cohort of individual s two or more years after ACL reconstruction and large effect sizes (ES) from before to 12 (ES 1.85 ) and 24 months (ES 1.80 ) after ACL reconstruction (unpublished data). • PROMIS Global 10 The PROMIS Global 10 is a 10- item patient -reported measure of physi cal and emotional health.70 It consists of a self -rated health item (global -1), single pure physical health (global -3) and mental health (global -4) items and an item representing overall quality of life (global -2), which is strongly related to mental health. The other items provide global ratings of physical function (global -6), fatigue (global -8), pain (global -7), emotional distress (global -10) and social health (global -5 and global -9)."

The global physical health score is created by summing the responses to four items (global -3, global -6, recoded global -7 and recoded global -8). The global emotional health score is created by summing the responses to 4 items (global -2, global -4, recoded global -5 and recoded global -10). The raw scores are converted to T scores using a look -up table. The T -score distribution is standardized such that a score of 50 represents the mean of the US general population with a standard deviation around the mean of 10 points. Therefore, a person that has T -scores of 60 for the Global Physical Health and Global Mental Health scales has physical and mental health scores that are one standard deviation better than the US population average. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses indicated the global health items fit a two- factor model that included global physical and global mental health. The scales had an internal consistency of 0.81 and 0.86 respectively and the global physical health scale was more strongly correlated (r=0.76) with the EQ -5D then was the global mental health scale (r=.59). We are including the PROMIS Global 10 as a measure of global health because global health items are predic tive of future health care utilization and mortality • Patient Acceptable Symptom State/Global Rating of Change The Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is a single question that measures an individual’s satisfaction with their health state. The PASS is assessed by asking the participant the question: “Taking into account all the activity you have during your daily life, your level of pain and also activity limitations and participation restrictions, do you consider the current state of your knee satisfactory?” with the responses of “yes” or “no”. The PASS question has shown to be have sufficient test re- test reliability in patients after ACL reconstruction, with a kappa coefficient of 0.78. 65 The Global Rating of Change is a fifteen- point global rating of change (GRC) and will be administered at 6, 12, and 24 months after randomization. The global rating of change asks the individual to compare their current functional status to the time of"

The GRC is used to identify individuals who made a substantial improvement due to the t reatment that was received (REF). Other Patient -Reported Measures Measures of kinesiophobia, resiliency and comorbidities will be collected because these constructs may impact return to military duty, work and sports. These measures will be collected only at the time of enrollment in the study. • Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia Several studies have shown that fear of re- injury was the major and most common reason cited by individuals for not returning to sports or for returning to a lower level of sports participation after ACL reconstruction.83-87 For individuals that sustain a MLKI there is no evidence on how fear of re- injury affects return to military duty , work or sports, however given the magnitude of the injury we expect that return to activity and participation following a MLKI will be associated with fear of re- injury. Therefore, to account for this potentially confounding variable we will utilize the shortened version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) to assess fear of re- injury. The TSK aims to quantify fear of re- injury due to movement and physical activity for patients with musculoskeletal pain. The shortened version of the TKS consists of 11 statements related to an individual’s perception of their experience of injury and physical activity. Each statement is provided with a four -point Likert scale that ranges from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree”. The TSK item scores are summed to create a score that ranges from 11 to 44, with a higher score indicating more fear. This scale has been found to have acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.77 to 0.81) and the validity of the TSK was acceptable in patients with acute and musculoskeletal pain. 88-91 The presence of fear as measured by the TSK is related to physical function after ACL injury and reconstruction,92 but it also can change over time.93 Therefore we will administer the TSK at the time of enrollment in the study as well as at the 6, 12 and 24 month follow -ups after randomization."

The score is created by calculating the mean of the 6 items, after reverse coding the scores for items 2, 4 and 6. The scores range from 1 to 5, where higher scores indicate positive resilience capabilities. The Brief Resilience Scale was evaluated in four samples and it was found to be an unidimensional and reliable measure (Cronbach’s alpha ranging from .80 - .91).94 We hypothesize that individuals with higher resilience will have a quicker return to return to pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports and higher levels of patient -reported physical function. • Functional Comorbidity Index Health status is likely to contribute to overall outcomes after surgery for a MLKI, therefore we will assess for the presence of medical comorbidities using the 18- item Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI). Using medical comorbidities is an important factor in creating risk -adjustment models for orthopedic trauma. 95 The FCI is a self - administered report of medical comorbidities that has been shown to be associated with physical function, 96 whereas other comorbidity outcomes focus on mortality. The FCI measures the full spectrum health related to musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, sensory, neuromuscular, endocrine and mental health. The FCI was found to demonstrate a stronger association w ith that SF -36 physical function subscale (R2 = 0.29) than the Charleston (R2 = 0.18) and Kaplan- Feinstein (R2 = 0.07) indices.96 A simple count of the number of comorbidities performed similarly to a weighted count of the comorbidities and thus for simplicity, the simple count of the number of co-morbidities is recommended. When individuals were classified into high and low function based on the SF -36 physical function score, the FCI correctly clas sified 77% of the cases."

A ll clinical assessments performed in this study are considered to be part of standard clinical practice. At each clinical visit and through the electronic surveys, the research team will actively query participants on the occurrence of any potential health related event since last contact. Unanticipated Problems The Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) and the University of Pittsburgh IRB consider unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: • unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB - approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; • related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and • suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Per th is definition, only a subset of adverse events would be characterized as unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. There are other types of incidents, experiences, and outcomes that are not considered adverse events, but are characterized as unanticipated problems (e.g., breach of confidentiality or other incidents involving social or economic harm)."

The occurrence of adverse events will be monitored for each subject on an ongoing basis throughout the study at all sites. All AEs, regardless of its relatedness to the study intervention, it will be recorded on the electronic AE form. Standard medical terminology from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06- 14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf ) will be used when recording AEs. This standardization will allow sorting and grouping of like events, which will facilitate calculation of the incidence of AEs and reporting. In addition, this standardization will promote consistent documentation across all 23 sites. As dictated by the CTCAE, the data elements that will be recorded in the AE CRF are: - Event term; - Event severity: mild, moderate, severe/life- threatening/disabling or death; - Start and end date of event; - Relatedness to study procedures: unrelat ed, unlikely, possible, probable or definite; - Action taken with study procedure: none, study procedure interrupted, discontinued or modified; - Other action taken: none, treatment given (describe), discontinued from study or hospitalization; - Status of Event: not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving, fatal, unknown or lost to follow -up; - Serious adverse event;"

If determined on the AE form that the event was a serious adverse event, additional questions will become available to collect information pertinent to the SAE including : - Unexpected serious adverse event; - Outcome of serious adverse event; - Action required because of the serious adverse event. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up Unanticipated problems will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study. The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each clinical visit and through the electronic surveys, the research team will actively query participants on the occurrence of any potential health related event since last contact. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization."

Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. d. The event reappears upon a re- challenge with the intervention. 2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. b. An alternate etiology has been established. Expectedness of SAEs An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document. Severity of Event The following scale will be used to grade adverse events: 1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL); 2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non- invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADLs; 3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject s eeks medical attention, needs major assistance with ADLs; 4. Life-threatening: urgent intervention indicated;"

Unanticipated Problem Reporting to IRB and HRPO Incidents or events that meet the HRPO criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. The HRPO recommends that investigators include the following information when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB: • A ppropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome; • A n explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem; • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using the following timeline: • Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and to HRPO within 1 week of the investigator becoming aware of the event. • Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to the HRPO within 2 weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the problem."

Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Reporting to IRB and HRPO Adverse events or SAEs that pose a risk to the study participant, or that are related to study procedures, will be reported as follows from the time the information is disclosed to research coordinator: - For AEs that pose a risk to the study participant or are related to the study procedures, the RC will enter information related to the AE into the REDCap system and will report the AE to the site’s IRB of record within timeframe specified by the IRB’s policies, but no later than 5 business days. Additionally, the RC will report the AE directly to the site PI. - All SAEs will be reported within 24 hours of learning of event. To do so the RC will enter the information into the REDCap system for SAEs. REDCap will automatically contact the study PIs ( Drs. Irrgang and Musahl), the site PI, and the Independent Research Monitor. The site PI will notify the site IRB of record within 24 hours. Note that the study personnel may not know of SAEs that are not study related until the monthly follow -up. If such SAEs occur, they will be documented as above as soon as the study personnel are aware of the occurrence of the SAE. Criteria for Intervention Discontinuation Participants will be discontinued from the study intervention (early vs. late surgery and early vs. late rehabilitation) if a medical condition develops that, due to safety concerns, precludes the continuation of allocated intervention. In such events, the subject will continue to be followed per the study protocol and follow -up data will be obtained. The subject will remain in the group to which they were initially assigned to according to t he intention- to-treat principle."

To achieve this objective, we will conduct two parallel randomized controlled trials. The aims and hypotheses for these trials are: Aim 1 : Determine the effects of timing of surgery and post -operative rehabilitation on time to return to pre -injury level of military duty, work and sports and patient - reported physical function. We hypothesize that early surgery, early rehabilitation and the combination of early surgery with early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports and better patient -reported physical function. Aim 2 : Determine the effects of timing of post -operative rehabilitation on time to return pre -injury level of military duty, work and sports and patient -reported physical function. We hypothesize that early rehabilitation will lead to an earlier and more complete return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports activity and better patient -reported physical function. Sample Size Considerations Based on our preliminary retrospective study, we estimate that across 25 clinical sites there will be 1213 MLKIs over a 2- year recruitment period. After the exclusions for participation in the trial that randomizes timing of surgery and rehabilitation (Aim 1 ), we estimate that there will be approximately 650 eligible individuals with a MLKI that present to orthopaedics in time to make it possible to perform surgery within 6 weeks if randomized to early surgery. If approximately 60% of the eligible subjects agree to participate in the study, this would provide a total sample size of 392 (n= 98 per cell)."

We had no preliminary data on time to return to pre- injury military duty, work and sports, therefore we conservatively estimated power using the 24- month rate of return to full pre-injury activity and participation and a two- sample test of proportions. This sample size would provide 80 %-92% power to detect a 15% absolute difference ( 𝑎𝑎=0.05) in the rate of return to full pre -injury military duty, work and sports for the main effects (n=176 for each arm) for timing of surgery or timing of rehabilitation, assuming the delayed arm has a return rate of 30% to 70%. Power was calculated for a two- sided z test with pooled variance using PA SS 13.97 Additi onally we would have 80% power to detect a 17% to 21% difference between the early surgery/early rehabilitation group (n=88) compared to any of the other 3 groups with rates from 30% -70%. With 176 subjects per main effect arm, we would have 82% power to detect a 15% difference in return to military duty, work and sports (hazard ratio=0.65, 35% improvement in the time to rate of return to duty, work and sports) using a log -rank test assuming two- year accrual, two- year follow -up for each participant, 10% dropout in each arm, and 5% crossover in each arm. For the MLQoL Questionnaire Activity Limitations Scale, we would have 80% power to detect a 6.2 point difference at 24 months between early surgery and delayed surgery (or early rehabilitation and delayed rehabilitation) using a two- sided two- sample equal variance t -test (α=0.05, standard deviation=20.8) assuming a 10% attrition rate. This is equivalent to a small effect size of approximately 0.30. We would also have 80% power to detect a 10.2- point difference between the early surgery/early rehabilitation group and any of the other three groups using the same standard deviation and test (α=0.0167 adjustment for multiple comparisons). After accounting for those included in the trial that randomizes surgery and rehabilitation and applying the excl usions described above we estimate that approximately 440 individuals with a MLKI will be eligible for participation in the trial for Aim 2 that randomizes only timing of post -op rehabilitation. If approximately 68% of the eligible"

This total of subjects would provide 79% to 84% power to detect an absolute difference of 15% between the groups ( 𝑎𝑎=0.05) assuming the delayed re habilitation group has a return to military duty, work and sports rate of 65 to 70% and 10% attrition. Power was calculated for a two- sided z test with pooled variance using PASS 13. 97 Safety Review Adverse events and serious adverse events will be named and classified using the CTCAE. No formal rules have been established to halt enrollment for safety concerns. All tabulations and comparisons of rates of AEs and SAEs by treatment group will be shared with the DSMB at their regularly scheduled meetings. As required by www.clinicaltrials.gov and biomedical journals, all safety data will be reported by treatment group as part of the final dissemination of study results. Final Analysis Plan We will first compare the distribution of baseline characteristics and important prognostic factors (age, sex, pre- injury activity level, KD classification etc.) between the groups for each trial (surgery and rehabilitation, rehabilitation only). Continuous variables with fairly symmetric distrib utions will be summarized using means and standard deviations. Those with skewed distributions will be described using medians and inter -quartile ranges. Categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages. Because of the expected heterogeneity of pre- injury activity level of individuals that sustain a MLKI, we will combine return to military duty, work and sports into an overall return to activity and Participation variable. Individuals will be classified as having returned to activity if and when they have returned to their pre- injury level of military duty, work and sports activity. See Section 3. 2 for details."

The primary outcome of return to military duty, work and sports will be assessed at monthly intervals via text message, email, or phone call from 6 to 24 months after randomization. This frequency of measurement will allow us to conduct more precise time to event analysis compared to having discrete time points several months apart. For those participants not returning to full activity and participation, the date of censoring for each participant will be the end of the two-year follow -up or last contact prior to 3 consecutive months of non- response/no data for this outcome. We will begin the analyses by estimating and comparing the time to event curves using Kaplan- Meier estimation and log -rank tests. We will begin the analyses by assessing the proportional hazards assumption for the four intervention groups using a plot of the log of the negative log of the estimated survival density vs. the log of time (for parallel lines) and by testing the group (4 levels) by time interaction in a Cox proportional hazards model (group*log(t)). If non- significant, we will assess using the collapsed main effects for surgery (early vs delayed) and post-operative rehabilitatio n (early vs delayed). We will also assess and test for non- proportional hazards by site and injury pattern (randomization stratification factors). If the proportional hazards assumption is not violated for the group effects, we will proceed using Cox proportional hazards model to test for intervention effects on time to return to military duty, work, and sports. Although we are not powered for detecting an interaction, we will test the interaction between timing of surgery and timing of rehabilitation using Cox proportional hazards model prior to looking at main effects. Assuming the interaction is not significant, we will compare the time to return to return to military duty, work and sports for both main effects, adjusting for site and KD injury pattern. We will present results using hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. If the proportional hazards assumption is violated, we will extend the Cox model to incorporate the group*log(t) term such that the hazards may vary over time across groups. If the proportional hazards assumption is violated for site or injury pattern, we will allow for this variability through stratification since the parameter estimates and testing for these two variables are not of interest."

The fixed effects of surgery (early vs. delayed), rehabilitation (early vs. delayed), time (baseline, 6, 12, 24 months), the two- way interactions, and the three- way interaction will be placed in the model controlling for site and KD injury pattern. Assuming the 3- way interaction is not significant, we will proceed to test the two- way interactions for surgery*time and rehabilitation*time. If the two- way interaction is significant, we will test the separate treatment effects at 24 months (primary time point of interest) using contrasts. All treatment effects will be presented using adjusted mean differences and 95% confidence intervals. Using the linear mixed models is advantageous in the presence of data missing completely at random or missing at random as these models efficiently handle the observed data and correlations among the repeated measures to estimate treatment effects and standard errors. With respect to missing outcome data, we will compare those patients missing follow up visits at 6, 12, and 24 on demographic and baseline clinical characteristics to assess the missing data mechanism. As a sensitivity analysis, if the proportion of patients lost to follow up exceeds 15% or any time point has more than 15% missingness, we will use pattern mixture models under non- ignorable missingness to test the impact on the inference of our trial results. To determine if early surgery and early rehabilitation is better that the other combinations, we will specifically compare the early surgery/early rehabilitation group to each of the 3 other intervention arms using contrasts in the full models for both the time to event outcome and patient -reported physical function. Secondary outcomes that are scales or continuous measurements will be analyzed similar to the methods used for physical function. Secondary outcome measures that are categorical will be analyzed using random effects logistic regression to control for repeated measures within person.

Statistical Analysis for Specific Aim 2 (Randomization to Only Early vs. Delayed Post -Operative Rehabilitation) Analysis for the early versus delayed rehabilitation trial (Aim 2) will follow the principle of intention- to-treat. Baseline characteristics will be compared between the two groups to assess comparability. We will estimate the time to full return to activity and participation using Kaplan Meier curves and test between the two groups using log -rank testing. We will then test the curves adjusting for site and KD injury pattern using Cox proportional hazards model similar to the analysis for the surgery and rehabilitation trial. The approaches to assessing and testing the proportional hazards assumption will be the same. We will use linear mixed models to compare and test mean patient -reported physical function between the two groups over time accounting for the repeated measurements within patient. The fixed effects of early vs. delayed rehabilitation and time (baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months) and their two- way interaction will be tested adjusting for site and KD injury pattern. The approaches to investigating and handling missing data will be similar to those proposed in Specific Aim 1. All other secondary outcomes that are scales or continuous measures and will be analyzed similarly. Secondary outcome measures that are categorical will be analyzed using random effects logistic regression to control for repeated measures within person.

It encompasses both quality control (QC), and quality assurance (QA) activities. Quality control is comprised by a set of operational activities intended to ensure the quality requirements are being met. It continuously reviews data collection forms and other records for completeness and logic. Quality assurance is comprised of a set of activities intended to: 1) establish quality requirements and procedures; 2) ensure that those requirements are being met and procedures are being followed; and 3) verify that quality is being maintained. This includes creating procedural documents to guide quality activities and the review of documentation to assess adherence to written procedures, policies, and regulations. Quality Management Quality Management includes the QC and QA processes aimed at prevention of errors, as well as processes aimed at detection and correction of errors. Activities related to Quality Management (QM) prior to study initiation will primarily focus on the prevention of errors and will include: • Reviewing consent documents to make sure that all proper elements are included and that the documents complies with all relevant regulations, local IRB requirements, and Good Clinical Practice, as appropr iate • Face -to-face kick- off Investigator’s meeting to review study protocol • Research Coordinators’ conference calls and/or webinars for training on study protocol (e.g., screening, eligibility, clinical and research CRFs, adverse events, etc.).

Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation will be provided to participants and their families, if applicable. A consent form describing in detail the study procedures and risks will be given to and reviewed with the participant . Consent forms will be IRB - and HRPO -approved, and the participant is required to read and review the document or have the document read to him or her. The investigator or designee will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. The participant will sign the informed consent d ocument prior to any study -related assessments or procedures. Participants will be given the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates prior to agreeing to participate. They may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the subjects will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of their clinical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. The consent process will be documented in the clinical or research record. Potentially eligible subjects will be informed of the study by the attending surgeon or a member of the surgeon’s clinical team . If the patient expresses an interest in participating in the study, the physician will ask permission for the patient to be approached by the research staff. At that time, the patient will be introduced to the research coordinator responsible for study recruitme nt. The surgeon- investigator and research coordinator will inform the patient of the research study including the activities, expectations, risks and benefits, and rights as a research subject as related to participation in the study. All questions and concerns will be addressed before the participant signs the consent form. Investigators and coordinators will be available to answer questions about study participation throughout the duration of the clinical trial. The informed consent discussion will occur after the clinical diagnosis of a multiple ligament knee injury, but prior to surgery and rehabilitation. The informed consent discussion will occur within the clinical practice of the treating physician, in the"

Potential participants will be given time to review the study information and ask any questions about the study they may have. Potential subjects will be able to discuss participation in the study with family members and/or other health care providers. Once the potential participant is fully informed of the study and is voluntarily willing to take part in the study, the subject and the surgeon- investigator will sign informed consent form. Before agreeing to participate in this research study, or at any time during study participation, participants will be provided the opportunity to discuss the study with another doctor who is not associated with this research study. For active duty military personnel, no individuals in the participant ’s chain of command will be involved in the recruitment process. Because the surgeon is also an investigator in the study, we recognize that the surgeon may be conflicted in their attempts to recruit the individual into the study. During the recruitment and consent process, subjects will be informed of this potential conflict and offered the opportunity to discuss their care with another surgeon that is not associated with the study. Once informed consent has been obtained, screening procedures will be performed to confirm final eligibility for participation in the trial for Aim 1 or 2. For potential participants that are between the 14 and 17 years of age, the study will be explained to both the child and the child’s parent or legal guardian as required by state (or Canadian) law and institutional policy of each site. If the child is willing to participate in the study, permission from the child’s parent or legal guardian will be sought and documented on the informed consent form. Additionally, the child will b e required to provide written assent to participate in the study. The participant 's physician will also be available to answer any questions that the subject has regarding his/her participation in the research study. If the individual agrees to participate in the study, the subject's surgeon will sign the informed consent form. All subjects will be capable of providing direct informed consent for study participation. Participants with altered mental capacity due to traumatic brain injury or those unable t o comply with study procedures will not be eligible to participate in the study. Individuals will not be approached to provide informed consent if they are under sedation,"

All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data. The investigators will maintain adequate case histories of study subjects, including accurate case report forms (CRFs), and source documentation. Data Management Responsibilities The purpose of the clinical data management plan (DMP) is to provide specific information regarding the study’s data management practices including staff responsibilities, data collection, data standards and acquisition, data quality assurance, and dissemination. The DMP will be coordinated by the Physical Therapy Data Center in the Department of Physical Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh under the leadership of Dr. Charity (Moore) Patterson, DCC Director, in collaboration with Dr. Alexandra Gil, Quality Control Coordinator and Drs. Irrgang (Principal Investigator), Musahl (Co- Principal Investigator and Qualified Collaborator [QC]) for Surgery and Lynch (Co- Investigator and QC for Rehabilitation). Data Capture Methods The Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system, hosted at the University of Pittsburgh, will be used as the web- based data collection and management system for this study .98 REDCap is a secure, web- based application designed with the flexibility to support data capture for a variety of research projects. It provides: • A mechanism for managing user -access to the data and the various system applications ; • A mechanism for validated data uploads from external s ources ; • A n intuitive user interface for validated data capture through the execution of real - time validation rules, such as univariate data type and range checks ;"

Identifiers Each study participant will be assigned a Study I dentification Number (SID) determined by site, system generated enrollment number and patient initials. The patient names and contact information will be stored in a table in the REDCap project that is not in the same tables as the research data. Name and contact information will be available to the local site where the participant was enrolled and to the staff at the University of Pittsburgh where the centralized follow -up is conducted via surveys. Dates of birth, injury, clinical visits, and surgery will be entered into the system. Date of birth and dat e of injury are necessary to ensure eligibility based on calculated age at the time of screening. Dates of surgery and clinical visits are necessary to ensure and monitor protocol compliance. Subjects will not be identified by name in any publications of research results. Confidentiality All study subjects will be identified by the SID on all data collection instruments, documents, and files used in the statistical analysis and manuscript preparation. Only limited team members will have access to personal information needed for tracking and informed consent. No personal information concerning study participants will be released without their written consent. Authorized representatives of the U.S. Army Medi cal Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC), which is the funding agency for this study, may review or obtain identifiable information (including subject SIDs) for monitoring the accuracy and completeness of the research data, for performing required scien tific analyses of the research data, and as part of their responsibility to protect human research volunteers."

The system is protected by a unique login and password. Once a research staff member has gone through data entry training and testing, the Systems Analyst or designee will permit access to the production system. A user access log will be maintained by the CCC and the DCC. We acknowledge that representatives of USAMRMC are eligible to review study records. In unusual cases, the investigators may be required to release identifiable information related to subject participation in this research study in response to an order from a court of law. If the investigators learn that a subject or someone with whom the subject is involved with is in serious danger or potential harm, they will need to inform the appropriate agencies, in response to an order by a court of law. Data Capture, Verification and Disposition The Case Report Forms (CRFs) will serve as the basis for the structure of the REDCap database with the data entry screens being as visually similar to the CRFs as possible. Blank CRFs, Study Protocol, and the Manual of Procedures (MOP) will be available in the document sharing application in the REDCap system. The MOP will include the forms and detailed descriptions of how to enter each data element. Personnel at the DCC will be av ailable to answer phone or e- mail questions during regular business hours. These include the DCC Director, the Systems Analyst, and Data Manager. Each aspect of the REDCap system will be tested before actual study data is collected. Mock data will be entered onto CRFs by DCC personnel to be used in the User Acceptance Testing process. The University of Pittsburgh site project coordinator will serve as the User for acceptance testing, entering the mock data on the CRFs into each field of each data collection instrument and documenting the success or failure of a) the user interface for data entry, b) the on- line univariate and range data validation c hecks, and c) custom functions.

The REDCap database structure will be designed and built by the Systems Analyst or designee and only these participants can modify the structure. User rights and access to all system data and applications will be assigned and managed by the Systems Analyst. All screening, clinical, surgical, rehabilitation, and performance measures data will be single -entered from the CRFs or directly entered into the REDCap data- entry screens by the coordinator at each site. Patient reported outcomes will be obtained using surveys sent via SMS text messages or email directly to the participants or via direct entry when surveys are conducted by interview (telephone or in person). REDCap has the capability to send SMS text messages to survey subjects by using a third- party web service named Twilio. Using this service, a subject will be invited to complete the CRF by sending them an SMS message or by calling them on their phone. Using this service the data are collected in REDCap directly from the subject’s phone without the need to use the webpage. The CRFs are electronic forms completed by clinical site staff or study participants. Some forms will be completed during the participant’s study visits, while others will be completed or verified using data extracted from the medical record (e.g. surgery dictation). The CRFs will be available in the REDCap file repository application and can also be obtained by emailing the Systems Analyst or Data Manager. In addition to data capture through CRFs that will be specifically developed for this STaR Trial, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function Scale will be administered as a computer adaptive test (CAT) directly through the REDCap Shared Library. 98 All instruments kept in the REDCap Shared Library have been approved and reviewed for their importance to research, function and coding precision, and copyright related issues.
