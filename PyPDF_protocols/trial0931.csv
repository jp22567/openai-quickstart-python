Eligible a dult and adolescent patients ( ≥12 to <18 years and weighing ≥40 kg) with moderate - to-severe AD for at least one year, defined according to the American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, an Eczema Area and Severity Index Score (EASI) of ≥16, an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥3 and a body surface area (BSA) of ≥10% will be enrolled. During the 16-week treatment period, approximately 225 patients will be stratifie d and randomized (2:1, active: placebo) to treatment with either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and Week 2) or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W). All study drug injections will be administered in the clinic. TCS treatment will be initiated at Baseline in all patients and may be tapered or stopped , as needed , based on treatment response. Efficacy will be measured through IGA, EASI, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD), BSA, Pruritus and Sleep -loss scores and , TCS/TCI use. Safety will be assessed in all patients by monitoring adverse events, serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, pulse and blood pressure. Additionally, adolescents will be monitored for hormones. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data periodically throughout the trial. Quality of life and impact of disease will be assessed using the Patient O riented Eczema Measure ( POEM ), Dermatology Life Quality Index/Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI/CDLQI ), standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group ( EQ-5D) , and Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) Anx iety and Depression measures. Patients reporting comorbid asthma at study entry will complete the Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ -5). Serum samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and immunogenicity. After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients will be offered the option of continued treatment in a separate long -term extension study (DRM06- AD07). Patients who early terminate or choose not to enter the long- term extension study will undergo a safety follow -up visit approximately 12 weeks after the last study drug injection. A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all required phases of the study including the last visit as shown in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study shown in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures."

Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease that is determined by genetic, environmental and immunologic factors ( Werfel 2016; Simon 2019). Genetic studies of AD ( Auriemma 2013; Bieber 2012 ; Weidinger 2018) have shown that genes encoding for cytokines involved in the regulation of the immune system ( IL-4, IL -5, and IL-13), are strongly associated with the development of AD ( He 2003; Hummelshoj 2003; Novak 2002). In addition, variants of genes that encode for proteins involved in skin barrier function such as filaggrin (FLG ) and loricrin ( LOR ) are also associated with AD ( Van Bever 2011). Since FLG plays a central role in skin barrier integrity, loss of function mutations of the FLG gene is considered a major contributor to the development of early childhood AD ( Bieber 2008; Tanei 2009; Bieber 2012 ; Flohr 2013). Reduced epithelial barrier function , which represents the first line of protection against the environment, is thought to lead to sensitization to environmental allergens, associated with elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) (present in about 50% to 80% of all patients with AD, particularly in children [ Werfel 2016] ) and consistent with the presence in t he skin of Type 2 cytokines (IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, IL -31, IL -33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP ]) and inflammation . Type 2 cytokines increase epidermal thickening, sensitization, inflammation, pruritus and decrease the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the barrier proteins FLG, LO R, and involucrin. IL-13 in particular can reduce epithelial integrity and barrier function through downregulation of FLG, LOR, and involucrin ( Kim 2008) and can act on keratinocytes in the skin to downregulate their differentiation ( Howell 2008 ). IL-13 also induces T-cell chemoattractants that mediate T -cell infiltration into AD lesions ( Purwar 2006 ) and may also induce IL-5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil chemoattractants ( Esche 2004). Increased expression of IL -13 has consistently been reported in AD skin lesions and is associated with disease severity ( Choy 2012; Hamid 1996; Jeong 2003; La Grutta 2005; Neis 2006; Suarez -Farinas 2013; Tazawa 2004 ). The ubiquitous presence of IL-13 in the skin of patients with AD supports the evaluation of anti- IL-13 therapies in patients with AD. 1.1.1. Epidemiology of Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis AD is one of the most common chroni c medical diseases —15‒30% of children and 2‒10% of adults are affected, and the prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three decades (Williams 2008 ), with some geographic variability. With respect to disease severity, about 67% of AD pediatric patients have mild disease, 14 to 26% have moderate disease and 2 to 7% have severe disease ( Silverberg 2017). Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before age 5, w ith up to 70% of children having spontaneous remission before adolescence (Bieber 2008; Hua 2014; Illi 2004). 1.1.2. Clinical Manifestations Clinically, AD is characterized by xerosis, erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), lichenification and intense pruritus ( Bieber 2008 ), which along with the distribution, chronicity and history of skin lesions, form the basis for making the diagnosis AD. F lares are frequently"
24,page_24,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 24 triggered by exposure to environmental factors, irritants, and allergens ( Bieber 2009). S everal clinical patterns, with differing distribution s of skin lesions in distinct age groups, have been noted ( Weidinger 2016; Weidinger 2018). The infantile stage (up to 2 years of age) is characterized by eczema that is usually localized to the face, scalp, and extensor aspects of the arms and legs. The lesions are characterized by pruritic, red, eczematous plaques, erythema, papules, vesicles, excoriations, oozing, and formation of crusts. The adult stage (from puberty onwards) is less predictable. Affected patients may have had only a few outbreaks since infancy, or they may have had a chronic, relapsing course. Lesions frequently localize to the face and neck (head -and neck dermatitis), as well in the flexures of the elbows and knees, and a considerable portion of patients (around 30%) develop atopic hand eczema, which may interfere with workplace activities. Like affected children, adolescents and adults commonly have lichenification of th e flexures and have facial dermatitis. Patients with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life (QoL) is significantly affected. In one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health than diabetes and hypertension ( Zuberbier 2006 ). Patients with moderate -to-severe AD have a higher prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, which are directly related to the severity of the disease ( Williams 2008 ). Depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction not only affect patients with AD, but also affect their caregivers (Zuberbier 2006). Compared with psoriasis, another common and debi litating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physical vitality, social functioning, role -emotional, and mental health scores ( Kiebert 2002). 1.1.3. Treatment for AD The therapeutic approach to AD consists primarily of trigger avoidance, skin hydration with bathing, and use of moisturizers and anti-inflammatory therapies consisting predominantly of TCS. In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of symptomatic relief but does not always adequately control the di sease. In those patients who have persistent moderate- to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, t he step -up options include topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive agents such as oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatment of moderate- to-severe AD (nationally licensed in many European countries, but not in the US), and its use is limited to patients ≥16 years f or a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks. Recently, a clinically efficacious and relatively safe treatment, the anti -IL-4R monoclonal antibody, dupilumab , was approved for the treatment of adult and adolescent patients with moderate- to-severe AD . In spite of these treatments, AD remains a major societal burden and a significant unmet medical need. 1.2. Lebrikizumab Lebrikizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a mutation in the hinge region that increases stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble human interleukin (IL)-13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL-13 signaling through the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. Because lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 in a non-receptor binding domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody-bound"
25,page_25,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 25 IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL-13R α1), but the engaged receptor complex cannot be activated. 1.3. Study Rationale and Benefi t-Risk Assessment 1.3.1. Scientific Rationale The use of lebrikizumab for AD is supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrat ing that AD is characterized by the increased expression of IL-13 in skin. Moreover, c linical trials (a Phase 2a study GS29250 [Section 1.3.1.1] and a Phase 2b study DRM06 -AD01 [Section 1.3.1.3]) with lebrikizumab demonstrated significant clinical benefit in patients with AD. Additional detailed discussion of the lebrikizumab studies is provided in the lebrikizumab Investigator’s Brochure. 1.3.1.1. Summary of Study GS29250 (TREBLE) Study Design TREBLE was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with persistent moderate to severe AD, inadequately controlled by TCS. The study consisted of 3 study periods: a run-in period (2 weeks), a treatment period (12 weeks), and a safety follow-up period (8 weeks). Patients applied emollient at least once daily and TCS of medium potency to all active skin lesions twice daily through the study . A total of 212 patients were randomized as follows: 53 to the lebrikizumab 250 mg, single dose group; 53 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg, single dose group; 52 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group; and 54 to the placebo Q4W group. Efficacy Results • EASI -50 at Week 12 (primary endpoint) was achieved by patients treated with lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W, with a treatment difference between this group and placebo) of 20.1% p = 0.0261). • Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W grou p demonstrated statistically significant differences from placebo in EASI -75 and SCORAD-50 and adjusted mean change from baseline to Week 12. Safety Results • Injection -site reactions occurred infrequently (1.3% all lebrikizumab treated vs. 1.9% placebo); all events were non -serious, lasted a median of 1 to 3 days, and did not lead to treatment discontinuation or interruption. • Herpes viral infections and zoster occurred infrequently, but only among lebrikizumab-treated patients (6 of 156 [3.8%]); all events were non -serious, and none led to treatment discontinuation or dose interruption of lebrikizumab. • Eosinophil- associated adverse events ( AEs) were reported infrequently, but only occurred among lebrikizumab -treated patients (3.2%); however, all e vents were non -serious, did"
26,page_26,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 26 not result in interruption of treatment, and there were no other associated clinical symptoms noted. • Allergic conjunctivitis events were only reported in lebrikizumab- treated patients (8 of 156 patients [5.1%] vs. 0% in placebo treated patients); all events were non -serious, did not lead to treatment discontinuation, all events recovered or resolved, and all patients had a history of asthma. Imbalances in allergic conjunctivitis events were not reported in previous lebrikizumab t rials. • The overall incidence of skin infection (noted in the system organ class [ SOC ] of infections and infestations) was 9.6% in all lebrikizumab arms combined, compared to 22% in the placebo arm. Conclusions The results of this trial suggested that lebrikizumab (on a background of mandatory twice daily TCS treatment ) provided some treatment benefit, as measured through EASI and SCORAD , but also suggested that higher lebrikizumab dosing might provide greater clinical benefit. In addition, lebrikizumab was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with that observed in previous trials conducted in other indications. 1.3.1.2. Summary of Study GS29735 (ARBAN) Study Design ARBAN was a Phase 2, randomized, open- label study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab monotherapy in adult patients (18–75 years of age) with persistent moderate to severe AD, who were inadequately controlled by TCS. A total of 55 patients were randomized to treatment: 28 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W and 27 to TCS. Efficacy Results • EASI -50 was achieved by 53.6% and 51.9% of patients in the lebrikizumab and TCS groups, respectively, with a treatment difference of 1.7%. EASI -75 was achieved by 39.3% and 37.0% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively, with a treatment difference of 2.3%. • IGA scores of 0 or 1 were observed for 7.1% of patients in the lebrikizumab group and 25.9% of patients in the TCS group, giving a treatment difference of −18.8% (95% CI: −37.9%, 0.3%). • The percent of pati ents achieving SCORAD- 50 or SCORAD-75 showed treatment differences of −19.3% and − 7.5% , respectively. Safety Results • Adverse event s were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group compared with the TCS group (64.3% vs. 37.0%) ; a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group, compared with the TCS group, had an AE in the SOC of infections and infestations (42.9% vs. 25.9%). U pper respiratory tract infections were more common in the lebrikizumab group (14.3% vs. 3.7%)."
27,page_27,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 27 • The overall incidence of skin infection (in the SOC of infections and infestations) was 17.9% in the lebrikizumab group and 7.4% in the placebo/TCS group. • No serious AEs (SAEs), deaths, anaphylaxis, malignancy, protocol- defined parasitic or targeted intracel lular infections of interest, herpes viral infections or zoster, or eosinophilia- associated AEs were reported. Conclusions Lebrikizumab was well tolerated at the dose of 125 mg Q4W; the safety profile was generally consistent with previous experience with lebrikizumab in previous trials. 1.3.1.3. Summary of Dose Ranging Study DRM06 -AD01 Study Design DRM06 -AD01 was a Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose- ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients with m oderate to severe AD. A total of 280 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (in a 3:3:3:2 ratio): 73 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 250 mg); 80 to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 500 mg); 75 to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W (with a loading dose of 500 mg given at baseline and W eek 2) ; 52 to placebo Q2W. Efficacy Results • Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups achieved EASI-50, EASI-75, or EASI- 90 at Week 16 than the placebo group. • A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had both an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a ≥ 2-point improvement in IGA score at Week 16 than the placebo group. • The lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W group had a statistically significantly greater proportion of patients who achieved a ≥ 4-point improvement in pruritus NRS compared with the placebo group. • Positive changes in pruritus correlated with positive changes in sleep; the lebrikizumab 250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had statistically significant percent reductions in sleep loss due to itching compared with placebo (p=0.0459 and p=0.0062, respectively). Safety Results • The incidences of conjunctivitis (2.6% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), herpes infections (2.2% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), and herpes zoster (0.9% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo) were relatively low. • Three patients (1.3%) in the lebrikizumab groups and 2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo group had an SAE. Those reported in the lebrikizumab groups were severe chest pain (1 patient in the 250 mg Q2W group), femur fracture of moderate severity (1 patient in the 125 mg Q4W group), and panic attack of moderate severity (1 patient in the 250 mg Q2W group). Those reported in the placebo group were severe chronic obstructive"

All SAEs were considered by the investigator as not related to study drug. • Most AEs were considered not related to study drug; those considered related were reported for 16.2% of patients in the lebrikizumab groups and 5.8% of patients in the placebo group Conclusions This Phase 2b study showed that higher doses of lebrikizumab provided greater clinical benefit. All lebrikizumab doses induced statistically significant reduction s in EASI scores compared to placebo , and a good dose response was observed for all primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. The best response for all endpoints was observed with the highest lebrikizumab dose (250 mg Q2W), although the next highest dose (250 mg Q4W) also induced significant improvement in virtually all endpoints. All doses of lebrikizumab were well tolerated , without a dose response noted; AEs were generally mild or moderate and considered unrelated to study drug. These results provided the basis for dose selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies. 1.3.1.4. Summary of DRM06 -AD03 Phase 1 PK Study Study Design DRM06 -AD03 was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics ( PK) and safety of lebrikizumab in healthy adult volunteers (18 to 45 years of age, inclusive). A total of 41 subjects were randomized as follows: 21 subjects received two 1-mL (125 mg) SC injections and 20 subjects received one 2-mL (250 mg) SC injection. The primary objective was to compare the PK (AUC, C max) of the 2 lebrikizumab dosing regimens. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for PK and Day 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Pharmacokinetic Results For each AUC comparison (i.e., AUC last, AUC inf, and AUC 0-57d) geometric mean ratios were close to 1 with 90% CI s within the range of 80% to 125%, except for AUC inf, which was just above the upper bound, with a value of 132% . The C max geometric mean ratio was 0.89 with a 90% CI of 73%–108%. Conclusions Both the AUC and C max results indicated similar overall exposure between the 2 lebrikizumab dosing regimens evaluated in this study, i.e., two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC injections versus one 2- mL (250 mg) SC injection. Data from th is study support the use of the 2- mL (250 mg) pre- filled syringe with a pre- assembled needle safety device ( PFS-NSD) in the Phase 3 pivotal trials. 1.4. Rationale for D ose and Treatment Regimen The dosing regimen of 500 mg loading dose at baseline and Week 2, followed by 250 mg Q2W lebrikizumab was selected , based on an evaluation of safety, efficacy and PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 and DRM06- AD03 trials (see above) ."

STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study which is 16 weeks in duration. The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab when used in combination with TCS treatment compared with placebo in combination with TCS treatment for moderate -to-severe AD (Figure 1). Eligible a dult and adolescent patients ( ≥12 to <18 years and weighing ≥40 kg) with moderate -to- severe AD for at least one year, defined according to the American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria, an EASI of ≥16, an IGA score of ≥3 and a BSA of ≥10% will be enrolled. During the 16- week treatment period, approximately 225 patients will be stratified and randomized 2:1 to treatment with either 250 mg lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg given at Baseline and Week 2) or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection every 2 weeks (Q2W). All study drug inject ions will be administered in the clinic. TCS will be initiated at Baseline in all patients and may be tapered or stopped, as needed , based on treatment response. Efficacy will be measured through IGA, EASI, SCORAD, BSA, Pruritus and Sleep -loss scores and, TCS/TCI use. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, serum chemistry, hematology and urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, pulse and blood pressure. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will monitor patient s afety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data periodically throughout the trial. Quality of life and impact of disease will be assessed using the POEM, DLQI/CDLQI, EQ- 5D, and PROMIS ® Anxiety and Depression measures. Patients reporting comor bid asthma at study entry will complete the ACQ -5. Serum samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and immunogenicity. After completion of the Week 16 visit, patients will be offered the option to continue treatment in a separate long -term extension study (DRM06- AD07). Patients who early terminate or choose not to enter the long- term extension study will receive a safety follow -up approximately 12 weeks after the last study drug injection. Completion of Patient Participation: A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed the last scheduled visit: • For subjects continuing into LTE, upon completion of week 16 visit and rolling into LTE study • For subjects not continuing into LTE, when subject had either week 16 or ET visit, and safety follow up visit (12 weeks after last IP administration)"

STUDY DRUG 5.1. Investigational Medicinal Product Lebrikizumab is a sterile liquid solution containing 125 mg/mL lebrikizumab, histidine acetate, sucrose, polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection, USP, pH 5.4‒6.0. Placebo solution is identical in appearance and content to the active solution except for lebrikizumab. All study drug (lebrikizumab and placebo) will be supplied as a sterile pre -filled syringe with a pre -assembled needle safety device (PFS -NSD). Each pre- filled syringe is intended f or a single 2 mL dose (250 mg) administered subcutaneously (SC). 5.2. Storage and Labeling Study drug is to be stored under refrigerated conditions (2‒8°C) and protected from excessive light and heat. Study drug should not be frozen, shaken or stored at room te mperature. Temperature excursions outside of 2‒8°C must be reported to the Sponsor or the designee. Each PFS -NSD will be packaged in a carton . A medication numbering system will be used in labeling blinded study drug. Lists linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the group responsible for study drug packaging. In order to maintain the study blind, these lists will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. Medication numbers will be assigned to a patient in the electronic data capture system based on the study randomization schema. 5.3. Patient Randomization Patients will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any pa tient records, datasets or tissue samples that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; pa tient names or any information which would make the pat ient identifiable will not be transferred. All patients will be random ly allocated to receive the study treatment using an electronic data capture system (an electronic randomization and trial supply management system) at the Baseline visit. The allocation to treatment will be prospectively stratified by geographic region (US versus EU versus res t of world), age (adolescent patients 12 to <18 years versus adults ≥18 years) and disease severity (IGA 3 versus 4) . At the Baseline visit (Day 1), once a patient is considered eligible to participate in the study, demographic and stratification information will be entered into the EDC to receive a medication number assigning the appropriate treatment to a patient. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to one of the following treatment groups:"

TCS treatment initiated at Baseline and applied PRN. • Placebo 4mLs (two PFS-NSD) administered at Baseline and Week 2 and 2mLs given Q2W through Week 14. TCS treatment initiated at Baseline and applied PRN. 5.4. Study Blinding The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, study-site personnel, and the patient will be blinded to treatment assignment. The integrity of the clinical study will be maintained by observing the treatment blind. If knowledge of a patient’s treatment assignment is required for the patient’s clinical care and/or safety, the Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor prior to breaking the blind. 5.4.1. Unblinding Treatment Assignment Unblinding the treatment assignment of a patient may only be performed in emergencies where knowledge of the patient ’s treatment assignment is essential for management of the patient ’s medical care. Unblinding the treatment assignment by the investigator under any other circumstances will be considered a protocol violation. The investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor or designee prior to unblinding a patient ’s treatment assignment. In the event of any unblinding, emergency or accidental, the sponsor must be notified within 1 business day. Unblinding will occur using the EDC . The Investigator must record the date and time the blind was broken, the names of the personnel involved, and the reason that treatment assignment information was required. The date and time that the Sponsor or designee was notified will also be recorded. 5.5. Study Drug Administration Study drug will be administered to all patients in the clinic by designated and trained site staff . 5.5.1. Instructions for Administration in the Clinic Syringes should be at room temperature prior to injection (refer to the applicable Instructions for Use provided by the sponsor). 5.6. Study Drug Accountability The Investigator must keep an accurate record of the number of cartons received, the study drug dispensed/used, and those returned to the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor or designee will provide forms to facilitate inventory control. All study-drug accountability forms and treatment logs must be retain ed in the Investigator’s permanent study file, and these records must be available for inspection at any time by the Sponsor, its designees, or by regulatory agencies. The study monitor will perform drug accountability for all study drug at the site, and w ill assist in returning all used, unused, and expired materials , to the Sponsor/designees, or destroy it according to the study site’s standard operating procedure, if accepted by the Sponsor."

CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS AND PROCEDURES All medications (including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and antacids) and over-the-counter emollient(s) taken/used at screening and throughout the study must be recorded. Patients should be instructed to consult with the Investigator prior to initiating any new medication (either self - administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by another physician) while participating in the study. The Investigator is expected to examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications, topical preparations, and di etary supplements taken by patients participating in the trial. • Medication entries should be specific to product name (if a combination drug product) and spelled correctly. • The brand and specific product name for any over-the- counter emollient(s) should be noted and spelled correctly. • Information on the dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, start date, discontinuation date, indication, and reason for use will be recorded. • The use of any concomitant medication must relate to an AE listed on the A E electronic case report form ( eCRF ) or the patient's medical history unless it is a supplement or used as preventative care. 6.1. Permitted and Prohibited Treatments and Procedures The use of concomitant medications for other medical conditions ( e.g., hypertension, diabetes, acute infections) is permitted during this study. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to control asthma are permitted. The introduction of medications or therapies for other medical conditions known to affect AD (e.g. syste mic corticosteroids , mycophenolate- mofetil, IFN -y, Janus kinase inhibitors, TCI, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexat e, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy, phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors such as crisaborole ) are not permitted during the study. The use o f systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of AD is prohibited and requires permanent discontinuation of Investigational Product. If used for treatment of AEs (for example, worsening of existing condition, such as asthma exacerbation ), it will be treated as rescue medication as per the Section 6.4 . Acute infections can be treated with systemic antibiotics , use of which must be recorded in the eCRF. However, chronic treatment with systemic antibiotics is not permitted . The use of a tanning booth/parlor is not permitted during the trial. Cannabinoid treatments for AD are prohibited. Planned or anticipated major medical procedures or surgeries should be avoided during the trial. See Section 6.4 for details on approved rescue medications and timing of use."

Moisturizers Non-medicated moisturizers are to be used during the study. T he patient may continue her/his current over -the-counter moisturizer regimen, if approved by the Investigator. 6.3. Topical Treatment for A topic Dermatitis All patients will be instructed to use TCS for AD symptoms starting at the Baseline visit ( Day 1 ). Patients may taper or stop TCS us e, as needed . If AD lesions return or a patient experiences a flare, TCS treatment may be resumed at the patient’s discretion. Low-potency TCS or t opical calcineu rin inhibitors (TCI) may be used for sensitive areas only, i.e., face, neck, intertriginous and genital areas. A mid -potency TCS, triamcinolone a cetonide 0.1% cream , and a low-potency TCS, hydrocortisone 1% cream (for use on sensitive skin areas) will be provided by the Sponsor or clinical site for use in this trial. Patients are to be instructed to return all used and unused TCS medication (tubes) to the study site for accountability purposes. The Investigator must keep an accurate record of the number of tubes received, dispensed/used, and those returned to the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor or designee will provide forms to facilitate inventory control. All accountability forms and treatment logs must be retained in the Investigator’s permanent study file, and these records must be available for inspection at any time by the Sponsor, its designees, or by regulatory agencies. The study monitor will perform accountability for all TCS tubes at the site, and will assist in returning all used, unused, and expired materials, to the Sponsor/designees, or destroy it according to the study site’s standard operating procedure, if accepted by the Sponsor. All TCS and TCI use will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary. 6.4. Rescue Treatment for Atopic Dermatitis The goal of this Phase 3 study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab when used in combination with TCS for AD . However, add on rescue therapies may be needed , if the patient experiences clinical worsening of symptoms th at are intolerable. If medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms), high potency TCS or systemic treatments (e.g., oral corticosteroids, phototherapy, cyclosporin, etc.) may be used. Study drug must be discontinued for patients receiving systemic rescue treatment . Patients should continue to attend all study visits and be assessed for safety and efficacy according to the schedule of events , even if rescue medication is initiated .

DETAILS OF ASSESSMENTS 8.1. Screening Assessments 8.1.1. Demographic Information Patient age, gender at birth, ethnicity and race will be collected. Race and ethnicity information will only be used to support sub-group analyses assessing phenotype with treatment response. The collection of a patient’s race and ethnicity is particularly important, given recent descriptions of disease heterogeneity in AD, with diverse phenotypes and endotypes described based on age, disease chronicity, ethnicity, genetics, IgE status, and underlying molecular mechanisms (Czarnowicki 2019)."
45,page_45,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 45 8.1.2. Medical History A complete medical history will be collected and include immunization rec ord (for adolescent patients), clinically relevant medical conditions or surgeries, including more specific information on a history of conjunctivitis and herpes infection/zoster. Information on the patient’s AD and comorbidities ( past history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, alopecia) will be collected and include the date of onset, extent of involvement and past treatments for AD and comorbidities . 8.2. Assessment of Efficacy Each patient’s AD will be assessed as specified in the Schedul e of Visits and Procedures. Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient over the course of the study. The sponsor will administer training on the required efficacy assessments, detail on the specific instruments and training given are recorded in the study training materials . 8.2.1. Investigator Global Assessment The IGA is a static assessment and rates the severity of the patient’s AD . The IGA is comprised of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) and a score is selected using descriptors that best describe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point. It is not necessary that all characteristics under Morphological Description be present. Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. The IGA must be conducted prior to conducting the EASI and BSA assessments. A single assessor should be assigned to each individual patient for as many visits as possible, to avoid inter- assessor variability in scorin g. Table 2: Investigator Global Assessment Score Grade Definition 0 Clear Minor, residual discoloration; no erythema or induration/papulation; no oozing/crusting; no edema. 1 Almost Clear Trace, faint pink erythema with barely perceptible induration/papulation and no oozing/crusting; no edema. 2 Mild Faint -pink erythema with papulation and edema perceptible upon palpation and no oozing/crusting; minimal induration. 3 Moderate Pink-red erythema with definite edema of skin papules and plaques; there may be some oozing/crusting; palpable induration. 4 Severe Deep/bright red erythema with significant swelling and obvious raised borders of papules and plaques with oozing/crusting; significant induration. 8.2.2. Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with the higher values indicating more severe and/ or extensive disease. Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment."
46,page_46,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 46 8.2.3. Body Surface Area The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. Body surface area will be determined by the Investigator or designee using the patient palm = 1% rule. Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. 8.2.4. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis SCOR ing Atopic Dermatitis is a validated clinical tool for assessing the extent and intensity of atopic dermatitis. There are 3 components to the assessment: • The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). • The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation) . • Subjective assessment of itch and of sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the patient or relative on a VAS, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20 ( assign ed as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculatio n). The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. 8.2.5. Pruritus Pruritus will be assessed by the patient using a Pruritus Numeric al Rating Scale (NRS). The Pruritus NRS is an 11- point scale used by patients to rate their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch imaginable.” Assessments will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary. Data will be transferred to the clinical database. 8.2.6. Sleep -Loss Sleep -loss due to pruritus will be assessed by the patient. P atient s rate their sleep based on a 5- point L ikert scale [0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all) ]. Ass essments will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary. Data will be transferred to the clinical database. 8.3. Patient Reported Outcomes and Health -Related Quality of Life Patient reported outcome and quality of life measures should all be completed prior to other study assessments."

Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7 -item, validated, questionnaire used by the patient to assess disease symptoms over the last we ek. The patient is asked to respond to 7 questions on skin dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding and weeping. All 7 answers carry equal weight with a total possible score from 0 to 28 (answers scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2 days = 1; 3-4 da ys = 2; 5‒6 days = 3; everyday = 4). A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. POEM responses will be captured using an electronic diary and transferred into the clinical database. 8.3.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI is a 10 -item, validate d questionnaire used to assess the impact of skin disease on the quality of life of an affected person. The 10 questions cover the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment, over the previous week. Questions are scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible total score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life). A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. Patients ≤16 years will complete the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) and should continue to complete the CDLQI for the duration of the study. DLQI/CDLQI is completed by the patient in the study clinic. 8.3.3. EQ-5D EQ-5D comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ VAS records the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles. EQ- 5D is completed by the patient in the study clinic. 8.3.4. Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Sy stem: Anxiety and Depression Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System is a set of person -centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. Pediatric and tools for anxiety and depressio n. Patients ≤1 7 years will complete pediatric versions for the duration of the study. T he PROMIS measures will be completed by the patient in the study clinic. 8.3.5. Asthma Control Questionnaire Patients who report comorbid asthma prior to enrollment will complete the ACQ -5) in addition to other patient reported outcomes in this trial. The ACQ-5 has been shown to reliably measure asthma control and distinguish patients with well- controlled asthma (score ≤0.75 points) from those with uncontrolled asthma (score ≥1.5 points). It consists of 5 questions that are scored on a 7-point Likert scale with a recall period of 1 week. The total ACQ- 5 score is the mean score of all questions; a lower score represents better asthma control. ACQ-5 is completed by the patient in the study clinic."

Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be conducted at screening and cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height and weight will also be recorded. At subsequent study visits, a symptom- directed physical examination may be conducted at the discretion of the Investigator. Findings will be recorded as medical history or AE in the eCRF. 8.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs, including body temperature, respiratory rate (breath per minute), pulse (beats per minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position, after sitting for at least 5 min utes. Any abnormal findings which are new or worsened in severity and clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, will be recorded as an AE. Vital sign measurements will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.4.3. Laboratory Evaluations Laboratory tests will be analyzed using a central laboratory and include hematology with differential, serology, a standard chemistry panel (including liver -function tests), total cholesterol, standard urine testing, and urine pregnancy test for women who are not post-menopausal or surgically sterile. Blood and urine will be collected from each patient as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures or as clinically indicated . Laboratory data will be transferred to the clinical database."

Adverse Events Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the Investigator and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked about AEs in a non-specific manner using open -ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have you been since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when applicable. All AEs will be documented and recorded in the patient’s eCRF. Any patient who has an AE (serious or non-serious) will be evaluated by the Investigator and treated and followed until the symptom(s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator. A physician, either at the clinical site, or at a nearby hospital emergenc y room, will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When"

FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 50 appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s). 8.4.4.1. Reporting Only AEs that occur during or following study treatment with the study drug will be reported in the AE section of the eCRF. Events occurring prior to study treatment with the drug will be reported in the Medical History section of the eCRF. All AEs occurri ng during the study will be individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will be recorded. New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if they are considered to be of clinical significance by the Investigator or meet the criteria of an SAE as described in Section 8.4.4.3. Unless an overall diagnosis is described , signs and symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred. The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respiratory infection). Severity is not the same as “serious”. Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (See Section 8.4.4.3) The relationship of the AE to the study treatment should be determined by the Investigator and will be based on the following two definitions: Not related : The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug and is most likely attributable to another cause. Related: A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and study treatment. 8.4.4.2. Adve rse Events of Special Interest The following treatment emergent adverse events are being designated a dverse events of special interest (AESI): • conjunctivitis • herpes infection or zoster • parasitic infection or an infection related to an intracellular path ogen Adverse events of special interest should be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 48 hours of knowledge of the event. Additional data will be collected for AESIs on study- specific AESI forms will be provided to the site. Patient records must in clude any follow-up information regarding these AESIs. Study drug should be discontinued if an adverse event is deemed persistent and if continuation of study drug would not be in the best interest of the patient . Discuss disc ontinuation of study drug or dose changes with the Sponsor or designee prior to implementation."

Serious Adverse Events An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, • Results in death • Is in the opinion of the Investigator immediately life threatening (i.e., the patient is at immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening, result in death, or require hospitalization, but based on appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE information. In the case of patient death, any post- mortem findings/reports will be requested. 8.4.4.4. Reporting of S erious Adverse Event s All SAEs , as defined in Section 8.4.4.3, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be documented to the extent that information is available. Serious adverse event s will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. If, in the opinion of the Investigator, an SAE occurring outside the specified time window (i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug - related, the event should be reported with 24 hours. Serious adverse event s must be recorded on study- specific SAE form s which will be provided to the site . The minimum information required for SAE reporting includes the identity of the PI, site number, patient number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form. In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all material facts relating to the progression or outcome of th e SAE. The Investigator may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by the Sponsor or its designee. When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered:"
52,page_52,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 52 • Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be provided, the Investigator should report the diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term. • Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless the event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. Although most hospitalizations necessitate reporting of an SAE, some hospitalizations do not: • Hospitalization for elective or previously scheduled surgery, or for a procedure for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospitalization. • Events that result in h ospital stays for observation of <24 hours and that do not require a therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics). The Sponsor will proces s and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant regulatory authorities have been met. The Sponsor will assess the likelihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the event to study drug. Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethic s Committees (IEC), and investigators. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investi gator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.4.5. Product Complaint s A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness or performance of a trial intervention. The sponsor collects product complaints on investigational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Participants will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or problem with the investigational product or drug delivery system so that the situation can be assessed."

Pregnancy The Investigator must notify the Sponsor immediately regarding a pregnancy in a (1) female clinical trial patient or (2) female partner of a male clinical trial patient . Pregnant female patient s must be withdrawn from study drug. If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by the male patient, the male patient will be advised by the study Investigator to have his female pregnant partner inform her treating physician immediately. The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clin ically indicated and continue to follow the patient for ≥4 weeks after delivery. Medical d etails for both the mother and baby must be obtained. The Investigator must complete a study -specific Pregnancy Form upon confirmation of a pregnancy. Pregnancy reporting forms will be provided to the site. 8.4.7. Hypersensitivity Reactions Patient s experiencing any hypersensitivity reaction should receive appropriate symptomatic medical care, as needed. Patients should be instructed to inform the site if a hypersensitivity reaction occurs. At the next study visit, a blood sample must be collected for immunogenicity analysis.

However, patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons: • Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time • Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter- current illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in the best interest of the patient • Serious protocol violation, persistent non-compliance or requirement for medication or procedure prohibited by the protocol • Lost to follow-up Patients who are terminated early from the study will have an Early Termination visit scheduled as soon as possible (see Section 7.12). All information, including the reason for early termination will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF. Two attempts of contact (e.g., telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of contact to the patient must be documented in a patient’s study records for all patients who are believed to be lost to follow -up. 8.6.2. Study Drug Discontinuation Study drug must be discontinued for patients who experience the following:"

FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 55 • Inter -current illness that would, in t he judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of clinical status to a significant degree • Treatment -related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the judgment of the Investigator • Unacceptable toxicity • Pregnancy • Use of systemic res cue medication as outlined in Section 6.4 Patients who discontinue study drug permanently during study participation must be scheduled for an Early T ermination visit except those receiving systemic rescue medication, as per the Section 6.4 . 8.7. Data Safety Monitoring Board An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of members who are independent of the study sponsor and study investigators will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data that is blinded by treatment group; if requested, the D SMB may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested data for the purposes of a risk- benefit assessment. The DSMB will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The DSMB will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study results during the study execution. All activities and responsibilities of the DSMB are described in the DRM06 DMC charter. 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 9.1. General Statistical Methodology All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two -sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of significance. Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be presented. For continuous parameters, descripti ve statistics will include n umber of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. For dichotomous variables, the CMH analysis wil l be used. For continuous variables, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used with factors of treatment and randomization strata and relevant baseline value. More details will be specified in the s tatistical a nalysis plan ( SAP). The Pruritus- NRS weekly mean will be calculated as follows: The mean of each patient’s baseline and post-baseline Pruritus-NRS scores will be computed for each week based on the"
56,page_56,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 56 previous 7 days. The weekly mean will be calculated if a patient has responses for Pruritus -NRS on at least 4 of the 7 days of the week. If the patient has 3 or fewer Pruritus-NRS responses, the mean value for that item will be considered missing. All Pruritus -NRS efficacy endpoint analyses will be conducted on the weekly mean. The Sleep -Loss weekly mean will be calculated similar to the Pruritus -NRS weekly mean. All Sleep -Loss efficacy endpoint analyses will be conducted on the weekly mean. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be as follows f or both binary and continuous endpoints: for patients who receive rescue medication (Section 6.4 for definition of rescue medication), use systemic corticosteroids or withdraw from the study due to lack of efficacy, set to the patient’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week 16. Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) multiple imputation will be used to handle the remaining missing data. MCMC multiple imputation for all missing values, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Tipping Point analysis will be used for sensitivity anal yses. Demographic data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Patient s’ baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with descriptive statistics among treatment groups to ensure comparable results. The number of patients in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by treatment group. An SAP, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a se parate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments. 9.1.1. Populations Analyzed Approximately 225 patients (including approximately 50 a dolescent patient s [≥12 to <18 years of age and weighing ≥ 40 kg ]) will be randomized to lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W or placebo treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent- to-treat (ITT) population and the per-protocol (PP) population. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. All patient s who are randomized will be included in the ITT population. All patient s who are randomized and receive at least one confirmed dose of study drug will be included in the safety population. The PP population will include all patient s in th e ITT population who complete the Week 16 evaluation without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any patient or Investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). The PP population will include patients in the safety population who do not meet any of the following criteria: • Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria; • Used an interfering concomitant medication (see Section 6.1 for definitions of interfering concomitant medications) or underwent a prohibited procedure; • Did not attend the Week 16 visit; • Missed more than one post-baseline study visit prior to Week 16;"
57,page_57,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 57 • Have not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., patients must receive at least 75% of the expected injections of study medication during participation in the study); • Out of visit window at the Week 16 visit by more than ±4 day. Patient s that discontinue from the study due to an adverse event related to study treatment or documented lack of treatment effect will be included in the PP population. Prior to breaking the blind, other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 9.2. Primary Efficacy Analysis For FDA: The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with an IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥ 2-points from Baseline to Week 16 and will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity, age). For EMA: Both co-primary endpoints: • Percentage of patients with an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a reduction ≥2 points from baseline to Week 16, and • Percentage of patients achieving EASI- 75 (≥75% reduction from baseline in EASI score) at Week 16 will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel t est adjusted by randomization strata (region, disease severity, age). 9.3. Missing Data The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be as follows for both binary and continuous endpoints: for patients who receive topical rescue medication (per Se ction 6.4), receive systemic rescue medication or withdraw from the study due to lack of efficacy, set to the patient ’s baseline value subsequent to this time through Week 16. MCMC multiple imputation will be used to handle the remaining missing data . Imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For each imputatio n process, 25 datasets with imputations will be calculated. E ach complete data set will be analyzed with the specified analysis . The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC M IANALYZE. For binary responses related to EASI and IGA, the binary response variables will be calculated based on the multiply imputed datasets that have been created. Because the MCMC algorithm is based on the multivariate normal model, imputed values for IGA will not generally be one of the discrete values used in IGA scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, to derive the binary IGA response variable, standard rounding rules will be applied to the imputed values. For example, if a patient has an IGA score imputed as 1.4 (and assuming a Baseline IGA score of 3), the imputed value would be rounded down to 1, and the minimum change from Baseline of 2 would have been met. This patient would be considered a responder."
58,page_58,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 -A1/J2T-DM-KGAD- A1 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. FINAL 13May2020 Confidential Page 58 For derivation of an EASI-75 response, no rounding will be performed. The imputed W eek 16 EASI value will be compared directly to the observed Baseline EASI value to determine whether a reduction of at least 75% was achieved. Imputation of continuous data will parallel that of binary variables. A total of 4 random seeds will be needed to impute IGA for the two treatment groups. The two seeds have been pre- specified by a random -number generator: • IGA: Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed = 970309630 • IGA: Placebo Q2W: Seed = 1477266806 A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute Pruritus NRS for the two treatment groups. The two seeds have been pre- specified by a random -number generator: • NRS : Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed = 1611917356 • NRS : Placebo Q2W : Seed = 1087836192 A total of 2 random seeds will be needed to impute EASI for t he two treatment groups. Those 2 random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: • EASI: Lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W : Seed = 353985587 • EASI: Placebo Q2W : Seed = 1828572477 9.4. Sensitivity Analyses 9.4.1. All Missing Values MCMC Multiple Imputation In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed values as collected for visits subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed using MCMC multiple imputation for the primary endpoint of a n IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75, EASI-90 and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥4 points, all at Week 16. 9.4.2. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) In this set of sensitivity analysis, the non- missing assessed values as collected for visits subsequent to rescue medication use will be used. Otherwise, missing values will be imputed using LOCF for the primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75, EASI-90 and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥4 points, all at Week 16. 9.4.3. Non-Response Imputation In this set of sensitivity analysis, f or patients who receive topical rescue medication (per Section 6.4 ), receive systemic rescue medication and any other missing values, set to non - response subsequent to this time through Week 16 for primary endpoint and the following secondary endpoints: EASI-75, EASI-90, and Pruritus- NRS Improvement ≥4 points, all at Week 16."

Tipping Point Analysis Assuming the primary analyses results of endpoints are statistically significant, in this set of sensit ivity analysis, assumptions on missing data due to rescue medication and study discontinuation will be varied to investigate if there will be any tipping points. To assess the impact of rescue medication and missing data due to dropout, the rates of response and non- response (including rescue medication use and dropout) will be varied to assess the response rates that tip significant differences to non -significance. The primary endpoint of an IGA 0 or 1 and a ≥2-point reduction from Baseline to Week 16 and the following secondary endpoints: EASI -75, EASI-90 and Pruritus- NRS i mprovement ≥4-points, all at Week 16 will be assessed using the tipping point analysis. More details about missing value imputation analysis will be described in the SAP. 9.4.5. Subgroup Analys es Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT populations for the following subgroups: Adolescents (Age 12 to <18 years) vs. Adults (Age ≥ 18 years), sex, race, baseline IGA score (3 or 4), region ( US, Europe, Rest of the World). Subgroup analysis will be conducted on the primary endpoint of IGA (0,1), EASI-75, EASI-90 and percent of patient s with pruritus improvement ≥ 4 points, all at Week 16. Sensitivity analyses will be addressed in a full statistical analysis plan. 9.5. Multiplicity C onsiderations The prespecified graphical multiple testing approach ( Bretz et al. 2011) will be implemented to control the overall Type I error rate at 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 for superiority tests for the hypotheses for the primary and major secondary endpoints. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure; hence it strongly controls the family- wise error rate across all endpoints (Alosh et al. 2014). The major secondary endpoints will be pre -specified in the SAP prior to the first unblinded analysis. FDA objectives: The graphical testing scheme will test IGA (0,1) first before proceeding to test the major secondary endpoints. Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, interrelationships, Type I error allocation for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre- specified in the SAPs prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis. EMA objectives: The Week 16 endpoints of IGA (0,1) and EASI- 75 repres ent a primary endpoint family. The graphical testing scheme will sequentially test IGA (0,1) first, followed by EASI -75 before proceeding to test the major secondary endpoints. Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (including testing order, in terrelationships, Type I error allocation for the major secondary endpoints , and the associated propagation) will be pre- specified in the SAPs prior to first unblinded efficacy analysis."

An injection is considered the full set of injections specified by the protocol for a given treatment. A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patien t received ≥75% of the expected number of injections while enrolled in the study. 9.10. Adverse Events All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset date on or after the date of the first injection of study drug. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, including the number of patients reporting an event, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness for the safety population. All serious AEs as well as AEs that led to study discontinuation will be listed by patient. AE tabulations will be summarized and presented .

Sample -Size Determination For FDA Approximately 225 patients will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to lebrikizumab or placebo (150 patients:75 patients). The assumed IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 response rates are 38% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and 13% for placebo. The assumption for lebrikizumab is based on the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 using the rescue medication non- response sensitivity analysis , adjusting for the allowed use of TCS/TCI. The placebo response rates are based on the review of historical TCS clinical studies in atopic dermatitis ( Simpson et al. 2016). This study has power >95% for testing superiority of lebrikizumab to placebo based on a two- sided Fisher’s exact test with alpha of 0.05. For EMA: Approximately 225 patients will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to lebrikizumab or placebo (150 patients:75 patients). The assumed IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 response rates are 38% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and 13% for placebo. The assumed EASI75 response rate at Week 16 response rates are 58% for lebrikizumab 250 mg Q2W and 20% for placebo. The assumptions for lebrikizumab are based on the DRM06-AD01 Phase 2b study, the proportion of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 and proportion of patients who achieved EASI75 response at Week 16 using the rescue medication non -response sensitivity analysis, adjusting for the allowed use of TCS/TCI. The placebo response rates are based on the review of historical TCS clinical studies in atopic dermatitis ( Simpson et al. 2016).

AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY CONSENSUS CRITERIA FOR CHRONIC ATOPIC DERMATITIS Atopic dermatitis: Diagnosis recommendations Patients with presumed atopic dermatitis should have their diagnosis based on the criteria summarized below. On occasion, skin biopsy specimens or other tests (such as serum immunoglobulin E, potassium hydroxide preparation, patch testing, and/or genetic testing) may be helpful to rule out other or associated skin conditions. Level of Evidence: III Strength of Recommendation: C Essential features — must be present: • Pruritus • Eczema (acute, subacute, chronic) • Typical morphology and age specific patterns* • Chronic or relapsing history *Patterns include: 1. Facial, neck, and extensor involvement in infants and children 2. Current or previous flexural lesions in any age group 3. Sparing of the groin and axillary regions Important features — seen in most cases, adding support to the diagnosis: • Early age of onset • Atopy • Personal and/or family history • Immunoglobulin E reactivity • Xerosis Associated features — These clinical associations help to suggest the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis but are too nonspecific to be used for defining or detecting atopic dermatitis for research and epidemiologic studies: • Atypical vascular responses (eg facial pallor, white dermographism, delayed blanch response) • Keratosis pilaris/ pityriasis alba/ hyperlinear palms/ icthyosis • Ocular/periorbital changes"
72,page_72,"Study Protocol: DRM06 -AD06 Lebrikizumab Dermira, Inc. Confidential Page 72 • Perifollicular accentuation/ lichenification/ prurigo lesions Exclusionary conditions — It should be noted that a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis depends on excluding conditions, such as: • Scabies • Seborrheic dermatitis • Contact dermatitis (irritant or allergic) • Icthyoses • Cutaneous T- cell lymphoma • Psoriasis • Photosensitivity dermatoses • Immune deficiency diseases • Erythroderma of other causes adapted from Eichenfield 2014."
