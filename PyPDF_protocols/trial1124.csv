Secondary objectives: • To evaluate the safety of dupilumab monotherapy compared to placebo treatment in adult patients with moderate-to-severe AD. • To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on improving patient reportedoutcomes (PROs) • To evaluate dupilumab immunogenicity Other objectives: • To evaluate dupilumab systemic exposure STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-blind, plac ebo-controlled, parallel group study to assess the efficacy and safety of dupilumab monotherapy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. The study duration includes 16-week treatment period and 12-week follow-up. After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Patients will undergo screening for 7-35 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements. Patients may be rescreened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Patients will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization and continue throughout the study. However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied on t he area(s) of nonlesional skin designated for such assessments for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. Patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following: • Dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously (SC) once every 2 weeks (q2w), following a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, OR • Matching placebo (double the amount of placebo on Day 1 to matchthe loading dose) SC q2w Randomization will be stratified by bas eline disease severity (moderate [Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) = 3] versus severe [IGA = 4] AD). Following the initial dose of 600 mg, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be administered 300 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14. Patients will remain at the study site for a minimum of 30 minutes after each injection at the study site. Patients will have the option to self-administer the IMP (or have a (electronic 1.0)"

Patients (and/or caregivers) will be trained on injecting the IMP at Visit 2 (Day 1) through Visit 4 (Week 4), or until competency has been demonstrated. Patients who do not want to self-inject may have the clinic staff administer all the IMP injections in the clinic. During the 16-week treatment period, patients will have study visits at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. The end of treatment visit will occur at Week 16, 2 weeks after the last dose of the IMP. The primary endpoint will be determined at Week 16. Follow-up visits will occur every 4 weeks from Week 20 through Week 28. The duration of the 12-week follow-up peri od is based on the time expected for drug levels to reach below the lower limit of quantification in most patients after the last dose of dupilumab. The end of study visit will occur at Week 28. Safety laboratory tests, collection of samples for dupilumab concentrations and anti-drug antibodies (ADA), and clinical assessments will be performed at specified clinic visits. STUDY POPULATION Main selection criteria The study population consists of adults with moderate-to-severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisabl e (eg, intolerance, other important side effects or safety risks), see below: Inclusion criteria A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study: I 01.

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Screening period: 7-35 days Randomized treatment period: 16 weeks Post-treatment period: 12 weeks STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: A total of 160 patients (with a randomization ratio of 1:1, 80 patients in each of the dupilumab 300 mg q2w and the placebo groups) will be enrolled in this study. The study will have 94% power to detect the difference between dupilumab and the placebo. It is based on the following assumptions: • The percentages of patients who achieve an IGA score of 0 to 1 and a reduction from baseline ≥ 2 points at Week 16 are 37% and 12% for dupilumab and placebo, respectively. • A two-sided continuity corrected Chi-square test with the significance level of 0.05. Analysis population: The intent-to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analysis will be based on treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). The per protocol (PP) population includes all patients in the ITT population except for those who are excluded because of major efficacy-related protocol violations. A major protocol violation is one that may affect the interpretation of study results. The criteria of major protocol deviations are defined as the following: • A patient who does not receive treatment as randomized • Any major violations of efficacy-related entry criteria • The percentage of a patient’s compliance with the IMP injection is <80% or >120% of the scheduled doses during the study treatment period The safety population includes all randomiz ed patients who received any IMP; it is based on the treatment patients actually received (as treated). Primary analysis: The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjus ted by baseline disease severity (moderate or severe) will be used for the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 and a reduction from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 on the ITT population. If rescue medication or procedure is used, the patient will be specified as a non-responder from the time the rescue is used. If a patient withdraws from the study, this patient will be counted as a non-responder for endpoints after withdrawal. (electronic 1.0)"
9,page_9,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 01 21-Jun-2018 EFC15116 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group- strictly confidential Page 10 Analysis of secondary endpoints: For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use the same approach as that used for the primary analysis. To account for the impact of rescue medication or procedure on the e fficacy effect: for continuous efficacy endpoints, if a patient receives rescue medication or procedure that specifies the patient as a non-responder according to the above rules for binary efficacy endpoints, the data collected after rescue medication or procedure is initiated will be treated as missing; if a patient withdraws from the study, this patient will be counted as a non-responder for endpoints after withdrawal. The continuous efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the multiple imputation (MI) with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA ) model with treatment, randomization strata (disease severity), and relevant baseline value included in the model as the primary analysis. Patient’s efficacy data after rescue medication up to Week 16 will be set to missing and then imputed by the MI method. Safety Analysis: Will be based on the safety population.This includes TEAEs and other safety information (ie, clinic al laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and ECG results). A summary of safety results for each treatment group will be presented. Anti-drug antibody results will be presented. DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient) 28 weeks, including 16-week treatment period and 12-week follow-up. The total study duration will be up to 33 weeks. (electronic 1.0)"

It is often associated with other atopic disorders, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Severe disease can be extremely disabling due to severa l factors: major psychological problems, significant sleep loss, and impaired quality of life (QOL) that lead to a high socioeconomic cost. An estimated 2% to 10% of adults worldwide are affected by AD ( 2). The pathophysiology of AD is influenced by a complex interplay between inflammation, environmental factors, genetics, and skin barrier dysfunction. Skin-infiltrating lymphocytes are thought to play a pivotal role in the initiation and amplification of atopic inflammation. The key cells involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism of AD are classified into 4 general subgroups. First, dendr itic cell subtypes including Langerhans cells and inflammatory dendritic ep ithelial cells polarize T-helper ce lls via Immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. Dendritic cells in the skin take up and present allergens to lymphocytes, causing a Type 2 helper T cell (T h2) polarization and s ubsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whic h include interleukin (IL)-4, IL- 5, and IL-13. The T-helper cells are the second group of cells. In acute exudative skin lesions, chemokine “C” receptor (CCR4+) Th2 cells are abundant and secrete cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5, whereas Type 1 helper T cells (Th1), which secrete IFN- γ, are also seen in chronic, lichenified lesions. Activated eosinophils are the third group of cells, causing local inflammation at lesional sites. Kerati nocytes are the fourth cell-type involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Th ese skin cells express high levels of the Th2 polarizing cytokine and thymic stromal lymphopoietin in AD lesions, which may amplify and sustain the allergic response. The goal in treating AD is reducing skin infla mmation. Therapy has been focused on trying to control the T helper cell response. Topical cor ticosteroids (TCS) are overwhelmingly the most frequently prescribed class of drugs. However, long-term application of TCS is not recommended because of the risk of skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions , and risks associated with systemic absorption (eg, hypothalamic pituitary axis effects, and Cushing’s disease). Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) are generally effective and safe as short-term treatments, but concerns of skin malignancies and increased risk of lymphomas have prompted regulatory authorities to require a warning regarding the long-term safety of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus in their prescribing information. Repeated application of an y topical therapy over a long period of time or too large surface areas also leads to reduced patient compliance. First generation antihistamines are widely prescribed for acute symptomatic trea tment of pruritus, although their effectiveness is limited and largely attributed to their sedating effect. Oral immunosuppressants ( 3) and glucocorticoids are effective, but are sometimes associated with severe toxicity and side effects, thus limiting their use to short c ourses and/or intermittent therap y. Diabetes, hypertension, and (electronic 1.0)"
23,page_23,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 01 21-Jun-2018 EFC15116 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 24 osteoporosis are side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids, and there is also the risk of rebound after steroid discontinuation. Cyclosporine, a current therapy for severe AD in some regions, is a potent immunosuppressant affecting both humoral and cellular immune responses. This results in increased susceptibility to infections and decreased cancer immunosurveillance. Other co mmonly recognized toxicities include hypertension and impaired renal and hepa tic function. In addition, cyclosporine interacts with other commonly used medicines potentially a ffecting their metabolism and effect. Patients’ disease often rebounds when the treatment is st opped, especially after the administration of systemic glucocorticoids ( 4, 5, 6). Biological agents, including anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α (infliximab and etanercept), anti-IgE (omalizumab ), anti-IL-5 (mepolizumab), and anti-CD11a (efalizumab), have generally been ineffective in clinical trials (7, 8, 9). Therefore, there exists a significant unmet medical need for an alternative treatment for AD. Up-regulation of IL-4 and IL-13 has been implicated as an important inflammatory component of AD disease progression. Dupilumab, a fully human m onoclonal antibody, is directed against the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R α), which is a component of IL-4 receptors Type I and Type II, as well as the IL-13 receptor system. The binding of dupilumab to IL-4R α results in the blockade of both IL-4 and IL-13 signal transduction. Dupilumab is being developed for the treatment of moderate-to-se vere AD in patients intolerant of, or not adequately controlled with, topical treatments. This population includes patients who are often treated with systemic corticosteroids, as well as other non-sel ective immunosuppressants, including cyclosporine, which are associated with significant toxicities. Dupilumab is being developed as a potential a lternative to oral corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and other systemic immonosuppressive drugs, which are us ed for treatment of AD patients and have numerous, considerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and may increase the risk of serious infection. A more focused immunomodulatory agen t such as dupilumab may have more limited effects on the immune system and potentially fewer ADRs. Data with dupilumab have, to date, demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability in a patient population with moderate-to-severe AD. In global phase 2 and phas e 3 studies, treatment with dupilumab monotherapy consistently and significantly cleared or re duced the extent and severity of AD lesions and relieved pruritus, with superior treatment effect to placebo demonstrated by an array of clinically relevant endpoints. The dupilumab safety database consists of over 3000 subjects exposed to dupilumab across all indications, including over 2500 in AD. Dupiluma b was well tolerated and generally safe when used in patients with moderate-to-severe AD. 4.2 RATIONALE 4.2.1 Rationale for Study Design This study has been designed as a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, place bo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety in Chinese a dult patients with modera te-to-severe AD whose (electronic 1.0)"

The design is similar to global pivotal studies, R668-AD-1334 and R668-AD-1416. The primary objective is to demostrate the efficacy of dupilumab (300 mg q2w) monotherapy, asse ssed by proportion of patients with both an IGA 0 to 1 (on a 5-poi nt scale) and a reduc tion from baseline of ≥2 points at Week 16 comparing with placebo. This study will generate information in Chinese AD patients regarding monotherapy with dupilumab compared to placebo. The choice of placebo as a control is appropriate for the objectives of this study, since it will provide the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab. 4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection The dose regimen of SC dupilumab selected for this study is 300 mg q2w . All patients randomized to receive treatment with dupiluma b will get an initial loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1. The administration of the loading dose of dupilumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach steady-state faster and potentially reduce the time to onset of clinical effect. The doses of dupilumab in this study were based on the efficacy and safety results from global pivotal Phase 3 studies (R668-AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416). Dupliumab pha se 3 studies have shown that dupilumab dose regimens (300 mg qw and 300 mg q2w) result in statistically significant, clinically meaningful improvements in objective signs, subjective symptoms, mental health, and QOL in patients with moderate-to- severe AD. These 2 dose regimens were very similar when used as a monotherapy, with no me aningful differences observed in the response rate of the 300 mg qw regimen over the 300 mg q2w regimen during the 16-week treatment period. These clinical data indicate that 300 mg q2w is adequate for patients with moderate-to-severe AD to help them reach their maximal response. (electronic 1.0)"

The study period includes 16-week trea tment period and 12-week follow-up. After providing informed consent, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Patients will undergo screening for 7-35 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, treatments for AD will be washed out, as a pplicable, according to eligibility requirements. Patients may be rescreened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Patients will be required to apply moisturizers (emollients) at least twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization and continue throughout the study. However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dr yness, moisturizers should not be applied on the area(s) of nonlesional skin designated for such as sessments for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. Patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria at base line will undergo Day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1 ra tio to receive q2w SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1, or matching placebo (including doubling the amount of placebo on Day 1 to matc h the loading dose). Randomization will be stratified by baseline disease severity (moderate [IGA 3] versus severe [IGA 4] AD); details will be specified in the interactive response tec hnology (IRT) specifications document. Eligible patients must have a documented history of inade quate response or intolera nce to treatment with topical AD medications. Following the initial dose of 600 mg, the IMP will be administered 300 mg at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 ( Figure 1 ). Patients will remain at the study site for a minimum of 30 minutes after each injection at th e study site. Patients w ill have the option to self-administer the IMP (or have a caregiver admi nister the IMP) outside the study site during weeks in which no clinic visit is scheduled (ie, Weeks 6, 10, and 14). Patients (and/or caregivers) will be trained on injecting the IMP at Visit 2 (Day 1) through Visit 4 (Week 4), or until competency has been demonstrated. Patients who do not want to self-inject may have the clinic staff administer all the IMP injections in the clinic. During the 16-week treatment period, patients w ill have study visits at Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Safety laboratory tests, co llection of samples for dupiluma b concentrations and ADA, and clinical assessments will be performed at specified clinic visits as noted in the Schedule of Events (Table 1 ). The end of treatment visit will occur at Week 16, 2 weeks after the last dose of the IMP. The primary endpoint will be determined at Week 16. Follow-up visits will occur every 4 weeks from Week 20 through Week 28. The duration of the 12-week follow-up period is based on the time expected for drug levels to reach below the lower limit of quantification in mo st patients after the last dose of dupilumab. The end of study visit will occur at Week 28. (electronic 1.0)"

Subsequently q2w SC injections after loading dose of IMP will be given every 14 ± 3 days (q2w). The doses of the IMP must be separated by ≥11 days. Patients will be monitored at the study site for a minimum of 30 minutes after the injection of the IMP for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Patients will have the option to administer the IMP (or have a caregiver administer the IMP) outside the study site during weeks in which no clinic visit is scheduled (ie, Weeks 6, 10, and 14). The study staff will train the patient/caregiver on preparation and administration of the IMP on Day 1 and will administer the first of the 2 injections require d for the loading dose. The patient/caregiver will administer the second injection required for the loading dose under the supervision of the clinic staff. The patient/caregiver will administer the IMP under the supervision of the clinic staff at Visits 3 and 4 (Weeks 2 and 4, respectively). Pati ents who prefer to have the clinic staff administer the IMP may choose to have injections administered in the clinic. The procedure for preparing the dupilumab dose for SC injection will be provided in the pharmacy manual. Subcutaneous injection site s should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms, so that the same site is not injected twice consecutively. To allow for adequate assessment of possible injection site reactions (ISRs), the IMP should be administered only into areas of normal-looking skin. Instructions for recording and reporting ISRs will be provided in the user guidance. 8.1.4 Dose modification and investigational medicinal product discontinuation rules 8.1.4.1 Drug modification Dose modification for an indi vidual patient is not allowed.

Th e reasons for temporarily or permanently discontinuation of the IMP are described in Section 10.3. Patients who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section 10.1.5. 8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 8.2.1 Background treatment All patients are required to apply moisturizers (emollients) at least twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization and to c ontinue the treatment throughout the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryn ess, moisturizers should not be applied on the area(s) of nonlesional skin design ated for such assessments for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patient s may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit. 8.2.2 Rescue treatment If medically necessary (ie, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD with otherwise prohibited medications or procedure (see Section 8.8.1) may be provided to study patients at the discretion of the Investigator. Please refer to the label of the product for the usage of rescue treatment. For the purpose of efficacy analysis, patients who receive rescue treatment during the study treatment period will be considered treatment failures, but they will continue study treatment if rescue consis ted of topical medications. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used for rescue, but should be reserved for problem areas only, eg, face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas. If possible, Investigators should atte mpt to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topical medications, and escalate to systemic medications only for patients who do not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatme nt. If a patient receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal systemic immunos uppressive/immunomodulating drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofe til, azathioprine, Janus kinase inhibitors, biologic agents, etc), the IMP will be immediately discontinued. After the treatment with these medications is completed, the IMP may be resumed if deemed appropriate by the Investigator and the sponsor, but not sooner than 5 half-lives after the last dose of systemic rescue medication. All patients will complete the schedule of study visits and assessments whether or not they complete the treatment with the IMP and whether or not they receive rescue treatment for AD. Investigators should make every attempt to conduc t efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity scores, safety labs) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose if necessary. (electronic 1.0)"

To protect the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL ( dupilumab/placebo) glass pr efilled syringes will be prepared such that the IMPs are identical and indistinguishable, and will be labeled with a treatment kit number. The randomiz ed treatment kit number list will be generated by the sponsor. In accordance with the double-blind design, study pa tients, Investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to study treatment and will not have access to the randomization (treatment codes) except under circumstances described in Section 8.3.2. 8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient. Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the IRT and/or by calling any other phone number provided by the spons or for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of day, and the reason for code breaking. Subject withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is made at the site level, not the study level. This means that if the Emergenc y Unblinding transaction is performed by the Investigator (ie, at the site level), then the subject will be withdrawn from treatment. See Section 10.3.4 for the handling of patients after perman ent treatment disconti nuation. However, if the emergency unblinding transaction is performed by the Global Safety Officer (GSO) (ie, at the study level, as the GSO is not site based), then the subject will not be withdrawn from treatment. At the facilities where the systemic drug concentration measurements, ADA, and selected biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to unblinding of responsible bioana lysts. Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. 8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP A total of 160 patients will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive q2w SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab, or matching placebo for 16 weeks. Patients will be rando mized to a treatment group according to a central randomization scheme provided by an IRT to the designated site personnel or clinical staff member s. Randomization will be stratified by disease severity (IGA 3 versus IGA 4); details will be specified in the IRT specifications document and will be documented in the clinical study report.

The IMP (dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list. The sponsor will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and th e Study Biostatistician will provide the randomization sc heme to the centralized trea tment allocation system. This centralized treatment allocation sy stem will generate the patient randomization list, according to which it will allocate the treatments to the patients. Patients may be rescreened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. A different patient identification will be issued. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen-failure date and the rescreening date. The IRT report will flag rescreened patients. Patients that are rescreened must sign a new consent form and all Visit 1 procedures must be repeated. A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is registered a nd assigned with a treatment kit number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. 8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING Dupilumab and placebo will be supp lied as one glass prefilled syring e packed in a patient kit box. Both the glass prefilled syringe and the box will be labeled. Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The content of the labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. A medication numbering system will be used in labeling blinded IMP. Lists linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or companies) responsible for IMP packaging. In order to maintain the bli nd, these lists will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. 8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS Investigational medicinal pr oducts will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C in an appropriate, locked room under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) in accordance with local regu lations, policies and procedures. Control of the IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and information on in-use stability and instructi ons for handling the compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the sponsor. The IMP will be shipped at a temperature of 2°C to 8°C to the Investigator or designee at regular intervals or as needed during the study. At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site monitoring visits), at the site close-out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation by the site monitor, all opened and unopened IMP will be destroyed or returned to the sponsor or designee.

All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription, and it is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that an a ccurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the sponsor, in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply the IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose the IMP in any other manner. 8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance The Investigator or pharmacist will also keep accurate records of the quantities of the IMP dispensed, used, and returned by each patient. The IMP dispensation/accountability log is to be updated each time the IMP is dispensed or returned. Any IMP not returned (even if considered empty) must be accounted for with a comment in the log. The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of the IMP held by the Inves tigator or pharmacist to verify accountability. All drug accountability records must be kept current. The Investigator must be able to account for all opened and unopened IMPs. These records should contain the dates, quantity, and IMP • dispensed to each patient, • returned from each patient (if applicable), and • disposed of at the site or retu rned to the sponsor or designee. Patients will be instructed to return their us ed and unused IMP to the investigation site. Compliance with IMP administration will be reviewed with the patient at each visit. Compliance will be assessed by inspection of the kit box a nd checking the unused glass pre-filled syringe. All accountability records must be made available for inspection by the sponsor and regulatory agency inspectors; photocopies must be provided to the sponsor at the conclusion of the study.

All used prefilled syringes shoul d be kept in a sharp container by the patients and be returned to sites for destroy. A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the monitori ng team. The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP unless the s ponsor provides writte n authorization. For noninvestigational medicina l product (NIMP) not provided by the sponsor, tracking and reconciliation has to be achieved by the Investigator and need to be captured in standard site documents and records (eg, medical notes). 8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION Any treatment administered from the time of informed consent to the final study visit will be considered concomitant me dication. This includes medications th at were started before the study and are ongoing during the study. 8.8.1 Prohibited medications and procedures The following treatments are prohibited during the study: • Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine (See Appendix B ) • Treatment with immunomodulating biologics • Treatment with an investigational drug (other than dupilumab) • Treatment with TCS or TCI • Treatment with systemic corticosteroids or nonsteroidal systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs (e g, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate-mofetil, azathioprine, and Janus kinase inhibitors ) • Initiation or uptitration of allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT). Patients on SIT prior to the screening visit must be on a stable dos e and remain on that dose during the study • Any other medications for AD that could ha ve interfered with efficacy outcomes or affected the evaluation for AD severity. Exampl es of such medications include coal tar products, other staining topical products, TCM, or any other therapeutic agents for AD that were not properly evalua ted in clinical trials However, at the discretion of the Investigator, patients were permitted to receive rescue treatment with some of the otherwise prohibited medica tions noted below. Re scue treatment (see Section 8.2.2 for details) is only to be performed wh en medically necessary for worsening AD signs and/or symptoms requiring initiation or escalation of treatment.

The following concomitant procedures ar e prohibited during study participation: • Major elective surgical procedures • Phototherapy except as rescue for AD • Tanning in a bed/booth 8.8.2 Permitted medications and procedures Other than the prohibited medications listed in Section 8.8.1, treatment with concomitant medications is permitted during the study. This includes basic skin care (cleansing and bathing, including bleach baths), emollients (required as background treatment), topical anesthetics, antihistamines, and topical and systemic an ti-infective medications for any duration. Medications used to treat chronic disease such as di abetes, hypertension, and asthma are also permitted; if there is any question regarding whether a concomitant medication may be used during the study, the study site should contact the sponsor. Cytochrome P450 Study R668-AD-1433, designed to investigate the potential impact of dupilumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity, shows no evidence for a clinically meaningful effect of dupilumab on the activity of CY P1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C19, CYP2C 9, or CYP2D6. No specific monitoring of CYP enzymes activities is needed. 8.8.2.1 Prohibited concomitant medications or procedures as rescue If medically necessary (eg, to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD may be provided to study patients at the di scretion of the Investigator (see Section 8.2.2 for details).

Questionnaires and patient-repor ted assessments will be admin istered prior to obtaining Investigator assessments, safety and laboratory assessments, a nd IMP administration. Please see the user guidance on the administration and use of all patient reported instruments (including POEM, DLQI, and EQ-5D). 9.2.1.1 Eczema area and severity index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD ( 10). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickne ss [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the Investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (s evere). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). 9.2.1.2 Patient assessment of pruritus: numerical rating scale The Pruritus NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) during a daily recall period using a pruritus reporting system. Patients will be asked the following questions: • For average itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch overall (on average) during the previous 24 hours?” • For maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?” Patients will be instructed on using the pruritus reporting system to record their Pruritus NRS score at the screening visit. Patients will complete the rating scale da ily. Clinical sites will receive alerts when patients do not complete the pruritus reporting system items. Sites will be expected to contact patients who have missed 2 consecutive en tries to encourage patient compliance. The Investigator will check patients’ reports at each visit. (electronic 1.0)"

The format is a simple response (0 to 3, where 0 is “not at all” and 3 is “very much”) to 10 questions, which assess QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL. 9.2.1.5 Patient oriented eczema measure The POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults ( 12). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. 9.2.1.6 Patient-assessed EQ-5D The EQ-5D is a standardized measure of health status developed by the EuroQOL Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. The EQ-5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQVAS). The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of perceived problems: “no problem” (l evel 1), “some problems” (level 2), “extreme problems” (level 3). The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health st ate by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement (ie, no pr oblems, some problems, or severe problems) in each of the 5 dimensions; this results in a 1-dig it number expressing the level for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5-digit number describing the respondent’s health state. The EQVAS records the respondent’s self-rated hea lth on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state (100)” and “worst imaginable health state (0)”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. 9.2.1.7 Patient-assessed pruritus categorical scale The pruritus categorical scale is a 4-point scale us ed to assess symptoms that has been used in clinical studies of AD and there is less of a tende ncy for patients to provide an “average” response (electronic 1.0)"

The scale is rated as follo ws: 0: absence of pruritus; 1: mild pruritus (occasional slight itching/scrat ching); 2: moderate pruritus (constant or intermittent itching/scratching that does not disturb sleep) and 3: severe pruritus (bothersome itching/scratching that disturbs sleep). Patients will be instructed on using the pruritus reporting system to complete the pruritus categorical scale at the screening visit. Patients will complete the categorical scale daily. Clinical sites will receive alerts when pa tients do not complete the pruritu s reporting system items. Sites will be expected to contact patients who have missed 2 consecutive entries to encourage patient compliance. The Investigator will check patients’ reports at each visit. 9.2.1.8 Sick Leave/Missed School Days Patients who are employed or enrolled in school will be asked to report the number of sick leave/missed school days since the last study a ssessment. Patients will unde rgo this assessment at time points according to Section 1.2. The assessment tool is provided in the user guidance. 9.2.1.9 Atopic Dermatitis Area Photographs At selected study sites, photographs will be taken of a representative area of AD involvement (eg, the lesional area used for EASI assessments on Day 1/baseline [pre-dose]). Subsequent photographs of the same area w ill be taken at Week 16 (end of treatment) and Week 28 (end of study). Instructions for taking the photographs are provided in the photography reference manual. 9.2.2 Safety endpoints 9.2.2.1 Adverse events Refer to Section 10.4 to Section 10.6 for details. 9.2.2.2 Laboratory safety variables Hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and serum pregnancy testing samples will be analyzed by a central laboratory. The urine pregnancy test kit will be provided to the site by the laboratory. Blood samples for serum chemistry and hematology testin g will be collected to measure overall patient health at screening. To tal basophil and eosinophil counts are of particular interest in AD patients, due to the occurrence of basophil hi stamine release and eosinophilia in this population. Understanding the lymphocyte profiles of AD pa tients may help researchers understand disease heterogeneity. Blood samples should be collected afte r a 6 to 8 hour fast, if possible; fasting is not mandatory.

Source data are contained in source documents. Source documents are original documents, data and records such as hos pital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, r ecorded data from automated instruments, etc. All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data downloaded from the study-associated central laboratories and patient electronic diary will be considered source data. 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal products Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consid ered by the Investigator because of AEs. Reinitiation of treatme nt with the IMP will be done under cl ose and appropriate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator consider s, according to his/her best medical judgment, that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with the IMP. The following conditions(s) will be causes for temporary treatment discontinuation: • Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per Appendix E • Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery • Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment The IMP should be discontinued until the infection is resolved. • Treatment with prohibited concomitant medication or procedure as described in Section 8.8.1 After the lab abnormality leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, the IMP may be resumed at the discretion of the principal Investig ator in consultation with the sponsor. Similarly, the IMP may be resumed after the medication lead ing to suspension of dosing is discontinued. A decision to discontinue the IMP and/or to rein stitute the IMP should be discussed with the sponsor. The Investigator may suspend the IMP at any time, even without consultation with the sponsor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest. However, the sponsor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of the IMP discontinuation. Resumption of st udy treatment after te mporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the sponsor. (electronic 1.0)"

All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or e-CRF. Patients must be withdrawn from the treatment (ie, from any further IMP administration) for the following reasons: • At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (Legally authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research). • If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuati on in the study would be detrimental to the patient’s well-being • At the specific request of the sponsor • In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the sponsor • Any code broken requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. • Pregnancy • Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment. • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin • Any opportunistic infection or other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immunocompromised status (see Appendix D ) • Serum ALT >3 ULN and total bilirubin >2 ULN (see Appendix E ) • Serum ALT >5 ULN if baseline ALT <2 ULN or ALT >8 ULN if baseline ALT >2 ULN (see Appendix E ) • Certain AEs deemed related to the IMP (eg, se vere and prolonged injection site reactions) 10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed-up as specified in this protocol, whiche ver comes last.

Under exceptional circumstances when a patient cannot come to the site for the scheduled visit, a phone contact can be made after sponsor approval is given. During the phone contact, at least information about AEs and concomitant medication should be collected. All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the CRF wh en considered as confirmed. 10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of consent for follow-up should be ac companied by documentation of the reason for withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up, eg, medical records checks. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicite d should be documented. Patients may withdraw consent verbally or in wr iting and, if verbal, then the site needs to document in source records that pa tient withdrew consent verbally. If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study visit including a systemic drug concentrati on sample, if appropriate, and 3 posttreatment follow-up period visits. For patients who fail to return to the site, the Inve stigator should make the be st effort to recontact the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, re viewing available registries or health care databases), and to dete rmine his/her health status, includi ng at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contacts, and recei pt for sending a registered letter). A subject should only be designated as lost to follow-up if the site is unable to establish contact with the subject after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone , text, e-mail, certified letter, etc). The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary endpoints will be considered. Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be rerandomiz ed (treated) in the study. Their inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused. Patients prematurely discontinued from the study will not be replaced. (electronic 1.0)"

The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that a dditional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the sponsor. Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI, at the prespecified study end-date, should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death and rela ted data will be collected.

Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the IB or in this protocol will be considered unexpected. For safety, the treatment code will be unblinded by the sponsor for reporting to the Health Authority of any SUSAR and reasonably associated with the use of the IMP according to the judgment of the Investigator and/or the sponsor. In case of a SUSAR, Sanofi Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology will utilize XGRID to reveal medication assignment for regulatory reporting requirements for the particular case. The sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical study report . 10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 10.6.1 Hypersensitivity Allergic reaction is a risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, including dupilumab. Acute allergic reactions may be defined as allergic reaction-mediated signs and symptoms experienced by patients, during or shortly after the pharmacologic or biologic agent is given. These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticar ia/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of infusion reaction, but these events may also occur via non-IgE mediated mechanisms (eg, an aphylactoid reactions), or may occur via other immune-mediated mechanisms (eg, cytokine-mediated). Allergic reactions may begin within a few hours and persist up to 24 hours postdosing. Refer to Appendix C “Definition of Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each inj ection of the IMP at study site for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Any anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are rela ted to IMP and require treatment are AESI (report within 24 hours) and study medication should be permanently di scontinued. Trained pers onnel and medications should be available to treat anaphylaxis or any severe allergic reaction if it occurs. Furthermore, the patients will be advised, when the IMP is administered at home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitive reaction for 30 minutes after administration. 10.6.2 Severe injection site reactions Based on the SC mode of administration of a ther apeutic protein, severe in jection site reactions are considered as a potential risk. Patients who e xperience an injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site reaction with a future injection. (electronic 1.0)"

Infections with a diversity of helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 response is characterized by production of IL-4 and IL-5, subsequently generating IgG1 and IgE-secreting cells, and elic iting eosinophilia. Eosinophilia is prominent in a number of helminthic parasitic dise ases. The eosinophilic response to he lminths is determined both by the host’s immune response and by the parasite , including its distribution, migration, and development within the infected host. Therefore, patient with treatment of dupilumab may potentially have an increased risk of helminthic parasitic infection In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of parasitic infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessments have ruled out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever, fatigue, and hepatosplenomegaly) that could be associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/or residence in endemic areas, especially when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, ex tended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers and vectors) . Subsequent medical assessments (eg, stool exam, blood tests) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infection/infestation. Helminthic infections defined in Section 10.4.1.3 should be reported as AESIs within 24 hours. A complete diagnostic work-up shoul d be performed (ie, cultures, hi stopathological or cytological evaluation, antigen detection and serum antibody titers). Patients should be referred to an infectious disease specialist if deemed necessary for diagnostic work up an d appropriate treatment. Infections or infestations that do not res pond to medical treatment should have the IMP discontinued until the infection is resolved. For any opportunistic infection or other infections, whose nature or course may suggest an immunocompromised status (see Appendix D ), patients MUST be permanently discontinued from the IMP. 10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests No pre-clinical and clinical da ta suggested any hepatic toxicity of anti-IL4 agent; however, as general consideration of clinical developmen t, the administration of immunosuppressant or immunomudulating agents may represent an addi tional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. In order to closely follow potential liver abnormali ties, assessment of tota l protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and nonconjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate a minotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing (see Section 9.2.2.2).

The continuous endpoints will be analyzed usin g the MI with ANCOVA model as the primary analysis. Patients’ efficacy data after rescue medication up to Week 16 will be set to missing and then imputed by the MI method. Missing data wi ll be imputed 50 times to generate 50 complete data sets by using the SAS MI procedure (using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method). The Week 16 data of each of the 50 complete data sets will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, randomization strata (disease severi ty), and relevant baselin e value included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from the 50 analyses using Rubin’s formula.

For safety variables, two obs ervation periods are defined: • The pre-treatment period is defined as the time from signing the informed consent form (ICF) to before the first dose of IMP. • The TEAE period is defined as the time from first dose of IMP (Day 1) to the end of the study. The following definitions will be applied to clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs and ECG. • The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal values considered medically important by the sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by the sponsor for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG. • PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage. (electronic 1.0)"

The analyses of adverse events will focus on TEAEs. Definitions Pretreatment AEs are defined as AEs that devel oped or worsened during the pre-treatment period. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as AEs that developed or worsened during the treatment-emergent period. The treatment-emergent period is from first administration of IMP to end of the follow-up period. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) The incidence tables will present by system orga n class (SOC) (sorted by internationally agreed order), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, th e number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an TEAE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatme nt phase. The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group. TEAEs will also be summarized by severity and relationship to IMP for each treatment group, presented by SOC and PT. Death The following deaths summaries will be generated: • Number (%) of patients who died by study pe riod (TEAE, on-study) and reasons for death summarized on the safety popula tion by treatment received. • Death in nonrandomized patients or randomized and not treated patients • TEAE leading to death (death as an outcome on the AE CRF page as reported by the Investigator) by primary SOC, HLGT, HLT and PT showing number (%) of patients sorted by internationally agreed order of SOC and alphabetic order of HLGT, HLT, and PT. Listings will be provided for all deaths by trea tment group and patient with flags indicating on- treatment status. Serious adverse events: Number (%) of patients with at least one treatment emergent SAE will be summarized by treatment group and presented by primary SOC (sorted by interna tionally agreed order), HLGT, HLT, and PT sorted in alphabetical order. SAEs will also be listed by tr eatment group and patient. (electronic 1.0)"

TEAE leading to permenant treatment discontinuation will be listed by trea tment group and patient. Adverse events of special interest: Treatment-emergent AESI will present number (%) of patients overall, by AESI category and PT, sorted by decreasing incidence of PT within each AESI category. 11.4.4.2 Clinical laboratory evaluations Laboratory test results will be summarized by baseline and change from baseline to each visit with descriptive statistics. Number and percentage of patients with a treatment-emergent PCSA will be summarized for each clinical laboratory test. Shift tables based on baseline normal/abnormal and othe r tabular and graphical methods may be used to present the results for laboratory tests of interest. Listings will be provided with flags indicating the out of laboratory range values. 11.4.4.3 Vital signs Vital signs (temperature, pulse , blood pressure, and respirati on rate) will be summarized by baseline and change from baseline to visit with descriptive statistics.

Analyses of QOL endpoints will be provided in the SAP. 11.4.8 Data Handling Conventions The following analysis and data conventions will be followed: Definition of baseline: • Unless otherwise specified, the baseline assessment for all measurements will be the latest available valid measurement taken prior to the administration of study drug. If any randomized patients are not treated, the baseline will be the last value on or prior to the randomization. General rules for handling missing data: • If the start date of an AE or concomitant medication is incomplete or missing, it will be assumed to have occurred on or after the intake of study medication, except if an incomplete date (eg, month and year) clearly indicates that the event started prior to treatment. If the partial date indicates the sa me month or year of the intake of study medication date, then the start date by the study medication intake date will be imputed, otherwise, the missing day or month by the first day or the first month will be imputed. • No imputations for missing laboratory data , ECG data, vital sign data, or physical examination data will be made. Unscheduled assessments: • Extra assessments (laboratory da ta or vital signs associated with non-protocol clinical visits or obtained in the course of investigating or managing AEs) will be included in listings, but not summaries. If more than 1 laboratory value is available for a given visit, the first observation will be used in summaries and all observations will be presented in listings. 11.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS No interim analysis is planned.

Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: - Documented hysterectomy - Documented bilateral salpingectomy - Documented bilateral oophorectomy. 2. Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hor mone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement ther apy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. - Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must disc ontinue HRT to allo w confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment. Reproductive potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.

Second symposium on the definition a nd management of anaphy laxis: Summary report— Second National Institute of A llergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network symposium. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006; 117: 391-397) Clinical criteria for diagnosing anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled: 1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus, or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING a. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, w heeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunc tion (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, gener alized hives, itch0flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) b. Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, w heeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia) c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence) d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specif ic) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BPa b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg or gr eater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline Abbreviations: PEF: peak expiratory flow; BP: blood pressure. a Low systolic pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 mmHg + [2 * age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years.
