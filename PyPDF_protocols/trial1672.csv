Study Des ign: This is a multicenter , interventional and observational study to understand factors affecting the likelihood of transplant ation in patients without a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched family donor and to compare outcomes associated with pursuing a n HLA - identical unrelated versus other alternative donor graft sources. Alternative donors are defined as any donor other than an HLA -matched or 1 antigen- mismatched related donor. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A LL), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), Non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a cquired aplastic anemia (AA) or sickle cell disease (SCD) are eligible. The primary comparison for the interventional study will be between two arms based on biologic assignment , analyzed on an intent ion-to-treat basis : Arm 1: Patients who are Very Likely to find a matched unrelated donor (MUD) , defined as having a >90% chance of finding an 8/8 HLA -matched unrelated donor, for whom a fully matched unrelated donor will be pursued; and Arm 2 : Patients who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD, defined as having a <10% chance of finding an 8/8 HLA -matched unrelated donor, for whom a haploidentical, cord blood, or mismatched unrelated donor transplant will be pursued. Patients with a Less Likely chance of finding a MUD, i.e., those not falling into the other two groups (a 26% chance), will be enrolled onto the observational component of the study and analyzed for all relevant endpoint s but will not be included in the primary compa rison . Primary Objective: The primary objective is to estimate and compare overall survival between the two arms: patien ts who are Very Likely to find a MUD versus those who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD. Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives include all patients, regardless of donor search prognosis: 1. To estimate and compare the cumulative incidence of receiving a transplant according to donor search prognosis 2. To describe barriers to achieving transplant ation with different alternative donor search strategies Post-transplant Objectives: 3. To compare survival, relapse, disease- free survival , treatment -related mortality , and acute and chronic graft -versus-host- disease ( GVHD) in patients transplanted for malignant diseases , according to the alternative donor used 4. To describe survival and acute and chronic GVHD in patients with acquired aplastic anemia and sickle cell disease after transplantation , according to the alternative donor used"

In patients with AML or ALL in first complete remission and early s tage MDS (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 5q - syndrome or <5% bone marrow blasts) who are treated with a limited subset of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimens and trans planted with either matched unrelated donors or haploidentical related donors (approximately 286 patients meeting eligibility criteria ), to compare quality of life (QOL) and describe the incidence of primary graft failure, chronic GVHD, time until off syst emic immunosuppression, acute grade III -IV and chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppression- free, relapse- free survival (GRFS), moderate- severe chronic GVHD relapse- free survival (CRFS) , current CRFS, number of hospital days , infections, immune reconstitution and late effects after transplant ation , according to the alternative donor used ( QOL Substudy ). All clinical data will be captured on Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) comprehensive report forms (CRFs) while QOL data will be collected centrally. Accrual Objective: The study will enroll 1022 patients in the MUD Very Likely plus MUD Very Unlikely search prognosis groups and approximately 710 patients in the Less Likely to find a MUD group. Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is 3 years . Study Duration: Total study duration from first enrollment through last follow -up will be approximately 5 years. Adult s included in the QO L substudy will be asked to consent to a final QOL assessment done at 5 years after trans plant ation. This 5 year QOL assessment will be separately funded and conducted through CIBMTR, referencing Protocol 1702 as the source of consent. Eligibility Criteria: Patients of all ages with AML, ALL, MDS, NHL, H L, AA or SCD are eligible. Patients must be considered suitable allo geneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) candidates based on available medical history, physical examination , and laboratory tests. Specific testing for organ function is not required for eligibility but, if available, these tests sho uld be used to judge transplant suitability . Centers must confirm their intention both to follow the recommended search algorithm and to perform the transplant within the next 6 months if a suitable donor is identified. Patients who consent are considered evaluable once the center determines no suitable HLA -matched or 1 antigen mismatched related donor is available (center will also confirm that the patient is still considered a transplant candidate) . Patients may be enrolled on other studies. Interim Analysis: No interim analysis or stopping guidelines for efficacy or futility are planned for this study. We will review the study design assumptions, particularly the ratio of patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD vs. patients who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD and percentage proceeding to transplant, on a periodic basis, and may adjust the sample size if needed to maintain power in the event that our assumptions are incorrect. Stopping Guidelines: Monitoring of a key safety endpoint of post- transplant mortality will be conducted monthly to ensure that the donor selection recommendations for the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group are not leading to significantly lower than expected post transplant outcomes. If rates significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised. Policies and composition of the DSMB are"

Barriers to Identifying Matched Unrelated Donors Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (H CT) is a potentially curative treatment and is standard of care for patients with high- risk or advanced hem atologic malignancies and other hematologic diseases . The use of allogeneic HCT has expanded rapidly over the past decades owing to substantial advances in transplant procedures and supportive care . 1,2 However, providing a suitable donor for all potential HCT patients in an optimal period of time remains an unmet need. Even though a fully HLA -matched related donor (MRD) is considered the first graft choice for transplantation, approximately two- thirds of patients who need a transplant do not have a MRD available; most patients must rely on alternative donor choices.3 Historically, a n HLA -matched adult unrelated donor has been accepted as the next best option. The success of unrelated donor HCT was primarily influ enced by the degree of HLA matching between the donor and the recipient. High resolution matching at 8 alleles at HLA -A, -B, -C, and -DRB1 (8/8 match) is considered standard for unrelated donor transplantation,4,5 and transplant outcomes after unrelated donor grafts approximate those of matched related donor grafts .6-9 Hence, most transplant centers usually proceed with an unrelated donor search for all patients in need of a transplant if no matched related donor is available. However, identification of an unrelated donor may be ch allenging due to low donor availability for non -Caucasian populations or mixed race individuals.10 In addition, the unrelated donor search and procurement of stem cell product usually takes longer (on average 3-4 months) than that of a matched related donor (approximately 1 month). As a result, patients may develop progressive disease11 or become medically unfit while waiting for a n unrelated donor transplant, which might have a negative impact on overall survival. With recent improvements in haploidentical donor transplant outcomes using post -transplant cyclophosphamide for graft - versus- host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, an increasing number of patients without an HLA - matched donor are receiving grafts from HLA -mismatched relatives. Some data suggest outcomes of haploidentical sibling donor HCTs are similar to those of HLA -identical HCTs, though numbers of evaluable patients remain small and follow -up relatively short . 12,13 Centers also continue to use cord blood and mismatched unrelated donors . It is currently unclear which is the best alternative donor source and if it is better to proceed with a n alternative donor as soon as possible or wait and complete an unrelated donor search , even if it takes a longer period of time to perform transplantation . Work by Dehn and colleagues has defined a “donor search prognosis” based on HLA allele frequencies and race/ethnicity. This score predicts the likelihood of successfully identifying a 10/10 matched unrelated donor . 14 Patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD have a >90% likelihood of finding a matched unrelated donor, while those who are Very Unl ikely to find a MUD have a <10% chance. Patients who are Less Likely to find a MUD have a 26% chance of finding a matched unrelated donor . Worse search prognosis is associated with racial and ethnic minority status but not with other patient and disease bi ology characteristics that might influence the success of HCT. Thus, the use of donor search prognosis in this trial as a tool for biologic assignment to"
8,page_8,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-2 matched unrelated donors vs. mismatched donors provides a mechanism to minimize bias from disease char acteristics. A recent survey (July 2018) of donor choice practices by different BMT CTN core and affiliate transplant centers revealed that the majority of centers (78%) will initially start a formal unrelated donor search in the absence of a matched related donor , while only 16% may proceed to a haploidentical donor transplant without a formal unrelated donor search. If a patient lacks a matched related or unrelated donor, 69% of the centers would likely choose a haploidentical donor, 16% a mismatched unrelated donor and 15% a cord blood donor . Eighty nine percent said they would be comfortable proceeding to transplant with a haploidentical related donor or cord blood without a formal unrelated donor search if a predictive algorithm could identify patients with a <10% chance of finding a matched unrelated donor. 1.2. Alternative Donor G raft Sources Provide Outcomes Comparable to Matched Unrelated Donors While most centers would choose a readily available matched unrelated donor over other alternative donors f or a patient lacking an HLA -identical sibling donor, in reality the reported outcomes for all alternative donor transplants appear similar (Section 6.4. Appendix D). Survival for transplanted patients is anticipated to be superior to outcomes without transplantation. Mismatched Unrelated Donor Transplantation Despite the availability of more than 32 million worldwide potential donors for HCT accessible through the National Marrow Donor Program registry, the probability of finding a suitable HLA - matched d onor for HCT varies considerably, from 75% in Caucasians to 16- 35% among other races . 10 One of the alternative options in such cases is the use of an H LA- mismatc hed unrelated donor ; however, previous studies found an increased risk of graft -versus- host disease (GVHD) and treatment -related mortality with reduced overall survival and progression- free survival compared to HLA -matched donor transplantation.4,8,15 The standard pharmacological GVHD prophylaxis regimen for HLA -matched unrelated donor or -matched related donor transplantation includes a calcineurin inhibitor (commonly tacrolimus or cyclosporine) and methotrexate .8,16 This is often intensified with in vivo T-cell depletion, generally with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab in mismatched unrelated donor HCT .17,18 With this intensive regimen, the incidence of grade II –IV acute GVHD (20 –35%), grade III –IV aGVHD (4 –20%) and cGVHD (22–67%) in mismatched unrelated donor HCT approaches comparable levels to those seen after matched unrelated donor HCT .17,18 However, in vivo T-cell depletion delays T -cell immune reconstitution19 and poses heightened risk of bacterial and viral infections, including herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, and infection -related deaths ,20 as well as fatal post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) .21 An alternative app roach to prevention of GVHD in mismatched unrelated donor HCT is the use of post- transplant cyclophosphamide ( PTCy ), administered in a similar fashion as in haploidentical transplantation on days +3 and +4, along with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ). A recent retrospectiv e comparison for patients with mismatched unrelated donor HCT treated with either PTCy or conventional GVHD showed a lower incidence of gr ade II-IV aGVHD in the first"
9,page_9,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-3 month post -transplant period with PTCy and similar incidence of cGVHD, 2 -year non- relapse mortality, relapse, progression- free survival , and overall survival.22 Cord Blood Transplantation Since the first umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) performed in 1988,23 the field of UCBT has evolved significantly. Due to reduced stringency of the HLA -match requirement and faster availability of banked cryopreserved umbilical cord blood units, cord blood has served as an alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells, and contributed to increase d access to HCT for patients who lack of an HLA -matched related or unrelated donor, primarily in younger patients. So far, over 750,000 cord blood units have been stored for transplantation worldwide,24 and approximately 3,000 UCBTs have been performed each year for both hem atologic malignancies and non- malignant diseases.25 In pediatric patients with acute leukemia, E apen et al. demonstrated a leukemia -free survival at 3 years of 60% after HLA -matched UCBT, 36% after 1 HLA -mismatched UCBT with low cell dose (<3 X10 7 TNCs/kg), 45% after 1 HLA -mismatched UCBT with high cell dose, and 33% after 2 HLA -mismatched UCBT .26 The encouraging results have also been demonstrated in pediatric patients with benign diseases such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia27 and Fanconi anemia23. Although there have been no randomized prospective studies comparing outcomes of UCBT and other donor sources, results from several retrospective and prospective studies have demonstrated that UCBT is associated with lower rate s of GVHD and can provide long -term s urvival rates comparable to HLA -matched unrelated donor transplants. 28-32 A recent meta- analysis included 9 studies of pediatric and adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and showed a simila r relapse rate, overall survival and progr ession -free survival of unrelate d single -unit UCBT and unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation. However, time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was shorter after unrelated donor transplantation compar ed to UCBT. 32 The median age of UCBT patients included in this meta -analysis was 27.5 years. Even though cord blood contains a high density of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) with an extensive proliferative capacity and can be cryopreserved for more than 20 years 33, the total volume of each cord blood unit infused is low, resulting in delayed hematopoietic recovery , delayed immune reconstitution and increased treatment -related mortality as it has been shown in many studies that the successful transplantation using cord blood depends primarily on number of HPCs in the cord blood unit.26,27,34 The optimal cell dose per recipient body weight can be achieved in small children while this becomes an important limitation of using cord blood cells in adult patients. I mprovements in UCBT outcomes for adult patients are due to better HLA matching, supportive care, patient selection and optimal cord blood unit selection based on nuc leated cell dose. The Japanese group reported bet ter 5-year disease- free survival of 60 –70% in selected acute leukemia patients receiving myeloablative single unit UCBT, presumably because lower recipients’ weight and less genetic variability in the Japane se population. 35 To overcome the low number of HPCs in a single cord blood unit, double UCBT was developed. In a study of 23 adults with high- risk hematological ma lignancies undergoing double CBT, the engraftment was derived from a single cord blood unit with the median time to engraftment of 23"
10,page_10,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-4 days.36 This approach has been studied in several diseases, which showed promising outcomes.37,38 However, the benefit of double as opposed to single UCBT remains unclear as demonstrated from a prospective randomized study comparing single versus double UCBT in children and adolescents, which showed a similar rate of neutrophil engraftment and survival, while a higher incidence of gr ade III-IV aGVHD and cGVHD was observed in patients receiving double UCBT. 39 Beside the use of double UBCT, several methods have also been pioneered to help increase numbers of HPCs and enhance engraftment after UCBT such as novel strategies of cord blood expansion 40-44 or strategies to increase cord blood HPC homing45-47. So far, all of the se approaches appear to be safe and have faster engraftment; however, survival benefits remain unclear. Haploidentical Transp lantation with Post- transplant Cyclophosphamide Haploidentical HCTs have been performed ever since the beginning of transplantation. However, high treatment- related mortality , initially because of a GVHD seen with T -cell replete grafts, then due to infectious complications associated with extensive T -cell depletion , has been noted. A recent development is the application of PTCy with a T -cell replete donor graft , which ma kes haploidentical transplant ation feasible, with lower cost, low rates of GVHD and reproducible results worldwide. This has allowed a significant increase in donor availability and in the number of haploidentical transplants performed. 2 Based on promising preclinical studies, O’Donnell and colleagues reported the first phase I clinical trial results of 13 patient s who underwent haploidentical transplant ation using non- myeloablative conditioning with fludarabine 30 mg/m 2 on day -6 to -2 and 2 Gy TBI on day -1 and PTCy 50 mg/kg on day +3 .48 Additional immunosuppression included MMF (day +4 to day +35) and tacrolimus. C yclophosphamide 16.5 mg/kg on day -6 and -5 was subsequently added (Flu/Cy/TBI regimen) after the first few treated patients exper ienced primary graft failure . 48,49 Subsequent studies refined the prevention of GVHD by administering two doses of Cy on days +3 and +4.49 Since then, there has been a considerable interest in developing this approach for clinical pract ice. In 2011, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) jointly published results of 2 phase II studies of haploidentical and cord blood transplants. The studies were conducted in parallel in patients with high -risk hematological ma lignancies . 50 BMT CTN 0603 reported the results of haploidentical transplants with PTCy and a bone marrow graft. Al l patients were treated with reduced intensit y conditioning using the Flu/Cy/TBI regimen . The patients in the h aploidentical transplant trial had a low incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD (32%) and, remarkably, there were no cases of severe (grade III -IV) aGVHD. The 1 -year treatment -related mortality was also very low (7%), but the relapse rate was high (45%) . The 1-year overall survival and progression- free survival were 62% and 48% in the haploidentical trial and 54% and 46% in the cord blood trial. The MD Anderson Cancer Center group also perform ed two parallel phase II trial s, one exploring the use of PTCy -based GVHD prophylaxis for haploidentical HCT and the other for 9/10 unrelated donor transplants , each using the same conditioning regimen (Flu/Mel/2GyTBI) . 51 A total of 1 04 patients were treated, 60 with a haploidentical donor and 46 with a 9/10 unrelated donor transplant. Most patients received a bone marrow ( BM) graft and all had the same GVHD prophy laxis with"

Cumulative incidence s of gr ades II-IV aGVHD w ere 28% and 33% .

One year rates of survival and progression- free survival were 70% and 60% and 60% and 47%, respectively (Table 1).51 Table 1.

In these studies, treatment -related mortality rates ranged from 9% at 2 years to 18% at 1 year for haploidentical donors vs. 8% to 34% at 2 years for unrelated donor s, relapse rate ranged from 18% at 1 year to 40% at 2 years for haploidentical donors and from 16% a t 1 year to 52% at 2 years for unrelated donors, w hile progression- free survival ranged from 41% at 3 ye ars to 60% at 4 years for haploidentical and from 29% at 2 years to 52% at 2 years for unrelated donors , indicating considerable overlap but also showing wide confidence intervals as a result of the rel atively small number of haploidentical transpl ant recipients in these studies ."
12,page_12,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-6 In addition, several larger registry studies compared outcomes between these two donor sources (Table 2 ). Two of these studies were performed by CIBMTR, one in patients with A ML12 and one in patients with lymphoma .13 These studies also showed si milar results between the two groups. In the first study more than 2,000 patients were analyzed ( though only 192 had a haploidentical donor) and the 3 -year progression- free survival was similar for haploidentical and unrelated donor transplant patients tre ated with myeloablative (41% vs . 42%) and reduced intensity/non- myeloablative conditioning (35% vs. 37%) , while lower incidences of acute an d chronic GVHD were observed in the haploidentical transplant groups .12 In the second study of 917 lymphoma patients, 185 had a haploidentical donor (all treated with Flu/Cy/TBI regimen) , and similar results were observed: the 3- year progression -free survival for haploidentical transplants was 47% vs. 49% for unrelated donor transplants performed without ATG and 38% for unrelated donor transplants with ATG (p=0.02), while the haploidentical transplants again had significantly lower incidence of severe aGVHD (8% vs. 12% vs. 17%, p<0.01) and cGVHD (13% vs. 51% vs. 33%, p<0.001).13 In all of these studies, the confidence intervals for the outcomes estima tes were wide and differences as large as 10-15%, while clinically meaningful, could have been missed. There is need to assess these comparisons in much larger cohorts to have adequate statistical power. Table 2 .

13,page_13,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-7 difference in disease -free survival probability according to donor type. Negative numbers favor matched unrelated donors over haploidentical donors; none of the differences were statistically significant. To date, only limited data on differences in immunologic reconstitution between different alternative donor sources exists. The MD Anderson group compared immunologic reconstitution between haploidentical transplants performed with PTCy and HLA matched related and unrelated donor transplants performed with conventional GVHD prophy laxis for patients with AML/MDS. They reported similar recovery of CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3- CD56+ (NK cells) and CD19+ (B -cells) between these 3 groups starting at 3 months post -transplant. However, at day +30 matched related donor transplants had significantly higher CD3+ cells, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ T -cells compared with th e other two donor sources . 59 Although in depth evaluation of immune reconstitution is beyond the scope of this trial, the study will examine rates of clinically significant infections and may provide an opportunity for sample collection for further, separately funded assessment of immune markers, depending on identification of additional resources beyond BMT CTN . 1.3. Quality of Life and Late Effects Quality of life (QOL) refers to every dimensio n of life except for its length and includes physical abilities, symptoms, social well- being, psycho -emotional status, and spiritual/existential qualities. It reflects how well people feel, what they can accomplish, how sati sfied they are with their lives, and whether their lives have meaning and purpose. HCT survivors generally report high global QOL following HCT, but many specific symptoms 60-65 and limitations on their daily activities.66 The purpose of the QOL component of this trial is to explore the long -term QOL implications of using an 8/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor vs. a haploidentical donor. While the trial is powered with survival as the primary endpoint, QOL will be an especially important secondary endpoint if survival is not statistically diffe rent. It is also possible that immunologic recovery, peri -transplant experiences and complications, speed of physical recovery, and expectations may influence"
14,page_14,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-8 ultimate QOL. Since patients are already consented to BMT CTN 1702, the incremental effort of collecting QOL data on a subset of informative patients is worth the potential information gained. It is very important that data collection is centralized, patients’ response burden is minimized and QOL assessments are fully integrated into the trial to maximize the chanc e of complete data collection. With this goal in mind, the number of survey items will be minimized and focused on answering the research question s. Late effects occurring more than 1 year after HCT may be related to the disease, treatment before transpla nt, or the transplant itself . The most common late effects are chronic GVHD and complications related to its treatment, bone density loss, hypothyroidism, diabetes, cardiovascular complications and subsequent neoplasms . 67 These late effects will be captured via the CIBMTR CRF s. No additional data collection forms are required. 1.4. Key Research Questions Donor availability for patients who do not have an HLA -identical related donor re mains a major factor in determining the success of transplantation. Overall, this study aims to assess donor availability and outcomes of patients receiving alternative donor transplant s. More specifically, the primary objectives of this study are: 1) To understand how donor search prognosis affects the likelihood and timing of undergoing transplantation; and 2) To under stand survival differences between MUD Very Likely and MUD Very Unlikely prognosis search groups , where MUD Very Likely search prognosis pa tients are anticipated to undergo matched unrelated donor HCT after some delay to identify a donor and MUD Very Unlikely search prognosis patients will instead pursue a mismatched donor source with less delay . 1.5. Study Design Rationale Current transplant statistics show that haploidentical donor transplant numbers are increasing in the US and internationally , while unrelated donor and cord blood numbers are stable or declining . Physicians and patients wish to know which alternative donor source is prefera ble in which clinical situation s. Because disease progression is a major reason that transplants are not performed, both the speed of getting to transplant and the outcome of transplant ation are important determinants of which donor source is preferable. 11"
15,page_15,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-9 Although the best study design would be a randomized controlled trial among patients who do not have a suitable HLA -identical sibling donor, the number of patients required is too large and preliminary assessment suggested that this type of study is not feasible. Thus, the protocol team opted for a n intention- to-treat biologic assignment design, where biologic assignment is made to matched unrelated donor s vs. all other alternative donors (haploidentical family mem bers, cord blood, m ismatched adult unrelated donors ) based on the donor s earch prognosis score. 14 The score is calculated using the patient’s HLA typing and race . Recent unpublished data suggest that patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD (about 44% of patients) have a >90% chance of finding a matched unrelated donor. Patients who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD (about 15% of patients) have <10% chance of finding a matched unrelated donor (J Dehn, BeTheMatch, personal communication to provide the current distribution of search prognoses). These two patient groups, those who are Very Likely to find a MUD and t hose who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD , will be analyzed for the primary endpoint since the biologic assignment is not associated with disease type, diseas e stage and most other patient factors known to be associated with transplant outcome . Patients who are Less Likely to find a MUD (about 41% of patients) have a 26% chance of fi nding a matched unrelated donor . Patients who are Less Likely to find a MUD will be enrolled and their outcome tracked but they will not be included in the primary analysis becau se there is no consensus on whether and for how long to search for a matched unrelated donor . Donor search prognosis is correlated with race/ethnicity but not with disease or disease stage. Thus, donor search prognosis will be used to assign patients to a group that is very likely to find a matched unrelated donor and a group that is very unlikely to find a matched unrelated donor , while minimizing biases due to disease status. It is acknowledged that the groups will be unbalanced for race (13% racial/ethni c minorities in the Very Likely to find a MUD group and 37% in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group based on 229 searches conducted in a 2 week period in 2018; personal communication J Dehn) and comparisons will be stratified on this variable. Because of the inherent biases in alternative donor selection, we plan to collect key data that will allow us to understand and adjust as much as possible for these biases. First, we will have centers keep screening logs so that we understand why potentially eligible patients were not enrolled, for example, disease considerations, logistics, patient refusal etc. We want to enroll patients once they are considered “serious” transplant candidates but before too many have been lost to factors that could be associated wi th a preferred donor source . For example, if it takes too long to ide ntify or arrange for a certain type of donor, then we want to understand how this impacts relapse and toxicity due to need for additional chemotherapy et c. We will track survival for all patients enrolled on the study, irrespective of whether or not they are transplanted and which donor source is used."
16,page_16,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-10 This will fill a large unmet need for information about the patient evaluation and donor search process and the reasons that otherwise seemingly eligible patients do not receive a transplant. There are few data about these barriers (especially collected prospectively in a systematic manner across multiple centers) , which may include, as noted above, disease progression and non- HCT - related com plications but may also include patient reluctance, financial barriers, lack of social support and others. The rationale for limiting the in-depth outcome analyses requiring complete clinical and patient - reported data collection to a smaller, more homoge neous subset (QOL Substudy ) is to use resources wisely to focus QOL questions on a group of patients who will provide interpretable data. Patients with r are diseases, advanced disease status or unusual conditioning regimens or GVHD prophylaxis approaches may increase the background noise and/or lead to subtle confounding effects on the main outcomes comparisons. The power for this analysis is limited but it will provide important information for planning future studies tha t aim to improve QOL . Little additi onal work is required other than collecting patient -reported outcomes and assigning patients eligible for the QOL Substudy to the CIBMTR CRF track. Given the large number of patients to be followed and understanding that data quality and burden of data collection are often inversely related, we opted to be parsimonious about endpoints. Thus, we will focus on overall survival. Secondary endpoints include rela pse, disease- free survival , treatment -related mortality , aGVHD and c GVHD , all endpoints that can be derived from data routinely collect on the CIBMTR Transplant Essential Data (TED) forms , which are mandated for all US allogeneic HCT recipients . Detailed cGVHD data , number of hospital days , primary graft failure, infection/immune reconstitution and late effects data are limited to a smaller homogenous population of patients with AML or ALL in first complete remission or early stage MDS (refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 5q - syndrome or <5% bone marrow blasts), with data collected on the CIBMTR CRFs. For example, GRFS (acute grade III -IV aGVHD and cGVHD requiring immunosuppression- free, relapse- free survival) and CRFS ( moderate- severe cGVHD- free, relapse- free survival) can only be derived from the CRF forms and not TED forms, so these endpoints are not reported for the entire cohort but will only be reported for the QOL Substudy . Both GRFS and CRFS will be reported to allow comparisons with other BMT CTN studies. Because patient -reported outcomes data require specialized infrastructure and attention, QOL data will also be reported only for the QOL Substudy patients. We limited the QOL assessments to pre - transplant and 1 and 2 years after transplant in order to focus on times where we anticipate more complete collection will result in more meaningful data. Participants also consent to a 5 year QOL assessment when they sign the study consent form but this data collection will be performed separately by CIBMTR, referencing BMT CTN 170 2 as the source of consent. This protocol also outlines research blood sampling but no funding currently exists for collection. Patients in the QOL Substudy will be asked to consent for potential future research samples, and it will be made clear that this sampling is contingent on securing additional funding. If additional funding is obtained, patients will be notified and research sampling will commence. Appropriate sample volume adjustments for patient age and weight will be included. If no additional f unding is secured, no research blood samples will be taken as part of this protocol. Donor blood samples"
17,page_17,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-11 are not included in the protocol now because of the complicated donor consent issues. If additional funding is obtained to support donor research sampling, this protocol will be modified. 1.6. Potential Concerns About the Study Design 1.6.1. Concerns About Minority Imbalance Will a higher proportion of racial/ethnic minorities in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group be problematic in interpretation of study results or an ethical concern for the study? Racial and ethnic minorities comprise a greater proportion of the group that is Very Unlikely to find a MUD (37% of 292, n=108) than the Very Likely to find a MUD group (13% of 730, n=95 ) but because of the differ ent sizes of the groups, the absolute number of racia l/ethnic minorities is comparable in the Very Likely and Very Unlikely groups. All analyses will adjust for racial/ethnic minority status to try to address other, non-HLA factors that might be confounde rs. Racial/ethnic minorities in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group have the lowest chance of finding a matched unrelated donor, so prompt use of another alternative donor is expected to benefit them most by allowing them to proceed to transplant. Furt her analysis of the Wadsworth et al study showed none of the 104 minority patients in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group had a matched unrelated donor transplant, and in fact, only 21% were transplanted using a mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood ( haploidentical transplants could not be tracked). Racial and ethnic minorities in the Very Likely to find a MUD group achieved a 40% transplant rate, closer to the 49% transplant rate achieved in the Caucasians in the Very Likely to find a MUD group, sugge sting that failure to promptly identify a donor is contributing to the barrier to transplantation experienced by the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group. Thus, while racial/ethnic minorities comprise a higher proportion of the Very Unlikely to find a MUD gro up, they are still less than 40% of that group. Use of the donor search prognosis score and rapid use of an alternative donor is anticipated to benefit everyone in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group. 1.6.2. Concerns About the Comparator Group The study tests the hypothesis that rapid access to a transplant improves survival compared to delayed progress to transplant after a more extensive donor search to try to identify a matched unrelated donor. What is the comparator group to measure this outcome? Is the pr imary outcome appropriate given the inherent ethnic/racial imbalance? Appendix C shows the outcomes of transplantation from matched unrelated donors vs. other alternative donors. Multiple other studies (Section 1.2) suggest that once patients under go transplantation, outcomes are fairly similar between the different graft sources. However, the greatest barrier to getting to transplant in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group is identifying a donor. Under current practice, half as many patients in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group get to transplant with a mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood, whether racial/ethnic minorities or Caucasians , and almost no one has a matched unrelated donor transplant. We do not know what happens to those patients who do not undergo transplantation but presumably"
18,page_18,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 1-12 their survival is much worse since transplantation was recommended for them, and we will track the outcomes for non- transplanted patients in this study . 1.6.3. Choice of Interventional Design What will be the impact of the study on the field given the expected rapid changes in transplant and disease management? How will evolving practice such as shifts in preference in donor selection be addressed? If the field shifts to rapid alternative donor transplant for patients in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group that means centers have evaluated the observational data themselves and concluded that this is the best algorithm for their patients. However, our study question is not about how to improve the outcomes in the Ve ry Unlikely to find a MUD group, although this is anticipated to be a derivative of the study . Our study question is how does a matched unrelated donor transplant compare to use of another alternative donor, specifically haploidentical donors. The donor search prognosis score serves as a biologic assignment tool to define groups for this primary comparison. Would the same study with prospective data collection but omitting the algorithm be sufficient to identify current practice including barriers to transplantation and result in identifying hypotheses for future testing? The study team considered an observational study but this design would only address the barriers to transplantation, not the outcomes comparison of matched unrelated donors to other alter native donor sources ."
19,page_19,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 2-1 CHAPTER 2 2. STUDY DESIGN 2.1. Study Overview The study hypotheses are: (1) disease and clinical status are the major determinants of deferred transplants rather than ina bility to identify a donor; and (2) if donor search prognosis is used to guide the donor selection strategy, Very Unlikely and Very Likely to find a MUD patients will have less than a 10% difference in survival, adjusting f or baseline clinical variables , despite having different donor sources. To test these hypotheses we need to enroll patients before a formal alternative donor sea rch is launched. P atients may be enrolled as early as when initial HLA -typing is sent or at the time of initial evaluation for transplantation, preferably but not necessarily before results of the recipient HLA typing are back. Patients are not considered evaluable until they are declared to have no suitable HLA -matched or 1-antigen mismatched family member donor and the center confirms they are still transplant candidates based on available in formation . Enrollment is facilitated by allowing patients with any planned conditioning or GVHD prophylaxis regimen to participate and relying on standard CIBMTR forms for almost all outcomes data. Data about the alternative donor search is collected on a Donor Search Tracking form. Data collection about the search focuses on barriers to transplantation and choices about donor type. The intention is that centers use the donor search prognosis to guide their search strategies . If a patient is Very Likely to find a MUD , a MUD is prioritized with the expectation that >90% will identify a fully matched unrelated donor . If a patient is in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group, the center will move rapidly to the alternative donor of choice - a haploidentical family member , cord blood or mismatc hed unrelated donor because fewer than 10% will be able to find a fully matched unrelated donor . The eligibility criteria will ensure that at the time of enrollment the intent is to tailor the donor search according to the donor search prognosis. It is expected that >90% of patients transplanted in the Very Likely to find a MUD group will have a matched unrelated donor and the 70%, 15% and 15% of patients transplanted in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group will have a hap loidentical, mismatched unrelated donor or cord blood transplant, respectively. Patients who do not undergo transplant will be followed long- term for survival only for at least 2 years after they are declared evaluable, through telephone contact with the patient/family, medical records review or search of administrative databases such as the social security death index. All enrolled and evaluable Very Likely and Very Unlikely to find a MUD patients will be considered in the intention- to-treat primary an alysis of survival. A Donor Search Tracking form will be designed to capture details of the alternative donor search and selection. This form also captures information about the patient’s health and clinical status that are relevant to the timing of transp lant. Data from the regular TED and CRF CIBMTR forms are sufficient for secondary endpoints such as occurrence of acute and chronic GVHD, relapse, disease- free survival , and treatment -related mortality . The CRFs but not the TED forms will capture primary graft failure,"

At 1 year, 2 year and 5 year time points , the CIBMTR will admin ister the QOL surveys electronicall y or on paper upon request. The number of questions may vary based on method of delivery, but each time point will take approximately 14-27 m inutes for adults and 11-19 minutes for pediatric patients. The survey times vary based on method of delivery because computerized adaptive testing will be used for participants who complete the survey online which may increase the number of survey items given to provide more precise scoring with questions that are more closely aligned to a subject’s functioning. 2.6.1.

F or the physical and social functioning scales, higher scores indicate better functioning; for fatigue, pain, anxiety, depression, and sleep scales, higher scores indicate a higher symptom burden. 70 Scores are normalized to 50 with a standard deviation of 10, and scores greater than 0.5 times standard deviation (i.e., <45 or >55, compared to the general population) are considered clinically meaningful. The PROMIS domains for adults are: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, pain interference, and pain intensity. The PROMIS domains for pediatric patients are: physical function mobility, anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, peer relationships, pain interference, and pain intensity."
28,page_28,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 2-1 When delivered on paper , the domains will be delivered combined in a Profile form. The PROMIS 29 Profile for adult patients contains 7 subscales with 4 questions each, and a single item for pain intensity (29 total items). When delivered electronicall y, the domains will be delivered as Computer Adaptive Tests (CAT), in which the questions a person answers are tailored to that person. Each response is used to further refine the questions a participant receives, and thus the participant’s score, for that domain. The PROMIS CAT item banks for a domain typically involve 4- 12 items. The first item administered is usually in the middle of the range of function or severity for that domain. After a participant responds, an estimated score is calculated. The PROMIS CAT algorithm then selects the best item in the item bank for refining the estimated score, and recalculates the participant’s score as they continue responding. The PROMIS CAT continues to administer items until a specified level of measurement precision is reached, or the maximum number of 12 items per measure have been administered. Studies have shown that the average number of items delivered in a CAT domain is 5-8. 71 2.6.3. Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale The Lee chronic GVHD symptom scale (LSS) is a 30 item measure with 7 domains referent to the past 7 days: skin, mouth, eye, lung, psychoemotional, vitality and nutrition. 72 Responses are captured on a five -point Likert scale (“no symptoms, or not bothered at all”, “slightly bothered,” “moderately bothered,” “bothered quite a bit,” or “extremely bothered”). Scores for each domain are converted to a 0 -100 scale where higher scores indicate more bother. The LSS has distinguished between people with different severities of chronic GVHD 68 and been used in randomized clinical trials to show difference in treatment arms .73,74 Although patients will not have chronic GVHD before transplant, we will still administer the instrument at b aseline to capture any pre- existing symptoms and aid in interpreting post -transplant scores. Participants aged 12 and older will complete the LSS. 2.6.4. Occupational Functioning Occupatio nal functioning was measured in the NH LBI T -cell depleted trial using 6 items that assess current job status, type of work (will be captured using Hollingshead categories), number of hours of paid and unpaid work, school, importance of work and change in work goals. 60,73 Only adults will complete the occupational functioning items. 2.6.5. Sociodemographic D ata Sociodemographic data are collected from adults in the QOL Substudy on the pre-transplant survey only: education, income, marital status, and religiosity . Zip code will be available from the TED/CRFs. Contact information including email addre ss, cell phone numbers and alternate contacts will also be collected .

Participant Risks The majority of the physical risks are related to the transplant itself, a treatment which the transplant center has already deemed appropriate for the participant. Patients and their doctors make treatment decisions including donor source, timing of transplant, conditioning regimen intensity and GVHD prophylaxis. The risks of transplant will be determined by the transplant care plan. The intervention being applied in this study i s a biologic assignment varia ble, i.e., the use of the donor search prognosis to guide the donor search strategy, is not per se being tested. R ather, it is being used to classify participants into two groups, those Very Likely and those Very Unlikely to find a MUD, for comparison. A c enter is not allowed to enroll a patient in the trial until they attest that the protocol’s donor search algorithm that uses the donor search prognosis is appropriate for the patient. The primary risk of participation in the study is the possibility that the donor search algorithm suggested by the donor search prognosis will be misleading for individual patients, i.e., a Very Likely to find a MUD patient may not find a matched unrelated donor, or conversely, a Very Unlikely to find a MUD patient may be able to identify a matched unrelated donor. Centers should use clinical judgment in these cases to deviate from the intended donor source based on the participant’s best interest. For children, the risks of this protocol would be the same as for adults. No se nsitive psychosocial or medical data will be collected from medical records. The risks of the QOL Substudy are anticipated to be minimal. C ompletion of patient-reported outcomes is unlikely to cause distress, as these surveys have been administered to thousands of patients without complaint and they do not ask sensitive questions. Collection of research blood samples in the QOL Substudy is contingent on securing additional funding. If this aspect of the protocol is activated, addition al risks to participants in the QOL Substudy include bruising and fainting. The small amount of blood taken is not expected to affect blood counts."

Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint for this study is survival from the time the center declares that no suitable matched family member is available and the patient is considered evaluable . Survival is analyzed as time to event with s urvivors censored at last follow up or 2 years, whichever is earlier. 3.2. Secondary and Post- transplant Endpoints 3.2.1. Transplantatio n Rate Receipt of a transplant is defined as starting conditioning, whether or not the stem cell graft is infused. 3.2.2. Barriers to T ransplantation Reasons for delay or cancellation of the transplant, as collected on the donor tracking form, will be summariz ed by search prognosis category and reported descriptively. 3.2.3. Relapse Relapse criteria for the different malignant diseases will be according to the CIBMTR data dictionary. 3.2.4. Disease- free Survival Disease- free survival is defined as the time from the date of graft infusion to the date of recurrent disease or death from any cause, whichever c omes first in patients with malignant disease . Observation is censored at the date of last follow -up for patients known to be alive without malignancy . 3.2.5. Treatment -related M ortality Treatment -related mortality is defined as death without prior relapse in patients with malignant disease. Relapse is considered a competing risk. 3.2.6. Acute GVHD Grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD will be reported. Acute GVHD grade will be cal culated from the center -reported organ scores using current CIBMTR approaches. 3.2.7. Chronic GVHD"
33,page_33,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 3-2 Any c hronic GVHD as rep orted by the center will be reported . 3.3. Endpoints for the QOL Substudy All patients on the QOL Substudy will have their transplant data collected on CRFs, which will capture all of the planned endpoints except for QOL. 3.3.1. Chronic GVHD Moderate and severe chronic GVHD will be defined per the NIH consensus criteria.75 3.3.2. Time Until Off Immunosuppression for Patients Diagnosed with Chronic GVHD Defined as the time since chronic GVHD onset until all systemic immunosuppression given for chronic GVHD treatment is discontinued. Continuation of low dose steroids f or adrenal insufficiency (5 mg or less of prednisone or 0.1 mg/kg prednisone for children < 18 years old) is not considered systemic immunosuppression. Extracorporeal photopheresis and PUVA are considered systemic immunosuppression. 3.3.3. GVHD, relapse -free surv ival (GRFS) Events for GRFS include grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppression, relapse or death. 3.3.4. Moderate-severe Chronic GVHD, Relapse- free S urvival ( CRFS ) and Current CRFS Events for CRFS include moderate -severe chronic GVHD, relapse or death. Current CRFS will also be calculated, defined as the prevalence of moderate -severe chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppression for treatment of GVHD , disease -free survival, considering chronic GVHD , as a potentially reversibl e complication if systemic immunosuppression is stopped. Although relapse may be treated and the patient placed back in remission, relapse will not be considered a reversible state. 3.3.5. Primary Graft Failure Primary graft failure is defined among patients sur viving at least 28 days after graft infusion as failure to achieve a post -nadir absolute neutrophil count of >500 cell/ µL for 3 days or donor peripheral blood T -cell chimerism of at least 5%. If T -cell chimerism is not available, testing of unsorted blood or marrow is acceptable. 3.3.6. QOL Summary and subscales of QOL instruments will be scored according to the recommendations of the developers. The primary QOL endpoint is the global physical health scale from the PROMIS Global 10. Secondary QOL endpoints are the LSS c hronic GVHD summary score and the PROMIS fatigue, pain and sleep scales. Other scales: mental health, social functioning, anxiety,"
34,page_34,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 3-3 and depression, and c hronic GVHD subscales will be described but are not expected to differ substantially or to have enough power to detect differences. 3.3.7. Hospital Days Number of hospital days within the f irst 100 days will be collected on CRFs . The CIBMTR forms do not distinguish ICU days from regular hospitalization days. We are not able to collect departmental costs due to the differing accounting systems and rules at institutions. 3.3.8. Infections Clinically significant viral, fungal, bacterial, and parasitic- defined infections will be reported by pathogen, site of disease, and date of onset from the CIBMTR CRF Form 2100 at 100 day, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after transplant. If no clinically significant infections have occurred, the absence of infection will be reported. Reporting of certain specific fungal and viral infections will trigger subsequent forms in order to capture more detailed information. Please refer to the CIBMTR forms instruction manual for more details. 3.3.9. Immune R econstitution CIMBTR CRFs will collect data about neutrophil and lymphocytes counts, immunoglobulin subsets and T- cell/B cell numbers , if available. If additional funding is obtained, peripheral blood will be collected for immune reconstitution studies for the QOL Substudy at the following time points: pre-transplant and up to 6 times over the first two years after transplant. Thirty milliliters will b e drawn at each time point for research tests. Participants in the QOL Substudy will be consented to these research blood draws at the time of enrollment, but no sampling will be performed until additional funding is obtained and the protocol is modifi ed to reflect activation of the research blood draws. 3.3.10. Late Effects Late effects are captured on the CIBMTR CRFs , and include selected cardiac, pulmonary, renal, metabolic, endocrine and other late complications."

Screening and Eligibility Procedures 1. Patients may be screened for basic eligibility criteria without informed consent based on a waiver for screening. A screening log will capture all patients screened and their s tudy disposition, e.g., enrolled, reasons they were not approached, etc. 2. The study is described to potentially eligible patients. The background, rationale and study requirements are discussed. Patients are given time to ask questions and consider whether they wish to participate. After the patient has given informed consent to participate on the study, a n authorized user at the transplant center completes the BMT CTN 17 02 Registration Form. 3. Once a patient is deemed evaluable by virtue of no suitable HLA -matched family donor (or 1 allele or antigen mismatched family donor if that is the center’s practice), NMDP Immunogenetic Operations sends the donor search prognosis and preliminary search information to the Center. A Donor Search Tracking form is started. 4. Almost all of the post -transplant outcomes data for this study will be collected through the CIBMTR. If a participant proceeds to transplant , centers must obtain a CIBMTR Research Identification (CRID) number and enter it on the BMT CTN 17 02 Segment A CIBMTR Research ID Form (see CIBMTR Data Collection below). 4.1.2. Evaluations at Enrollment Data collected when consent is signed include the following: 1. Patient ag e, sex, patient -identified race and ethnicity 2. Disease and disease stage 3. Number of full siblings 4. Number of other first degree relatives 5. Date HLA typing sent , both low resolution and high resolution 4.1.3. Evaluations at Evaluability A new form (BMT CTN Donor Source Tracking , see Study Procedure and Guidance Manual ) will be started once a center determines tha t an alternative donor is required. T he form will be updated at least monthly to provide information until conditioning for transplant starts , or the search for a donor is no longer active (survival will be captured on this form until the patient either go es to transplant, dies, or the study ends) . The form will collect d etailed data about the donor"

Upon initiation of the Donor Source Tracking form, the NMDP will provide the donor search prognosis. Key data collected include: 1. Initial preferred alternative donor source (priority ranking at enrollment) : A rank list of preferred donors with “1” indicating the preferred alternative donor and descending. If a donor type would not be used, “0” should be entered. Options include: matched unrelated donor, mismatched unrelated donor , haploidentical family member donor (i.e. > 2 allele mismatch), cord blood, or combinations of donors such as haploidentical + cord blood. For patient s in the Very Likely to find a MUD group, this form will define the donor choice if a matched unrelated donor is not identified. For patients in the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group, it will identify the preferred donor among haploidentical, cord blood or mismatched unrelated donor. For the Less Likely to find a MUD group, it will capture the search algorithm planned by the center in the absence of protocol guidance. 2. Target time to transplant (# of weeks to infusion) 3. Patient weight 4. Confirmation of patient -defined race and ethnicity 5. Current patient diagnosis and disease stage, date of diagnosis 6. Date of patient and full sibling typing 7. Patient HLA typing and NMDP Recipient ID 8. Results of any special testing and dates 9. Date final donor selected 10. Reasons for delay or cancellation of transplantation. See Study Procedure and Guidance Manual for the full list of collected variables. For patients who are never transplanted, this form will also capture survival information. 4.1.4. Donor Search and Identification Once the patient is deemed evaluable, the transplant center transmits the high resolution HLA typing to the NMDP Immunogenetic Program who will prepare a report within 2 business days and send the information back to the center. Once the donor search prognosis inform ation and preliminary search summary have been received and reviewed by the Center, t he transplant coordinators at the transplant center should proceed with their institution’s standard procedure to identify a donor including additional family member typin g and/or initiation of an unrelated donor and/or cord blood search. Updates on patient and search status will be requested at least monthly after enrollment, and include any revision to the donor priority ranking and rationale for changes. Details of the f inal donor selection and donation schedule will be captured. Guidance on the sea rch is provided in the Study Procedure and Guidance Manual. 4.2. Methodology and Documentation of Study Events"

Approaching Patients, Eligibility , Screening, and Obtaining Consent Subjects may be approached for this study from the ti me when they are considered to be potential allogeneic HCT candidates through when the determination that no suitable HLA -matched or 1 allele or antigen mismatched related donor is available. For center s who see patients for a transplant consult then do not see them again until a donor has been identified, consent may happen as soon as HLA -typing is sent. For centers that will see potential participants more frequently before transplant, consent may also take place on ce it is determined there is no suitable HLA - matched or single mismatched related donor. Eligible patients willing to participate in the study will sign an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved consent form for this protocol. Parents or legal guardians will consent for minors, and minors will provide assent per local institutional guidelines. If patient s are determined to have a suitable HLA -matched or 1 allele or antigen mismatched related donor (i.e. < 1 mismatch ; 7+/8 HLA- A, B, C, DRB1 ) who will serve as the donor, they are not considered evaluable for this study. 4.3. Study Monitoring 4.3.1. Transplant D ata Transplant outcome data will be collected on CIBMTR forms. Whether or not a patient participates in BMT CTN 1702, c enters must register pr e- and post -transplant clinical data on all consecutive HCTs done at their institution through the CIBMTR , which holds the contract for the US Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database (SCTOD) charged with collecting data on US allogeneic HCTs . Registration is done using procedures and forms of the SCTOD. (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these forms for all US alloHCT recipients.) Enrollment on BMT CTN 1702 must be indicated on the SCTOD pre -transplant registration form. Assignment to the TED or CRF track will not be affected by participation in BMT CTN 1702, unless patients are eligible for the QOL Substudy in which case all will be assigned to the CRF track . If they consent to QOL data collection, this information will be collected using CIBMTR supplemental forms. 4.3.2. Collection of QOL D ata At the time a patient is identified as participating in the QOL Substudy, the CIBMTR Survey Research Group (SRG) is notified and then adds that patient to CIBMTR’s electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (eP RO) system for long -term QOL tracking. Pre-transplant (baseline) QOL data will be collected by the center or CIBMTR electronically or on paper forms within 4 weeks of the start of conditioning. If conditioning is delayed, the QOL surveys should be repeated so the y are within 4 weeks of conditioning. Electronically -collected baseline QOL surveys will be entered in the ePRO system. The center will securely email or fax baseline QOL instruments completed on paper to the SRG t o enter into their ePRO system. Along with the pre -transplant QOL instruments, the center will s ecurely email or fax a patient cont act information form so that the SRG can reach the patient for 1, 2 and 5 year QOL time points."
38,page_38,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 4-4 The SRG will administer the 1, 2 and 5 year QOL instruments online, or on paper if requested by the patient . They will first confirm the patients’ status with the transplant center because reporting of deaths may lag. They will then contact the patient via email, phone or mail to collect the QOL information online o r on paper. • 1 year +/ - 2 months • 2 years +/- 2 months • 5 years +/ - 3 months [funded and performed under a separate protocol] At the conclusion of each QOL administration, patients will be reminded of the next date of contact . The SRG will notify the transp lant center if a patient’s contact information has changed or if they find through follow-up that the patient has died. 4.3.3. Locat ing Missing Patients If patients cannot be located through the contact information provided, or through the transplant center, th en the SRG will request the NMDP Call Back Unit to conduct a paid search for new contact information using Accurint, a government website accessible to only tho se with permission . Patients give their permission for the SRG to conduct this paid search when they sign the informed consent. 4.3.4. Adverse Event Reporting Only adverse events related to the study consent process , collection of the optional research blood sample s, or completing Q OL surveys will be reported . Since no other therapy is mandated in this study, adverse events associated with transplantation or non- transplantation will not be collected nor reported for this protocol. 4.4. Research Samples Pre-transplant and Post- transplant If additional funding is obtained, peripheral blood samples (30 mL bl ood) will be collected from patients on the QOL Substudy pre-transplant and up to 6 times within the next 2 years after transplant. The study protocol will be modified prior to sample collection to specify the time points and additional information but participants will not have to be reconsented."
39,page_39,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 5-1 CHAPTER 5 5. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1. Study Overview This study is designed as a multicenter prospective study to assess outcomes of alternative donor search prioritizations and transplants, for patients with AML, ALL, MDS, NHL, HL, AA, or SCD who are considered eligible for a transplant within the next 6 months. Patients who consent are considered evaluable once the center determines no suitable HLA -matched or 1 allele or antigen mismatched related donor is a vailable and the center confirms the patient is still transplant eligible . The primary objective is to estimate and compare the overall survival between two arms: patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD , who will pursue a fully matched unrelated donor, versus those who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD, who will pursue a haploidentical, cord blood, or mismatched unrelated donor. Patients who are Less Likely to find a MUD will be enrolled but not analyzed for the primary endpoint because there isn’t agreement on whether a matched unrelated donor should be pursued first. Additional secondary endpoints look at the cumulative incidence of receiving a transplant and reasons for not receiving a transplant , as well as post -transplant outcomes in those who rece ive a transplant by search prognosis arm and by type of transplant received . An additional QOL substudy will examine post- transplant outcomes of a smaller, more homogeneous subgroup with more detailed data collection on chronic GVHD, QOL , infections, and immune reconstitution. 5.1.1. Accrual Based on historical CIBMTR data from 2016 for the diseases included in this study, there were 3133 HCTs from alternative donors, including 2013 from matched unrelated donors, 653 HCTs from haploidentical relatives, 201 from mismatched unrelated donors and 266 cord blood transplants at Core and non- Core BMT CTN centers. Assuming 50- 70% of patients slated for unrelated donor transplantation actually undergo transplantation, there are potentially 4500-6000 transplant c andidat es per year. Assuming 15 % of these patients participate in the trial, and 60% of these are in the Very Likely or Very Unlikely to find a MUD groups , we would be able to accrue between 400-540 patients per year who are eligible for the primary analysis. Based on these assumptions and accounting for variable time to open protocols at participating centers , it is estimated that approximately 3 years of accrual are necessary to enroll the targeted sample size for the primary analysis. 5.2. Sample Size and Powe r Calculations Sample size requirements for this study are based on enrolling sufficient patients to have adequate power for the primary analysis, which is to compare the overall survival between patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD vs. those who a re Very Unlikely to find a MUD , starting at the time of evalua bility for the study when a center confirms that there is no suitable matched or 1 allele or antigen mismatched related donor . We assumed baseline survival probabilities for patients who are in the Very Likely to find a MUD group would be approximately 30% at 2 years , since"
40,page_40,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 5-2 approximately half are expected to make it to transplant, and most patients who do not make it to transplant are not expected to survive past 2 years. Calculations use a log -rank test with a two - sided significance level of 5% for the primary comparison of the Very Likely vs. Very Unlikely to find a MUD groups. We account for approximately 5% exponential rate of loss to follow -up per year, and we assume 3 years of accrual, to tal study time of 4.5 years (or 18 months after last evaluable patient enrolled when the primary analysis is conducted ), and we censor all patients at 2 years since few events are expected to occur after 2 years. We assume that the sample size ratio between MUD Very Likely and MUD Very Unlikely donor search prognosis is 2.5 to 1, based on preliminary data. The targeted total sample size of n=1022 (n=730 MUD Very Likely ; n=292 MUD Very Unlikely donor search prognosis) patients would provide >85% power to detect a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.76, corresponding approximately to a 10% improvement in overall survival at two years for either group. Although preliminary data suggest a <5% survival difference between matched URD and haploidentical transplants (Steve Dev ine, personal communication), we assume that patients having haploidentical donor transplant are able to proceed to transplant earlier and thus have higher transplantation r ates and better overall survival in an intention- to-treat analysis. We are using a two-sided test of the primary endpoint because we do not want to miss the possibility that matched URD recipients have better survival. The targeted sample size for the Very Likely to find a MUD and Very Unlikely to find a MUD patients is based on the ratio of patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD to patients who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD . This number will be monitored throughout the study and the sample size may be increased or decreased depending on the ratio of Very Likely to Very Unlikely to find a MUD patients ; potential increases in sample size are shown in the table below.

Interim Analysis and Stopping Guidelines No interim analysis or stopping guidelines for efficacy or futility are planned for this study. We will review the study design assumptions, particularly the ratio of patients who are Very Likely to find a MUD vs. patients who are Very Unlikely to find a MUD and percentage proceeding to transplant , on a periodic basis, and may adjust the sample size if needed to maintain power in the event that our assumptions are incorrect.

Guidelines for Safety Monitoring Monitoring of a key safety endpoint of post transplant mortality will be conducted monthly to ensure that th e donor selection recommendations for the Very Unlikely to find a MUD group are not leading to significantly lower than expected post transplant outcomes. If rates significantly exceed pre- set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised. Policies and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures. The stopping guideline serves as trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review. The key safety endpoint for this study is mortality post transplant. The rate of mortality will be monitored up to 100 days post -transplant, and only Very Unlikely to find a MUD patients who are transplanted will be included in this monitoring rule , which is designed to minimize the likelihood risk that patients are exposed to a risk of early mortality that is higher than would be expected with match unrelated donor transplantation. Monitoring will be applied to two separate cohorts, defined by malignant vs. non -malignant disease. Monitoring will be perfo rmed monthly beginning when at least 3 patients are evaluable for the monitoring rule ( died or been followed for at least 100 days post transplant ), until enrollment is closed. At least three deaths must be observed, along with crossing of a stopping boundary as described below, in order to trigger re ferral to the DSMB for further re view. The expected probability of 100 day mortality is <=15% for malignant disease and <=10% for nonmalignant disease, based on CIBMTR data for HLA -identical unrelated donor transplantation. Each month, the null hypothesis that the 100- day mortality rate is less than or equal to a specified probability (10% for nonmalignant disease, 15% for malignant disease) is tested. An extension of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored exponential data will be used for monitoring, as described in greater detail below and in Appendix E. This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly examinations separately for both malignant and nonmalignant disease cohorts. The SPRT can be represented graphically. At each monthly interim analysis, the total time on study (e.g. in months or years, x axis) is plotted against the total number of endpoints (e.g., patients experiencing death, y axis) . The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by two parallel lines. Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive 100-day mortality. If the graph falls above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more events than predicted by the observed time on study. Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment is closed. This procedure assumes a censored exponential distribution for the time until death during the first 100 days, and censors follow -up time after 100 days. Only deaths that occur on or before the patient has been followed for 100 days are counted. Total time on study is computed as time from transplant to death, or to 100 days, whichever comes first, summed for all patients on study."
42,page_42,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 5-4 The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α and β of rejecting H 0 when θ = θ0 and of accepting H 1 when θ = θ1, respectively, and the expected sample size E(N| θi). The tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following SPRTs: • Malignant disease: A SPRT contrasting 15% versus 25% 100- day rate of mortality results in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.067 and an upper intercept of 4.372, with nominal type I and II errors of 7% and 15%, respectively. • Non-malignant disease: A SPRT contrasting 10% versus 30% 100- day rate of mortality results in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.063 and an upper intercept of 1.938, with nominal type I and II errors of 8% and 15%, respect ively. The actual operating characteristics of the truncated tests, shown in Table 5.3a and 5.3b for the malignant and non- malignant cohorts respectively , were determined in a simulation study that assumed uniform accrual of 292 Very Unlikely to find a MU D individuals (approximately 260 malignant and 32 nonmalignant) over a three -year time period, and exponential time to failure after transplant. Deviations from these expected distributions of malignant vs. nonmalignant sample sizes may lead to small chan ges in the rejection probabilities and other operating characteristics.

Analysis Populations Primary Analysis Population : The pr imary analysis population will include all patients registered who meet study eligibility, do not have a suitable matched or 1 allele or antigen mismatched family donor, and who are Very Likely to find a MUD or are Very Unlikely to find a MUD . Outcomes will be analyzed according to the donor search prognosis, regardless of the alternative donor prioritized, as an Intention- to-Treat analysis. Outcomes will be measured from the time the patient is deemed evaluable by virtue of needing to pursue alternative donors. Less Likely to find a MUD group: Patients who are registered and meet study eligibility but have a donor search prognosis of Less Likely to find a MUD will not be included in the primary analysis population, but rather will be analyzed separately in a descriptive analysis, both overall and according to the specified alternative donor preference. Outcomes will be measured from the time the patient is deemed evaluable. Transplant population: Several secondary analyses will be done on the subset o f patients in all three search prognosis groups who receive a transplant. Here patients will be analyzed according to both their initial search prognosis score and by the type of alternative donor transplant received, and outcomes will be measured from the time of transplant. Outcomes will be measured from the start of transplant. QOL Substudy population: A substudy will be conducted on a homogeneous group of AML and ALL patients who are transplanted in first complete remission and early stage MDS patien ts, in order to collect more detailed post-transplant outcome data. Based on the eligibility for the QOL Substudy and transplant activity in 2016, we anticipate having 286 patients across the 3 search prognostic groups. This estimate is based on an enrollment of 1732 evaluable patients, 50% of whom are transplanted and 33% of those meet the eligibility criteria for the Substudy. Patients will be analyzed according to the type of alternative donor transplant received (matched unrelated donor vs. haploidenti cal), and outcomes will be measured from the time of transplant. These"
44,page_44,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 5-6 analyses will be exploratory in nature, and hypothesis -generating for future studies. Although these are primarily exploratory analyses, we calculated the detectable mean difference wit h 85% power in the physical subscale of the PROMIS global health measure to be 5.1. This assumes that 90% of the 286 patients would have baseline QOL, 60% would be alive at 2 years, and 70% of those would have complete 2 year QOL data, for an evaluable sample size of n=108. It is based on a two-sample t -test with two -sided significance level of 5%, standard deviation of 8, and a sample size ratio of 2.5 to 1. 5.5. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics will be su mmarized for each of the analysis populations. Characteristics to be examined for the primary analysis population and Less Likely to find a MUD group are: age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status as determined by zip code, disease (including known high r isk cytogenetics or molecular markers), disease stage and duration, performance score, number of siblings, preferred alternative donor, and transplant center. Characteristics to be examined for the transplant population also include disease risk index , donor type, graft source (peripheral blood vs. bone marrow vs. cord blood), donor age and gender, CMV matching, co -morbidity index, time to transplant, preferred alternative donor identified, preferred alternative donor available, transplant center. Character istics of interest for the QOL Substudy include: all of the variables listed above plus baseline QOL, and self -reported socioeconomic status. 5.6. General Analysis Considerations As this is a biologic assignment study where there may be potential biases in d onor search prognosis groups or alternative donor transplant groups being compared, all analysis will include summary univariate measures as well as multivariate analyses whenever feasible with sufficient numbers to adjust for confounding. Proportional hazards assumption will be assessed for all Cox models using graphical methods or time -dependent covariates. Interactions between patient characteristics and donor search prognosis group or alternative donor transplant group will also be investigated but will be considered exploratory. 5.6.1. Anal ysis of the Primary Endpoints The primary endpoint of the trial is overall survival from the time of e valua bility determination in the primary analysis population, analyzed according to the donor search prognosis group ( Very Likely vs. Very Unlikely to find a MUD), in an intent -to-treat fashion. The primary null hypothesis of the study is that there is no difference in overall survival between the Very Likely and Very Unlikely to find a MUD groups. Because of the potent ial bias resulting from this biologic assignment mechanism (using donor search prognosis as a surrogate for prioritization of alternative donor types), 76 the comparisons of overall survival between groups will be done using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for the following pre -specified patient characteristics: age, sex, race, ethnicity, disease, and disease stage, if applicable. A Cox model stratified on alternative donor type will be used to provide adjusted overall survival probabilities at two years for each alternative donor type, using the method of Zhang et al . 77 It is not possible to adjust this"

When the sample size is not fixed in advance, further improvement is possible by using Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The SPRT continues to sample as long as A L Bn< < for some constant A B< <1 , stops sampling and decides in favor of 1Has soon as A Ln>, and stops sampling and decides in favor of 0Has soon as B Ln<. The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error pro babilities αandβof rejecting 0H when0θ θ= , and of accepting 0H when 1θ θ=, respectively, and the expected sample size ) ( ) | (N E N Ej j≡θ .

59,page_59,"BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK CTRL -ALT-D – Protocol 1702 Version 1.0 – December 10, 2018 6-2 Derivation of the SPRT for Censored Exponential Survival Times Suppose that we wish to construct a sequential test for the composite null hypothesis that the rate of overall mortality at an early time point t is less than or equal to p 0 versus the alternative hypothesis that it is greater than or equal to p 0. Let us assume that the survival times, nT T T,..., ,2 1, are i.i.d. with exponential density function Te T fθθ θ−=) , ( . Although an exponential model may not fit well for overall mortality, it usually provides a reasonable model over a short time frame for modeling toxicity, so in all discussion below we assume that exponential survival times are censored at time point t. In the exponential parameterization, a t -day survival rate of p 0 translates into a mean survival of µ 0=-t/ln(1 -p0) (rate parameter =0θ-ln(1-p0)/t). . The SPRT is derived with reference to a simple null and alternative hypothesis for the r ate parameter, in this case, 0:o Hθθ= versus1 1:θ θ= H . The log -likelihood ratio for the exponential in the presence of censoring is 1 0 1 0 10 log ( ; ) log ( , ) (log( ) log( )) ( )nn n ii i i iifx fx d T θ θ θ θ θθ − = − −− ∑ ∏∏ , where d is the number of events. The SPRT can be represented graphically when plotting the number of deaths (d) on the y axis against the total time on study ∑n iiT on the x axis. The continuation region in terms of d is bounded by two parallel lines given by 10 10 10 10 10 10() () log( ) log( ) ( log log ) (log log ) (log log ) (log log )nn ii iiBATd Tθθ θθ θθ θθ θθ θθ    −−+ << +    −− −−   ∑∑ with common slope 10 1 0( ) / (log log )θθ θ θ−− , and intercepts 10 log / (ln ln )Aθθ− and 10 log / (ln ln )Bθθ− , for the upper and lower bounds, respectively. For monitoring purposes, at an interim analysis calendar time point s, suppose that d(s) events have occurr ed and that the total time on study is ()n i iTs∑ .The cumulative number of events d(s) is plotted on the y axis against the total time on study, ()n i iTs∑ . When this graph crosses the upper boundary, the null hypothesis is rejected. In practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the study. A truncated version of the SPRT can be obtained by specifying a maximum sample size. We truncate the SPRT by declaring that if the test has failed to terminate after the maximum sample size, that the null hypothesis will be accepted. Since the probability that the untruncated SPRT would reject the null at the maximum sample size is negligible, it makes little difference how the final boundary value is selected, and this rule is chosen for simplicity. The operating characteristics of this proposed truncated SPRT for censored exponential data can be estimated by simulation."
