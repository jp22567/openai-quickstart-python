INTRODUCTION Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that leads to death in an average of 7 years following symptom onset [Williams 2005 ]. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD), and the European Organisation for Orphan Diseases estimate the prevalence of PSP to be between 3 and 6 per 100,000 persons. Both the NINDS and NORD estimate that there are approximately 20,000 cases of PSP in the United States and 30,000 in the European Union, while there are thought to be approximately 17,000 cases in Japan [Takigawa 2016 ]. The disease is characterized by progressive aberrations in gait, eye movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, pseudobulbar affect, neuropsychiatric abnormalities, and dementia, as well as difficulties with sleep [Boxer 2017 ; Nath 2003 ]. Since the syndrome was first characterized in 1963, it is now recognized that there are a number of different clinical presentations that appear to be linked to the regional distribution and severity of pathology in the brain [Williams 2007 ]. There is curre ntly no treatment available to stop or slow the progression of this deadly disease. The neuropathological hallmark of PSP is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles in clinically correlated regions of the brain, including the basal ganglia, diencephalon, b rainstem, and cerebellum with restricted involvement of the neocortex [Dickson 2010 ]. The tangles are composed of tau, an intracellular microtubule -associated protein, of which fragments may also be released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial space a s N-terminal tau [Bright 2015 ; Guo 2017 ]. Tau dysfunction is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology of PSP, both by causing neuronal dysfunction via tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles and by facilitat ing cell to cell spreading of tau pathology via secreted N -terminal tau. BIIB092 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to amino acid residues 15 to 22 of N-terminal tau, removing it from the CSF. It is hypothesized that BIIB092 -mediated depl etion of N-terminal tau will inhibit the spread of tau pathology, potentially slowing the progression of PSP. This would be expected to translate into important improvements in function, activities of daily living, health outcomes, and overall quality of l ife for patients living with PSP. 3.1. Study Rationale The neuropathological hallmark of PSP is the presence of tau pathology in the form of neurofibrillary tangles in characteristic subcortical and cortical brain regions. N -terminal tau is implicated in mediat ing the transcellular spreading of this tau pathology in PSP. BIIB092 has been shown to bind N -terminal tau and suppress CSF concentrations of unbound N - terminal tau (i.e., N -terminal tau that is not bound to BIIB092) in preclinical studies, a single ascen ding dose (SAD) study in normal healthy volunteers ( NHVs ) (Study CN002001), and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in participants with PSP (Study CN002003). Based on these data, BIIB092 is expected to prevent spreading of tau pathology by binding and reducing unbound N -terminal tau in brain interstitial fluid, suggesting that it has potential utility for the treatment of human tauopathies, such as PSP. The aim of this s tudy is to demonstrate the efficacy of BIIB092 in delaying the progression of clinical signs and symptoms of PSP and to characterize its safety/tolerability profile."

Background BIIB092 (formerly known as BMS -986168 and IPN007) is a humanized mAb of subclas s IgG4 that specifically binds the mic rotubule -associated protein tau . BIIB092 is derived from the murine IgG1 mAb, IPN002, which was produced in response to immunization of mice with aggregated, recombinant full -length human tau ( tau isoform 2N4R). The af finity, specificity, and functional activity of the antibody were maintained following humanization. BIIB092 recognizes a linear, amino terminal epitope (including amino acid residues 15 to 22 of full -length human tau) of tau. BIIB092 exhibits high affinit y for human and cynomolgus monkey tau, with binding affinities of 7 × 10-10 M and 6.35 × 10-10 M, respectively. The primary site of action of BIIB092 is believed to be the interstitial space between neurons where it binds N -terminal tau, thereby reducing t au-induced neuronal hyperexcitability and tau -mediated spread of tau pathology. BIIB092 is being developed for the treatment of PSP, a rare neurodegenerative disease associated with tau pathology that results in a progressive movement disorder. There is a significant unmet medical need for safe and effective agents for patients with PSP, as there are currently no approved drugs for its treatment. Existing medical management is focused on reducing symptoms, using drugs approved for various other indications off-label along with dietary supplements. However, it is widely accepted that none of these drugs is particularly effective in treating PSP. BIIB092 was first introduced into clinical trials in the Phase 1 trials conducted in the United States (US), Study CN002001 in healthy adult volunteers and Study CN002003 in participants with PSP . Results from the first -in-human study, CN002001, indicate that administration of single doses of up to 4200 mg of BIIB092 in healthy volunteers is well tolerated. Mean suppression of the CSF - unbound N -terminal tau in that study ranged from 67% to 97% at doses ranging from 70 to 4200 mg. Study CN002003 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, MAD study to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharma cokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of BIIB092 doses of 150, 700, and 2100 mg in participants with PSP. All 3 doses were well tolerated based on results from the dose escalation phase of the study. Treatment with monthly doses of BII B092 decreased CSF -unbound N -terminal tau by mean values of approximately 90%, 93%, and 96% on Day 29 and 91%, 95%, and 97% on Day 85 at doses of 150, 700, and 2100 mg, respectively. Study 251PP201 is an ongoing open -label extension study to evaluate the l ong-term safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BIIB092 in participants with PSP who participated in CN002003 . A more detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, and safety of BIIB092 is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 3.2.1. Research Hypothesis This study will demonstrate that BIIB092 is effective and safe for the treatment of participants with PSP."

Benefit/Risk Assessment The benefit/risk profile of BIIB092 in nonclinical studies, the SAD study in NHVs (Study CN002001), and the MAD study and its associated open -label extension study (Studies CN002003 and 251PP201, respectively) supports further evaluation of the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, PD response, and clinical efficacy of BIIB092 in participants with PSP. BIIB092 is a humanized IgG4 isotype antibody that is considered to have a low potential for immunogenicity in humans based on nonclinical studies. There were no adverse effects noted at any dose tested in the pivotal toxicity studies in monkeys. Nonclinical findings were limited to decreases in CSF unbound N -terminal tau consistent with the intended pharmacology of BIIB092. In completed clinical study CN002001, there was no consistent trend showing a potential effect of anti -drug antibody (ADA) on the PK of B IIB092. In completed clinical study CN002003, there was no apparent dose -related trend in the number of subjects with positive immunogenicity results post -treatment. Studies evaluating the potential for reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed for BIIB092. As of 25 November 2018, an estimated 486 participants have been exposed to BIIB092 across all completed ( Studies CN002001 and CN002003) and ongoing clinical studies (Studies 251PP201, 251PP301, and 251AD201). Based on safety data fr om a completed Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (Study CN002001) and a completed Phase 1B study in participants with PSP (Study CN002003), the benefit /risk profile of BIIB092 was favorable to support further clinical development. There is no information available about possible interaction of BIIB092 with other drugs, although no PK interactions are anticipated. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably anticipated AEs of BIIB092 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. However, because BIIB092 is an experimental agent, it is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or unanticipated reactions may occur."

Data Monitoring Committee and Other External Committees An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established for this study and its activities will be fully described in a DMC Charter. The DMC will be composed of at least 2 independent physicians and 1 independent statistician with experience in neurological clinical trials. In this stu dy, the major tasks of the DMC will be to review unblinded data and monitor the benefit/risk of BIIB092, to assess whether there are unacceptable safety findings after administration of BIIB092 that require modifying or stopping the study, and potentially to adjudicate study treatment -relatedness of SAEs and deaths that are unexpected and/or atypical for participants with PSP. 5.4. Number of Participants It is anticipated that approximately 459 male and female participants will be dosed in this study. Approximat ely 459 participants will be randomly assigned, in 2:1 ratio, to receive 2000 mg of BIIB092 or placebo (306 participants active and 153 placebo) administered by intravenous (IV) infusion approximately once Q4W. Randomization will be stratified by country a nd screening CTT Part 2 score of either less than or equal to 170 seconds or greater than 170 seconds. Anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 25%, approximately 345 participants (230 participants in the BIIB092 treatment group and 115 participants in the placebo group) are expected to complete the study through Week 52. 5.5. End of Study Definition The date the first participant signs a study -specific informed consent form will be defined as the start of the study. A participant is considered enrolled when the study -specific informed consent form is signed. The date that the last participant completes the last study visit or scheduled procedure shown in Section 2, Schedule of Activities, will be defined as the end of the study. 5.6. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The double -blind period of the study is intended to determine the efficacy and safety/tolerability of BIIB092. It is anticipated that participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 2000 mg of BIIB092 or placebo, respectively, administered by IV infusion once Q4W for approximately 48 weeks (up to a total of 13 times). The justification for the dose is described in Section 5.7 and based on previous studies evaluating the PK of BIIB092 and PD effects on unbound N -terminal tau levels in CSF. A duration of treatment of up to 5 2 weeks and comparison with a placebo control are considered adequate and appropriate to evaluate the efficacy of BIIB092 on the primary and secondary endpoints, given the natural history of PSP and the lack of any approved therapies. The open -label exten sion period of the study is intended to further characterize the long -term efficacy and safety/tolerability of BIIB092. It is anticipated that all participants in the study, including those randomized to receive placebo in the double -blind period, will rec eive 2000 mg of BIIB092 administered Q4W by IV infusion throughout the open -label extension period of the study."

Postural ins tability, gait disturbances, and falls are prominent signs of PSP that impact participant outcomes. At present these signs are assessed in the clinic with questionnaire s. It is anticipated that advances in wearable sensor technology and analytics could imp rove quantification of these signs and may provide sensitive measures of disease progression. 5.6.1. Clinical Assessments All participants will have baseline and periodic, on -treatment measures throughout the study to evaluate PSP symptoms using the PSPRS, MDS -UPDRS Part II, SEADL scale, CGI -S and CGI - C; MoCA; PSP -QoL, , and neuropsychological assessments (RBANS, phonemic fluency, LNS, and CTT). The will be performed for all participants. Each participant will have their respective caregiver assessed for caregiver burden and resource utilization using the 5.6.2. Rationale for Inclusion of Key Biomarkers All participants will have blood collected for assessment of serum concentrations of unbound N - terminal tau and explorator y biomarkers determined at baseline and at regular intervals during the study to confirm target engagement. Where local regulations and institutional approvals allow, a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be prepared to analyze genetic variation in specific genes associated with PSP, genes impacting drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and/or neurodegeneration. The impact of genetic variation such as H1 and H2 haplotypes on tau protein levels may also be examined. All participants will have MRI evaluations at baseline and at Weeks 24, 52, and 100 to assess structural changes in the brain. 5.7. Justification for Dose The dose of BIIB092 selected for this study is 2000 mg, administered once Q4W. In the SAD study in NHVs (CN002001), single doses of BIIB092 were well tolerated at all doses tested (i.e., 21 to 4200 mg). A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Robust suppression of unbound N -terminal tau in CSF (88% to 97%) was observed for at le ast 4 weeks after a single dose, compared to baseline, in the dose range of 210 to 4200 mg. The MAD study in participants with PSP (CN002003) assessed three Q4W doses of BIIB092 of 150, 700, and 2100 mg during the dose escalation phase of the study. All t hree doses were well tolerated in participants with PSP, based on preliminary results from the dose escalation phase of"

Treatment with monthly doses of BIIB092 decreased CSF unbound N -terminal tau by mean values of approximately 90%, 93%, and 96 % on Day 29 and 91%, 95%, and 97% on Day 85 at doses of 150, 700, and 2100 mg respectively. Additional data on safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of all 3 dose levels is accruing with the open -label extension period of this study. Emerging PK and unbound N -terminal tau data from Panels 1 and 2 (150 and 700 mg, administered Q4W) of CN002003 were modeled using a semi -mechanistic PK -PD model developed using the NHV data, and re -estimating the model parameters to describe the observed data in participants with PS P. The observed PK -PD profile in participants was well characterized by the PK -PD model based on the estimates of the model parameters in participants as well as the goodness of fit plots. Using the estimated PK -PD model parameters and the variability arou nd these parameters in participants with PSP, 1000 profiles were simulated and the time course of PK in serum and CSF and PD (unbound N -terminal tau) in CSF were obtained for the 2000 mg dose administered Q4W for a period of 1 year. Unbound N -terminal tau concentrations were converted to percent suppression, relative to each participant’s baseline value, prior to summarization based on the simulations. Table 5 shows summary statistics of percent suppression of unbound N -terminal tau relative to baseline levels at 4, 12, 24, and 52 weeks following the 2000 mg Q4W dosing regimen."

Based on the results of the simulation, ninety percent of all participants who are dosed the 2000 mg Q4W dose are expected to have a percentage suppression of unbound N -terminal tau at 96% or greater at trough. The remaining 10% of participants are expecte d to have a suppression of approximately 95% and greater. Whereas the actual level of unbound N -terminal tau suppression in CSF that is associated with efficacy in humans is unknown, it is anticipated that higher levels of unbound N -terminal tau suppressio n will be associated with greater efficacy. The high level of suppression of unbound N-terminal tau was well tolerated in monkeys and has been well tolerated in both healthy volunteers and participants with PSP. Overall, a dose of 2000 mg Q4W is expected t o be a well tolerated dose in participants with PSP that will achieve and maintain greater than 95% suppression of unbound N -terminal tau in CSF in the vast majority of participants for the entire study period, which is expected to increase the likelihood of demonstrating efficacy with BIIB092."

Based on the following: − Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy defined as clear limitation of the range o f voluntary gaze in the vertical more than in the horizontal plane, more than expected with age, which is overcome by activation with the vestibulo -ocular reflex (at later stages, the vestibulo -ocular reflex may be lost, or the maneuver prevented by nuchal rigidity). OR − Slow velocity of vertical saccades (i.e., decreased velocity [and gain] of vertical greater than horizontal saccadic eye movements) . Gaze should be assessed by command to a stationary target rather than by pursuit, with the target >20  from the position of primary gaze. Typically, saccadic movement is slow enough for the examiner to see its progress, rather than just its initial and final positions. Deficits are more prominent in the vertical than the horizontal plane. A delay in initiation o f saccades is not considered slowing. c. Age at symptom onset of 40 to 85 years by history, and current age between 41 and 86 years, inclusive, at the time of screening. d. An akinetic -rigid syndrome. e. Presence of PSP symptoms for less than or equal to 5 years (d etermined by the best judgement of the Investigator) at screening. 2. Body weight range of 43 kg/95 lbs. to 120 kg/265 lbs. 3. Able to ambulate independently or with assistance defined as the ability to take at least 10 steps with a walker (guarding is allowed provided there is no contact) or the ability to take at least 10 steps without a walker or cane with the assistance of another person who can only have contact with one upper extremity. 4. Able to tolerate MRI. 5. Able to perform all protocol -specified a ssessments and comply with the study visit schedule. 6. Able to comply with neuropsychological evaluation at screening and throughout the 52 - week double -blind period of the study (determined by the best judgement of the Investigator). 7. Have reliable caregiver to accompany participant to study visits. Caregiver must be able to read, understand, and speak local language fluently to ensure comprehension of informed consent and informant -based assessments of participant. Caregiver must also have frequent contact wi th participant (at least 3 hours per week at one time or different times) and be willing to monitor the participant’s health and concomitant medications throughout the study. Caregiver must be willing to sign and date an IRB -/IEC - approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines as appropriate. 8. Score 20 on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) at screening."

Method of Treatment Assignment All participants will be centrally randomized using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Before the study is initiated, each user will receive log in information and directions on how to access the IRT. Randomization will be stratified by country and screening CTT Part 2 stratum of a score either less than or equal to 170 seconds or greater than 170 seconds. Randomization will only be stratified by screening CTT Part 2 stratum under the IRT system for protocol Version 1. To promote treatment balance wi thin each country, randomization will be stratified by both country and screening CTT Part 2 when the new IRT system for this protocol is in place. Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits as listed in Schedule of Activities (Section 2). 7.3. Blinding Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrity of this clinical study. However, in the event of a medical emergency or pregnancy in an individual participant in which knowledge of the investigational product is critical to the participant's management, the blind for that participant may be broken by the Investigator. The participant’s safety takes priority over any other c onsiderations in determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded. Before breaking the blind of an individual participant's treatment, the Investigator should determine that the unblinded information is necessary, i.e., that it will alter the part icipant’s immediate management. In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not related to the IP, the problem may be properly managed by assuming that the participant is receiving active product. It is highly desirable that the decision to u nblind treatment assignment be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the Investigator always has ultimate authority for the decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator should only call in for emergency unblinding AFTER the participant has made the decision to discontinue from study treatment . For information on how to unblind in an emergency, consult the IRT manual."

The Bioanalytical Sciences section or its designate will be unblinded to the randomized treatment assignments in order to minimize unnecessary analysis of samples from control group participants. Any request to unblind a participant for non -emergency purposes should be disc ussed with the Medical Monitor. 7.4. Dosage Modification There will be no dose escalations or reductions of study treatment allowed. Participants may be dosed within a ±3 -day window for each dosing visit in the double -blind portion of the study after the first dose administered on Day 1 of Week 0. For the open -label extension period of the study, participants may be dosed within a ±7 -day window for each dosing visit. Participants should be carefully monitored for infusion reactions during administration. If an acute infusion reaction is noted, participants should be managed according to Section 14. Dosing visits should generally not be skipped, only delayed. In the unusual circumstance where an extended delay occurs (e.g., 2 weeks or more), the Investigator should discuss this with the Medical Monitor. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability Study treatment will be manufactured, handled, and stored in acc ordance with applicable Good Manufacturing Practice. BIIB092 is supplied as a liquid drug product in glass vials containing an extractable dose per the Directions for Handling and Administration (DHA). The contents of the BIIB092 label will be in accordanc e with all applicable regulatory requirements. BIIB092 should not be used after the expiration date. BIIB092 must be stored refrigerated between 2°C and 8°C with protection from light. Study treatment not supplied by Biogen will be stored in accordance wit h the package insert. The product storage manager should ensure that the study treatment is stored in accordance with the environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by the DHA. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the study treatment arise, the study treatment should not be dispensed, and Biogen should be contacted immediately. The study treatment should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ens ure that study treatment is only dispensed to study participants . The study treatment must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations. Study site staff should follow the DHA for specific instructions on the handling, preparation, administration, storage, and disposal of the study treatment. The DHA will also describe the masking of the IV bags of study treatment (both BIIB092 and placebo) to maintain the treatment blind. The DHA supersedes all other re ferences (e.g., protocol or Investigator’s Brochure)."

DISCONTINUATION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation From Study Treatment Participants MUST discontinue study treatment (a nd non -IP at the discretion of the Investigator) for any of the following reasons: • Participant’s request to stop study treatment. Participants who discontinue study treatment and remain enrolled in the study will be expected to complete scheduled safety and efficacy evaluations until the decision is made to withdraw from the study. • Any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that continued participation in the study is not i n the best interest of the participant • Termination of the study by Biogen • Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntary incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and study treatment must be discontinued immediately. In most cases, the study treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose t apering if necessary for participant safety). Please call the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. If the Investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor/designee must occur. If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study, the reason for the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and ente red on the appropriate CRF page . 8.2. Study Follow -Up In this study, safety is a key endpoint of the study. Study follow -up is of critical importance and is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrity of the study. Participants who discontinue study treatment and remain in the study will be expected to complete scheduled safety and efficacy tests and assessments until the end of study or withdrawal of consent (see Table 2 and Table 3). Participants who discontinue study treatment and remain in the study should have all AEs collected up to 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. AE collection should continue until the end of study or withdrawal from the study. At any point after discontinuing study treatment, if the participant makes the decision to withdraw from the study ( see Section 8.3), the following should be done: • Early Discontinuation visit procedures should be completed . • Participants and/or caregiver s should receive a follow -up phone call approximately 30 days after discontinuation of study treatment to collect relevant clinical"

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES • Study procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). • Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. • All immediate safety concerns must be discussed with the Medical Monitor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue treatment. • Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the Schedule of Activities, is essential and required for study conduct. • All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria b efore randomization. The Investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. • Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed within the timeframe defined in the Schedule of Activities. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments Each of the clinician -reported outcome measures described below will be performed by an appropriately qualified individual, for example a psychometrist or neurologist. The specific requirements will be document ed in the procedure manual. The PSPRS and RBANS may be recorded (either audio or video) in order to allow for central review for standardization of test administration where allowable by country and/or local authorities. Each of the participant -reported outcome measures described below may be administered as clinician -reported outcome measures where allowable by the assessments author/developer meaning that the assessments will be completed by a qualified member of the site staff, who will be reporting info rmation collected from the participant and/or the caregiver as appropriate in order to promote consistent quality, standardization of test, and minimize burden on the study participant and/or caregiver. These assessments are described below: PSPRS The PSPR S [Golbe and Ohman -Strickland 2007 ] is a quantitative measure of disability in participant s with PSP. The PSPRS comprises 28 items in six areas. The available total score ranges from 0 (normal) to 100. Six items are rated on a 3 -point scale (0 to 2), and 22 are rated on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The History/Daily Activities area i ncludes seven items with a total maximum of 24 points, the mentation area four items with 16 points, the bulbar area two items with 8 points, the ocular motor area four items with 16 points, the limb motor area six items with"

The PSPRS should be conducted by a neurologist. MDS -UPDRS Part II The MDS -UPDRS Part II includes 13 items assessing motor aspects of experiences of daily living [Goetz 2007 ]. These include speech, saliva and drooling, chewing and swallowing, handwriting, doing hobbies and other activities, eating tasks, tremor, dressing, hygiene, turning in bed, getting out of bed, walking and balance, and freezing. CGI -S and CGI -C The CGI -S measures the symptomatology of the disease using a 7 -point scale. The CGI -C [Guy 1976 ] scale measures the change in the participant ’s clinical sta tus from a specific point in time. Using a 7 -point scale, ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with a score of 4 indicating no change. Whenever possible, for any individual participant, this assessment should be done by the same rate r throughout the study. The CGI -C should be assessed relative to the CGI at the Week 0 (Day 1) visit as the reference. A version of the CGI that has been modified for use in Participants with PSP will be used in this study [Boxer 2014 ]. RBANS The RBANS [Randolph 1998 ] was developed for the dual purposes of identifying and characterizing abnormal cognitive decline in the older adult. The full battery is composed of 12 subtests. PSP-QoL The PSP -QoL [Schrag 2006 ] is a participant -reported outcome mea sure developed specifically for assessing the health -related quality of life in people living with PSP. It is a validated 45 -item questionnaire and visual analog scale that is comprised of two subscales: physical health state (22 items), which covers mobil ity, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual disturbances, self -care, and activities of daily living, and mental health state (23 items), which covers emotional, cognitive, and social functioning. Items are given a 5 -response option format (0 = no problem to 4 = extreme problem). The subscale results are derived by summing the respective items for that subscale and transforming the scores into a range of 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater impact of the disease on the aspect measured. The scale has high internal consistency in both physical health and mental health subscales (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93 and 0.95, respectively). SEADL scale The SEADL scale [Dal Bello -Haas 2011 ] is a means of assessing a person’s ability to perform daily activities in terms of speed and independence through a percentage figure. The rating will be determined by a qua lified staff member according to the participant’s self -reported functional ability of specific criteria, with 100% indicating total independence and falling to 0% indicating a state of complete dependence. QMA QMA evaluates the effect of BIIB092 on motor function during typical daily activities . Participants in the QMA substudy will undergo q uantitative assessments of core motor features"

Participants will be asked to perform motor tasks while wearing lightweight accelerometers on their neck, feet, lower back, and wrists. Refer to the QMA manual f or details of each assessment. The following tests will be performed for QMA: • Falls : Participants will be asked to wear a necklace -like sen sor at home to capture any fall data and quantify the number of falls. • Sway: A postural sway test will be conducted, where the participant will be asked to remain standing still for 30 seconds while staring at a fixed object on a wall 1 to 4 m away. A foot block will be placed between the participant’s feet. Sway jerk, velocity, and frequency dispersion will be determined. • Gait: Gait speed, stride length, foot strike angle, arm swing range of motion, and turn velocity will be determined. − Usual gait: The participant will be asked to walk back and forth over a 7 -m distance, at a comfortable speed, for approximately 2 minutes. − Dual -task gait: The participant will be asked to walk back and for th over a 7 -m distance, at a comfortable speed, while doing a cognitive task, for approximately 1 minute. • Timed chair stands (TCS): This performance -based measure will evaluate the amount of time it takes for a participant to rise from a chair and sit down . • Instrumented push and release test : This evaluation is similar to a retropulsion test but with a standardized pull of force. Participa nts will lean backward into the examiner and will be given a small push and release to quantify postural stepping response. • Rapid successive movements: Assessment of rapid successive movements consists of 2 tasks. Each task will be performed separately for the left and right limbs. Change in frequency and amplitude of repetitive movements will be determined during each of the following tasks: − Toe taps: For this task, both feet will be flat on the floor. Participants will be asked to tap their toe as high a nd as fast as they can without lifting their heel. The other foot must remain still. − Wrist rotations: For this task, the hand is fully extended. Participants will be asked to alternate between having the palm fully up and fully down. This pattern will be repeated as quickly as possible. • Orthostatic vitals : Resting heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded after the participant has been seated for a few minutes. The participant will then be asked to stand, and blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded within the first 30 seconds and after an additional 3 minutes . • Visual acuity: A standard printed Snellen eye chart will be used with the participant 6 m away."

Hip flexion and knee extension strength are given a Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Grade from 0 to 5 for each side. Phonemic Fluency Phonemic fluency is a sensitive test for assessing frontal lobe dysfunction. The p articipants will be given a letter of the alphabet and asked to name as many words as they can that start with that letter, in 1 minute. LNS LNS is a test of working memory which involves ordering a series of up to seven letters and numbers in which the nu mbers are repeated back first in order starting with the lowest number, then followed by the letters in alphabetical order. For example, 3 - W - 5 should be repeated back as 3 - 5 - W. CTT The CTT is a language -free version of the Trail Making Test and was developed to allow for broader cross -cultural assessment. Numbered circles are printed with vivid pink or yellow backgrounds that are perceptible to color -blind individuals. For Part 1, the respondent uses a pencil to rapidly connect circles numbered 1 to 25, in sequence. For Part 2, the respondent rapidly connects numbered circles in sequence, but alternates between pink and yellow. The length of time to complete each trial is recorded, along with qualitative features of performance indicative of brain dysfunction, such as near -misses, prompts, number sequence errors, and color sequence errors. MoCA The MoCA [Nasreddine 2005 ] was designed as a rapid scree ning instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Time to administer the MoCA is approximately 10 minutes. EuroQol The EuroQol [Brooks 1996 ; Rabin and de Charro 2001 ; The EuroQol Group 1990 ] is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome. It assesses health -related quality of life in five dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The version of the instrument will be used to measure health -related quality of life for participants and/or caregivers as appropriate."

Follicle -stimulating hormone (screening only for women only) a Thyroxine and triiodothyronine were tested if thyroid -stimulating hormone result was abnormal . b Hepatitis C antibody RNA was tested if the hepatitis C antibody result was abnormal . 9.2.5. Suicidal Risk Monitoring BIIB092 is considered to be a central nervous system (CNS) -active study treatment . There has been some concern that some CNS -active study treatments may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior when given to some participants with certain conditions . Although this study treatment or other similar drugs in this class have not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to healthy volunteers or participants with PSP, Biogen considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical study. Participants being treated with BIIB092 should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior . Consideration should be given to discontinuing BIIB092 in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Families and caregivers of participants being treated with BIIB092 should be instructed to monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergen ce of suicidal ideation and behavior, and to report such symptoms immediately to the Study Investigator. Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be monitored during the study using th e Refer to Section 9.4 for more information. 9.2.6. Imaging Safety Assessment Any incidental findings of potential clinical relevance that are not directly associated with the objectives of the protocol should be evaluated and handled by the Study Investigator as per standard medical/clinical judgment. 9.3. Imaging Assessment for the Study MRI A central imaging vendor will perform imaging analyses. Image acquisition guidelines and submission processes will be outlined in the Study 251PP301 Imaging Manual to be provided by the core central imaging vendor.

Specifically, a three -dimensional MRI sequence with 1.0 x 1.0 x 1.2 mm isotropic voxels will be acquired according to the AD Neuroimaging Initiative recommendation. 1.5 T and 3.0 T MRI scanners will be employed in this study. The volumes of 7 brain structures of particular relevance in PSP (ventricles, whole brain, midbrain, pons, superior cerebellar peduncle, third ventricle and frontal lobes) will be measured. In addition, volumes of additional brain structures will also be measured (e.g., gray/white matter, cerebrum, cerebral cortex, frontal/parietal/temporal/occipital lobes, hippoc ampus, caudate nucleus, cerebellum, brainstem, medulla oblongata). In addition, fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 sequences will be performed to exclude new pathologies. All MRI scans will be locally and centrally read. Local reads should be performed to confirm eligibility. 9.4. Other Assessments"

ADVERSE EVENTS The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3. AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver or surroga te). The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to withdraw before completing the study. Contacts for SAE reporting are specified in Appendix 3. 10.1. Time Perio d and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study treatment and continue until end of study at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Section 6.6 in the Investigator’s Brochure represents the Reference Safety Information to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting . Following t he participant’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period, continuously throughout the study, and until 30 days following the last dose (see Table 2 and Table 3). • Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the appropriate s ection of the electronic case report form ( eCRF) section. • All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3. • The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of this being available. • Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study partici pants; however, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. • The method of evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and reporting/transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3. 10.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a participant . (In order to prevent reporting bias, participants should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)"

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization or reported as SAEs if they become serious (see Appendix 3). Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study treatment and for those present at the end of study treatment, as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic) . Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during the course of the study. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the participant is l ost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.4). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 10.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification from the Investigator to the Sponsor of SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met. An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing SAEs or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. The Sponsor will be reporting AEs to regulatory authorities and ethics committees according t o local applicable laws, including Eu ropean Directive 2001/20/EC and Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 CFR Parts 312 and 320 . A (suspected, unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is a subset of SAEs and will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities and Investigators following local and global guidelines and requirements. 10.5. Pregnancy Participants should not become pregnant or impregnate their partners for the duration of treatment with study treatment(s) BIIB092 plus 5 half -lives of study treatment BIIB092 plus 30 days for females (duration of ovulatory cycle) or 90 days for males (dur ation of sperm turnover) for a total of 155 days or 215 days for females and males, respectively. If a female participant becomes pregnant, study treatment must be discontinued immediately. The Investigator must report a pregnancy occurring in a female par ticipant by faxing or emailing the appropriate form to Biogen within 24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the pregnancy . Refer to the Study Contact List for complete contact information . The Investigator or site staff must report the outcome of the pregnancy to Biogen . A pregnancy is not considered an AE and should not be recorded on the AE CRF. Congenital abnormalities and birth defects in the offspring of male or female participants should be reported as an SAE if conception occurred during the st udy treatment period."

Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate . Paper forms are only intended as a back -up option when the electronic system is not functioning. • Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE • Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment discontinued or interrupted • Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term should be used by the reporting Investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 10.7. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is defined as follows : Aminotransaminases (ATs), including ALT or AST elevation >3 times ULN AND Total bilirubin >2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase), AND No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria must be reported as SAEs (see Section 10 and Appendix 3 for reporting details). 10.8. Other Safety Considerations Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, ECG, x -ray filming, or any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious AE or SAE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 10.9. Expectedness of Events Expectedness of all AEs will be determined by Biogen according to the Investigator’s Brochure. 10.10.

IMMUNOGENICITY ASSES SMENTS A validated immunoassay will be used to assay samples for the presence of, and measure titers of, anti -BIIB092 antibodies in serum on an ongoing basis in Study 251PP301 . Samples will be collected during the 52 -week double -blind period at Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24, Week 36, and Week 48 ( Table 2). In addition, samples will also be collected during the open - label extension period approximately every 24 weeks ( Table 3). All samples will be collected predose. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) titers will be monitored throughout the course of Study 251PP301 . If ADAs are observed, analyses will be conducted to assess impacts on safety, pharmacological, and efficacy measures across treated participants with and without ADAs . ADAs may also be assessed for neutralizing activity. Participants who withdraw from Study 251PP301 with ADA titers that are not stable or are increasing in two consecutive samples leading up to discontinuation will be asked to return for follow -up assessment approximately every 6 weeks for up to 24 weeks for measurement of ADAs and immunological AE assessment until resolve d (defined as two sequential samples showing no change or declining levels). Clinically relevant immune reactions (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions) will be treated according to current standard of care medical practice . Additional samples for immunogenicity assessments referred to as “event driven” samples may be justified on the basis of Grade 3 hypersensitivity reactions . The immunogenicity and corresponding drug exposure (PK) data from these samples will be reported a s part of a participant’s overall PK and immunogenicity assessment."

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 17.1. Sample Size Determin ation Approximately 459 participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive BIIB092 or placebo (306 participants in the BIIB092 treatment group and 153 in the placebo group) . Anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 25% (based on previous clinical studies in participants with PSP), approximately 345 participants (230 participants in the BIIB092 treatment group and 115 participants in the placebo group) are expected to complete the study through Week 52. Using a two -sided, two -sample t -test with an alpha level set at 0.05, this sample size will provide 80% power to detect a difference of 3.2 points in the change in PSPRS total score from baseline to Week 52 for BIIB092 relative to placebo, assuming a common standard deviation of 9.95 [Stamelou 2016 ] in the change in PSPRS total score from baseline to Week 52. 17.2. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled participants All participants who signed informed consent and were assigned a participant identification number Randomized participants Enrolled participants who received a randomization treatment assignment from the Interactive Response Tec hnology (BIIB092 or placebo) Treated participants Enrolled participants who received at least 1 dose of study treatment , i.e., blinded therapy (BIIB092 or placebo) or open - label BIIB092 Intention -to-treat (ITT) participants Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of blinded study treatment Cumulative BIIB092 - treated participants All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of BIIB092 during the double -blind and/or the open -label period. Additional analysis populations will be defined in the statistical analysis plan. 17.3. Handling of Missing Data Missing data patterns will be summarized. Percentage of participants who withdrew from the study over time through Week 52 will be summarized and graphically presented by (1) as randomized treatment group and reason for discontinuation, and (2) as randomiz ed treatment group and disease severity (split by the median of baseline PSPRS). Observed mean change from baseline in the primary endpoint will be summarized and graphically presented by treatment group and dropout pattern over time. Main analyses using a likelihood -based mixed model approach will based on the assumption of missing at random (MAR). Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will be conducted with missing data imputed by multiple imputation. Specifically, the multipl e imputation will be"

In addition, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA ) sensitivity analysis at Week 52 will be conducted for the primary using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method adjusted by historical progression; that is, missing PSPRS data will be imputed by assuming historical placebo progression (11.24 po ints/year) [Stamelou 2016 ] from the visit of the last observation prior to Week 52. 17.4. Statistical Analyses The statistica l analysis plan will be developed and finalized before database lock and will describe the selection of participants to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. Below is a summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. 17.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent -to-treat participants. Unless stated otherwise, all tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a two -sided significance level of 0.05. The primary efficacy analyses will be for comparative efficacy of BIIB092 to placebo in the double -blind treatment period (including all data through Week 52 for participants discontinuing study treatment during the double -blind period). De tails of the efficacy analyses for the open -label extension period will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary Changes from baseline in PSPRS will be analyzed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. The principal analysis of the primary endpoint will be a MMRM model that will include treatment, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, stratification factors as categorical fixed effects, baseline value of PSPRS as a continuous covariate, and baseline value of PSPRS -by-visit interaction. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -participant errors. If this analysis fails to converge, the following structure s will be tested in this order: the heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance structure, autoregressive model of order 1, and compound symmetric. The first covariance structure yielding convergence will be used."

Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will include the following analyses : • ANCOVA analysis at Week 52 using LOCF adjusted by historical placebo progression: The ANCOVA model will include treatment, stratification factors as categorical effects, and baseline value of PSPRS as continuous covariate. • MMRM analysis with missing data imputed by the CDC multiple imputation method. The specification of the MMRM model based on the imputed data will be the same as the primary MMRM model. • MMRM analysis with missing data imputed by the J2R multiple imputation method. The specification of the MMRM model based on the imputed data w ill be the same the primary MMRM model. • Responder analysis in which participants with missing data at Week 52 will be treated as non -responders. • Subscales of the PSPRS will be summarized over time descriptively. • Additional analysis may be performed with de tails specified in the statistical analysis plan. Key Secondary • If the primary analysis finds that participants treated with BIIB092 performed significantly better than placebo, the key secondary endpoints will be analyzed hierarchically in the following order: MDS -UPDRS Part II, CGI-C, RBANS, and PSP-QoL. • The testing procedure will maintain an alpha level of 0.05 at each level of the hierarchy and ensures the preservation of the overall type I error at 0.05. Non-Key Secondary • Non-key secondary endpoints will be tested at an uncontrolled alpha level of 0.05 per endpoint . The p-values resulting from these analyses will be considered as nominal and descriptive in nature. Exploratory • Will be described in the statistical analysis plan."

Safety Analyses Safety analyses will be performed by as -treated treatment group for treated participants . Safety endpoints include the frequency and proportion of participants with AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuations and deaths , and other significant AEs reported on case report forms . Other safety endpoints include laboratory abnormalities, changes in laboratory parameters, changes in vital signs, physical findings, and ECGs. In general, AE presentations will be by system organ c lass and preferred term. The primary safety analyses will be for comparative safety of BIIB092 to placebo in the double -blind treatment period . Safety endpoints will include data up to the start of the open -label extension period for participants who completed the double -blind treatment period and continue into the open -label extension, or up to last dosing date plus 30 days for participants disco ntinuing study treatment during the double -blind treatment period. Additional safety analyses will include all events reported through the time of database lock for the cumulative BIIB092 -treated participants . Safety endpoints will include data from the fi rst dose of BIIB092 in the study up to the last dose of BIIB092 treatment in the study plus 30 days. 17.4.3. Interim Analysis An interim analysis for superiority may be performed before the last participant has had the opportunity to complete the Week 52 visit . An alpha spending function approach will be used for the analysis . In order to maintain the treatment blind in the event of this interim analysis, an independent group external to Biogen that will not be involved in the conduct of the study after unblinding will perform the interim superiority analysis . The independent group will present the unblinded interim analysis to the DMC . The aim of this interim analysis is to allow the possibility to demonstrate treatment effect early . The analysis (including the det ails of the alpha spending approach) will be discussed in the statistical analysis plan. 17.5. Other Analyses 17.5.1. PK and PD Analyses PK and PD analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan . The population PK analysis and PD analyses will be presented s eparately from the main clinical study report. 17.5.2. Immunogenicity Analyses Immunogenicity analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan. 17.5.3. Biomarker Analyses Biomarker analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan."

ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVER SE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING Adverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An adverse event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation participant administered study treatment and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment , whether or not considered related to the study treatment . Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose Results in death Is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) Requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization (see NOTE below) NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in Biogen clinical studies: • a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours, that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life-threatening event) • elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent • admissions as pe r protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure • routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g., routine colonoscopy)"

Appropriate documentation is required in these cases • admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason) • admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs (applies to oncology protocols) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention [e.g., medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event . (See Section 10.7 for the definition of potential DILI.) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study treatment is an SAE. Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential DILI are not always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs . (See Section 10.5 for reporting pregnancies). Any component of a study endpoint that is considered related to study treatment should be reported as SAE (e.g., death is an endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported). Evaluating AEs and SAEs The causal relationship to study treatment is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all AEs . The causal relationship can be one of the following: • Related: An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation . Factors that point toward this assessment include but are not limited to a positive rechal lenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the IP and the AE, a known response pattern of the suspected product, improvement following discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the product and the AE, or a lack of an alternative explanation for the AE. • Not related: An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by the product under"

Factors pointing toward this assessment include but are not limited to the lack of reasonable temporal relationship between administration of the IP and the AE, the presence of a biologically implausible relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a mor e likely alternative explanation for the AE. Reporting of SAEs to Sponsor Follow -up of AEs and SAEs If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports must include the same Investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study treatment or if new information becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to Biogen using the same pro cedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization. • SAEs, whether related or not related to study treatment, and pregnancies must be reported to Biogen within 24 hours of awareness of the event. • SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Notification and Outcome Form (electronic or paper forms). • The preferred method for SAE data reporting collection is through the electronic case report form (eCRF). • The paper SAE/pregnancy notification and outcome forms are only intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning. o In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to: SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.

WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITIONS AND METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION Definitions Woman o f Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently sterile . Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. Wome n in the following categories are not considered WOCBP • Premenarchal • Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: − Documented hysterectomy − Documented bilateral salpingectomy − Documented bilateral oophorectomy Note : Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. • Postmenopausal female − A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes . In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle - stimulating hormone, (FSH) level >40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause. Note : Females treated with hormone replacement therapy, (HRT) are likely to have artificially suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH level . The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used . The duration of the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the Investigators should use their judgement in checking serum FSH levels. • 1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels) • 4 week minimum for transdermal products • 8 week minimum for oral products Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 months . If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/mL at any time during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal."

Local laws and regulations may require use of alternative and/or additional contraception methods. Contr aceptive methods that are approved for use during and for 155 days after participation in this study are: Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.a • Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb − oral − intravaginal − transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb − oral − injectable Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent • Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb • Intrauterine device (IUD)c • Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)c • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomized partner A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed . If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. • Sexual abstinence Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relati on to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. • It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected. • WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified in Section 10.5. • Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence"

Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment , which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method . Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous . In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. c Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter contraception effectiveness. Unacceptable Methods of Contraception • Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) • Withdrawal (coitus interruptus) • Spermicide only • Lactation amenorrhea method (LAM) CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR MALE PARTICIPANTS WITH PARTNER(S) OF CHILD BEARING POTENTIAL. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the treatment and until the end of r elevant systemic exposure. • Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to comply with contraception instructions as directed by the Investigator. No additional contraceptive measures are required to be used.

The neuropathological hallmark of PSP is the presence of neurofibrillary tangles i n clinically correlated regions of the brain, including the basal ganglia, diencephalon, brainstem, and cerebellum with restricted involvement of the neocortex [Dickson 2010] . The tangles are composed of tau, an intracellular microtubule- associated protein , of which fragments may also be released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial space as N-terminal tau [Bright 2015, Guo 2017]. Tau dysfunction is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiology of PSP, both by causing neuronal dysfunction via tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles and by facilitating cell to cell spreading of tau pathology via secreted N -terminal tau. BIIB092 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to amino acid residues 15 to 22 of N -terminal tau, removing it from the CSF. It is hypothesized that BIIB092 - mediated depletion of N -terminal tau will inhibit the spread of tau pathology, potentially slowing the progression of PSP. This would be expected to translate into important improvements in function , activities of daily living, health outcomes, and overall quality of life for patients living with PSP. immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 that recognizes human extracellular tau (eTau). It is currentl y being evaluated as a treatment for Progressive Supranuclear Pal sy (PSP). Although tau is primaril y an intracellular protein, a small amount of tau is secreted. eTau refers to the extracellular, soluble fragments of tau that contain an intact amino terminal and are truncated prior to the beginning of the first microtu bule binding domain of tau. eTau produces disruptions in neuronal activity in vitro. eTau is believed to play two roles in the pathophy siology of PSP. First, eTau may cause neuronal dy sfunction directly , and second, eTau may be partiall y responsible for the spreading of tau pathology that is observed in human tauopathies, such as PSP. PSP is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by atypical Parkinsonism for which there are no approved or effective treatments. At autops y, insoluble tau aggregates are found throughout the brain within neurons and glia, most notably in the brainstem, deep cerebellar nuclei, basal ganglia, and neocortex [Dickson 2012; Dickson 2010; Steele 1964] . Symptoms of PSP include early and severe gait instability with falls, great er slowing of vertical than horizontal saccadic eye movements, slowe d movement, rigidit y of the axial musculature, dysphagia, d ysarthria, pseudobulbar affect, neuropsy chiatric abnormalities, and dementia [Boxer 2014; Golbe 2014; Steele 1964]. Survival tim e from s ymptom onset for PSP patients ranges from 5.3 to 9.7 y ears with a ty pical figure of 7.4 y ears from sy mptom onset. PSP has a prevalence ranging between 1 to 9 cases per 100,000 individuals. The mean age of diagnosis is around 63 y ears[Boxer 2014; Golbe, 2014; Nath 2001] . No medication s have been approved for PSP. There is a significant"

In a transgenic mouse tauopathy model, the mur ine analog of BIIB092 slowed the progression of locomotor impairment and limited the spreading of tau pathology. In non human primates, BIIB092 reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of free eTau. Administration of single doses of BIIB092 is sa fe and well tolerated in normal health y volunteers (NHVs). In addition, administration of multiple doses of BIIB092 is safe and well tolerated in participants with PSP. I n both NHVs and participants with PSP, BIIB092 reduces CSF concentrations of free eTau in a dose dependent fashion. These findings suggest that BIIB092 may have utility for the treatment of human tauopathies, such as PSP. Rationale: Clarified the terminology , background, and rationale in using BIIB092 as a treatment for PSP. Clarified th at the amino acid residues involved in BIIB092 were corrected from “15 to 24” to “15 to 22” . Section 3.3, Benefit/R isk Assessment Change: The number of subjects who have been exposed to BIIB092 hasbeen updated . Now reads: BIIB092 is a humanized IgG4 isoty pe antibody that is considered to have a low potential for immunogenicit y in humans based on nonclinical studies. There were no adverse effects noted at any dose tested in the pivotal toxicity studies in monkey s. Nonclinica l findings were limited to decreases in CSF unbound N -terminal tau consistent with the intended pharmacology of BIIB092. In completed clinical study CN002001, there was no consistent trend showing a potential effect of anti -drug antibody (ADA) on the PK of BIIB092. In completed clinical study CN002003, there was no apparent dose -related trend in the number of subjects with positive immunogenicity results post -treatment. Studies evaluating the potential for reproductive and developmental toxicity have not be en performed for BIIB092. As of July 31, 2017, 114 subjects25 November 2018, an estimated 486 participants have been exposed to BIIB092 across all completed (S tudies CN002001 and CN002003) and ongoing clinical studies (Studies CN002001, CN002003, 251PP201, and251PP301 ). , and 251AD201). Based on safet y data from a completed Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (Study CN002001) and a completed Phase 1B study in participants with PSP (Study CN002003), the majority of adverse events (AEs) reported to date have been mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. There have been no deaths or discontinuations due to an AE reported in the program. There have been 4 serious AEs (SAEs) reported in 3 participants in Study CN002003, all of which were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator benefit -risk profile of BIIB092 was favorable to support further clinical development . Rationale: Updated the information based on clinical trial exposure and safet y data available as of 25 November 2018, to provide the most recent information ."

Now reads: Section 5.2. Substudy Design This study includes an optional substudy to measure QMAs using wearable sensors. The QMAs will measure gait, postural instability, motor function, and falls in a subset of participants participating in the long -term extension period. Study participants included in this substudy will be from selected countries, and participants will be required to ambulate independently or with assistive devices. Participants will participate in the QMA substudy for 6 months, with in -clinic assessments of gait, postural instability, and motor function conducted every 3 months. Falls will be assessed continuously in the home using wearable sensors for 6 months to capture and quantify falls. The QMA substudy baseline visit will be conducted after participants sign the informed consent form and are eligible to enroll in the substudy. Two follow -up visits will be conducted at 3 and 6 months after the baseline visit of the QMA substudy. If a participant at a selected site is unwilling to participate in the QMA substudy, they can still participate in the open -label extension study. Rationale: The QMA substudy in the open -label extension period was added to further characterize disease progression with wearable sensors. Postural instability , gait disturbances, and falls are prominent signs of PSP that affect participant outcomes. At present, these signs are assessed in the clinic with questionnaires. It is anticipated that advances in wearable sensor technology and analy tics coul d improve quantification of these signs and may provide sensitive measures of disease progression.

In the case of pregnancy , the I nvestigator must immediat ely notify the Medical Monitor of this event . In the event a normal healthy female participant becomes pregnant during a clinical trial, theandstudy treatment must be discontinued immediately . In most cases, the study treatment will be permanentl y disco ntinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for participant safety ). Please call the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy . If the Investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussion between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor/designee must occur. All participants who discontinue study treatment should comply with protocol specified follow up procedures as outlined in Section 2. The only exception to this requirement is when a participant withdraws consent for all study procedures including post treatment study follow up or loses the ability to consent freel y (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of eithe r a ps ychiatric or ph ysical illness). If study treatment is discontinued prior to the participant’s completion of the study , the reason for the discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the appropriate case repo rt form ( CRF )page. 8.2 Study Follow Up In this stud y, safety is a key endpoint of the stud y.

AE collec tion should continue until the end of study or withdrawal from the study. At any point after discontinuing study treatment, if the participant makes the decision to withdraw from the study (Section 8.2), the following should be done: Early Discontinuation visit procedures (Table 2 )should be completed . Participants and/or caregivers should receive a follow- up phone call approximately 30days after last dose discontinuation of study treatment to collect relevant clinical information, including, but not limited to safety data (i.e., AEs, SAEs) and vital status (e.g., ability to ambulate, cognitive disability , speech, dy sphagia, dependence on wheelchair for mobility , placement in residential care, and death). If possible, participants who discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to return to the clinic at Week 52 to complete Week 52 visit procedures. If the visit cannot be done in person by the participant, the site should attempt a phone call at approximately Week 52 to collect at a minimum vital status and SAE/AE information on the participant. For participants who discontinue study treatment during the open label extension period of the study (after Week 52): Early Discontinuation visit procedures (Table 3 ) should be completed. Participants and/or caregivers should receive a follow up phone call approximately 30days after last dose to collect relevant clinical information, including but not limited to , safety data (i.e., AEs, SAEs) and vital status (e.g., ability to ambulate, cognitive disability , speech, dy sphagia, dependence on wheelchair for mobility , placement in residential care, and death ) Post study follow up is of critical importance and is essential to preserving participant safety and the integrit y of the study.

New text is shown in bold ty pe; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough . Section 17.1, Sample Size Determination Now reads: Approximately 396459 participants will be randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive BIIB092 or placebo ( 264306 participants in the BIIB092 treatment group and 132153 in the placebo group). Anticipating a dropout rate of approximately 25% (based on previous clinical studies in participants with PSP), approximately 297345 participants ( 198230 participants in the BI IB092 treatment group and 99115participants in the placebo group) are expected to complete the study through Week 52. Using a two -sided, two- sample t -test, with an alpha level set at 0.05, this sample size will provide 9080% power to detect a difference o f 4.03.2points in the change in PSPRS total score from baseline to Week 52 for BIIB092 relative to placebo, assuming a common standard deviation of 9.95 [Stamelou 2016] in the change in PSPRS total score from baseline to Week 52. Rationale: Preliminary market research conducted with experts in the field indicates that a difference of 2.5 to 3.5 points in the primary efficacy endpoint ( the Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Rating Score [PSPRS] )would represent a clinically meaningful treatment effect at 52weeks. The sample size has been increased b y approximately 15% to improve the estimated power of the stud y to detect a between -treatment difference in PSPRS of that magnitude . This change also affects Section 5.1, Overall Design (including Figure 1); and Section 5.3, Number of Participants."

New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough. Section 1, Sy nopsis The Sy nopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol. Section 4, Study Objectives and Endpoints Change: Efficacy and safet y objectives and endpoints for the open- label extension period were added. Now reads: Open -Label Extension Period To assess the long -term safety and tolerability of BIIB092 in participants with PSP.The tertiary endpoint will be incidence of AEs, SAEs, and SAEs accompanied by death. To assess the long -term efficacy of BIIB092 in participants with PS P.The tertiary endpoints will be change from baseline over the placebo -controlled period and long -term extension period for clinical and health- outcomes assessments. Rationale: T he objectives and endpoints of the extension p eriod were not previously stated. Section 6.4.1, Retesting During Screening or Lead- In Period Change: Improper reference to “re -enrollment” of participants who failed a previous s creening was c orrected, and the role of the Medical Monitor in determining testing requirements for re- screening was made clear. Now reads: Participant Re- enrollment screening: This study permits the re -enrollment screening of a participant that who has discontinued the study as a pre treatment failure screen -failed up to 2times ( i.e., participant hwas not been randomized / has not been ortreated). If re - enrolledscreened , the participant must be re- consented. The assessments to be conducted on re-screening will depend upon how much time passed since the previous Screening Visit. Please contact the Medical Monitor for guidance regarding the acceptability of any previous assessments completed."

These changes to the protocol are presented chronologically . New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough. Section 2, Schedule of Acti vities (Table 1, Notes) Change: The responsibility of the caregiver to accompany the participant to s tudy visits was clarified in the Notes to the table. Now reads: Informed Consent for Caregiver XCaregiver is defined as theatperson that who accom panie s participant to all/most study visits and has frequent contact with participant of at least 3 hours per week at one time or at different times. Only one caregiver can be designated for participant at a given time. At a minimum, caregiver should personal ly attend the following study visits: Screening, Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 52, and Early Discontinuation. Although caregiver assessments cannot be conducted by telephone, caregiver should be available for telephone consultation regarding inform ation on AEs and SAEs when not otherwise attending a scheduled visit. Rationale: This revision is intended to make certain that the caregiver is clearl y advised of the importance of their commitment to proper conduct of the study . This change also affects Table 3 (Extension Period Procedural Outline) and Section 6.1 (Inclusion Criteria, 1dand 2g). Section 2, Schedule of Activities (Table 1, Footnote a) Change: The timeframe during which Screening procedures may be conducted was clarified. Now reads: aScreening procedures may be conducted Wwithin 42 days prior to first dose unless otherwise specified. Rationale: This revision is intended to make certain that the Investigator is advised of flexibility regarding the completion of Screening procedures. Section 2, Schedule of Activities (Table 2, Notes) Change: The duration of BIIB092 infusion was clarified. Now reads:"

Rationale: This revision is intended to make certain that the Investigator is advised that the infusion is not required to be completed within approximately 60minutes. This change also affects Section 2 (Schedule of Activities, Table 3, Notes) and Section 11 (Pharmacokinetic, Ta ble 7 , Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule ). Section 2, Schedule of Activities (Table 2, Footnotes a&b) Change: The f lexibility associated with the conduct of certain study visits was stated more explicitly . Now reads: aEfficacy assessments requiring subject participant participation involvement should be completed prior to dosing with study treatment unless otherwise specified in the notes .; specific attention should be paid to conducting the Week 24 MRI within 7 days prior to the Week 24 dosing visit. The study visits at Weeks 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 52, and Early Discontinuation, which involve the conduct of efficacy assessments, may be completed over a period of up to 3 consecutive days. bWeeks 28, 32 ,40, and 44 Mmay qualify for home visit if appropr iate. See Section 5.1 for details. Rationale: Th esechanges are intended to facilitate the completion of certain study visits and improve procedural conformity regarding those visits involving efficacy assessments. Section 5.5.2, Rationale for Inclusion of Key Change: The need for compliance with local regulatory and institutional requirements in the practice of and pharmacogenetic analysis was explicitly recognized. Now reads: All participants will have blood collected for assessment of serum concentrations of determined at baseline and at regular intervals during the study to confirm target engagement. In addition Where local regulations and institutional ap provals allow , a deox yribonucleic acid (DNA) sample will be collected prepared to support future studies examining the relationship between H1 and H2 haploty pes on tau protein levels. Rationale: This change was made to formalize recognition of jurisdictio nal differences in the acceptability of collecting biological samples for exploratory research and the rights of participants who may choose to provide those samples."

Now reads: a.Participants , or a legally authorized representative (where local regulations and institutional practices permit), must have signed and dated an Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RB/IEC) approved written informed consent form in accordance with regulatory and institutional guidelines. This must b e obtained before the performance of an y protocol -related procedures that are not part of normal subject participant care. j.If participant is receiving coenzy me Q10, levodopa/carbidopa, levodopa/benserazide, fava bean extract, a dopamine agonist, catechol -0O-methy ltransferase inhibitor, amantadine, or other Parkinson’s disease medications, the dose must have been stable for at least 60 day s prior to screening baseline and expected to remain stable for the double- blind period of the study . k.Stable on other chronic medications for at least 30 day s prior to screening baseline . Rationale: The intent of th echange in criterion 1 ais to allow for the involvement of those participants who can no longer consent freely due to progression of disease ; the intent of the change in criteria 2jand 2 kis to avoid unnecessary screening failures by allowing additional time to stabilize the dosing of chronic medications. Section 6.2, Exclusion Criteria Change: Under Subsection 1 (Medical Conditions), 4criteria were revised (a, e, l, and q) and 1criterion was added ( w); under Subsection 2(Prior/Concomitant Therap y), 2criteria were revised ( aand b); and, under Subsection 3 (Phy sical a nd Laboratory Test Findings), 1 criterion was deleted ( i). Now reads: 1.Medical Conditions a.Presence of other significant neurological or ps ychiatric disorders including (but not limited to) Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies; prion disease, Parkinson's disease (which has not subsequently been revised to a diagnosis of PSP); any psychotic disorder; severe bipolar or unipolar depression; prior history of suicidal thoughts or behavior that are believed to represent a current safet y risk; seizure; brain tumor or other space -occupy ing lesion; history of clinically significant stroke (e.g., stroke with neurologic aldeficit ); history of head injury with loss o f consciousness for at least 15minutes within the past 20 y ears."

Section 3.2 Background Change: More current information on some of the studies was added. Now reads: BIIB092 was first introduced into clinical trials in the P hase 1 trial sconducted in the United States (US) , Study CN002001 in healthy adult volunteers and. The Phase 1b PSP study (Study CN002003) in subjects with PSP. and corresponding roll over study (CN002004) are ongoing in the US. Preliminary data available Results from the first -in-human study , CN002001, indicate that administration of single doses of up to 4200 mg of BIIB092 in healthy subjects is safe and well tolerated. Mean suppression of the CSF eTau in that study ranged from 67% to 97% at doses rangin g from 70 mg to 4200 mg. Study CN002003 was a Phase 1b randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, MAD study to characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of BIIB092 doses of 150 mg, 700 mg and 2100 mg in subjects with PSP. All 3 doses were safe and well tolerated based on results from the dose escalation phase of the study. Treatment with monthly doses of BIIB092 decreased CSF free eTau by mean values of approximately 90%, 93% and 96% on Day 29 and 91%, 95% and 97% on Day 85 at d oses of 150 mg, 700 mg and 2100 mg respectively. Study 251PP201 is an ongoing open -label extension study to evaluate the long term safety and tolerability of multiple doses of BIIB092 in subjects with PSP who participated in CN002003. Studies CN002003 and CN002004, Phase 1b study in participants with PSP and the associated roll over study , are currently ongoing to evaluate the safet y, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of multiple doses of BIIB092. Preliminary data indicate that multiple doses of 150 , 700 , and 2100 mg of BIIB092 are safe and well tolerated, with an apparent dose proportional increase in exposures, and a robust and persistent lowering of free eTau consistent with the observations in healthy participants. Rationale: Updated status and general results on safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of completed clinical trials were available."

Now reads: The overall benefit/risk profile of BIIB092 in several nonclinical studies, the single dose study in normal health y volunteers (CN002001), as well as the multiple dose study and associated roll over study open label extension study (Studies CN002003 and CN002004 [ Study 251PP201]) support further eva luation of the safet y, tolerability, immunogenicit y, PK, PD response, and clinical efficacy of BIIB092 in participants with PSP. BIIB092 is an IgG4 isotype antibody that is considered to have a low potential for immunogenicit y in humans based on nonclinica l studies. There were no adverse effects noted at any dose tested in the pivotal toxicity studies in monkey s. Nonclinical findings were limited to decreases in CSF free eTau consistent with the intended pharmacology of BIIB092 . Studies evaluating the poten tial for reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed for BIIB092 . As of July 31, 2017, 114 subjects have been exposed to BIIB092 across all completed and ongoing clinical studies (Studies CN002001, CN002003, 251PP201 and 251PP301). Bas ed on safety data from a completed Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers (CN002001) and a completed Phase 1B study in subjects with PSP (Study CN002003), the majority of AEs reported to date have been mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. There have been no deaths or discontinuations due to an AE reported in the program. There have been 4 SAEs reported in 3 subjects in the CN002003 study, all of which were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. Based on preliminary data from the CN002001 study and still ongoing studies CN002003 and CN002004, observed AEs to date have mostly been mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. AEs considered related to the study drug by the investigator were belching, nausea, headache, and flushing. One AE of headache and one AE of diverticulitis were considered moderate; all other AEs were considered mild. Four (4) SAEs considered not related to study drug b y the investigator have been reported to date in three (3) participants; one SAE was a urinary tract infection requiring hospitalization, one SAE was an aspiration pneumonia requiring hospitalization; the other two SAEs were aspiration pneumonia and a related metabolic encephalopath y in the same participant requiring hospitalizatio n. Overall, there were no apparent BIIB092 treatment related trends observed in the occurrences of AEs. There is no information available about possible interaction of BIIB092 with other drugs, although no PK interactions are anticipated. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y anticipated AEs of BIIB092 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. However, as BIIB092 is an experimental agent, it is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or unan ticipated reactions may occur."
172,page_172,"Protocol 251PP301 , Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published w ithout the written consent of Biogen MAInc. 8Rationale: Clinical experience text was updated to include results from Study CN002003 and align with the Investigator’s Brochure. Section 5.1 Overall Design Change: The responsibility of approving in -home administration of the study treatment was changed . Now reads: In the open -label portion of the study , visits occurring at 4, 8, 16 and 20 week intervals after Week 52, may qualify for a home visit starting with the Week 68 visit. However, in the event that the participant experienced a clinically significant infusion reaction during the first 24 weeks of the protocol, the participant should not be administered BIIB092 in the home unless previously approved by the study Medical Monitor Investigator . Rationale: The Investigator, and not the Medical Monitor, is the person who approves in -home administration of BIIB092. Section 5.6 Justification for Dose Change: Update for which dose data will be accrued. Now reads: In the SAD study in normal healthy volunteers (CN002001), single doses of BIIB092 were safe and well tolerated at all doses tested (i.e., 21 mg to 4200 mg). A maximum tolerated dose was not identified. Robust suppression of free eTau in CSF (88% to 97%) was observed for at least 4 weeks after a single dose, compared to baseline, in the dose range of 210 mg to 4200 mg. The MAD study in participants with PSP (CN002003) assessed Q4W doses of BIIB092 of 150 mg, 700 mg and 2100 mg during the dose escalation phase of the study . All three doses were safe and well tolerated in participants with PSP, based on preliminary results from the dose escalation phase of the stud y. Preliminary results also showed robust suppression of free eTau in CSF at the end of the first 4 week dosing interval, with 89%, 93%, and 97% suppression relative to baseline for 150 mg, 700 mg, and 2100 mg, respectively. Treatment with monthly doses of BIIB092 decreased CSF free eTau by mean values of approximately 90%, 93% and 96% on Day 29 and 91%, 95% and 97% on Day 85 at doses of 150 mg, 700 mg and 2100 mg respectively. Based on the near maximal suppression of eTau and the lack of an y noteworth y findings on safet y and tolerability of BIIB092, at the maximum dose of 2100 mg Q4W studied during the escalation phase of the study , the dose for the ex pansion panel in Study CN002003 was chosen to be continued at 2100 mg Q4W. Additional data on safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD of the 2100 mg all 3 dose levels areaccruing with the expansion panel open label extension of this study . Rationale: Additional data on safet y, tolerability , PK, and PD are accruing for all 3 doses of study treatment, not just in the 2100- mg dose group in the open -label extension panel.

Randomization will be stratified by country and screening Color Trails Test Part 2 stratum of a score either less than or equal to 170 seconds or greater than 170 seconds. Randomization will only be stratified by screening Color Trails Test Part 2 stratum under the IRT system for protocol Version 1 . To promote treatment balance within each country, randomization will be stratified by both country and screening Color Trails Test Part 2 when the new IRT system for this protocol is in place. Rationale: The randomization scheme was amended to include countr y as an additional stratification factor. Text was added to clarify that stratification by country will not occur until the programming in I RT is updated to V1.3. Section 8.3, L ost to Follow -Up Change: Section 8.3 was revised to reflect alignment with p rocesses at Biogen for patients lost to follow -up. Now reads: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow- up with persons authorized b y the participant. Lost to follow -up is defined by the inability to reach the participant after a minimum of three documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical re cords. If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain date and cause of death. If investigator’s use of a third party representative to assist in the follow up portion of the study has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor retained third party representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated contact information. If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow-up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s medical records."

To date, the third part y vendor services have not been required to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s contact information or other public vital status data n ecessary to complete the follow- up portion of the study . Section 10 , Adverse Events Change: Section 10 text was revised. Now reads: Pregnancy Subjects should not become pregnant or impregnate their partners during the study and for 5 times the half -life or 6 months, whichever is longer, after their last dose of study treatment. If a female subject becomes pregnant, study treatment must be discontinued immediately. The Investigator must report a pregnancy occurring in a female subject by faxing o r emailing the appropriate form to Biogen within 24 hours of the site staff becoming aware of the pregnancy. Refer to the Study Contact List for complete contact information. The Investigator or site staff must report the outcome of the pregnancy to Biog en. A pregnancy is not considered an AE and should not be recorded on the AE CRF. Congenital abnormalities and birth defects in the offspring of male or female subjects should be reported as an SAE if conception occurred during the study treatment period. If, following initiation of the study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a participant is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 5 half lives after product administration, the investigator mu st immediatel y notify the Medical Monitor of this event and complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form to the Medical Monitor or their designee within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in A ppendix 3 In most cases, the stud y treatment will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (e.g., dose tapering if necessary for participant safety ). Please call the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy . Protocol requir ed procedures for stud y discontinuation and follow up must be performed on the participant. Follow up information regarding the course of the pregnancy , including perinatal and neonatal outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to Sponsor or designee. In order for Sponsor or designee to collect an y pregnancy surveillance information from the female part ner, the female partner must sign an informed consent form for"

I nformation on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) isdefined as: AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND Total bilirubin > 2times ULN,without initial findings ofcholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase), AND Noother immediately apparent possible causes ofATelevation andhyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to,viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic oracute liver disease, orthe administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined cr iteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 9 10 Appendix 3 for reporting details). Expectedness of Events Expectedness of all AEs will be determined by Biogen according to the Investigator’s Brochure. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that are unexpected and judged by the Investigator or Biogen to be related to the study treatment administered. Appropriate personnel at Biogen will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulato ry reporting. Biogen will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Biogen will submit SUSARs to Investigators in a blinded fashion. Overdose An overdose is any dose of study treatment administered to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose assigned to the subject according to the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and faxed or emailed to Biogen within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to Biogen even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded. If an overdose results in a n SAE, both the SAE and Overdose forms must be completed and faxed or emailed to Biogen. All study treatment- related dosing information must be recorded on the dosing CRF. Medical Emergency In a medical emergency requiring immediate attention, site staff will apply appropriate medical intervention, according to current standards of care. The Investigator (or"

Refer to the Study Contact List for complete contact information. Unblinding for Medical Emer gency In a medical emergency when knowledge of the subject’s treatment assignment may influence the subject’s clinical care, the Investigator may access the subject’s treatment assignment by IRT. The Investigator must document the reasons for unblinding i n the subject’s source documents. The Investigator is strongly advised not to divulge the subject’s treatment assignment to any individual not directly involved in managing the medical emergency, or to personnel involved with the analysis and conduct of the study. The Investigator can contact Biogen to discuss such situations. Deaths Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. All causes of death must be reported as SAEs within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. The Investigator should make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to Biogen. The term death should be reported as an SAE only if the cause of death is not known and cannot be determ ined.

New text is shown in bold type; deleted text is shown with a strikethrough. Section 1, Synopsis The synopsis was revised to reflect changes made throughout the protocol. Section 3.3, Benefit/Risk Assessment Change: Section 3.3 was updated. Now reads: The overall benefit/risk profile of BIIB092 in several nonclinical studi es, the single dose study in normal healthy volunteers (CN002001), as well as the multiple dose study and associated roll over study (Studies CN002003 and CN002004 [Study 251PP201]) support further evaluation of the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK, PD response, and clinical efficacy of BIIB092 in participants with PSP. BIIB092 is an IgG4 isotype antibody that is considered to have a low potential for immunogenicity in humans based on nonclinical studies. There were no adverse effects noted at any dose tested in the pivotal toxicity studies in monkeys. Nonclinical findings were limited to decreases in CSF free eTau consistent with the intended pharmacology of BIIB092 . Studies evaluating the potential for reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed for BIIB092 . As of July 31, 2017, 114 subjects have been exposed to BIIB092 across all completed and ongoing clinical studies (Studies CN002001, CN002003, 251PP201 and 251PP301). Based on safety data from a completed Phase 1 studies in h ealthy volunteers (CN002001) and a completed Phase 1B study in subjects with PSP (Study CN002003), the majority of AEs reported to date have been mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. There have been no deaths or discontinuations due to an AE reported in the program. There have been 4 SAEs reported in 3 subjects in the CN002003 study, all of which were considered not related to study drug by the Investigator. Based on preliminary data from the CN002001 study and still ongoing studies CN002003 and CN002004, observed AEs to date have mostly been mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. AEs considered related to the study drug by the investigator were belching, nausea, headache, and flushing. One AE of headache and one AE of diver ticulitis were considered moderate; all other AEs were considered mild. Four (4) SAEs considered not related to study drug by the investigator have been reported to date in three (3) participants; one SAE was a urinary tract infection requiring hospitaliza tion, one SAE was an aspiration pneumonia requiring"

This text was added to address drug supply transition from BMS-labeled drug product to Biogen-labeled drug product and convey in the protocol that the two drug names are synonymous with one another. Section 8.3, Lost to Follow- Up Change: Section 8.3 was revised to reflect alignment with processes at Biogen for patients lost to follow- up. Now reads:"
197,page_197,"Protocol 251PP301, Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL The information contained herein may not be used, disclosed, or published without the written consent of Biogen MA Inc. 9 1.1. Lost to Follow -Up • All reasonable efforts must be made to locate participants to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow -up with persons authorized by the participant. • Lost to follow -up is defined by the inability to reach the participant after a minimum of three documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by participant to one regist ered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical records. • If it is determined that the participant has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain date and cause of death. • If investigator’s use of a third party representative to assist in the follow up portion of the study has been included in the participant’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor retained third party representative to assist site staff with obtaining participant’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow up portion of the study. • The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain updated c ontact information. If after all attempts, the participant remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the participant’s medical records. Rationale: The site Principal Investigator or designee will make every reasonable effort to contact any patient lost to follow up, a third party vendor will not be required to manage these activities. To date, the third party vendor services have not been required to assist site staff w ith obtaining participant’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up portion of the study. Section 10, Adverse Events Change: Section 10 was revised to reflect compatibility with safety processes at Biogen. Now reads: 1.2. Pregnancy Subjects should not become pregnant or impregnate their partners during the study and for 5 times the half- life or 6 months, whichever is longer, after their last dose of study treatment. If a female subject becomes pregnant, study treatment must be discontinued immediately."

Refer to the Study Contact List for complete contact information. The Investigator or site staff must report the outcome of the pregnancy to Biogen. A pregnancy is not considered an AE and should not be recorded on the AE CRF. Congenital abnormalities and birth defects in the offspring of male or female subjects should be reported as an SAE if conception occurred during the study treatment period. 1.3. Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities The following laboratory test result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF page or SAE Report Form electronic, as appropriate. Paper forms are only intended as a back-up option when the electronic system is not functioning. • Any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE • Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to have study treatment discontinued or interrupted • Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the participant to receive specific corrective therapy It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 1.4. Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is defin ed as: AT (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase), AND No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevation and hyperbilirubinemia, including, but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.

Other Safety Considerations Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiogram, x -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not required by protocol should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and reported accordingly. 1.6. Expectedness of Events Expectedness of all AEs will be determined by Biogen according to the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.7. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SAEs that are unexpected and judged by the Investigator or Biogen to be related to the study treatment administered. Appropriate personnel at Biogen will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Biogen will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Biogen will submit SUSARs to Investigators in a blinded fashion. 1.8. Overdose An overdose is any dose of stud y treatment administered to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds the dose assigned to the subject according to the protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE on the CRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and faxed or emailed to Biogen within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be reported to Biogen even if the overdose does not result in an AE. If an overdose results in an AE, the AE must be recorded. If an overdose results in an SAE, both the SAE and Overdose forms must be completed and faxed or emailed to Biogen. All study treatment -related dosing information must be recorded on the dosing CRF. 1.9. Medical Emergency In a medical emergency requiring imm ediate attention, site staff will apply appropriate medical intervention, according to current standards of care. The Investigator (or designee) should contact the study’s Medical Director. Refer to the Study Contact List for complete contact information . 1.10.

The Investigator must document the reasons for unblinding in the subject’s source documents. The Investigator is strongly advised not to divulge the subject’s treatment assignment to any individual not directly involved in managing the medical emergency, or to personnel involved with the analysis and conduct of the study. The Investigator can contact Biogen to discuss such situations. 1.11. Deaths Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. All causes of death must be reported as SAEs within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. The Investigator should make every effort to obtain and send death certificates and autopsy reports to Biogen. The term death should be reported as an SAE only if the cause of deat h is not known and cannot be determined. 1.12. Safety Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities. Rationale: Section 6 was updated to reflect compatibility and alignment with safety processes at Biogen. Appendix 2, Study Goverance Considerations, Informed Consent Process Change: Appendix 2 was revised to reflect replacing BMS language regarding ethical considerations to Biogen template language. Additionally, text was added to outline course of action in the event of cognitive worsening of study participants over the study in the protocol. Now reads: Ethical Requirements Biogen and the Investigator must comply with all instructions, regulations, and agreements in this protocol and applicable International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and conduct the study according to local regulations. The investigator is responsible for endorsing all data on completed CRFs electronically, prior to any Interim lock or Databas e lock.

The subject must be given sufficient time to consider whether to participate in the study. Subjects will be informed that th eir race and ethnicity will be collected during the study (unless the collection is not permitted by applicable law or not approved by the governing ethics committee) and the data will be used during analysis of study results. A copy of the signed and dat ed ICF must be given to the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative. The original signed and dated ICF will be retained with the study records. Local regulations must be complied with in respect to the final disposition of the original (wet signature) and copies of the signed and dated ICFs. Confirmation of informed consent must also be documented in the subject’s medical record. Subject Data Protection Prior to any testing under this protocol, including screening tests and assessments, candidates must also provide all authorizations required by local law (e.g., Protected Health Information authorization in North America). During the study, subjects’ race and ethnicity will be collected (unless the collection is not permitted by applicab le law or not approved by the governing ethics committee) . These data will be used in the analysis of the safety and/or pharmacokinetic profile of the study treatment. It is unknown whether the effects of the study treatment are influenced by race or eth nicity. Study reports will be used for research purposes only.

Rationale: Text regarding ethical considerations was updated to conform to Biogen template language. Also, clarification was needed to appr opriately outline the responsibilities of the Investigator in situations where a study participant loses capacity to provide informed consent over the course of the study. This additional language is based on a Protocol Clarification Letter for Study 251PP301, dated 21 June 2017. Appendix 3, Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow Up and Reporting Change: Appendix 3 was revised to reflect compatibility with safety processes at Biogen. Now reads: The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all AEs. The causal relationship can be one of the following: Related: An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the investigational product if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. Factors that point toward this assessment include but are not limited to a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the investigational product and the AE, a known response pattern of the suspected product, improvement following discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the product and the AE, or a l ack of an alternative explanation for the AE. Not related: An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the investigational product if there is not a reasonable possibility that the event has been caused by the product under investigation. Facto rs pointing toward this assessment include but are not limited to the lack of reasonable temporal relationship between administration of the investigational product and the AE, the presence of a biologically implausible relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. • Sexual abstinence Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. • It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is elected. • WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified in Section 10.5. • Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abstinence NOTES: a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies. b Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence that the IMP and other study medications will not alter hormonal exposures such that contraception would be ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous. In this case, alternative methods of contraception should be utilized. c Intrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the"
