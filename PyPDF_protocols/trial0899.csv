Subjects in this study completed treatment with tapinarof in 1 of 2 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies (Study DMVT-505-3001 or Study DMVT-505-3002). This study will consist of up to 40 weeks of treatment and a 4-week safety follow-up period. At the completion of the Week -12 visit of the pivotal study (Baseline [Day 1] in this study), all eligible subje cts will be offered enrollment in the long -term extension study. Study visits during the treatment period for all subjects will occur every 4 weeks (± 3 days). Unscheduled visits may occur, as needed. Subjects who withdraw from the study before Week 40 will return to the study center for an Early Termination visit. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 4 4 weeks. Subjects in the study will be treated based on their PGA score from the Week 12 visit in the pivotal study. Subjects entering with a PGA ≥ 1 will receive treatment with tapinarof cream, 1% until they achieve a PGA score of 0, at which time treatment will be discontinued an d subjects monitored for durability of response. If disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, treatment will then be re -initiated and continued until a PGA of 0 is observed. Subjects entering with a PGA of 0 will have treatment discontinued and be monitored for dura bility of response. If disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, then treatment will be re- initiated and continued until a PGA of 0 is observed. This treatment and re- treatment pattern of use will be continued until the end of the study (i.e., subjects may receive study treatment up until the Week 40 visit). Study drug w ill be dispensed to subjects during the study visits and will be administered at home between study visits as instructed by site personnel. Subjects will be instructed to appl y study drug once daily to all affected areas, including newly appearing lesions and lesions or affected areas that improve during the study. Subjects will apply sufficient study drug to cover completely each lesion with a thin layer of study drug and will record the time of study drug application in a daily diary provided by the stu dy site. (Note that subjects are allowed, but not required, to treat fingernails, toenails, palms, soles and scalp lesions with study drug; however, efficacy analyses will not include assessment of improvement of psoriasis in these areas ). Subjects will be instructed to maintain the approximate dosing time chosen at the beginning of the study for their full study participation. Study drug application instructions will be reviewed at subsequent study visits. During subsequent study visits, subjects will DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

The time of the study drug application and assessments will depend on the time of the study visit (either morning or afternoon visit). Therefore, the timing of the study visit may lead to a change from the subject’s chosen dosing time; if this occurs, it will NOT be considered a protocol deviation; the subject should resume their chosen do sing time the day following any such study visit study drug application. This should only occur for subjects receiving study treatment. Rescue medications may be initiated with consultation of the medical monitor. Sample Size Justification: The sample size of this study is based on the Internatio nal Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E1 guideline on extent of population exposure to assess clinical safe ty for drugs intended for long-term treatment of non-life-threatening conditions. An estimated 850 subjects who complete Study DMVT-505-3001 or Study DMVT-505-3002 will be enrolled in this study across all regions. A high discontinuation rate is anticipated in this long -term extension study. Approximately 300 subjects are expected to complete the study (up to 40 weeks of treatment). Number of Subjects (planned): Approximately 850 subjects ages 18 to 75 years of age Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Inclusion criteria: 1. Completed the 12-week treatment period in 1 of the 2 pivotal studies (Study DMVT-505-3001 or Study DMVT-505-3002); 2. Male or female; 3. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male su bjects who are engaging in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy should use one of the following acceptable birth control met hods while on study and for 4 weeks after the last exposure to study drug. Acceptable contraception methods are: x Female subject or male subject’s female partner is surgically sterile (b ilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) for a m inimum of 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug x Female subject or male subject’s female partner has had an intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug x Double barrier methods (e.g., condom plus diaphr agm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicide) starting at least 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug x Subjects who claim abstinence as their method of contraception are allowed provided they agree to use a double barrier method (e.g., condom plus diaphrag m, condom or diaphragm plus spermicide) should they become sexually active from Screening to 1 month after the last dose of study drug x Surgical sterilization of male subject or female subj ect’s male partner (vasectomy) a minimum of 3 months prior to first dose of study drug x Female subject or male subject’s female partner is taking hormonal contraceptives starting at least 3 months prior to the first dose of study drug. If hormonal contraceptives were started less than 3 months prior to the first dose of stu dy drug, subjects must agree to use a double barrier method (e.g., condom plus diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermicide) from Screening through 3 months after the initiation of hormonal contraceptives. These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, correctly and in accordance with the product label. The Investig ator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception. Non-CBP is defined as premenarchal or premenop ausal females with a documented bilateral tu bal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or hysteroscop ic sterilization; or postmenopausal females defined as a cessation of menses for at least 12 months without an alternative medical cause. In questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) > 40 ml/U is confirmatory. Documented verbal history from the subject is acceptable.

Background Information Psoriasis is a common, chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease [ Parisi, 2012 ] with recurrent episodes of prominently erythematous and scaly patches (plaques). Approximately 2% to 3% of the global population is affected by psoriasis; those affected are predominantly adults, who are most often diagnosed between the ages of 18 to 35 years. Psoriasis disrupts daily activities such as work and/or school attendance, interpersona l relationships, recreational activities, and intimacy – thereby significantly impacting sufferers’ quality of life . Furthermore, psoriasis sufferers can also have co-morbidities such as arthritis, depression, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular diseases. Up to 80% of patients have mild to moderate plaque-type psoriasis, which is generally managed with topical treatments. The most commonly used treatments for psoriasis include topically applied corticosteroids and Vitamin D analogs, alone or in combination. Vitamin D analogs are moderately efficacious as monotherapy, while application of topical corticosteroids – particularly the very potent ones – is restricted in terms of body areas that can be treated and the duration of use due to the well-known application site and systemic adverse drug reactions [ Mason, 2013 ]. Although numerous topical treatment options are available, there remains a need for a topical treatment that combines a high level of efficacy with an acceptable safety profile that permits application to a large body surface area (BSA) without restrictions on duration of treatment. DMVT-505 (tapinarof), formerly known as GSK2894512, is a fully synthetic hydroxylated stilbene that is being developed by Dermav ant Sciences GmbH (Dermavant) as a novel anti-inflammatory agent for the topical treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD) and plaque psoriasis. The compound (number WBI-1001) was initially developed by Welichem Biotech Inc. (Welichem; Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada ) and then was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) on 31 July 2012 for further development in the rest of the world except China. Beijing Wenfeng Tianji Pharmaceuticals (BWTP) is developing a compound in China identified as Benvitimod (active ingredient corresponds to tapinarof) with a unique topical formulation. Dermavant acquired the drug from GSK on 20 August 2018 for continued development. Tapinarof cream, 1% is a white to off-white, oil-in-water emulsion intended for topical application to AD and psoriatic skin lesions, which has a novel mechanism of action. The drug likely mediates its effects via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) because the pattern of pro-inflammatory mediators inhibited by tapinarof is different from that of corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, vitamin D analogs, and other immunosuppressive agents commonly used to treat AD and psoriasis. Rather, the profile of biological responses elicited by tapinarof most closely matches that of the dual activation properties of coal tar, a common nonpr escription treatment for psoriasis. Together, existing data identify tapinarof as a non-ster oid, therapeutic AhR-modulating agent (TAMA), which is a unique mechanism of action compared with existing therapies.

19,page_19,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 20 Tapinarof cream has been evaluated in nonclinica l studies at concentrations up to 8% and in clinical studies at concentrations up to 2%. Three Phase I clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers and 7 Phase I/II studies in subjects with AD and psoriasis have been completed. Refer to the current version of the tapinarof Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information. Tapinarof has demonstrated an ac ceptable safety profile and a clear therapeutic effect, as compared to vehicle, in both psoriasis and AD. Four randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, cl inical studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topically-applied tapinarof cream in su bjects with AD or psoriasis were conducted by Welichem; one 28-day and one 12-week stud y was completed for each indication. These studies enrolled a total of 282 adult subjects, with 235 subjects exposed to tapinarof cream 0.5%, 1%, or 2% (Formulation C) once or twice daily for a period of 28 to 84 days. Efficacy was rapid, and statistically significant differences versus vehicle were observed as early as Day 14 for the majority of efficacy parameters in both indications. The most frequently reported (1 to 6% of 235 subjects) dermatological adverse events (AEs), regardless of causality, were application site discoloration/hyperpigmentation, application site dermatitis, papular rash, pruritus, dermatitis contact, folliculitis, erythema, and skin burning sensation. Nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequently-reported (>10% of subjects) nondermatological AEs overall. Overall, results of the clinical studies indicated tapinarof was high ly efficacious for both AD and psoriasis, with a favorable safety profile. The first clinical study with Formulation F (Study 201851) was a Phase 1 study to evaluate the systemic exposure and pharmacokinetic (PK) pa rameters of tapinarof cream, 1% and 2%. This study was conducted in 11 subjects with AD; 5 subjects were treated with the 2% dose and 6 subjects were treated with the 1% dose. Head ache was the most frequently reported (100% and 60% of subjects at the 1% and 2% doses, resp ectively) nondermatological adverse event. Two Phase 2b, 12-week, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, 6-arm, parallel-group, dose-finding studies with topically applied tapinarof cream were conducted by GSK; 1 study each in subjects with AD or psoriasis. These 2 studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of tapinarof cream (Formulation F) at 2 concentrations (0.5% or 1%) and 2 application frequencies (once daily or twice daily) in 247 adult and a dolescent subjects with AD and in 227 adult subjects with plaque psoriasis. In both studies, tapinarof showed a clear therapeutic effect compared with vehicle, with the 1% concentration treatment groups demonstrating a higher proportion of subjects with treatment success compared with the 0.5% concentration groups (applied once daily and twice daily in the AD study). In both indications, the tapinarof 1% dosing groups showed a faster onset of action than the 0.5% dosing groups, and once daily application had similar efficacy to twice daily application. In both Phase 2b studies, tapinarof showed an acceptable safety profile. Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported w ith a higher frequency in the tapinarof groups than in the vehicle groups. The most frequent TEAEs ( ≥5% in any arm or in total) were nasopharyngitis, folliculitis, dermatitis con tact, atopic dermatitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, vomiting, acne, application site dermatitis, miliaria, dermatitis allergic, and impetigo. The majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. In each study, the tapinarof 1% once daily treatment group had a lowe r frequency of TEAEs than the tapinarof 1% twice daily treatment group.

Study Rationale This 40-week, Phase 3, open-label extension stud y is being conducted as part of a clinical development program to evaluate the long-term safe ty and continued efficacy of tapinarof cream, 1% for the topical treatment of plaque psoriasis in adults with psoriasis. Subjects in this study will be selected from those subjects who comp lete 1 of 2 Phase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies (pivotal Study DMVT-505-3001 or pi votal Study DMVT-505-3002) and meet the predefined criteria to enroll into this study. 1.2. Rationale for Study Design and Dose As in the pivotal studies, this Phase 3 study cont inued to be conducted at multiple study centers in more than 1 country to enhance the possibility of inclusion of a wider range of population groups and to subsequently increase generalizability of the results. Tapinarof cream is intended for long-term, intermittent use in non-life-threatening inflammatory dermatologic conditions. Therefore, the 40-week duration of long-term, intermittent use of tapinarof in this study, in addition to the treatment received in the pivotal st udy, is expected to be an adequate duration to assess safety and efficacy of repeated treatmen t courses of tapinarof as recommended in the International Conference on Harmonisation E1 (ICH E1) guideline on the extent of population exposure to assess clinical safety for drugs intended for long-term treatment of non-life- threatening conditions [ ICH, 1994 ], which recommends a minimum of 100 subjects be treated with the intended clinical dose and to be followed for AEs over at least 1 year. The once daily topical application of tapinarof cream, 1% concentration administered in the pivotal studies will be continued in this open-label extension study. 1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits To assess any potential impact on subject eligibility with regard to safety, the Investigator must refer to the current ve rsion of the tapinarof Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, AEs, and other significant data pertaining to the study drug being used in this study. 1.3.1. Risk Assessment 1.3.1.1. Dermatological Adverse Events, Including Skin Irritation or Allergic Reaction Tapinarof or its excipients may induce skin irritation. Allergic or irritant reactions in the exposed areas may present as erythema, edema, papules, or vesicles. In the event of pronounced skin reaction, spreading of the eczematous reaction beyond the original application site(s) and/or more generalized (remote) skin reactions may be observed. In the dose-ranging study 203120 in psoriasis, the most frequently reported dermatologic AEs were folliculitis and contact dermatitis. In the dose-ranging study 203121 in AD, the most frequently reported dermatologic AEs were folliculitis and AD. Nonclinical dermal toxicity studies of up to 8% tapinarof for up to 13 weeks indicated local effects are primarily mild to moderate skin irritation that is reversible; tapinarof did not show evidence of sensitization. In initial clinical studies using a different formulation of tapinarof (Formulation C), AEs of skin DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"
21,page_21,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 22 hyperpigmentation, application site dermatitis, papular rash, pruritus, contact dermatitis, folliculitis, erythema, and skin burning sensation were reported. To mitigate these potential risks, subjects with a known or suspected intolerance to tapinarof or its excipients will be excluded from enrollment. Subject s’ skin will be evaluated routinely for signs of irritation or allergic reaction, and if needed, study treatment will be interrupted and an appropriate treatment provided. Note that after cessation of exposure, dermatological reactions generally subside spontaneously or with topical treatments. 1.3.1.2. Systemic Adverse Events Nasopharyngitis and headache were the most frequently reported nondermatological AEs in dose-ranging Study 203120 in psoriasis. In dose-ranging Study 203121 in AD, the most frequently reported nondermatological AEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache. In the initial clinical studies (in AD and psoriasis) using a different tapinarof formulation (Formulation C), nasopharyng itis and headache were the most frequently reported nondermatological AEs. In the open-label PK Study 201851 with BID dosing of Formulation F of tapinarof cream (n=11), 1% an d 2%, headache was the most frequently reported AE during the study (reported for 100% and 60% of subjects at the 1% and 2% doses, respectively). In a nonclinical study in minipigs using intraven ous (IV) administration, reversible decreases in arterial blood pressure and PR inte rval were observed; however, in this study and repeat dermal toxicity studies, there were no effects on QT interval or heart rate. Repeat-dose dermal toxicity studies also showed findings related to the liver (increased weights and hepatocellular hypertrophy/regeneration) and thym us (thymic cortex depletion in adult rabbits and rats; changes in thymus weight, microscopic decreased cellular ity, and changes in thymic T cell maturation in juvenile rats) with associated secondary hematological findings. Thymic findings were also noted in repeat adult and juvenile rat studies; however, there were no clinically relevant AEs/SAEs reported. To mitigate potential systemic risks, subjects w ill be monitored for AEs and any abnormal vital signs, physical examination, and laboratory test results. 1.3.1.3. Reproductive and De velopmental Toxicity Results of embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits indicated an increased risk for embryo-fetal developmental effects, as evidenced by an increase in post-implantation loss and incidence of fetal skeletal variations. Results of a juvenile rat study indicated adverse microscopic changes in the form of renal pelvic dilatation in both sexes, along with reversible increases in total urinary glucose and protein excretion in males at ≥ 10/15 mg/kg/day tapinarof (administered subcutaneously). An investigative study in rats suggested an increased risk for hydronephrosis during a narrow window of postnatal sensitivity prior to postnatal day (PND) 32 (specifically PND 15 to 21). Rat renal tubule anatomic maturation and nephrogenesis occurs during this period [ Cappon, 2010; Frazier, 2013; Zoetis, 2003 ], however tubule morphogenesis/nephrogenesis occurs entirely prenatally in humans [ Cappon, 2010 ; Zoetis, 2003 ].

22,page_22,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 23 To mitigate these potential risks, women of childbearing potential (CBP)must utilize abstinence or a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly during the study and for 4 weeks after the end of treatment (Section 4.2). Monthly pregnancy testing will be conducted. Pregnant women and subjects under 18 years of age will be excluded from the study. If a woman becomes pregnant during the study, she will immediately discontinue study treatment. Additionally, AEs will be monitored and clinical laboratory testing will be performed. 1.3.2. Benefit Assessment Subjects may experience improvements in their psoriasis during the course of the study and may benefit from the additional safety assessments conducted as part of the study (e.g., physical examination, laboratory tests). Subjects in the study will also contribute to the process of developing a novel anti-inflammatory agent for the topical treatment of psoriasis. 1.3.3. Overall Benefit/Risk Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects in this study, the potential risks identified in association with tapinarof are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to subjects with psoriasis.

Overall Design This is a long-term, open-label, multicenter, study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical tapinarof cream, 1% in adults with plaque psori asis. Subjects in this study completed treatment with tapinarof or vehicle in 1 of 2 pivotal Ph ase 3 pivotal efficacy and safety studies (Study DMVT-505-3001 or Study DMVT-505-3002). The study will consist of up to 40 weeks of treatment and a 4-week safety follow-up period. At the completion of the Week-12 Visit of the pivot al study (Baseline [Day 1] in this study), eligibility of the subjects opting to enroll in this extension study will be confirmed. Study visits during the treatment period for all subjects will occur every 4 weeks (±3 days). A Phone Call will be performed at Week 2 (Day 15). Unscheduled visits may occur, as needed. Subjects who withdraw from the study before Week 40 will return to the study center for an Early Termination Visit. The total duration of study participation will be approximately 44 weeks. Subjects in the study will be treated as follows based on their PGA score from the Week 12 visit in the pivotal study (DMVT-505-3001 or DMVT-505-3002). x Subjects entering with a PGA ≥ 1 will receive treatment with tapinarof cream, 1% until they achieve a PGA score of 0, at wh ich time treatment will be discontinued and subjects monitored for durability of response. If/when disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, treatment will then be re-initiated and continued until a PGA of 0 is observed. x Subjects entering with a PGA of 0 will have treatment discontinue d and be monitored for durability of response. If/when disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, treatment will then be re-initiated and continued until a PGA of 0 is observed. x This treatment and re-treatment pattern of us e will be continued until the end of the study (ie, subjects may receive study treatment up until the Week 40 visit) (see Section 5.1.5.2 ). Study drug will be dispensed, and subjects will be instructed on how to apply study drug. Subjects will apply the daily dose of study drug while at the site, under the supervision of site personnel, after efficacy and safety assessments have been completed. Study drug will be dispensed to subjects during th e study visits and will be administered at home between study visits as instructed by site personne l. Subjects will be instructed to apply study drug once daily to all affected areas, including newly appearing lesions and lesions or affected areas that improve during the study. Subjects will apply sufficient study drug to cover completely each lesion with a thin layer of study drug and will record the time of study drug application in a daily diary provided by the stud y site. (Note that subjects are allowed, but not required, to treat fingernails, toenails, palms, so les, and scalp lesions with study drug; however, efficacy analyses will not include assessment of improvement of psoriasis in these areas.) Subjects will be instructed to maintain the approximate dosing time chosen at the beginning of the study for their full study participation. Study drug application instructions will be reviewed at subsequent study visits. During subsequent study visits, subjects will apply the daily dose of study drug while at the study under the supervision of site personnel, after efficacy and safety DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

The time of th e dose application and as sessments will depend on the time of the study visit (either morning or afternoon visit). Therefore, the timing of the study visit may lead to a change in the subject’s chosen dosing time; if this occurs, it will NOT be considered a protocol deviation; the subject should resume their chosen dosing time the day following any such clinic visit application. Rescue medications may be initiated with consultation of the medical monitor. Safety assessments will include AEs, local (application site) tolerability, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examinations, and invest igator-assessed LTS. Efficacy assessments will include a 5-point static PGA (0-4 scale), %BSA af fected, the PASI, and subject-reported DLQI. Refer to Section 6 for descriptions of study procedures and assessments and Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) for timing of procedures and assessments. 3.2. Treatment Groups and Duration Subjects entering with a PGA ≥ 1 will receive treatment with tapinarof cream, 1% until they achieve a PGA score of 0, at which time treatment will be discontinued and subjects monitored for durability of response.

If, in the opinion of the Investigator and the study Medical Monitor, such medication will not interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study or compromise the safety of the subject, then the subject may continue to receive study drug. If the subject is discontinued from study drug, they may remain in the study for safety assessments as needed, at the discretion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor. x Pregnancy x Any Grade 3 or 4 AE considered causally related to study drug (Section 8.2.2) Study drug may be discontinued for any of the following reasons: x Subject noncompliance x Investigator noncompliance x Discontinuation of the study at the request of the Sponsor, regulatory agency, or an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) If a subject meets a withdrawal criterion during treatment, an Early Termination Visit will be required (Section 7.7). 4.6.2. Temporary Discontinuation A subject will discontinue study drug when th e Investigator determines a PGA of 0 has been achieved as described in Section 5.1.5.1. While actively treating an episode of disease worsening or during the treatment course for a PGA ≥ 2, there are no specific provisions for temporary discontinuation of treatment during this study, with the exception of the interruption of study treatment for skin irritation (see Section 1.3). If study treatment is interrupted due to a safety issue, the Medical Monitor will be contacted and the event documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 4.6.3. Withdrawal Procedures The primary reason for the discontinuation of st udy drug and/or withdrawal from study must be recorded in the source document and on the eCRF. If a subject is prematurely discontinued from study drug(s), the Investigator must make every effort to perform an Early Termination Visit (Section 7.7) and document the primary reason for withdrawal. Should a subject fail to attend a required study visit, the site should attempt to contact the subject and re-schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The site should also counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance.

Administration of Study Drug 5.1.5.1. Treatment by Physician Global Assessment Score Subjects entering with a PGA ≥ 1 will receive treatment with tapinarof cream, 1% until they achieve a PGA score of 0 . If/when disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, treatment will then be re-initiated and continue d until a PGA of 0 is observed. Subjects entering with a PGA of 0 will have treatment discontinue d and be monitored for durability of response. If/when disease worsening occurs, as evidenced by a PGA ≥ 2, treatment will then be re-initiated and continued until a PGA of 0 is observed. This treatment and re-treatment pattern of use will be continued until the end of the study (i.e., subjects may receive study treatment up until the Week 40 visit). Subjects who experience suspected disease worsening between scheduled study visits may contact the study site to arrange an unscheduled visit (Section 7.5). See Disease Worsening (PGAt t2) During the Study (Section 5.1.5.2) for further instructions. Upon confirmation of disease worsening, subjects will restart treatment with study drug. 5.1.5.2. Disease Worsening (Physician Global Assessment Score ≥ 2) During the Study If disease worsening is suspected between sche duled study visits, an unscheduled visit may be performed. x If disease worsening (ie, PGA ≥ 2) is not confirmed, the subject will continue to be assessed at routine, scheduled visits (see Table 1 ). x For each confirmed episode of disease worsening (ie, PGA ≥ 2) during the study (at either a scheduled or unscheduled visit), a treatment course of tapinarof cream (once daily) will be initiated and will continue until the subject achieves a PGA 0, as assessed at scheduled visits, approximately every 4 weeks (see Table 1 ). x Subjects subsequently achieving a PGA of 0 will stop study drug and will then be assessed at routine, scheduled visits (see x Table 1). Subjects who then experience suspected disease worsening between scheduled study visits may contact the study site to arrange an unscheduled visit (see x Table 1).  If disease worsening is not confirmed, the subject will continue to be assessed at routine, scheduled visits.  If disease worsening is confirmed (ie, PGA ≥ 2) at either an unscheduled or a scheduled visit, subjects will initiate a nother treatment course of tapinarof cream (once daily) until a PGA 0 is achieved as described above. x This treatment and re-treatment pattern of use will be continued until the end of the study (ie, subjects may receive study treatment up until the Week 40 visit).

Application of Study Drug Study drug will be dispensed to subjects requiri ng treatment at the study visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Subjects will take the tubes home and self-admin ister (or have a caregiver apply if necessary), except on study visit days (when study drug is appl ied under supervision at the site), to affected areas once daily. Subjects will be instructed to apply study drug as follows: x For subjects with a PGA > 0, once daily application to affected areas including those areas treated in the pivotal study; subject s are to choose the application time they prefer and to apply the study drug at that time each day of study participation. x Subjects with a PGA of 0 will not receive tr eatment but if they worsen and experience a PG A of ≥ 2, apply once daily to newly affected areas only. x If a subject misses a daily dose, it will be recorded as a protocol deviation. The subject should continue dosing the next day and should not apply more than once daily to make up for the missed dose on the previous day. x If chosen application time is in the evening, the dose should be applied at least 30 minutes prior to bedtime. x Study drug should be applied to dry, clean skin x Wash hands after application, unless treati ng lesions on the hands or fingernails. x Study drug should be applied to all lesions, including newly appearing lesions and lesions that have improved during the study. x Subjects are allowed, but not required, to treat fingernails, toenails, palms, soles, and scalp lesions with study drug; however, efficacy analyses will not include assessment of improvement of psoriasis in these areas). If using study drug on the scalp, no other treatment for scalp psoriasis is permitted during the study. x If there is residual cream visible on the dise ase-affected lesional skin, then the subject should be instructed to continue to lightly rub the cream into the skin until it is no longer visible x If study drug is applied to the subject by another person, that person should thoroughly wash his/her hands after application. When possible, use of disposable gloves is recommended. x Subjects should record the time of study drug application in the daily diary. x Subjects should avoid swimming, bathing, showering, or strenuous activities for at least 2 hours after application of study drug. x On study visit days, study drug should be applied in the clinic under the supervision of site personnel and after safety assessments have been completed NOTE: The time of the dose and assessments on study visit days will depend on the time of the study visit (either morning or afternoon visit).

The intention is to allow flexibility to accommodate subjects’ schedules. 5.2. Randomization/Treatment Assignment All subjects will receive treatment with tap inarof cream, 1% as needed per protocol. 5.3. Blinding This study is an open-label study; blinding is not applicable. 5.4. Compliance with Study Drug Administration At baseline, study staff will provide the subjec t with detailed instructions concerning protocol requirements and use of study drug in this extension study. Additionally, subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary with the time of each application of study drug. At each postbaseline study visit, study staff will review use of study drug, as applicable, with the subject. When subjects are dosed at the site, they will apply the study drug under supervision of the study staff. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents. The study drug and study subject iden tification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff. At the time of dispensing study drug to each subject, site personnel will weigh the tubes to be dispensed and will record the weight of all tubes dispensed at each visit in the drug accountability logs. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused tubes with them to each study visit. Site personnel will weigh th e returned tubes (used a nd unused) and record the weight in the drug accountability logs. If a tube has been lost, discarded, or forgotten by the subject, the site personnel will make a notation of this on the drug accountability logs. The site personnel will remind the subject to keep all tubes of study drug dispensed and to bring all used and unused tubes to each study visit. These data wi ll be used to estimate subject compliance with use of study drug. Tubes of study medication disp ensed at the most recent prior visit, which remain unopened (the foil cap on the tube remains fully intact/undisturbed) may be redispensed to study subjects at the current visit. Unopened tubes may only be dispensed one time. Opened, partially used tubes, or tubes with foil overlay removed are not to be redispensed to study subjects. If there is any question as to redispensation, sites should issue new tubes of study medication to the subject(s). 5.5. Treatment after the End of the Study Subjects will not receive any additional treatment with the study drug from the Sponsor after completion of the study. The indication being studied is not life threatening or seriously debilitating, and other treatment options are available. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the poststudy care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or not the Sponsor is providing specific poststudy drug.

Prior and Concomitant Therapy The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 5.6.1. Permitted Medications and Nondrug Therapies Concomitant medications for medical treatment of other conditions are allowed, under the condition that the dosage and administration of these treatments is not planned to change from the Baseline visit to the completion of the stud y or discontinuation, and that the medication is not a prohibited medication as described in Section 5.6.2 . In the event of skin infection, topical antibacterial agents can be applied to the infected area; however, study drug must not be applied to the area until the skin infection is healed. Subjects may use nonmedicated shampoos (must not contain corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, salicylic acid, or coal tar). Nonm edicated emollients may be used on nonlesional skin; emollients should not be applied to lesional skin during acti ve treatment courses and should not be applied on the morning of study visits. The same emollient should be used throughout the subject’s participation in the study. Note: Any emollient used during the study must be recorded as a concomitant medication. 5.6.2. Prohibited Medications and Nondrug Therapies Medications and nondrug therapies that are prohibited throughout the study duration are as follows: x Biologic agents: rituximab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, golimumab, ixekizumab, infliximab, adalimumab, alefacept, etanercept (list is not exclusive, contact Medical Monitor for questions) x Systemic treatments: cyclosporin, interferon, methotrexate, apremilast, tofacitinib, mycophenolate, thioguanine, hydroxyurea, sirolimus, azathioprine, other systemic immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents, fumaric acid derivatives, vitamin D3 and analogs (>5000 IU / day), retinoids (e.g., acitretin, isotretinoin), psoralens, corticosteroids, or adrenoc orticotropic hormone analogs x Ultraviolet light: therapy or prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sources of UV radiation (e.g., phototherapy, tanning beds/booths, or therapeutic sunbathing) x Topical treatments: corticosteroids, antihistamines, immunomodulators, anthralin (dithranol), Vitamin D derivatives (e.g., calcipotriene, calcipotriol), retinoids (e.g., tazarotene), or coal tar x Drugs known to possibly worsen psoriasis (unless on a stable dose for >12 weeks): beta blockers (e.g., propranolol), lithium, iodides, angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, and indomethacin x Immunizations: live, attenuated vaccines (inactivated or subunit vaccines are acceptable when required) x Other: any Investigational products or procedures DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES Study procedures and assessments are summar ized in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) and in Section 7. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the schedule of activities, is essential and requi red for study conduct. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 6.1. Medical History and Demography 6.1.1. Medical History Medical, medication, and family history collec ted during the pivotal study will be used for this study. 6.1.2. Demographics The demographic information collected during the pi votal study will be used for this study, including: age, sex, race, and ethnicity. 6.2. Efficacy Assessments To minimize interobserver variability, investigators and evaluators/raters will be trained on each of the required assessments during an investigator meeting, site initiation visit, and/or utilizing online assessments before enrolling subjects at thei r study center. Only trained evaluators/raters are permitted to perform the efficacy assessments. To the fullest extent possible, the same investigator (or designated evaluator/rater) will perform all efficacy assessments for an individual subject throughout the study. If it is not possible for the same evaluator/rater to continue performing assessments, it is re commended that the primary and subsequent evaluator/rater both examine and discuss their respective scoring during at least 1 visit. 6.2.1. Assessments by Investigator 6.2.1.1. Physician Global Assessment The PGA is a clinical tool for assessing the current state/severity of a subjec t’s psoriasis at a given timepoint. It is a static 5-point morphologic al assessment of overall disease severity, as determined by the Investigator, using the clinical characteristics of erythema, scaling, and plaque thickness/elevation as guidelines; higher PGA scores represent more severe disease. The BSA affected is not considered in scoring of the PGA (see Section 6.2.1.2). Variations of the PGA are frequently used in clinical studies because it is a simple assessment that is more similar to the assessments actually used in clinical practice (see Appendix 1 for details). The PGA should be performed first, prior to %BSA, PASI, and LTS assessments. DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"
36,page_36,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 37 6.2.1.2. Body Surface Area The assessment of the %BSA is an estimate of the percentage of total involved skin with psoriasis. For the purpose of clinical estimation, th e total palmar surface of the subject’s palm and digits may be assumed to be approximately e quivalent to 1% BSA. The %BSA affected by psoriasis will be evaluated (from 0 to 100%). Details on calculation of approximate %BSA involvement in each subject (total and individual are provided in Appendix 2) . Percentage BSA is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores. Note: for all efficacy assessments, lesions on the subject’s scalp, palms, fingernails, toenails, and soles will not be included in the calculation of %BSA affected as these areas will not be included in the efficacy analyses. 6.2.1.3. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index The PASI scoring system is a widely-used standard clinical tool for assessing the severity of psoriasis that takes into account the overall se verity of erythema (redness), induration (plaque thickness), and scale, and the extent of %BSA af fected with psoriasis. The 3 clinical signs are each graded on a 5-point scale (0 to 4) and the %BSA affected is scored on a 7-point scale (0 to 6) for each of the 4 specified body regions (head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities). The individual scores are multiplied by a weighted factor for each body region; the sum of these scores gives the overall PASI score. Higher scores indicate more severe disease. PASI is a static assessment made without reference to previous scores. See Appendix 2. 6.2.2. Assessments Completed by Subject 6.2.2.1. Dermatology Life-Quality Index Subjects will complete the DLQI questionnaire. The DLQI is simple dermatology-specific 10-question validated questionnaire to assess the impact of the disease on a subject’s quality of life (Cardiff University, Department of Dermatology, Quality of Life Questionnaires). The DLQI has become an important outcome measure in dermatology clinical trials and is the most frequently used instrument in studies of randomized controlled trials in dermatology [Basra, 2015]. The DLQI can be analyzed as a total score (where a higher score indicates greater impairment in quality of life) and can also be scored for the following dimensions: Symptoms and Feelings (items 1 and 2), Daily Activities (items 3 and 4), Leisure (items 5 and 6), Work and School (item 7), Personal Relationships (items 8 and 9), and Treatment (item 10). An example of this assessment is provided Appendix 3. For additional information, refer to the Study Reference Manual. 6.2.2.2. Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire Subjects will complete the Patient Satisfac tion Questionnaire. The Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire is provided in Appendix 5. 6.2.3. Optional Clinical Photography Clinical photography may be performed in a subgroup of subjects at selected study centers that participated in photography in the pivotal study. This is not required of subjects for participation DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"
37,page_37,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 38 in the study. Informed consent and photographic release will be required. The photographs may not be referred to by the Investigator at any subsequent study visit for the purposes of grading. Photographs will be taken of a representative area of the subject’s disease area at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1; see also section 7). Three photographs of the selected skin area will be taken in a standardized fashion (ie, same camera, angle, background, distance). Procedures for the clinical photography w ill be contained in the Photography Manual. 6.3. Safety Assessments 6.3.1. Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the subjec t signs the ICF until the final visit/contact with the subject. Adverse events that began during the pivotal study and were ongoing at the end of that study will be reported as ongoing AEs. Additional safety information, including the definition of an AE and the methods for recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and the procedures for completing and transm itting SAE reports are provided in Section 8. 6.3.2. Brief Physical Examination A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illness. 6.3.3. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured before blood collecti on for clinical laboratory assessments and will include measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature. Subjects should be in a seated position for at least 5 minutes. 6.3.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments All protocol-required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance with the Study Reference Manual or Laboratory Manual, and Pr otocol Schedule of Assessments. Laboratory requisition forms must be completed, and samples must be clearly labeled with the Subject number, protocol number, site/center number, and visit date. Details for the preparation and shipment of samples will be provid ed by the laboratory and are detailed in the Study Reference Manual or the Laboratory Manual. Reference ranges for all safety parameters will be provided to the site by the laboratory responsible for the assessments. A list of clinical laboratory tests and parameters is provided in Table 3 . All laboratory tests with values that are considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified, if possible, and the Sponsor notified.

Local Tolerability Scale At each specified study visit and if the subjec t is receiving study drug, the Investigator (or qualified evaluator) will assess the presence and overall degree of irritation at the application sites, according to the LTS (an example of the LTS is provided in Appendix 4). The score will ideally represent an ‘average’ across all application sites. To the fullest extent possible, the same Investigator (or designated evaluator) will perform all tolerability assessments for an individual subject throughout the study. If the subject is applying study treatment to “sensitive areas” (e.g., genitals, face, neck, and skin folds), then the degree of irritation for these areas should also be assessed by the investigator. Additionally, at each specified study visit if re ceiving study drug, the subject will use a 5-point LTS to assess the presence and degree of burning/stinging and itching at the treatment areas. The score will ideally represent an ‘average’ across all application sites . 6.4. Treatment of Study Drug Overdose For this study, accidental or intentional ingestion of the study drug is considered an overdose. Ingestion of a 30-gram tube of 1% cream w ould result in an oral dose of 300 mg. The Sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the Investigator (or treating physician) should: x Contact Medical Monitor to discuss the event x In the event of excessive topical applicati on, instruct the subject to wash study drug off of the skin and monitor for application-site AEs. x Monitor subject for systemic AEs/SAEs and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. x Obtain blood sample within 2 days from th e date of last application of study drug or date of ingestion to determine possible systemic exposure to study drug (if requested by the Medical Monitor; determined on a case-by-case basis) x Provide general symptomatic treatment as necessary x Document quantity of excess dose (e.g., by weighing the tube of cream) and duration of exposure, in the eCRF. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject. 6.5.

Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, and Adverse events of Special Interest The Investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE, SAE, or advers e event of special interest (AESI). At each visit/contact, subjects should be questioned in a general way so as not to introduce bias in detecting AEs and/or SAE. Open-ended and non-lea ding verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subjects. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the Investigator would promptly notify the Sponsor. 8.1.1. Definition of Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether considered causally related or not related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events that meet the definition of an AE include: x Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry) or other safety assessments (e.g., vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator x Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition (e.g., atopic dermatitis) including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  For skin-related AEs, it should be noted whether or not the event is in the area of active application of study medication, and/or if spreading beyond the application site. x New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE) x ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE.

Definition of Serious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per Section 8.1.1, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease, etc.). An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: x Results in death x Is life-threatening  The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. x Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  In general, this signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as t o whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. x Results in disability/incapacity: a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or ma lignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitali zation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest In prior clinical studies, the following AEs have been identified as AEs of particular clinical importance and will be reported as AESIs in this study; in each case, study drug may be discontinued, and study drug may be restarted when event resolves: x Contact dermatitis: the study site should collect location, duration, size, associated symptoms (itching, burning, pain), severity (mild, moderate, severe), and photograph the affected site (if possible). If the subjec t contacts the study site to report significant skin irritation at or near the site of study drug application between study visits, the subject should be brought for an unscheduled visit, if possible. x Folliculitis: the study site should collect the location, duration, size, associated symptoms (itching, burning, pain), severity (mild, moderate, severe), indicate whether pustular, and photograph the aff ected site (if possible) x Headache: the study site should collect duration, severity (mild, moderate, severe), onset, and location Additional AESIs may be identified by the Drug Safety Physician and if applicable by the Clinical Study Team Physician during the evaluation of safety data for the Clinical Study Report. For each AESI, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report. 8.2. Classification of Adverse Events 8.2.1. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events 8.2.1.1. Criteria for Determining Adverse Event Severity The Investigator will make an assessment of the severity of each AE and SAE according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), v. 5.0, 2017. For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 4 should be used to determine the grade severity. DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

Adverse event severity should be recorded in th e appropriate section of the adverse event case report form and in the subject’s source documents. 8.2.1.2. Toxicity Management Criteria 8.2.1.2.1. Grade 1 or Grade 2 Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 1 or Grade 2 AE may continue study drug at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects who choose to withdraw from study due to a Grade 1 or 2 AE should have study withdrawal / follow-up evaluations completed. 8.2.1.2.2. Grade 3 Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 3 AE should be managed as follows: x If the Investigator has compelling evidence that the Grade 3 AE has not been caused by study drug, then dosing may continue after discussion with the Medical Monitor. x Subjects who develop a Grade 3 AE that th e Investigator considers related or possibly related to study drug should have the study drug discontinued. Subjects experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent disconti nuation of study drug should be followed weekly until resolution or stability of the AE and encouraged to have withdrawal study evaluations completed. 8.2.1.2.3. Grade 4 Adverse Event Subjects who develop a Grade 4 AE should have study drug permanently discontinued. Subjects experiencing Grade 4 AEs requiring pe rmanent discontinuation of study drug should be followed weekly until resolution or stability of th e AE and encouraged to have withdrawal study evaluations completed.

49,page_49,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 50 8.2.1.2.4. Other Management Criteria The Medical Monitor should be notified if any of the following occur: x Severe signs or symptoms, or significant changes in any of the safety assessments, that put the safety of the subject at risk (e.g., laboratory tests or vital signs, etc.) as judged by the Investigator 8.2.2. Assigning Causal Relati onship to Study Drug An Investigator is to make the causality assessment. Causality assessment may only be delegated to a Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator; howe ver, if it is de legated to any other staff, this must be recorded as a protocol deviation. The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The following de finitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: x Related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to study drug administration th at makes a causal relationship plausible, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on readministration (rechallenge) with or withdrawal (dechallenge) from study drug, although information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear x Not related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to study drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation Any AEs/SAEs assessed as related to study par ticipation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to study drug will be collected from the time a subject consents to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All AEs, whether related to study drug or not, must be fully and completely documented on the AE page of the eCRF and in the s ubject’s clinical record. In the event a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, th e primary reason for withdrawal (e.g., due to an adverse event) must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-up 8.3.1. Adverse Event Reporting All AEs will be collected from the time of si gned informed consent until the final visit. Any AEs assessed as related to study participat ion (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) will be collected from the time a subject consented to participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF and repo rted to the Sponsor within 24 hours via email or phone (refer to Medical Monitor/Sponsor Information page for contact information) (see Section 8.4).

50,page_50,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 51 8.3.2. Follow-up of Adverse Events After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each Subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and nonseri ous AEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherw ise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following criteria: x Recovered/Resolved: The event has improved or subject recuperated. x Recovered/Resolved with sequelae: The subject has recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury. x Recovering/Resolving: The event is improving. x Not recovered/Not resolved: The event has not improved or subject recuperated. x Unknown: The outcome of the event is not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused x Fatal: Termination of life as an outcome of the AE. 8.4. Reporting Procedures 8.4.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting When an Investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE during the study, he/she must notify the Sponsor using an SAE Report Form within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s knowledge of the event , regardless of the Investigator assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Relevant information will be entered on the AE page and on all other applicable pages of the eCRF; source documentation should not be sent with the SAE Report Form unless requested. Follow-up information received on SAEs, should all be faxed to the Sponsor within 1 business day of receipt (refer to Medical Monitor/Sponsor Information page for contact information). This information should be included on a follow-up SAE form and placed with the original SAE information. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. The completed SAE Report Form should be submitted via email or fax to the SAE Reporting Contact which can be found on the Medical Monitor/Sponsor Information Page of this protocol. Do not delay reporting a suspected SAE in order to obtain additional information. Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow-up to the initial report. 8.4.2. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events Prompt notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor of SAEs (even for noninterventional postmarketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are met.

51,page_51,"Tapinarof DMVT-505-3003 Dermavant Sciences GmbH Clinical Study Protocol Confidential Page 52 The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and Investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for su spected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and are forwarded to Investigators as necessary. An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate, according to local requirements. 8.5. Pregnancy Management and Reporting Any female subject who becomes pregnant during th e study will be withdrawn. Details will be collected for all pregnancies in female subjects and female partners of male subjects that begin after the start of dosing and through the Follow-up Visit. Pregnancy is not automatically considered an AE. If a pregnancy is reported, then the Investigator should complete a Pregnancy Report Form and submit via email or fax to the Pregnancy Reporting Contact which contact information can be found on the Medical Monitor/Sponsor Information Page of this protocol, within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy. The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug must be promptly reported to the sponsor or the sponsor’s representative. The Investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subject is enrolled in the study. Pregnancy information must be reported to the sponsor or the sponsor’s representative as described above. The partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to Sponsor or the Sponsor’s representative. Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported on the pregnancy report form. 8.6. Safety Oversight No independent Data Monitoring Committee will be used for this study; however, the Sponsor (including the Medical Monitor) will monitor safety on a periodic basis throughout the study DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

Good Clinical Practice The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), ICH guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protecti on to the study subject. For studies conducted under a United States (US) Investigational New Drug Application (IND), the Investigator will ensure that the basic princi ples of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 312, S ubpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. Since this is a “covered” clinical trial, the Investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitte d in a marketing application or reclassi fication petition subject to this part that the applicant or Food and Drug Administration (FDA) relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective produc t) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. ” This requires that Investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial inter est or arrangements with the Sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the Investigator and any sub-investigator. The Investigator and sub-investigator agree to notify the Sponsor of any change reportable interests during the study and for 1 year following completion of the study. Study completi on is defined as the date that the last subject has completed the protocol defined activities. 11.1.2. Institutional Review Board/Inde pendent Ethics Committee Approval This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the subject (such as advertisements, subject information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) will be submitted by the Investigator to an IRB or IEC. Approval from the IRB or IEC must be obtained before starting the study and should be documented in a letter to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitted to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 11.1.3. Informed Consent/Assent The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent/assent from each individual participating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study-related procedures. The Investigator must utilize an IRB or IEC-approved consent form for documenting written DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

Each informed consent will be appropriately signed and dated by the Subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative and the person obtaining consent. 11.1.4. Confidentiality The Investigator must assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly m aintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject number, date of birth, and an identification code (e.g., not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the Sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory. The Investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all Subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the trial. The Investigator agrees that all information receiv ed from the Sponsor, including but not limited to the Investigator’s Brochure, this protocol, eCRFs, the investigational new drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the Sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduc t of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from the Sponsor. The Invest igator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 11.1.5. Study Files and Retention of Records The Investigator must maintain adequate and ac curate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following 2 categories: (1) Investigator’s study file, and (2) subject clinical source documents. The Investigator’s study file will contain th e protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. The required source data should include the following for each subject: x Subject identification (name, date of birth, gender) x Documentation that subject meets eligibili ty criteria, e.g., history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria) x Participation in trial (including trial number) x Trial discussed and date of informed consent x Dates of all visits x Documentation that protocol specif ic procedures were performed x Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol x Start and end date (including dos e regimen) of trial medication (preferably drug dispensing and return should be documented as well) x Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and preferably including causality and intensity) DocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"

Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if re quired by applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 25 years in Canada), by local regulations, or by an agreement with the Sponsor. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Should the Investigator wish to assign the study re cords to another party or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in advance. If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the si te so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. Biological samples at the conclusion of this study may be retained in storage by the Sponsor for a period up to 10 years for purposes of this study. 11.1.6. Electronic Case Report Forms For each Subject enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the Principal Investigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate). This also applies to records for those Subjects who fail to complete the study. If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a Subject is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 11.1.7. Drug Accountability The Investigator or designee (e.g., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, vehicles, and comparators. This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the Sponsor and quantities dispensed to subjects, including lot number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate th e site’s procedure for investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the Sponsor requirements. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused investigational medicinal product supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures.

The score will ideally represent an ‘average’ across all applicat ion sites. To the fullest extent possible, the same investigator (or designated evaluator) will perform all tolerability assessments for an individual subject throughout the study. If the subject is applying study treatment to “sensitive areas” ( e.g.,genitals, face, neck, and skin folds), then also assess the degree of irritation for these areas. Local Tolerability –Dryness, Erythema, and Peeling Score Severity Description 0 No irritation No evidence of loca l irritation/intolerance 1 Mild Minimal erythema and/or edem a, slight glazed appearance 2 Moderate Definite erythema and/or edema with peeling and/or cracking but does not require treatment modification 3 Severe Erythema, edema glazing with fissures, few vesicles or papules 4 Very Severe Strong reaction spreading beyond the treated area, bullous reaction, erosions At each specified study visit, the subject will use a 5-point tolerability scale to assess the presence and degree of burning/stinging and itching at the treatment areas. The score will ideally represent an ‘average’ across all application sites. Local Tolerability –Burning/Stinging and Itching Score Severity Description 0 None Normal, no discomfort 1 Slight An awareness, but no discomfort and no intervention required 2 Mild A noticeable discomfort that causes intermittent awareness 3 Moderate A noticeable discomfort that causes intermittent awareness and interferes occasionally with normal daily activities 4 Strong/Severe A definite continuous discomfort that interferes with normal daily activitiesDocuSign Envelope ID: A86CDA99-5519-45D7-AB4A-2A81BB86EDE4"
