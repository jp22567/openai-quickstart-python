INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background and Rationale Defibrotide ( Defitelio®) is proposed to be indicated for the prevention of acute graft -versus-host disease (a GvHD) in adult and pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and at high risk of aGvHD. Defibrotide is a highly complex polydisperse collection of predominantly single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotides prepared by controlled depolymerisation of DNA from porcine intestinal tissue. While the mechanism of a ction of defibrotide has not been fully elucidated, nonclinical and clinical data have shown that defibrotide protects endothelial cells (EC s) and has the potential to modulate early alloreactivity and subsequent end organ damage post-HSCT. Defibrotide is postulated to reduce the incidence of aGvHD without an increase in opportunistic infections or disease relapse by: 1) potentially ameliorating the onset and propagation of the alloreactivity seen immediately after conditioning and HSCT, 2) protecting ECs in GvHD target organs from donor alloreactive T- cell infiltration and damage, and 3) not directly depleting T-cells involved in the graft -versus-tumor (GvT) effect. Defibrotide (defibrotide sodium; brand name Defitelio) has been approved in the United States (US) and Canada for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic veno- occlusive disease ( VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), with evidence of renal or pulmonary dysfunction following HSCT. Defibrotide is also currently marketed in Europe, Israel, and South Korea with the brand name Defitelio for the treatment of severe hepatic VOD post-HSCT therapy. Graft-versus-host disease is a life -threatening complication following allogeneic HSCT. Graft- versus-host disease occurs when immune cells transplanted from a non- identical donor (the graft) recognize the transplant recipient (the host) as foreign, thereby initiating an immune reaction that causes multisystem disease in the host. Allogeneic transplant patients receiving the most cytotoxic conditioning regimens (myeloablative conditioning [MAC]) and stem cell grafts from donors most genetically unlike themselves (unrelated donors and/or patient-donor pairs who are mismatched at genetic loci, ie, human leukocyte antigen [HLA] mismatched) have the highest risk of developing GvHD. Acute GvHD usually occurs within the first 100 days following HSCT; involves potentially severe damage to the skin, liver, and/or gastrointestinal tract; increases the risk of developing chronic GvHD (cGvHD); and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. As the leading cause of transplant- related morbidity and non- relapse mortality, GvHD limits the potential curative effect of HSCT on many hematologic malignancies. One in every 5 patients receiving a transplant from an unrelated donor dies from GvHD, and overall up to 1 in 10 transplant patients dies from GvHD complications ( Pasquini and Zhu 2015). Acute GvHD is recognized to be a consequence of donor T- cell activation and proliferation following recognition of host alloantigens, and multiple physiological events prior to and after HSCT contribute to local inflammation and target tissue destruction ( Nomura et al 2017). The first step in the pathophysiology of aGvHD is postulated to be EC damage, which can be caused CONFIDENTIAL Page 18 of 104"

The damage is subsequently coupled with processes that amplify the original insult and promote further endothelial and tissue dysfunction. For example, conditioning regimen toxicity causes endothelial apoptosis and release of polynucleotides from dying cells (ie, damage- associated molecular patterns ), activation of antigen-presenting cells, with release of proinflam matory cytokines, resulting in increased expression of adhesion molecule receptors at the EC surface (Mir et al 2017 ), while translocation of bacterial endotoxin may enhance these effects and increase antigenicity of ECs toward allogeneic CD8+ cytotoxic T -lymphocytes ( Eissner et al 2002). The potential for allogeneic HSCT to be curative depends on the complete destruction of malignant cells by 2 processes: the direct cytotoxic effects of pre -transplant conditioning; and the immunologically -mediated cytotoxi c effects of the stem cell graft (GvT effect) . This immunologically -mediated GvT effect (alloreactivity) is also the underlying basis of GvHD, when donor T- cells are stimulated to initiate variable degrees of acute and/or chronic host tissue inflammation, leading to aGvHD or cGvHD. Overall survival is dependent on the relative difference between the severity of aGvHD (which increases mortality mainly by direct effects on the gastrointestinal tract and from complications of immunosuppressive therapy) and the magnitude of the GvT effect (which decreases mortality by lowering relapse rates). Successful prevention of Grade B-D aGvHD, while preserving the GvT effect, would likely decrease morbidity and mortality by reducing the need for aggressive and prolonged immunosuppression, decreasing the symptoms of moderate and severe aGvHD, and maintaining the graft’s positive effect on residual malignant cells after pre -transplant conditioning (decreased risk of relapse). Most prophylactic treatments in use remain investigational in aGvHD, and progress in developing new treatments has been limited. The backbone of most T- cell replete conventional aGvHD prophylaxis regimens includes: 1) methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) plus 2) a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine A [CSA] or tacrolimus [TAC]). Of these, MMF is used more frequently in non-MAC and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens and umbilical cord blood transplants ( Holtan et al 2014). Sirolimus is sometimes substituted for MTX, but VOD is a con cern when used in combination with TAC, especially in busulfan- containing regimens. Steroids are typically not used as prophylaxis due to a lack of proven benefit (Holtan et al 2014). Anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to reduce the incidence of cGvHD and aGvHD ( Finke et al 2009 , Kroger et al 2016 ). However its adoption is not universal , and recent data showed that ATG is associated with increased disease relapse, reactivation of Epstein -Barr virus, delayed engraftment, and reduced overall surviva l (Walker et al 2016, Soiffer et al 2016 ). In summation, current therapies demonstrate variable efficacy and safety, which highlight the profound limitations in treatments to prevent this life- threatening disease.

Approximately 40-59% of adult and pediatric patients receiving allogeneic transplants from unrelated donors develop clinic ally significant Grade B-D aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008). First -line therapy consists of intravenous (IV) steroids, but nearly 40% of all patients with Grade B-D aGvHD are refractory to steroid-based therapy and further treatment options are limited. Second- line therapies are associated with significant toxicities, high failure rates, and patients with steroid refractory GvHD have 1 -year overall survival rates of approximately 20- 30% (Pavletic and Fowler 2012). In addition, approximately 8- 30% of patients with unrelated donors will develop severe (Grade C-D) aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012 , Jacobsohn 2008), with estimated 5 -year survival rates of 25% (Grade C ) and 5% (Grade D) (Cahn et al 2005). Patients developing a GvHD exhibit a n enhanced degree of EC dysfunction compared with patients who do not develop this complication ( Mir et al 2017). In patients with aGvHD, there is an increase in the biomarkers associated with EC damage (endothelial microparticles, E -selection and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ ICAM-1], von Willebrand factor; Palomo et al 2010, Pihusch et al 2006, Matsuda et al 2001, Biedermann et al 2003). Furthermore, factors in serum from patients with aGvHD promote EC activation ( Mir et al 2017) and there is an association between Grade C-D GvHD and increased angiopoietin- 2 levels at baseline that suggests a connection to early damage to the endothelium ( Dietrich et al 2013 ). Finally, circulating ECs in peripheral blood increase from engraftment to onset of GvHD ( Almici et al 2014 ). Ultimately, the goal of aGvHD prevention is to minimize the graft’s negative effects on the patient while preserving its positive effects on both the underlying disease (GvT) and immune reconstitution. Current standard of care can limit the beneficial GvT effect and increase the risk of opportunistic infection and disease relapse. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with GvHD and the limitations of current therapies, prevention of aGvHD remains an area with significant unmet need. 1.2. Nonclinical Experience Nonclinical and clinical data suggest that the protective effect of defibrotide may be mediated via fibrinolytic, antithrombotic, anti- ischemic, anti -inflammatory, and anti- adhesive actions (reviewed in Pescador et al 2013 ). The mechanism of act ion of defibrotide is as a multi-t arget compound (Pescador et al 2013, Benimetskaya et al 2008 , Echart et al 2009 , Cella et al 2001 , Coccheri et al 1988 , Falanga et al 2003). Nonclinical studies have shown that defibrotide increases tissue plasminogen activator (t- PA) and decreases plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 . In vitro studies showed that incubation of defibrotide with ECs upregulated thrombomodulin mRNA levels ( Zhao et al 1994). In addition, defibrotide has been reported to induce the release of tissue factor pathway inhibitor from ECs and inhibit platelet aggregation by increasing the plasma concentration of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2. Other experimental studies have shown that defibrotide can contribute to maintaining vascular integrity and reducing vascular permeability and inflammation. It has been shown to modulate the production of some inflammatory mediators such as interleukin 6 , vascular endothelial growth factor, thromboxane CONFIDENTIAL Page 20 of 104"

Defibrotide has been shown to down- regulate the gene expression, protein level, and activity of several inflammation- related biomarkers, including heparanase, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in activated ECs , reduce P - selectin and ICAM-1. Defibrotide was shown to localize at the EC membranes and was subsequently internalized through micropinocytosis. However, defibrotide did not reach the cell nucleus even after 24 hours. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of defibroti de seem to be caused by the interaction of the drug with the cell membrane ( Palomo et al 2016). These data suggest that the action of defibrotide is exerted through its interaction with the cell membrane, rather than acting through specific changes in expression of selected genes. Therefore, protection of the endothelium may prevent the development of vascular complications associated with GvHD that are caused by both the conditioning regimens and immunosuppressive agents. The pharmacological activity of de fibrotide in aGvHD in a mouse model of allogeneic stem cell transplantation is underway at Duke University in the laboratory of Nelson Chao. In this model, BALB/c mice are lethally irradiated (8.5 Gy) and transplanted with 1×10 7 T-cell depleted bone marrow (BM) cells together with 1×106 T-cells from C57BL/6 mice (Chen et al 2007). At the highest dose tested (800 mg/kg twice daily by intraperitoneal injection), defibrotide showed significant benefit in clinical aGvHD scores in mice and increas ed overall survival during a 30-day treatment period. Work is ongoing to elucidate relationships between dose schedules and benefit. The nonclinical safety profile of defibrotide has been characterized in a comprehensive program in compliance with the ICH S6 (R1). The safety assessment program completed for defibrotide comprised the following: repeat-dose general toxicology (rat, rabbit, and dog), in vitro and in vivo mouse and rat genotoxicity, mouse and rat oral carcinogenicity, rat and rabbit developmental and reproductive toxicology, and allergenicity, antigenicity, and immunogenicity assessments. Segment II reproductive development studies were not warranted since the conditioning regimen precludes pregnancy, and long-term toxicology studies were not warranted given the duration of dosing (median 21 days). Safety pharmacology evaluations were included in the repeat -dose toxicity studies in rat and dog to fulfill the regulatory requirement for central nervous system and cardiovascular evaluations. Local tolerance was r eported as part of the general toxicology studies. In the 13-week dog toxicology study, defibrotide was well-tolerated, and the no observed effect level was 60 mg/kg/day in males and less than 60 mg/kg/day in females. Spleen, liver, and kidneys were consid ered the target organs with evidence of defibrotide uptake by Kupffer cells and kidney macrophages. Toxicokinetic studies showed that the systemic exposure in dogs after infusion was generally dose dependent, tended to plateau at about 1 hour after the sta rt of infusion, and showed no accumulation over the study duration, which was consistent with a short half-life of approximately 11 minutes. Defibrotide administration did not demonstrate genotoxic potential or carcinogenic (oral) potential. No developmental or reproductive toxicity was observed after IV or IM bolus administration in rats; however, the dose levels were considered CONFIDENTIAL Page 21 of 104"

Defibrotide repeat-dose administration did not appear to cause immunogenicity, allergenicity, and immunotoxicity. 1.3. Overview of Defibrotide Clinical Development The clinical program for defibrotide spans more than 20 years, with clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of defibrotide for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with hepatic VOD (beginning in April 2000) and for the prevention of he patic VOD in high -risk pediatric patients (starting in January 2006). Additional clinical pharmacology studies have evaluated defibrotide in healthy and renally impaired subjects and have evaluated the effect of defibrotide on QTc intervals. Data on the ef fects of defibrotide in the prevention of aGvHD were generated as a pre-specified endpoint in a Phase 3 randomized study (Study 2004) as part of the overall clinical program. An ongoing Phase 3 randomized study (Study 15-007) is evaluating the efficacy and safety of defibrotide in the prevention of VOD in adult and pediatric patients undergoing HSCT. For additional information on studies in the defibrotide clinical development program, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for defibrotide. 1.4. Clinical Expe rience The clinical evidence supporting defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD comes mainly from the Phase 3 randomized trial Study 2004, with supportive evidence from published data and retrospective analyses done by Tekgündüz et al 2016 and Chalandon et al 2016. Additional supportive information has also been presented by Strouse et al 2016. Study 2004 was a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled trial that enrolled patients from 28 European university hospi tals or academic medical centers . The trial included 356 patients of 18 years of age or younger who had undergone MAC prior to allogeneic or autologous HSCT and were at high risk of hepatic VOD. Among the 356 patients in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population, 180 patients received defibrotide prophylaxis and 176 were in the control arm. The mean age (± standard deviation [ SD]) was 6.12±5.11 years and 6.28±5.32 years in the defibrotide and control arms respectively, with 26% and 25% being <2 years; and 61% and 57%, respectively, were males. The incidence and severity of aGvHD was a pre-specified endpoint in Study 2004 and was analysed in 241 allogeneic patients: 124 patients received defibrotide prophylaxis and 117 were in the control arm. Demographic a nd baseline characteristics were similar in the defibrotide and control arms of the allogeneic subset. Busulfan was used in conditioning in 62% and 64% of patients in the 2 arms, and melphalan in 60% and 53%, respectively. Grafts were from related donors in 40% and 30% of the defibrotide and control arms, respectively . Standard GvHD prophylaxis was allowed according to best practice and was generally comparable ( CSA: 80% vs 89%, MTX: 45% vs 56%, in defibrotide and control arms, respectively). However, there was a difference in patients who received ATG in the defibrotide arm compared to controls (54% vs 70% , respectively ). By Day +100, the incidence of aGvHD was 47% in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm compared with 67% in the control arm. The Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 equaled 22% in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm vs 37% in the control arm (p= 0.015). CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 of 104"

The defibrotide groups received defibrotide 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days in addition to low- molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin, 0.4 mg), ursodeoxycholic acid (URSO), and N- acetylcystine ( NAC), while the control group received the same prophylaxis treatments less defibrotide. High risk criteria for VOD were similar to those for Study 2004. The GvHD prophylaxis w as per institutional guidelines, and included MTX/CSA, ATG- Fresenius (ATG -F), and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Of these, 85% of patients had a matched related donor (MRD) graft. All other patients were grouped as “Other” and included matched unrelated donors (MUD s), mismatched related/unrelated donors (MMRD s, MMURDs), and haploidentical donors. Treatment arms were comparable according to age, conditioning intensity, use of total-body irradiation (TBI) -based preparative regimen, female donor/male recipient combination, cytomegalovirus ( CMV) seropositivity of recipients, and donor age. There was a trend in favo r of defibrotide in decreasing cumulative incidence of severe forms (Grades C-D) of aGvHD at Day +180 (all grades aGvHD, 25.5% vs 40% vs 46.5%, defibrotide/pre- HSCT vs defibrotide/post- HSCT vs co ntrol, p=0.057). No defibrotide/pre-HSCT patient developed Grade C-D GvHD in the pre-HSCT group vs 15.5% in the control and 11.2% in the defibrotide/post-HSCT group. This trend was seen despite more patients in the defibrotide/ pre- HSCT group having more “Other” donors than MRDs and more peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts than BM grafts (diffe rence among no defibrotide vs defibrotide/post- HSCT vs defibrotide /pre-HSCT, p<0.001 and p=0.018, respectively), both of which are considered risk factors for aGvHD and would be expected to decrease the ability to show a treatment effect with defibrotide. Chalandon and colleagues (2016) retrospectively analysed data from 248 patients who received defibrotide intravenously (800-2400 mg/day) in combination with heparin for VOD prophylaxis compared to patients not treated with defibrotide as controls. The Day +100 cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD was not significantly different between the 2 groups: 27% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22% to 33%) in the defibrotide group vs 29% ( 95% CI 24% to 35%) in the control group (p=0.707). T he 1-year Grade B-D aGvHD cumulative incidence was significantly reduced in t he defibrotide group (31% [95% CI 25% to 37%]) compared with the control group (42% [95% CI 36% to 48%]) (p=0.026). Multivariate analysis, performed taking into account clinical factors known to influence the risk of SOS, confirmed the favorable impact of defibrotide on 100 day VOD cumulative incidence [HR 7.5x10 -7 (95%CI 1.8x10-7-3.2x10-6), p<0.00001]; c onversely, multivariate analysis failed to confirm the imp act of defibrotide on 1 year event -free survival or the cumulative incidence of acute GvHD.

Patients identified with severe VOD (VOD occurring in the setting of renal impairment requiring dialysis or any non-infectious pulmonary abnormality) were divided into 2 groups for analysis: those treated with defibrotide (n=41), and those not treated with defibrotide (n=55). The cumulative incidence of G rade B-D aGvHD at Day +100 post-HSCT was 23.1% (95% CI 11.4% to 37.4%) vs 37.7% (95% CI 25.3% to 51.0%) (defibrotide vs control, difference of -14.6% [95% CI -33.1% to 3.9%]). T he cumulative incidence of G rade C-D aGvHD at Day +100 post- HSCT was 10 .9% (95% CI 3.0% to 22.8%) vs 28.6% (95% CI 17.3% to 41.4%) (defibrotide vs control, difference of -17.7% [95% CI -33.6% to 2.0%]). Although the study was not in patients given defibrotide for prophylaxis of VOD or GvHD, the author concluded that the results supported the previously observed protective effect that defibr otide appeared to have on the incidence and severity of aGv HD. The author stated that the finding may be mechanistically related to down-regulation of heparanase or inhibition of T- cell activity, which preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated wit h the use of defibrotide. 1.5. Justification for Dosage and Dosage Regimen The dosage of defibrotide selected for this study is 25 mg/kg/day, administered intravenously as 4 2-hour infusions of 6.25 mg/kg every 6 hours beginning prior to the start of the conditioning regimen (may have completed 1 -4 doses of defibrotide prior to conditioning) for a recommended duration of ≥21 days and stopping no later than Day +30 post- HSCT. Using a recommended minimum duration of defibrotide prophylaxis provides a relati vely consistent minimum duration of inpatient treatment to maximize the potential defibrotide treatment effect, while not imposing unnecessary inpatient hospitalization on patients who may be ready for hospital discharge prior to 21 days of study drug admi nistration . The safety of defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day as prophylaxis has been demonstrated in children at high risk of VOD who received MAC (Corbacioglu et al 2012). Incidences of adverse events ( AEs), serious adverse event s (SAEs), and events leading to discontinuation were similar between the defibrotide and control groups (207 SAEs in 108 patients in the defibrotide group and 231 SAEs in 103 patients in the control group). The most common AE s considered by the investigator to be related to defibrotide w ere hemorrhage -type events . During the prophylactic phase of the study, hemorrhage- type events were reported in 17.5% of patients in the defibrotide group vs 13.6% of patients in the control group. There was no notable difference between study arms in the incidence of any specific hemorrhage- type event. Overall, most fatal AEs were either neoplasms (12 [7%] patients in the defibrotide group and 14 [8%] patients in the control group) or infections (6 [3%] patients in the defibrotide group and 11 [6%] patients in the control group).

Justification for Choice of Primary Efficacy Endpoint Acute graft -versus-host disease is a comm on complication of allogeneic HSCT that classically presents in the early post-transplantation period and has historically been measured at Day +100 post-HSCT. Although Grades C-D aGvHD are associated wit h the highest mortality, Grade B also represents a clinically meaningful point in the progression of aGvHD. Active physician engagement and concerted clinical efforts at (further) immunosuppression typically begin once the patient is diagnosed with Grade B aGvHD i n order to 1) treat the Grade B symptoms and 2) prevent more severe and/or other organ involvement. Initial immunosuppression treatment with systemic steroids will ultimately fail in up to 40% of patients and is associated with multiple possible side effects, including an increased risk of systemic infection due to further immunosuppression and an increased probability of immunosuppressant drug toxicity (eg , renal toxicity) ( Pavletic and Fowler 2012). Overall, these data suggest that a reduction in Grade B-D aGvHD at Day +100 post- HSCT would be clinically meaningful due to decreased patient morbidity and possibly decreased mortality. The severity of aGvHD is determined by assessing the degree of involvement of the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, and several systems for grading aGvHD have been developed. The most widely used grading scales in aGvHD prevention trials are the Consensus C riteria (Przepiorka et al 1995) and the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR) Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997). These 2 grading systems differ slightly in the staging criteria used to define each grade, but both have been shown to correlate well with treatment response and patient survival. In the proposed study, collection of data for the diagnosis and staging of aGvHD will be based on the recommendation of the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC; Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 2). Grading of aGvHD for assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoint s will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997; Appendix 3). As sensitivity analyses, all GvHD-related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC (Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 4). In the proposed study, the primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT. Given defibrotide’s postulated mechanism of action in protection/stabilization of EC and the proposed treatment re gimen for a recommended ≥21 days up to a maximum of Day +30 post- HSCT, defibrotide will be optimally place d to prevent aGvHD cases arising from transplant toxicity.

Justification for Selection of the Patient Population Allogeneic transplant is offered to some patients with hematologic malignancies such as acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a potential curative therapy. Acute graft - versus-host disease is a common c omplication o f allogeneic HSCT that classically presents prior to Day +100 post- HSCT despite intensive prophylaxis with immunosuppressive agents. Numerous risk factors are associated wit h the development of aGvHD. Two of the most important ris k factors for developing Grade B-D aGvHD are the use of stem cell grafts from unrelated donors ( Flowers et al 2011, Arora et al 2009 ) and the use of MAC regimens (Jagasia et al 2012). Allogeneic transplant patients receiving stem cell grafts from donors most genetically unlike themselves (unrelated donors and/or patient-donor pairs who are mismatched at genetic loci [ ie, HLA mismatched]) have the highest risk of developing aGvHD because of the increased degree of genetic variation between donor and patient. Appr oximately 40 %-59% of adult and pediatric patients receiving allogeneic transplants from unrelated donors develop clinically signific ant moderate or severe (Grade B-D) aGvHD, despite the use of immunosuppressive aGvHD prophylaxis reg imens (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008). The prognosis for these patients is poor. First-line therapy consists of intravenous steroids, but nearly 40% of all patients with Grade B-D aGvHD are refractory to steroid -based therapy, and further treatment options are limited. Second-line therapies are associated with significant toxicities, high failure rates, and patients with steroid refractory GvHD have 1- year overall survival rates of approximately 20%-30% ( Pavletic and Fowler 2012 ). In addition, approximately 8%-30% of pa tients with unrelated donors will develop severe (Grade C-D ) aGvHD (Jagasia et al 2012, Jacobsohn 2008), with estimated 5 -year survival rates of 25% (Grade C) and 5% (Grade D) (Cahn et al 2005). Patients receiving the most cytotoxic conditioning regimens ( ie, MAC) have a somewhat increased risk of developing aGvHD thought to be due to direct cellular toxicity and damag e to the gastrointestinal tract. This promotes release of inflammatory cytokines and translocation of gut bacteria ( Harris et al 2013 ), both of which stimulate and amplify the cytokine cascade that is central to the pathophysiology of aGvHD ( Couriel et al 2004). Reduced intensity conditioning regimens have been used in older patients to avoid transplant-related morbidity and mortality, but while initial engraftment is often incomplete and mixed donor chimerism evolves over time to full donor chimerism, these regimens have not substantially truncated the risks of GvHD and the accompanying immunologically -based anti -tumor effects (Weisdorf 2017). Patients with acute leuk emia (CR1 or CR2) or MDS who have received MAC and undergo allogeneic HSCT with unrelated donor grafts represent 19% (20% adult and 17% pediatric) of allogeneic transplants in the European Union (EU) and 21% (23% adult and 17% pediatric) of allogeneic transplants in the US (Passweg et al 2016 , Pasquini and Zhu 2015). This population excludes patients with advanced disease and represents a well -defined, high-risk group that is relatively homogeneous in its risk for developing aGvHD, while remaining broad enough to represent a significant proportion of the allogeneic HSCT population. In addition, the Sponsor has included both PBSC and BM as graft sources in this study. This allows for the inclusion of CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 of 104"

Allowing grafts from these sources is not likely to affect overall background risk, because results from a Phase 3 randomized trial demonstrated no differ ence in the incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD or survival between PBSC and BM grafts from unrelated donors in patients who received either MAC or RIC (Anasetti et al 2012 ). The reduction of aGvHD is expected to be similar in both adult and pediatric patients. W ith approximately 80% adult patients estimated to be in the study, the overall background incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD is estimated to be approximately 44%. In summary, adult and ped iatric patients with acute leuk emia or MDS who undergo MAC or RIC prior to receiving PBSC or BM grafts from URDs are a patient population at high risk of aGvHD and have an unmet medical need for improved aGvHD prophylaxis therapies. 1.8. Potential Risks The defibrotide clinical development program, spanning over 20 years, comprises 8 clinical studies, as well as expanded access/compassionate use programs, examining defibrotide in both the VOD treatment and prevention settings. The overall defibrotide safety database includes patient data from clinical trial and post-approval use. As of April 2017, over 6000 adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients have been exposed to defibrotide. Through clinical trial use, a total of 1690 patients have received defibrotide: approximately 1441 patients for treatment of VOD, 179 patients for prevention of VOD, 12 patients for severe or end- stage renal disease, and 58 healthy volunteers. Through post-approval exposure and use on a named patient basis, it is estimated that 4387 patients have received defibrotide. The safety profile is consistent across clinical trial and post-approval use. Safety data for prophylactic use of defibrotide is available from the randomized, prospective Study 2004-000592-33 (prevention of VOD in high risk pediatric patients post- HSCT). In Study 2004-000592- 33, defibrotide at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day administered as prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing HSCT at high risk for VOD was generally safe and well tolerated. In the prophylactic phase of the study, 353 patients were randomized and treated (n=177 defibrotide and n=176 controls). Between patients who received defibrotide prophylaxis and patients in the control arm who received no VOD prophylaxis (but received standard care post-transplant), respectively, there were similar incidences overall of AEs (79.7% vs 80.1%), AEs leading to death (14.1% vs 10.2%), severe AEs (32.2% vs 27.8%), and AEs leading to discontinuation (7.3% vs. 6.3%). The most commonly reported AEs during the prophylactic phase of the study were typical for a high -risk pediatric population undergoing HSCT and were generally balanced between the study arms. The overall incidence of AEs considered related to defibrotide was low (5.1%). Treatment- related AEs reported in more than 1 patient were gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epistaxis (reported in 2 patients each). During the prophylactic phase of the study, hemorrhage events were reported in 31 (17.5%) patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm compared with 24 (13.6%) patients in the control arm. There was no notable difference between study arms in the incidence of any specific hemorrhage event. CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 of 104"

Defibrotide has been generally well tolerated, and the overall safety profile of defibrotide appears to be acceptable. The principal toxicity of concern continues to be the potential for increased risk of hemorrhage. Hemorrhage is commonly observed in patients following HSCT. Clinically seve re hemorrhage is reported in 12-27% of all post-HSCT patients, and in a study of over 1500 patients, the risk of post-HSCT clinically significant hemorrhage was independently associated with a diagnosis of VOD (odds ratio=2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6; Gerber et al 2008 ). Fatal hemorrhage has been reported to occur in 3-5% of all HSCT patients (Gerber et al 2008, Pihusch et al 2006, Nevo et al 1998). In this population, causality is difficult to determine given multiple comorbidities in VOD patients with associated organ dysfunction such as infection/sepsis, coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated intravascular coagulation, GvHD, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and systemic inflammatory reaction. Therefore, given the potential benefit to patients in decreasing the incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD (Section 1.4), and no appreciable safety concerns in data from the use of defibrotide in the treatment and prevention of VOD post-HSCT, the benefit-risk evaluation is considered to be positive for this study of defibrotide for the prevention of aGvHD.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan This is a Phase 2, prospective, randomized, open- label study comparing the efficacy and safety of defibrotide added to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (defibrotide prophylaxis arm) vs standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone ( standard of care arm) for the prevention of a GvHD as measured by the cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post- HSCT in adult and pediatric patients who are at high risk of developing aGvHD. Investigative site diagnosis of aGvHD and treatment decisions will be based on clinical judgment with guidance on clinical data collection and clinical staging from the recommendations of MAGIC (Harris et al 2016; Appendix 2). An overview of the study design is illustrated in Figure 1. A total of 150 patients are planned for enrollment in the study. After informed consent and/ or assent is obtained from patients, parents /legal guardians or representatives, as applicable, screening procedures will be performed within 28 days of the scheduled start of the patient’s HSCT conditioning regimen. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive defibrotide prophylaxis 25 mg/kg/day in addition to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (“defibrotide prophylaxis arm”) or standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone (“standard of care arm”) in a 1:1 ratio. Standard of care immunoprophylaxis will consist of MTX or MMF + calcineurin inhibitor (CSA or TAC ) +/- ATG, with dosing and treatment schedules per local institutional guidelines, physician preference, and patient need. Randomization will be stratified by age at screening (<17 years vs ≥17 years), geographic al region (North America vs Europe), and use of ATG (ATG vs no-ATG) using an interactive response technology (I RT). Use of ATG will be limited to 30% of patients . All patients enrolled in the study ( defibrotide prophylaxis and standard of care arms) should receive individualized standard of care immunoprophylaxis therapy based on local institutional guidelines, physician preference, and patient need. This standard of care therapy , intended to serve as a study control for comparison with those patients randomized to receiving defibrotide prophylaxis, will not be provided by the Sponsor . Patients randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis arm should receive standard of care immunoprophylaxis therapy added to defibrotide prophylaxis. Prophylactic use of defibrotide added to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (defibrotide prophylaxis arm) will be compared to standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone ( standard of care arm). Patients randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis arm will receive defibrotide prior to the start of conditioning therapy (may have completed 1 -4 doses of defibrotide prior to conditioning) for a recommended duration of ≥21 days (and stopping no later than Day +30 post- HSCT) at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day given as a 2-hour intravenous infusion every 6 hours.

Investigative site c linical diagnosis of aGvHD will be based on clinical, laboratory, and histological assessments on site. Collection of data for determination of clinical diagnosis of aGvHD and clinical staging of aGvHD will be based on the recommendations of MAGIC (Harris et al 2016; Appendix 2). Grading of aGvHD for assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997; Appendix 3). As sensitivity analyses, all aGvHD-related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC (Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 4).

For both treatment arms of the study, patients who develop aGvHD should be treated for aGvHD based on local institutional guidelines, physician preference, and patient need . Patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm diagnosed with aGvHD prior to Day +30 post-HSCT and receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis may continue to receive defibrotide at the discretion of their physician up to a maximum of Day +30 post- HSCT. Patients in the standard of care arm will not receive defibrotide for the treatment of aGvHD. If a patient in either the defibrotide prophylaxis arm or standard of care arm develops VOD during the course of the study, the investigator may treat with Defitelio (commercially available defibrotide) if clinically indicated. Investigators should not use study drug for treatment of VOD . If patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm are diagnosed with VOD prior to Day +30 post-HSCT and are receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis, they may continue to receive defibrotide up to Day +30 post- HSCT and start Defitelio treatment thereafter. They will need to clearly demonstrate the diagnosis of VOD and the use of Defitelio should be clearly stated as for use in VOD. Details of VOD diagnosis will be captu red as per the schedule of procedures and assessments. Efficacy will also be assessed through monitoring for aGvHD -free survival, GvHD-free and relapse-free survival, relapse of disease, relapse-free survival, cGvHD, and overall survival. Steroid use will be evaluated for the treatment of aGvHD by Day +180 post- HSCT.Other assessments include HRQoL, and hospital resource utilization. Measurement of biomarkers in blood for assessment of their potential as predictive or diagnostic biomarkers of GvHD and response to defibrotide prophylaxis will also be performed. Safety will be assessed through monitoring of AEs, SAEs, vital signs, physical examination s, clinical laboratory tests, and Karnofsky/Lansky performance scales (PSs). In addition, the following parameters will be assessed for safety: • Time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and cumulative incidence of graft failure by Day +100 post- HSCT • Incidence of infectious disease by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT (see Section 6.8.7).

Rationale for Study Design and Control Arm Standard of care immunoprophylaxis was selected as the control for this study, and the options available for use as aGvHD immune-prophylaxis are th e most common regimens offered to patients with URDs receiving either MAC or RIC. Use of placebo control was considered unethical due to increased risk of infection, bleeding, possible fluid overload, and patient discomfort should additional venous access need to be obtained in order to blind study staff to treatment arm assignment. Criteria for diagnosis of aGvHD and staging of aGvHD organ involvement in both arms of the study using the MAGIC guidelines is an effort to minimize the subjectivity in aGvHD diagnosis and staging and distribute this risk equally between study arms in this open- label trial. While comprehensive, the MAGIC guidelines do not cover every conceivable scenario; thus Medical Monitor adjudication may be required. Additional informatio n (eg., related labs, adverse events, concomitant medications, etc.) will be recorded for adjudication purposes. 3.3. Study Duration and Dates The study is expected to last approximately 24 months, with an estimated enrollment period of 18 months for the planned total of 150 patients . Duration of participation for each patient is expected to last approximately 6 months. The study will consist of a s creening period lasting up to 28 days, a treatment period of variable time (dependent on length of conditioning and time on defibrotide/observation), and a follow-up period up to 180 days post- HSCT (the last visit in the study for each patient) . The end of trial is the date when the last patient is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study, at the follow-up of Day +180 post- HSCT, early termination visit, or last visit at which the patient is assessed or receives an intervention as part of the study, if the patient does not complete the Day +180 post- HSCT/early termination visit.

STUDY TREATMENT 5.1. Description of Treatment 5.1.1. Study Drug Defibrotide (defibrotide sodium) is a clear light yellow to brown solution supplied as 200 mg/ 2.5 mL (concentration of 80 mg/mL) in single- patient-use clear, glass vials. After dilution with 0.9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water (D5W), the final solution should be free of particulates and turbidity. Excipients include sodium citrate dihydrate, hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), and water for injection. 5.1.2. Reference Therapy The reference therapy in this study is standard of care according to local institutional guidelines , physician preference, and patient need , excluding defibrotide and agents that increase the risk of bleeding (see Section 5.7). Reference therapy will not be provided by the Sponsor. Please refer to SmPC or approved label for warnings and precautions associated with reference therapy. 5.2. Treatments Administered Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive defibrotide 25 mg/kg/day added to standard of care immunoprophylaxis or standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone. 5.2.1. Defibrotide Administration Defibrotide solution is administered intravenously by study site personnel at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day, divided into 4 equal doses of 6.25 mg/kg/dose given as 2-hour infusions every 6 hours. Defibrotide may be held for surgical procedures or to accommodate other urgent medication delivery without necessitating dose modification. For surgical procedures, it is recommended that defibrotide administration be completed more than 2 hours prior to intervention. Scheduling may also be adjusted to accommodate other medications and interventions, such as dialysis. While the intent is to treat every 6 hours, the schedule may be adjusted without rendering the patient ineligible or causing protocol violation as long as the daily dose does not substantially alter. A dosing window of ± 30 minutes is allowed with a minimum of 2 hours separating the end of 1 infusion and the beginning of another. Individual doses of defibrotide are determined for individual patients based on body weight at baseline. B aseline is defined as the day defibrotide starts for the defibrotide prophylaxis arm or conditioning therapy starts for the standard of care arm . To facilitate efficient drug administration, e ach of the 4 divided doses per day will be rounded to the nearest 10 mg for patients weighing >35 kg and the nearest 5 mg for patients weighing ≤35 kg.

Patients must undergo Day +14 post- HSCT assessments before hospital discharge. If a patient is discontinued from study/study drug prior to Day + 14 post-HSCT, the Day + 14 post-HSCT assessments must be completed on the day of study/study drug discontinuation ( ±2 days). 5.2.1.2. Extended Defibrotide Administration in the Defibrotide Prophy laxis Arm for Patients who Develop aGvHD Patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm diagnosed with aGvHD prior to Day +30 post- HSCT and receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis may continue to receive defibrotide at the discretion of their physician up to Day +30 post- HSCT. Note: There are no known benefits in the use of defibrotide as treatment for aGvHD. Patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm who have discontinued defibrotide prophylaxis and are subsequently diagnosed with aGvHD prior to Day+30 may not re- start defibrotide as treatment for aGvHD . 5.2.1.3. Defitelio Rescue Treatment for Patients who Develop VOD If a patient in either the defibrotide prophylaxis arm or standard of care arm develops VOD during the course of the study, the investigator may treat with Defitelio (commercially available defibrotide) if clinically indicated. Investigators should not use study drug for th e treatment of VOD. If patients in the defibrotide prophylaxis arm are diagnosed with VOD prior to Day +30 post-HSCT and are receiving defibrotide prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis, they may continue to receive defibrotide up to Day +30 post- HSCT and start Defitelio treatment thereafter. The patient must have a documented diagnosis of VOD and the use of Defitelio as treatment for VOD must be clearly indicated on the appropriate case report form . Details of the criteria used to diagnose VOD must be captured on the appropriate case report form. Defitelio may be administered as treatment for VOD until resolution of VOD or hospital discharge, whichever is sooner, and may continue beyond Day +30 post- HSCT.

Reference Therapy Patients randomized to the standard of care arm should receive standard of care immunoprophylaxis therapy according to local institutional guidelines , physician preference, and patient need. The standard of care options availa ble are intended to serve as study control for comparison with those patients randomized to receive defibrotide prophylaxis in addition to standard of care immunoprophylaxis. Administration of standard of care immunoprophylaxis should be based on local ins titutional guidelines , physician preference, and patient need regarding dosing and duration of each immunosuppressive agent. Please refer to SmPC or approved label for warnings and precautions associated with reference therapy. 5.3. Selection and Timing of Defibrotide Dosing for Each Patient All patients who receive defibrotide will receive the same dosa ge (25 mg/kg/day divided into 4 equal doses of 6.25 mg/kg/dose) and will follow the same regimen (2-hour infusions every 6 hours daily ). To facilitate effici ent drug administration, e ach of the 4 divided doses per day will be rounded to the nearest 10 mg for patients weighing >35 kg and the nearest 5 mg for patients weighing ≤35 kg. 5.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Arms Patients will be randomly assig ned to receive defibrotide prophylaxis in addition to standard of care immunoprophylaxis or standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone in a 1:1 ratio in an open-label fashion after they qualify for participation in the study. The investigator or designee will access IRT to obtain treatment assignments for patients eligible to participate in the study. 5.5. Randomization A copy of the master randomization code will be provided to the head of the Sponsor’s Quality Department or a designee in a sealed envelope, and the Sponsor will be blinded to the master randomization code. Randomization will be stratified by age at screening (<17 years vs ≥ 17 years), geographical region (North America vs Europe), and use of ATG (ATG vs no-ATG) using an I RT. Use of ATG will be limited to 30% of patients . A permuted block design with above stratification factors will be used. 5.6. Blinding Blinding is not applicable in this open- label study.

However, per the MAGIC guidelines, aGvHD will be considered present and counted as an event in the evaluation of all aGvHD endpoints if the confidence l evel for the diagnosis is either “Confirmed” or “Probable” per criteria detailed in Table 1. Confidence levels for attribution of symptoms to a diagnosis of aGvHD are based on treatment decisions made by the clinician. When symptoms develop that are concerning for aGvHD, an overall confidence level is assigned to the diagnosis of aGvHD based on the highest organ- specific confidence level assigned as supported by categorized facts (eg, biopsy results and infectious studies) and by clinical action ( Table 1). Thus, each target organ is assigned a confidence level and the highest confidence level in any organ becomes the overall confidence level for the diagnosis of aGvHD (“Confirmed” is the highest confidence level). Please see Appendix 2 for further details on the MAGIC guidelines for aGvHD data collection, staging and grading. Table 1: Confidence Level Criteria for Diagnosis of aGvHD Confidence level Pathologic evidence Clinician assessment Treatment for aGVHD Comments Confirmed (GvHD diagnosis proven by biopsy) Unequivocal pathologic evidence of GvHD GvHD is the etiology for symptoms Yes GvHD is clearly present even if other etiologies may co - exist simultaneously Probable (Clinician assessed as GvHD diagnosis and/or treatment started) Not required GvHD most likely etiology for symptoms Yes GvHD is most likely present but other etiologies may also explain the symptoms and there is insufficient evidence to make a confirmed diagnosis Possible (aGvHD in differential) Not required GvHD in differential diagnosis No GvHD may be present, but other etiologies are favored to the degree that GvHD treatment is not initiated Negative (only 1 required) Unequivocal evidence of a diagnosis other than GvHD (eg, drug rash) GvHD is not considered as an explanation for the symptoms No and the symptoms resolve without GvHD treatment a A “negative” biopsy (eg, normal skin) is not unequivocal evidence of a diagnosis other than GvHD Note: Because aGvHD rarely occurs prior to Day +14 post -HSCT and symptoms such as rash, nausea, and diarrhea are often present, a confidence level of “Possible” is not entertained in this early time period. However, when aGvHD is diagnosed and treated, a confidence level of “Probable” or Confirmed” can be assig ned during the first 2 weeks post -HSCT depending on whether aGvHD is biopsy -proven. a If GvHD in 1 organ (eg, gastrointestinal tract) is being treated and another sy mptomatic organ does not have GvHD (eg , liver biopsy confirms VOD and absence of GVHD) , then the symptom in the non-Gv HD organ does not need to resolve without treatment for the organ to be considered uninvolved (and negative confidence level ). aGvHD=acute graft -versus-host disease.

Pathology results will be used to assess aGvHD target organ confidence levels per MAGIC ( Appendix 2). The primary endpoint is the cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT and assigned an overall confidence level for aGvHD diagnosis of either “Confirmed” or “Probable.” 6.3.1.2. Staging of aGvHD Staging of aGvHD will be based on target organ criteria as described per MAGIC ( Appendix 2). 6.3.1.3. Grading of aGvHD Grading of aGvHD for assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997; Appendix 3). As sensitivity analyses, all GvHD -related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC ( Harris et al 2016 ; Appendix 4). Refer to Section 9.8 for additional details. 6.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Secondary efficacy assessments include Grade B-D aGvHD -free survival by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT; cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +180 post- HSCT; cumulative incidence of Grade C-D a GvHD by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT; and cumulative incidence of relapse by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT. 6.3.2.1.

Evaluation of Steroid Use in the Treatment of aGvHD The incidence of systemic steroid use in the treatment of aGvHD will be evaluated by Day +180 post-HSCT. 6.5. Health-Related Quality of Life Patient-reported outcomes, including multi-dimensional questionnaires to measure quality of life and functional status, are a powerful method used to assess a patient’s experience with an experimental therapeutic regimen. Different HRQoL questionnaires will be administered to adults, and children and their parents, as applicable ( Table 2).

Adverse Events 6.8.1.1. Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered related to study drug or procedure. Adverse events i nclude, but are not limited to, the following: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) patient deterioration due to primary illness; (3) intercurrent illness; (4) drug interaction; an d/or (5) laboratory values assessed as clinically significant by the investigator . All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the patient, determined from laboratory findings, vital signs, physical examinations, or other means, must be recorded. Patients should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis (including syndromes) based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. When a diagnosis or syndrome is established or confirmed, the diagnosis or syndrome, not the individual signs/symptoms, should be documented as the AE. CONFIDENTIAL Page 47 of 104"

Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, severity, seriousness, outcome, action taken with study drug, and causal relationship to the study drug or procedure. 6.8.1.2. Severity Assessment Adverse events will be classified by the investigator using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03. All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE v4.03.

Serious Adverse Events An SAE is an AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A.II.B: • Is fatal (results in dea th) • Is life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe. G rade 4 laboratory values secondary to HSCT are not necessarily serious unless the patient was at immediate risk of death.) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant incapacity or disability , defined as substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medical event Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above in the definition of an SAE. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Suspected tr ansmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. An AE should be recorded as an SAE when it meets at least one of the criteria for seriousness. A patient’s underlying disease that results in the initial h ospitalization for HSCT is not considered an SAE. The following reasons for hospitalization are also NOT considered SAEs: • Procedures that were planned prior to the patient entering the study • Social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deteriorati on in the patient’s general condition • Procedures that are elective in nature and not related to worsening of an underlying condition Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs the hospitalization, it is an SAE. CONFIDENTIAL Page 49 of 104"

Emergency room care without admission to a hospital is considered outpatient care. Overdose, medication errors, and drug misuse of the study drug are considered reportable experiences and should be reported by study site personnel on an Other Reportable Experience Form. The form and contact information for submission of the form will be provided to the study sites separately. 6.8.1.4. Causal Relationship to Study Drug or Procedure The investigator’s assessment of the relationship of AE to study drug and to study procedures is required. The relationship or association of the study drug or procedure in causing or contributing to the AE wil l be characterized using the following classification and criteria: Related to Study Drug or Procedure There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug or procedure caused the event, ie, there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. Some tempo ral relationship exists between the event and the administration of the study drug or procedure and the event is unlikely to be explained by the patient’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not Related to Study Drug or Procedure There is not a reasonable possibility or clinical evidence that the study drug or procedure caused the event. The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the patient’s underlying medical conditions, concomitant therapy, or accident; or there is no temporal relationship between study drug or procedure and the event. 6.8.1.5. Adverse Event Recording and Reporting For patients in either the defibrotide prophylaxis or standard of care arm, the investigator must record all AEs and SAEs that occur from the time written informed c onsent is obtained until Day +63 post- HSCT (or screen failure), regardless of their relationship to study drug or procedure. For patients who do not receive HSC T, AEs will be collected up to 70 days after baseline. In addition, a ny SAE assessed as related to study drug or study procedures by the investigator after Day +6 3 post-HSCT, must be reported as described below. SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee using the SAE Reporting Form within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study site personnel. The SAE Reporting Form and contact information for submission of the form, will be provided to the study sites separately. CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 of 104"

Follow-up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events All AEs and SAEs assessed as not related to study drug or procedure, including clinically significant laboratory tests, or physical examination findings, must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first. AEs and SAEs assessed as related to study drug or procedure will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient’s safety, or until th e event stabilizes, or the patient is lost to follow up. If resolved, a resolution date should be recorded . AEs and SAEs resulting in termination will be followed to the satisfactory resolution and determination of outcome as ascertained by the investigator (and/or the Sponsor or its designee). The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the event. This may include additional clinical la boratory testing or investigations, examinations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals as is practical, according to the Sponsor’s requests. The investigator should provide follow-up SAE information for any updates to information previously provided to the Sponsor or as requested by the Sponsor. 6.8.1.7. Pregnancy Patients’ HSCT preparative regimens commonly include agents which may cause infertility and are known to have teratogenic effects . As such, there is a low likelihood that patients may become pregnant. H owever, due to the teratogenic effects of the preparative regimens, and the unknown effects of defibrotide use during pregnancy, highly effective methods of contraception are required (see Section 4.1, inclusion criterion #7). If a female patient (or female partner of a male patient) of childbearing potential becomes pregnant at any time after the first dose of study drug and up to Day +63 post- HSCT, it must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee using the Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study site personnel. S tudy drug must be stopped for any pregnant patient (see Section 6.9.1). The pregnancy of a female patient (or female partner of a male patient) must be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known, and in the case of a live birth, for 6 months following the birth of the child.

Regulatory Reporting The Sponsor or its designee is responsible for reporting to the relevant regulatory authorities, central ethics committees (CECs), and participating investigators, and will report in accordance with ICH guidelines, the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the EU Clinical Trial Directive, and local regulatory requirements. The reference safety information to determine expectedness of SAEs is specified in the IB for defibrotide. All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities, CECs, and all participating investigators no later than 15 days after first knowledge of the event. SUSARs that are fatal or life -threatening will be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities, CECs, and participating investigators no later than 7 day s after knowledge of such a case, and relevant follow-up information provided within an additional 8 days. Once a year throughout the clinical study, a report listing of all SUSARs (and SAEs if required by local regulation) that have occurred during this period and a report of the patient's safety will be submitted to the applicable authorities, and as otherwise required by local laws. Reporting of SAEs by the investigator to his/her local IRB/IEC will be done in accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC. Adequate documentation must be maintained showing that the IRB/IEC was properly notified. 6.8.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at local laboratories. It is anticipated that patients will undergo laboratory testing both as an inpatient and an outpatient. The investigator will provide to the Sponsor or its designee the current licensure and laboratory reference ranges for all laboratories used during the study. Refer to Appendix 1 for the individual laboratory tests to be performed during the study. If a patient is at risk for exceeding maximal allowable blood draw limits (per Seattle Children’s Hospital Guideline for Maximum Blood Volumes, Appendix 6), the blood draw schedules for laboratory assessments may be adjusted per local physician ’s practice to ensure patient safety and to remain below the blood draw maximums. Laboratory values assessed as clinically significant by the investigator are AEs and must be recorded as AEs (see Sections 6.8.1.1 and Section 6.8.1.5). CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 104"

Physical Examination Complete physical examination, including weight and assessments of the skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, and a general assessment (including edema) will be performed. Height will be measured at baseline only. Adverse events determined from physicial examinations must be recorded (see Section 6.8.1.5). 6.8.5. Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment Patients will be monitored for engraftment per the Schedule of Procedures and Assessments (Appendix 1). If a patient is discontinued early from the study, engraftment status can be reported at the early terminatio n visit. The investigator will determine the dates for neutrophil engraftment and platelet engraftment based on an algorithm, as described in the subsequent sentences. The dates for neutrophil and platelet engraftment will be recorded separately. The date of neutrophil engraftment is defined as the first date after HSCT of an absolute neutrophil count >0.5 x 10 9/L that is maintained for 3 consecutive days. The definition of “absolute neutrophil count” includes both segmented neutrophils and “bands”, immature neutrophils. The date of platelet engraftment is defined as the first date after HSCT of a platelet count >20 x 10 9/L without a platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days. 6.8.6. Karnofsky/Lansky Performance Scores Functional impairment will be assessed usin g the Karnofsky PS for patients ≥16 years of age and the Lansky PS for patients <16 years ( Table 4).

PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 9.1. General Considerations All study data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics (sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables (eg, age, weight) and by the number and percentage of patients for categorical variables (eg, gender, race). All summaries, statistical analyses, and individual patient data listin gs described below will be completed using Version 9.3 or later of the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Inc Cary, NC). 9.2. Tests of Hypotheses and Significance Levels The primary objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of defibrotide added to standard of care immunoprophylaxis (defibrotide prophylaxis arm) vs standard of care immunoprophylaxis alone (standard of care arm) for the prevention of aGvHD as measured by the cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT in adult and pediatric patients. The trial is hypothesis generating and is not powered to detect minimal clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups at a signifi cant (type I) error level of 5%. The trial is designed to obtain meaningful estimates of the treatment difference of the cumulative incidence rates between the 2 treatment arms . 9.3. Determination of Sample Size The sample size of 150 patients (75 patients per treatment arm) will provide a 90% CI of (-0.28, -0.03) for the treatment difference of the primary endpoint (ie, cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT), assuming the cumulative incidence of 28.6% and 44% for the defibrotide prophylaxis arm and standard of care arm, respectively. The calculati on of the CI is based on the large sample normal approximation. The 44% cumulative incidence for the standard of care arm is based on published studies and results from a previously conducted study (Study 2004-000592-33). The 28.6% cumulative incidence for the defibrotide prophylaxis arm is projected based on a relative 35% improvement from the standard of care arm. 9.4. Analysis Sets The ITT Analysis Set will include all randomized patients. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized . This is the primary analysis set for efficacy analysis. The Safety Analysis Set will include all patients randomized to the defibrotide prophylaxis arm who receive at least 1 dose of defibrotide and all patients randomized to the standard of care arm. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received. This is the primary analysis set for safety analysis. CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 of 104"

Handling of Dropouts and Missing Data Every effort will be made to minimize missing data. For efficacy analysis with time-to-event methodology, data for patients who discontinue from the study early will be included in the analysis of efficacy endpoints up to their censoring time. 9.6. Pooling of Investigation Centers Data from all study centers will be pooled. Data may also be pooled by region or country for exploratory or sensitivity analyses, as appropriate. 9.7. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group. The summaries of demographics and basel ine characteristics will be provided for the Safety Analysis Set and the ITT Analysis Set . Relevant medical history findings and prior medications will be summarized by system organ class and anatomical therapeutic chemical codes, respectively, using descriptive statistics. 9.8. Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses Grading of aGvHD for assessment of the primary and applicable secondary efficacy endpoints will be based on the IBMTR Severity Index ( Rowlings et al 1997). As sensitivity analyses, all GvHD-related efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed using the modified Consensus Criteria detailed in the aGvHD grading system from MAGIC ( Harris et al 2016 ). 9.8.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using the IT T Analysis Set . The primary efficacy en dpoint is cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT. It will be estimated by the cumulative incidence competing risk estimator, as described by Marubini and Valsecchi (1995) . Death prior to Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT will be considered as the competing risk. The difference i n the cumulative incidence between the 2 treatment arms will be estimated with 2 -sided 90% CI (Zhang and Fine 2008 ) and the treatment comparison will be based on the Gray’s test ( Gray 1988 ). As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will be repeated by censoring patients in the standard of care arm at the time of rescue Defitelio initiation if patients in the standard of care arm received rescue Defitelio treatment for VOD.

The timing variable is defined as the number of days from time 0 to the onset of aGvHD or death by Day +100 post-HSCT. If a patient does not have aGvHD and is not followed for 100 days, the censoring for that endpoint will be defined at the t ime of last available evaluation of aGvHD. 9.8.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints and Analyse s Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following: • Grade B-D aGvHD -free survival by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT • Cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +180 post- HSCT • Cumulative incidence of Grade C-D aGvHD by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT • Cumulative incidence of relapse by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT The treatment differences along with the 90% CI will be presented for the secondary efficacy endpoint. These secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested for difference between treatment groups without multiplicity adjustments, and nominal p-values will be reported. 9.8.2.1. Grade B-D aGvHD -free Survival by Days +100 and +180 Post- HSCT Kaplan-Meier estimates of Grade B -D aGvHD-free survival by Day +100 and Day +180 post- HSCT will be presented for the 2 treatment arms . The grade B -D aGvHD or death will be considered an event in the analyses. Patients will be censored at the last available evaluation of aGvHD if no event occurs. The hazard ratio (HR) of defibrotide prophylaxis arm compared with standartd of care arm from the Cox proportional hazard model will be presented along with the 90% CI. The log rank test will be performed to test th e treatment difference. 9.8.2.2. Cumulative I ncidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +180 Post- HSCT and Cumulative I ncidence of Grade C-D aGvHD by Days +100 and +180 Post- HSCT In addition to cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +100 post-HSCT, cumulative incidence of Grade B-D aGvHD by Day +180 post- HSCT and cumulative incidence of Grade C- D aGvHD by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT will be analyzed similar ly to the primary efficacy endpoint. 9.8.2.3. Cumulative I ncidence of Relapse by Days +100 and +180 Post- HSCT Cumulative incidence of relapse by Days +100 and +180 post- HSCT will be analyzed similar ly to the primary efficacy endpoint of treating death prior to disease relapse as a competing event. 9.9. Steroid Use in the Treatment of aGv HD by Day +180 Post -HSCT The cumulative incidence of systemic steroid use in the trea tment of aGvHD by Day +180 post-HSCT will be analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy endpoint using a competing risk analysis.

DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE Steps to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and associated personnel prior to the study, a nd periodic monitoring visits by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee. Data are reviewed throughout the study through programmed checks, reports, and manual review. Any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or designees as appropriate. 10.1. Clinical Data Management The standard procedures for handling and processing clinical data will be followed in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and ICH Regulations and Guidelines, Good Clinical Practices, and the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of Jazz Pharmaceuticals or the contract research organization (CRO). A comprehensive Data Management Plan (DMP) will be developed to document data sources, systems, and handling. The lack of standardized approaches toward collec tion and evaluation of staging data for aGvHD diagnosis likely contributes to why promising GvHD treatments reported from single centers have failed to show benefit in randomized multicenter clinical trials ( Harris et al 2016 ). Collection of data pertainin g to aGvHD diagnosis and clinical staging will be done according to MAGIC guidelines ( Appendix 2), which have been developed through international e xpert consensus opinion to standardize the diagnosis and clinical staging of GvHD. 10.2. Electronic Case R eport Forms All patient data required by the protocol to be reported to the sponsor on each trial patient will be recorded by clinical site staff in eCRFs developed by Jazz Pharmaceuticals or its designee, unless such data are transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, central labo ratory data, data from an I RT, etc). Electronic data sources will be identified in the DMP. The Principal Investigator must review the eCRFs and provide his/her signature certifying that he/she has reviewed the data and considers them complete and accurate to the best of his/her knowledge. Regardless of who signs or completes the forms, it is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to ensure their completeness and accuracy. CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 of 104"

Eligibility must be confirmed before ra ndomization. Review of planned conditioning regimen for GvHD prophylaxis is required to ensure that the eligibility criteria will continue to be met prior to randomization . d. Randomization of patients should be the last screening activity performed. e. Medical history, information pertaining to underlying disease, any prior HSCTs, and current HSCT , should be collected. f. Prior medications include those current at the time of screening through baseline, and all prior therapies for the malignant disease . g. Height is only required at the baseline visit. h. HLA typing information should be available prior to HSCT Day. i. CBC and WBC differential performed at least 2 times weekly from day of transplant (i e, HSCT Day [Day 0]) until ANC > 0.5 x 109/L for 3 days and platelet count >20 x 109/L without a platelet transfusion in the preceding 7 days. CBC then performed weekly through Day +100 post-HSCT and at Day +180 post -HSCT. j. Blood chemistries include: serum creatinine, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT. Blood chem istries performed at least 2 times weekly until hospital discharge. Blood chemistries performed weekly after hospital discharge until Day +100 post-HSCT, then at Day +180 post -HSCT. If a patient is at risk for exceeding maximal allowable blood draw limits (per Seattle Children’s Hospital Guideline for Maximum Blood Volumes, Appendix 6), the blood draw schedules for laboratory assessments may be adjusted per local physician’s practice to ensure patient safety and to remain below the blood draw maximums. k. Infectious disease markers will be assessed per institutional practice to include at minimum: CMV, Hepatitis panel (HepB SAb, HepB SAg, HepB Core Ab, HepC Ab) during screening , and CMV at Day s +100 and +180 post-HSCT. l. Disease evaluation for acute leukemia and MDS (performed locally) includes a BM aspirate and /or biopsy for pathology and cytogenetics. Cytogenetics, molecular, or other institutional a ssessment to determine Minimal Residual Disease will be recorded at screening to document patient’s pre-transplant Minimal Residual Disease status. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are required for assessment of disease relapse. If disease relapse assessment can be made using only an aspirate sample, results from assessment of a core biopsy are not required. Disease relapse is defined by either morphological evidence of acute leukemia or MDS consistent with pre-transplant features, documented or not by biops y. The event is defined as an increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, documented or not by biopsy. Disease relapse will be diagnosed when there is morphological or clinical evidence of i) reappearance of leukemia bla st cells in the peripheral blood, or ii) >5% blasts in the BM, not attributable to another cause (eg, BM regeneration), or iii) the appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes (MES specific) within the B M, with or without falling donor chimerism, or iv) the development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid, or v) institution of therapy to treat relapsed disease, including donor lymphocyte infusion. m. Results of a biopsy and aspirate performed prior to HSCT as part of the standard of care will be recorded during the screening period. This bone marrow biopsy and aspirate is not required to be performed between D -28 and baseline. n. Serum pregnancy test must be performed ≤30 days before the start of the transplant conditioni ng regimen. In addition, pregnancy test must be performed prior to treatment with study drug , at Day +28 post-HSCT, at Day +63 post-HSCT, 1 week after the last dose of defibrotide, and as required by local guidelines . Pregnancy test is required for females of child-bearing potential (ie , not postmenopausal or surgically sterile), and may be performed per institutional practices. o. Functional impairment will be assessed using the Karnofsky PS for patients ≥16 years of age and the Lansky PS for patients <1 6 years. p. MAGIC staging/assessmen t should be completed at least 1) weekly through Week 13, at Day +100 post -HSCT and at Day +180 post -HSCT (aGvHD present or not) and 2) at GvHD diagnosis and/or GvHD treatment and for 4 weeks of follow -up for both events (to obtain 4 weeks response data). Example: If GvHD is diagnosed at Day +100 post - HSCT, MAGIC staging/assessments are required at GvHD diagnosis (Day +100 post -HSCT) and for 4 weeks of follow -up (with assessment periods ending on Days +107, +114, +121, and +128 p ost-HSCT). The last visit of the study is the Day +180 post -HSCT visit, thus follow -up visits are not required to continue beyond the Day +180 post - HSCT visit. CONFIDENTIAL Page 83 of 104"

Patient GvHD staging is reported once per assessment period except for weeks in which GvHD is first diagnosed or treated, in which case the GvHD staging should be completed on those days as well. Guidance: Patients may be assessed for GvHD more than once per week (eg, inpatient where daily assessments are often performed) but only 1 assessment should be reported. The GvHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment period should be: o If GvHD staging was performed only once during an assessment period, report the staging and date of the clinical assessment. o If GvHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, and the staging did not chang e during the assessment period, report the staging and date closest to the end of the assessment period. o If GvHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, report the staging for the day corresponding to t he peak staging for that period. If the peak stage occurred on more than 1 day, report the day closest to the end of the assessment period. o If either GvHD diagnosis or treatment develops during an assessment period, report the staging on the day of GvHD diagnosis a nd GvHD treatment on the GvHD Diagnosis or Treatment form and report the peak staging from the assessment period on the Weekly form . These might be the same date but require separate forms (Weekly Assessment and GvHD Diagnosis/Treatment forms). o For assessment periods where no staging is available, report that the patient was not assessed. Unless patient status is “Off Study”, GvHD weekly assessment forms need to be completed for all 13 weeks, at Day +100 post -HSCT and at Day +180 post -HSCT. If the patient was not assessed in Week 13, continue to report Weekly forms, regardless of whether GvHD is active, until the final reporting week is one in which patient was assessed. q. GvHD assessment questions regarding individual case scenarios may require Med ical Monitor adjudication. Additional information (eg, related labs, AEs, concomitant medications, etc.) will be recorded for adjudication purposes. r. Up to Day +30 post -HSCT. s. Hospitalization data includes dates of hospitalization, dates in ICU, and dates of readmissions . t.

These could occur at di fferent times . The term GVHD Onset will not be used in this guidance, and the terms GVHD Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment will be used instead . The definition of each is as follows – The aGVHD Diagnosis date is the earlier of the following: o Date physician clearly determines, or confirms in response to a query, a diagnosis of acute GVHD. (Probable confidence level [CL]) o Date a biopsy was performed that demonstrates the presence of GVHD ( Confirmed CL) The aGVHD Treatment date is: o Date systemic treatment was started for GVHD ( Probable CL) Guidance: GVHD Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment may be reported on the same date for a patient. If GVHD Treatment occurs within 3 days of GVHD Diagnosis, then only one set of GVHD data and samples is needed for the patient. If GVHD Treatment occurs greater than 3 days from GVHD Diagnosis, a new event has occurred and separate data forms and samples will be collected. ASSESSMENT PERIODS MAGIC Staging/Assessment should be completed at least (a) weekly through Day 98/Week 14 (aGVHD present or not) and (b) at GVHD Diagnosis and/or GVHD Treatment and for four weeks of follow-up for both events (to obtain 4 week response data). MAGIC Assessment period: One week. Each assessment period corresponds to a 7 day interval from the first day of stem cell infusion (ie , ends on 7, 14, 21, etc, days from the first day of transplant). Patient GVHD staging is reported once per assessment period except for weeks in which GVHD is first diagnosed or treated, in which case the GVHD staging should be completed on those days as well.

The GVHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment period should be: o If GVHD staging was performed only once during an assessment period, report the staging and date of the clinical assessment. o If GVHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, and the staging did not change during the assessment period, report the staging and date closest to the end of the assessment period. o If GVHD staging was performed on multiple days during an assessment period, report the staging for the day corresponding to the peak staging for that period. If the peak stage occurred on more than one day, report the day closest to the end of the assessment period. o If either GVHD Diagnosis or Treatment develops during an assessment period, report the staging on the day of GVHD Diagnosis and GVHD Treatment on the GVHD Diagnosis or Treatment form and report the peak staging from the assessment period on the Weekly form . These might be the same date but require separate forms (Weekly Assessment and GVHD Dx/Tx forms). o For assessment periods where no staging is available, report that the patient was not assessed. Unless patient status is “Off Study”, GVHD weekly assessment forms need to be completed for all 14 weeks. If the patient was not assessed in Week 14, continue to report Weekly forms, regardless of whether GVHD is active, until the final reporting week is one in which patient was assessed. Typically this will require reporting only until Week 15. GVHD STAGING once treatment begins: During the initial treatment response period (four weeks), the GVHD staging should be reported for the date CLOSEST to the seven day interval from the start of treatment. For example, week 4 corresponds to days 22 -28 post transplant. If a patient begins systemic steroid treatment for GVHD on day 24, the assessment reported for week 5 should be the one that occurred closest to day 31 (i.e, at a seven day interval). This practice allows for the GVHD staging at start of treatment and day 28 post- treatment to be used to determine day 28 treatment response. Guidance 1: Steroid therapy alone cannot determine the date of GVHD treatment because patients may be receiving steroids for other indications. The date of GVHD treatment is the first date that systemic therapy is given for GVHD (as indicated on the GVHD treatment form). Guidance 2 : Patients may be assessed for GVHD more than once per week (eg, inpatient where daily assessments are often performed). The GVHD staging(s) and corresponding date that should be reported for an assessment period during treatment should be the date closest to the multiple of seven days calculated from the start of treatment. SPURIOUS GVHD Spurious GVHD Diagnosis and/or Spurious GVHD Treatment can occur multiple times per patient. Occasionally, GVHD is diagno sed, but further data review (ie , biopsy results) contradict the diagnosis. For example, a skin rash thought to be GVHD is proven to be infectious. In such cases, the diagnosis/treatment and weekly forms should be revised to indicate no GVHD, confidence le vel changed to negative, and comment field used to indicate spurious diagnosis or treatment. See also Target Organ guidance (symptoms present, steroids given for non- GVHD cause). CONFIDENTIAL Page 86 of 104"

Guidance: Biopsies sometimes take place before the medical record indicates that GVHD is present. o Clinical judgment determines the presence of GVHD even if biopsy results do not agree. For example, if a patient is staged and treated, then GVHD is considered present even if a biop sy indicates absence of GVHD (ie, early GVHD skin rash may be reported as normal skin by pathologist). o In order to change a diagnosis from acute to chronic GVHD, clinical features of chronic GVHD must be present (eg , sclerodermatous or lichenoid skin changes) and acute GVHD features must be resolved. Histopathology is not required and could reflect treatment induced changes, especially when intensive therapy was given over a prolonged period. Acute GVHD staging and grading should continue in scenarios such as this. Biopsy Result Definitions : The pathologist interpretation of a biopsy does not always clearly resolve whether GVHD is present or not. The below guidance is to assist in reporting the biopsy findings, but should not replace transplant physician involvement in data reporting. - Positive: GVHD is clearly identified as present on the biopsy. Note – multiple coexisting processes may be presen t on a biopsy along with GVHD. If other etiologies are noted, they should be reported but will not change staging. (example: CMV colitis and GI GVHD both present on the same biopsy). - Equivocal: GVHD and/or other possible etiologies are identified on the biopsy and the pathologist cannot definitively state whether or not GVHD is pr esent. (a common scenario) - Non-Diagnostic: Either no abnormalities are identified, the abnormalities are insufficient to identify a potential etiology, or there is insufficient tissue for interpretation. - Non-GVHD Etiology: One or more etiologies are identified on a biopsy, none of which are GVHD. - Unknown: The pathological results are not available by the end of the assessment period. Biopsy results are not changed for a completed assessment period unless the original report was incorrect based on the inf ormation available at the time . Multiple biopsies from the same organ: All biopsies obtained in a given assessment period are reported. If a target organ biopsy is positive for GVHD, and a later biopsy for the same organ in the same or different assessment period is negative, the diagnosis of GVHD is unchanged (subsequent biopsies that do not show GVHD may reflect treatment effect). o Clinician can determine if a patient has GVHD despite an unknown, non-diagnostic or equivocal biopsy result, or the absence of biopsy altogether.  If the patient has started treatment for GVHD then the confidence that GVHD is present is Probable.  If the patient has not started treatment for GVHD then the confidence that GVHD is present is Possible. o When a positive biopsy result is obtained and clinician determines GVHD is not present, the case is referred for adjudication.

TARGET ORGAN CONFIDENCE LEVELS Guidance: The level of confidence that symptoms are aGVHD ( Confirmed, Probable, Possible, and Negative) is reported at each assessment period for each target organ. Confidence levels may change over time as new information becomes available – these changes are reported for the assessment period during which they occur. Prior confidence levels are not changed as these reflect the real -time assessment. When new information and discussion retrospectively alters a previously reported confidence level, an adjudication level , will also be recorded for the assessment period. For example, a skin rash treated for GVHD is recorded in real time as probable GVHD. If later information revealed that the rash was likely due to a diagnosis other than GVHD, the adjudication level will be recorded as possible GVHD. This strategy allows both the real-time and adjudicated confidence levels to be recorded when there is a disagreement. Target organ specific rules are provided below to assist in establishing the confidence level. CONFIDENTIAL Page 88 of 104"

Example: A patient with diarrhea thought to be from GVHD is treated with high dose steroids, but C. difficile toxin is also present (a GI biopsy is not available). This is considered Probable GVHD and staging should be reported. o Symptoms are present but GVHD treatment is not given : (1) A patient has a rash which might be GVHD, bu t no treatment is given and no biopsy results are available. (2) A patient has diarrhea, but no etiology is identified and no GVHD treatment is given. These situations are considered Possible GVHD if GVHD is a potential etiology. The extent of rash or diar rhea volume is reported, the GVHD symptoms are staged but this is not considered a diagnosis of GVHD. Note:  If a biopsy is subsequently reported/obtained that confirms the presence of GVHD, the confidence level changes to Confirmed GVHD as of the date of t he positive biopsy, which then becomes the diagnosis of GVHD date.  If GVHD treatment is later initiated for persistent symptoms, the confidence level changes to Probable GVHD as of the date treatment is begun.  Exception : GVHD skin rash ≤50% may not be treated but is diagnosed as GVHD on clinical grounds. This case is considered Probable GVHD. The date of clinical staging is the diagnosis of GVHD date. o Prior to day 14 exception . [GVHD rarely develops before day 14, but symptoms are often present - eg , nausea, vomiting, diarrhea]. A confidence level of Possible GVHD can only be assigned prior to day 14 as the result of adjudication. Otherwise, Possible GVHD is not an option prior to day 14.  Report Confirmed when biopsy confirmation of GVHD is available  Report Probable when start of treatment has begun for GVHD target organ symptoms but biopsy confirmation of GVHD is not yet available  Report Negative when target organ symptoms were present but no GVHD treatment was started and there is no confirmatory biopsy  If symptoms persist past Day 14, the confidence level stays the same until new evidence develops, such as change in symptom severity or physician judgment that GVHD should be included in the differential diagnosis(es). o Target organs symptoms are present, a non-GVHD etiology is diagnosed (ie, engraftment syndrome) but treatment similar to that used for GVHD (ie, steroids) is given . This case is considered Negative GVHD.  If symptoms persist and the rationale for treatment is changed to GVHD treatment (eg , steroid dose is increased to manage presumed GVHD), the confidence level changes to Probable GVHD at the date of treatment change.  If a biopsy is subsequently reported/obtained that confirms the presence of GVHD, the confidence level changes to Confirmed GVHD as of the date of the positive biopsy, which then becomes the diagnosis of GVHD date.

Confidence levels when symptoms are present in multip le target organs : - If GVHD treatment is not being given, Possible or Negative GVHD confidence levels will be reported for each organ as defined in the table above. - If Probable or Confirmed GVHD is present in one target organ (and treated), symptoms (simultaneous or that develop while still on treatment) in other target organs that are not biopsied at the same time are reported as Probable GVHD. This action is taken because it is not possible to exclude GVHD on clinical grounds in other symptomatic target org ans when treatment is being given. For example, if biopsy proven skin GVHD is present and treated with systemic steroids and diarrhea develops, then the lower GI tract will be staged for GVHD and the confidence level will be Probable (even if an earlier GI biopsy was negative and no other etiology diagnosed).  Exception: If only topical therapy is being given for GVHD (eg, steroid creams for skin GVHD), other target organs with symptoms (eg, diarrhea) will be reported as Possible GVHD in the absence of syst emic GVHD treatment.  Exception: If other symptomatic organs do not meet the minimum requirements for stage 1, then these should be reported as Possible (eg, diarrhea volume <500 ml/day) .  Exception: Jaundice attributable to anothe r etiology (eg, SOS) that is present prior to GVHD Diagnosis /Treatment in another organ will not be considered GVHD unless confirmed by biopsy (see Liver GVHD Guidance section below).  Confirmed GVHD is reported for additional target organs ONLY when GVHD is confirmed by biopsy in that particular organ  Upper GI rule: When GVHD is present (probable or confirmed) in another target organ, suspected in the upper GI tract, but untreated, the UGI should be staged as 1 and confidence level = possible. Guidance for Complicated Scenarios: o Scenarios not addressed above should be referred for adjudication. Adjudication Levels: - When adjudication determines a different confidence level than the real time assessment, the Adjudication Confidence Level will be recorded as well.

Confidence levels are not modified and should ref lect the status at the time of reporting according to Table 1. - There is no adjustment of GVHD staging when, along with confirmed/probable/possible GVHD, non-GVHD etiologies are also present.  For example, when a patient with hyperbilirubinemia from pre- existing veno -occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome develops Confirmed/Probable GVHD in another target organ and starts systemic GVHD therapy, liver GVHD staging will be based upon total bilirubin and not adjusted down because of the patient’s other known cause for hyperbilirubinemia.  Exception : GVHD skin rash ≤50% may not be treated but is diagnosed as GVHD on clinical grounds. This case is considered Probable GVHD. The date of clinical staging is the date of GVHD diagnosis. SKIN GVHD GUIDANCE: o Only active rash (eg , erythema, maculopapular changes) is considered in body surface area ( BSA) calculations. Hyper- or hypopi gmentation or inactive areas (eg , brown/tanned rash, dry skin) representing post- inflammatory changes are not included in the BSA assessment. o Always report BSA involvement (if available), use the Rule of 9’s when necessary o Always report if bullae and/or desquamation are present o Desquamation from severe skin GVHD is categorized by the loss of all skin layers. o These symptoms must be caused by GVHD and not directly related to a healing process. o Peeling of the skin in the setting of quiescent GVHD is not stage 4 GVHD as this can be seen as a normal process in healing skin. o Working Definition of Engraftment Syndrome: o No Acute GVHD o Some combination of the following symptoms around the time of WBC engraftment:  Fevers without infection  Rash  Jaundice  Nausea  Vomiting  Diarrhea o Explanation: The presence of symptoms is not sufficient to document engraftment syndrome, rather it is a diagnosis by the treating physician when some of the above criteria are present and specifically attri buted to engraftment syndrome. Skin GVHD staging rules : o Stage 0: No GVHD rash o Stage 1: Maculopapular rash < 25% BSA o Stage 2: Maculopapular rash 25 – 50% BSA o Stage 3: Maculopapular rash > 50% BSA o Stage 4: Generalized erythroderma (>50% BSA) plus bullous formation and/or desquamation >5% BSA CONFIDENTIAL Page 92 of 104"

LIVER GVHD GUIDANCE: o Use total (not direct/conjugated) bilirubin for staging. o If jaundice is present before GVHD is diagnosed in another target organ (skin or GI), and GVHD is not the only diagnosis in the differential (whether in assessment or by h istory), liver GVHD will NOT be diagnosed. o If jaundice develops at the same time or after GVHD in another target organ, liver GVHD is presumed to be present. o Isolated liver GVHD can be diagnosed based on clinical judgment when GVHD is the only or most plausible etiology (GVHD treatment should be given to diagnose isolated liver GVHD). o If Bilirubin is not above 2.0 but other liver enzymes are significantly elevated from the normal, use comment field to note elevated values but do not stage Liver as GVHD. Liver GVHD staging : o Stage 0: < 2 mg/dl o Stage 1: 2 -3 mg/dl o Stage 2: 3.1 -6 mg/dl o Stage 3: 6.1 -15 mg/dl o Stage 4: >15 mg/dl Other common etiologies for liver symptoms: Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, VOD, TPN cholestasis, infection. UPPER GI GVHD GUIDANCE: o The determination that nausea, vomiting, and/or anorexia are persistent (one of the criteria for upper GI GVHD) is based on clinical judgment. As a general rule, nausea lasting fewer than 3 days, fewer than two vomiting episodes per day for at least two days, and anorexia without weight loss should not be considered persistent. Upper GI GVHD staging rules : o Stage 0: No persistent nausea or vomiting o Stage 1: Persistent nausea, vomiting or anorexia Other common etiologies for upper GI symptoms: Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, infection, TPN.

Formed or mostly formed stools should not be quantified or counted in the estimation of liquid stool volume. o When diarrhea is reported as ep isodes instead of individual volumes: Episodes of non-quantified liquid stool will be counted as 200 cc each for children ≥50 kg and adults, 4 ml/kg for children up to 50 kg. o Quantified episodes of mixed urine/stool: use 50% total volume o Positive lower GI biopsy with stool <500cc is reported as stage 0 Lower GI GVHD staging (use adult staging for children ≥50kg): o Stage 0: Adult: < 500 ml/day; Child: < 10 ml/kg/day o Stage 1: Adult: 500–999 ml/day; Child: 10 -19.9 ml/kg/day o Stage 2: Adult: 1000-1500 ml/day; Child: 20 – 30 ml/kg/day o Stage 3: Adult: >1500 ml/day; Child: > 30 ml/kg/day o Stage 4: Severe abdominal pain with or without ileus, or grossly bloody stool (regardless of stool volume). o For stage 4 GI: the term “severe abdominal pain” is defined as: (a) Pain that requires start of narcotic use, or a substantial increase in on -going narcotic use, PLUS (b) Pain that significantly impacts performance status, as determined by the treating physician. o When gross blood is used for staging: Bloody diarrhea is staged as 4, even if low volume. Blood streaked low volume (<500 mL) stools (as can be seen w/ bleeding hemorrhoids for example) are staged as 0. Other common etiologies for lower GI symptoms: Drug toxicity, conditioning regimen toxicity, infection. SYSTEMIC STEROIDS AND IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE TREATMENT/PROPHYLAXIS GVHD prophylaxis Guidance: o Report actual, not planned, GVHD prophylaxis given. For example, if CSA is planned, but tacrolimus is actually given, report tacrolimus. If methotrexate is planned an d at least one dose is given, even if one or more doses is not, report methotrexate as a prophylaxis. o If prophylaxis changes prior to, or after, Diagnosis of GVHD/Start of Treatment for GVHD [eg , an intolerance to one agent leads to replacement with another agent(s)], report the replacement agent(s) and report this as a change in prophylaxis o Report all GVHD prophylaxis agent(s) given during the assessment period, indication will be GVHD CONFIDENTIAL Page 94 of 104"

Use outpa tient clinic visit weight if treatment for GVHD is started during an outpatient visit. The weight recorded at the start of steroids should be used on all subsequent forms and for calculations for steroid dosing. o Steroid dose and form (prednisone, methylprednisolone, etc ) should be reported corresponding to the date of GVHD assessment for that week. The dose being given on the date of GVHD assessment should be the one reported, even if the dose is changed one or more times during the assessment period.  Exception: When steroid therapy begins during the assessment period, report the starting dose. o Indication for steroid therapy should be reported. o If the patient develops GVHD while on steroid therapy for another indication, and the dose of steroids is changed, report the new dose of steroids as the treatment dose given for GVHD , the new indication for steroid therapy, and the date of the dose change. o Other agents: list all other agents being given for GVHD treatment and/or prophylaxis. o If a patient is receiving extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), report the number of ECP treatments given during the assessment period. o If the patient is on a study where the treatment assignment is not known (blinded), report this as experimental treatment and report which potential agents the patient may be receiving (ie, report both the study drug AND placebo). o Topical therapies will no t be collected.

If the patient has D ied, report the date of death. Primary and contributing cause of dea th will also be reported. Cause of Death Hierarchy: Cause of death is attributed to the key initiating event in the chain of events that culminate in death. It is inaccurate to report the proximate cause of death (eg, liver failure) when the liver failure is a result of severe liver GVHD. In that example, the cause of death should be recorded as GVHD. Cause of death may be difficult to ascertain and often requires adjudication. I n some cases, no obvious cause of death can be determined, in which case the adjudication represents a best medical opinion. The following hierarchy will be followed for assigning cause of death: Relapse Recorded at any point prior to death, supersedes all other causes of death, including GVHD and Infection, when any other competing etiology is also present at time of death. EXCEPTION: In most cases, COD can be d etermined using the above rule. In circumstances where the treating physician does not believe that relapse is the primary cause of death, an exception can be made with documentation emailed to the DCC and/or a comment entered into the Cause of Death comment box. All such cases will be adjudicated. GVHD (Acute and Chronic) GVHD supersedes all other causes of death except relapse. Relapse supersedes GVHD because relapse generally prompts measures that increase likelihood of GVHD (eg , abrupt cessation of immunosuppression or donor leukocyte infusion). Deaths occurring with active GVHD symptoms are attributed to GVHD. Deaths (usually incorrectly reported as Infection) are attributed to GVHD when symptoms are absent if the patient had been previously treated or remains on immunosuppression treatment for GVHD. The effect of GVHD treatment on the immune s ystem persists beyond the last treatment dose and therefore guidance is provided for the time off immunosuppression to consider when assigning GVHD as cause of death. Deaths are considered due to GVHD even when symptoms are absent (ie, complete response to treatment) if any of the following conditions are met: • Patient was on 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of alternative steroid) within two weeks of death • Patient was on 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent dose of alternative steroid) within four weeks of death • Patient on immunosuppressive agents ( eg, ATG, Campath, etc) other than those used for prophylaxis • In the event of missing or incomplete data, patients reported to have Grade 4 GVHD within two months of death, then COD is GVHD CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 of 104"
