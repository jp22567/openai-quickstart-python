SYNOPSIS Title of Study: An Open -label Study to Assess the Safety of Repeat Administration of FX006 to Patients with Osteoarthritis of the Knee Study Centers: Approximately 20 centers Study Phase: 3b Objectives : The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall safety and general tolerability of repeat administration of FX006 (two doses of 32 mg FX006) in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Exploratory objectives of this study include the following:  examine efficacy signals for sustained pain reduction following two doses of 32 mg FX006.  collect synovial fluid samples to enable potential future examination of synovial fluid biomarkers that may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA and/or be associated with responsiveness to FX006 treatment. Study Design and Methodology : This study is an open -label, repeat administration design of 32 mg FX006. The study will be conducted in male and female patients ≥ 40 years of age with symptomatic OA of the knee. Eligible patients will be offered participation to receive an initial IA injection of FX006 administered to the index knee at Day 1 . Patients who receive an initial i njection of FX006 will return at Weeks 4 and 8 before being evaluated at 12, 16, 20 , and 24 weeks following the initial administration of FX006 for repeat administration . At the first visit where the patient has been determined to meet repeat administrati on eligibility criteria described in Section 7.4.3 , the patient will be eligible to receive a second IA injection of FX006 administered to the index knee . Patients who are eligible to receive a second injection will be evaluated for a total of 52 weeks post initial injection at: Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 , and 52, regardless of the visit at which they receive their second injec tion. Patients that do not benefit from the initial treatment as determined by evaluation at Week 12 will complete the study at the Week 12 follow -up visit. These patients will be evaluated for a total of 12 weeks post initial injection at: Weeks 4, 8, 12. Patients who are not eligible for a second injection of FX006 after evaluation at Weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24 will complete the study at the Week 24 follow -up visit. These patients will be evaluated for a total of 24 weeks post initial injection at: Week s 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 , and 24. Refer to Appendix 2 Study Visit Flow Chart . The study is expected to enroll over approximately 6 months. Number of Patients : Approximately 200 patients will be enrolled to ensure that at least 100 patients receive two doses of 32 mg FX006 and complete the study through Week 52. Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration : FX006 – extended release formulation of TA in 75:25 poly(lactic -co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres .

12,page_12,"Flexion Therapeutics, Inc . Protocol FX006 -2016 -011 FX006 Version 2.0 16 October 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 13 of 57 Procedures and Assessments : The study will involve a Screening period ( a minimum of 7 days, up to 21 days), dosing at Day 1/Baseline and up to 13 additional outpatient visits (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 , and 52) depending if the patient is eligible for and receives a second injection. At specified times throughout the study, patients will undergo physical examinations, index knee assessments and index knee X -rays; blo od samples will be collected for laboratory safety tests and vital signs will be collected or measured. Information regarding AEs and concomitant medications will be collected. Patients will have index knee synovial fluid collected at baseline and the week at which the second dose is administered (if the patient is eligible to receive a second dose) . Patients that are not eligible to receive a second dose will not have synovial fluid drawn at their final study visit. These samples will be preserved fo r potential future OA biomarker analyses. Steps per day will be captured using a measured function device. Patients will be provided with a device at the Screening visit to be worn for at least 7 days prior to Baseline/Day 1 through Week 12. The site will confirm patient compliance with wearing the device to capture steps per day data at each patient visit from Day 1 through Week 12. As well, patients will complete the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) at Screening and at Week 12 . During out -patient visits, patients will complete the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC®) Osteoarthritis Index Likert (LK) 3.1 and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Quality of Life (QOL) Subscale . Blinding : This is an open -label study. IP Administration Procedure : IA injections will be performed by the assigned injector. The injector may choose the position of the knee (e.g., extended or flexed), the approach for the injection (e.g., medial or lateral) and the numbing agent to be used (e.g., ethyl chloride, subcuta neous lidocaine; IA anesthetics are not allowed) based on standard of care. Sterile technique should be used. Prior to injection, the index knee should be thoroughly cleansed using a bactericidal solution. The index knee will be aspirated in all cases p rior to administration of study medication. Following attempted aspiration, 5 mL of the reconstituted FX006 will be injected into the synovial space. Refer to the Pharmacy Binder for detailed instructions on how to prepare FX006. The same needle used fo r IA injection of the study medication may also be used for synovial fluid aspiration, thereby allowing for a single injection with syringe replacement. The injector will use a 21 gauge or larger needle for injection and aspiration of fluid. Patients shou ld be advised to avoid strenuous activities or prolonged weight -bearing activities for approximately 24 to 48 hours following the injection and to also maintain a stable lifestyle with regard to physical activity throughout the duration of the study. In the event that the patient has an immediate reaction (e.g., tenderness, increased pain, swelling, effusion, decreased mobility of the index knee), the patient should be treated according to local clinical guidelines and physician experience"

Protocol FX006 -2016 -011 FX006 Version 2.0 16 October 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 14 of 57 Concomitant Medications: The exclusion criteria indicate that a patient may not be enrolled if he/she has used any of the following within the specified windows. In addition these medications should not be taken or used throughout the study:  IV, IM or oral corticos teroids  IA corticosteroids in any joint  IA viscosupplementation (hyaluronic acid) or any IA intervention (IA injection, IA aspiration, etc.) in the index knee  Opiates  Any investigational drug, device or biologic  Immunomodulators, immunosuppressives, or ch emotherapeutic agents  Live or live attenuated vaccines Criteria for Evaluation: Safety Variables Safety and tolerability will be evaluated on the basis of AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or discovered by the Investigator and findings from the following assessments: physical examinations, index knee assessments, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations. In addition the index knee will be evaluated by X -ray and assessed by a central imaging vendor for joint space narrowing, chondrolysis, subchondral bone changes, bone infarcts, avascular necrosis, joint swelling , and insufficiency fracture.

No formal power and sample size calculations have been made as the analysis of the efficacy data collected from this study will be considered exploratory and hypothesis -generating for future multiple dose studies of FX006. In order to ensure at least 100 patients who receive two doses of 32 mg FX006 are enrolled and followed for 52 weeks, approximately 200 patients will be enrolled based on an estimate that approximately 66% of patients enrolled will be eligible to receive a second dose of 32 mg FX006 and approximately 75% of subjects who receive a second dose will complete the study through Week 52."

No formal interim analysis is planned for the primary safety endpoints in this open -label study to assess the safety and tolerability of FX006 after repeat administration . However, i nterim analysis may be conducted with exploratory endpoints to examine efficacy signals f ollowing administration of one or two doses of 32mg FX006 . These interim analyses on exploratory endpoints may be completed for data review , regulatory updates , and/or publication (or presentation at congresses) for this open -label study. Any interim analysis completed will have an interim analysis plan written and approved to describe the purpose and analytical objectives of the interim analysi s. Final analyses , described in the protocol and statistical analysis plan, will be conducted after completion of the study, when all subjects have either discontinued the study early (prior to Week 52) or completed the study through Week 52. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be listed by study site and patient, and will be summarized by treatment. Frequencies and proportions will be presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be presented for continuous variables. Treatment exposure will be listed by study site and patient, and will be summarized by treatment and dose. The examination of efficacy is exploratory in this study. Data from the WOMAC® questionnaire will be presented in by-patient listings with summary pr esentation of the data and exploratory analyses. Analysis of the magnitude of pain relief observed with WOMAC A (pain), stiffness (WOMAC B), and function (WOMAC C) will be explored between patients who receive one dose and those receiving a second followi ng the first and second doses of 32 mg FX006 will be explored with a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed effects of number of doses (1 or 2) received, and a dose by time interaction. Model covariates will include study site, and potentially other variables. Subject will be a random effect in the model. Time points of interest for this analysis are those when a subject is eligible for a second dose. A second within subject analysis will be completed for subjects who receive two doses of FX0 06 to examine the improvement in WOMAC scores within a subject after receiving the second dose: WOMAC after the first dose, compared to WOMAC following the second dose. The change from baseline to the last WOMAC score for the first dose will be compared to the change from the last score prior to the second dose to the last WOMAC score following the second dose. The increment difference in the overall change for the first dose compared to second dose will be explored with a linear model. Evaluation of dose -response will be assessed descriptively with an examination of WOMAC A responses at the time (in weeks) of second dose administration to assess the magnitude of scores at each week that a second dose may be administered. The time to maximal pain relief resp onse with WOMAC A following the first and second doses of 32 mg FX006 will be examined using a Kaplan -Meier (KM) procedure. Questionnaire data from the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) domains (occupational physical activity, transport -related physical activity, and physical activity during discretionary or leisure time) will be described descriptively at the two time points collected ( Screening and Week 12 ). The change in GPAQ domain scores and total score will be examined with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with summaries comparing patients who receive one dose to those receiving two doses of 32 mg FX006. GPAQ information collected at Screening will be utilized to normalize steps per day based on lifestyles activity. GPAQ information w ill be a model covariate in subsequent analyses. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. Incidences (number and percent) of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), those events that started after do sing or worsened in severity after dosing, will be presented by treatment group. Incidences of TEAEs will also be presented by maximum severity and relationship to study medication. Similar presentations will be provided for serious AEs, AEs leading to wi thdrawal from the study, or AEs leading to death. Analysis of AE data will include examination of the incidence rates of TEAEs and index knee related TEAEs following the first dose and second dose, as well as the cumulative incidence of TEAEs after all dos es of 32 mg FX006. Both the number of events and the number of patients experiencing an event will be examined to assess the by patient cumulative incidence of TEAEs associated with repeat administration . Clinical laboratory data and vital sign information will be presented as descriptive summary statistics for value and change from Baseline at each individual time point."

Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating musculoskeletal disease that is characterized by intra-articular ( IA) inflammation, deterioration of articular cartilage, and degenerative changes to peri-articular and subchondral bone (Creamer and Hochberg, 1997; Goldring and Goldring, 2006 ). Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the United States (US) and OA is the most common joint disease, affecting 27 million Americans, with numbers expected to grow as a result of aging, obesity and sports injuries. Recent data suggest that OA accounts for over $185 billion of annual healthcare expenditures in the US, which does not include loss of productivity costs. We estimate that by 2030, 45 million people will have OA. OA commonly affect large weight -bearing joints like the knees and hips, but also occurs in the shoulde rs, hands, feet and spine. Patients with OA suffer from joint pain, tenderness, stiffness and limited movement. As the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly painful and debilitating, culminating, in many cases, in the need for total joint arthropla sty. Current Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) and the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend the use of IA corticosteroids for short -term acute pain relief ( ACR Subcommittee 2000; Hochberg et al, 2012; Jordan et al, 2003 ). While historically OA has been considered a non -inflammatory disease, it is increasingly being recognized that chronic synovitis occurs in all stages of knee OA ( Benito et al, 2005 ; Sellam and Berenbaum, 2010; Wenham and Conaghan, 2010 ). As synovial inflammation is correlated with clinical symptoms and joint degeneration, it should be an important target for therapeutic intervention. The inflamed synovium may well be the target for IA corticosteroids which are widely used in knee OA ( Ayral et al, 2005 ). 5.2. Background 5.2.1. Investigational Me dicinal Product: FX006 FX006 is an extended -release formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for IA administration that is being developed for the treatment of patients with pain attributed to OA of the knee. FX006 is intended to deliver TA to the syn ovial and peri -synovial tissues for a period of approximately 3 months depending on the dose administered (Bodick et al, 2013 ). FX006 contains TA, United States Pharmacopeia (Ph. Eur/USP), formulated in 75:25 poly(lactic -co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres with a nominal drug load of 25% (w/w) and is provided as a sterile white to off -white powder for reconstitution. The drug product is reconstituted with diluent containing an isotonic, sterile aqueous solution of sodium ch loride (NaCl; 0.9% w/w), carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC; 0.5% w/w) and polysorbate -80 (0.1% w/w) to form a suspension prior to IA injection. Further details of the physiochemical properties of FX006 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)."

Rationale for FX006 in OA of the Knee Available clinical and nonclinical data indicate that FX006 is likely to be safe and well tolerated and has the potential to provide pain relief that is meaningfully better and more persistent than that provided by imm ediate release triamcinolone acetonide ( TAcs ). Nonclinical data and the literature suggest that this potential could extend to limiting structural progression in patients with inflammatory joint disorders. The near term clinical development program for FX 006 focuses on the analgesic effects in patients with OA of the knee. 5.2.3. Non-clinical The safety of FX006 was evaluated following single IA injection in one non -GLP rat toxicity study and two GLP -compliant dog toxicity studies, and following repeated IA inje ction in one GLP -compliant dog toxicity study. In the repeat dose study, dogs were dosed once every 3 months (1Q3M) for a total of 3 doses, or once every month (1Q1M) for a total of 3 doses); local and systemic (steroid target tissues) toxicity were asses sed. The systemic effects of repeat IA administration of FX006 containing up to 18.75 mg of TA and 75 mg of PLGA microspheres were consistent with known TA/corticosteroid affects and were similar for the 1Q3M and 1Q1M dose regimens. Regarding local toxici ty, at 1 month after the last dose following I.A. administration every 3 months (1Q3M), the only effect on cartilage observed at 1 -month post -dose was loss of Safranin -O staining, reflecting reduced levels of glycosaminoglycan. At 6 -months post -dose, ther e were additional changes in the structure and cellularity of articular cartilage in both the TAcs and FX006 groups (in males only). These effects are consistent with the known effects of corticosteroids in normal joints. Occasional FX006 -treated animals show slower recovery for cartilage changes compared to TAcs -treated animals, as expected based on the longer exposure to TA in the joints of these animals. After monthly dosing (Q1M), small changes in structure and cellularity were present at 1 -month pos t- dose in both FX006 and TAcs groups, in addition to loss of Safranin -O staining. This is consistent with the more intensive dosing regimen. By 6 months after the cessation of dosing there was clear evidence of recovery. Again, these effects are consisten t with the known effects of corticosteroids in normal joints. A local foreign body tissue response was observed 1 -month following repeated IA injection of FX006 or blank microspheres. This effect was characterized by macrophage and multinucleated giant cell infiltration to the presence of the microspheres in the syn ovium. The local foreign body response was partially or fully reversed by 6 months post dosing. An increased incidence and/or intensity of lymphocyte and plasma cells, and minimal fibrosis were also observed in the blank microsphere and FX006 groups at 1 and 6 months post dosing. Overall, these changes suggest a host tissue response, which is an expected reaction to PLGA products and is consistent with a foreign body response. Additional details on non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and ph armacodynamics in animals and toxicology information for TA, PLGA , and FX006 can be found in Section 4 of the IB. 5.2.4. Clinical Experience The clinical development of FX006 to date consists of eight completed studies (FX006 -2011 001, FX006 -2011 -002, FX006 -2013 -005, FX006 -2014 -006, FX006 -2014 -007, FX006 -2014 -008,"

A brief summary of each study and data from the completed and fully analyzed studies is presented below. NOTE TO REVIEWER : Subsequent to completion of the human pharmacology, efficacy , and safety studies reported herein (as of September 2017), extensive in -house testing was performed to assess the actual FX006 dose removed and delivered under the conditions of the dose preparation procedure. This in -house testing determined that the FX006 delivered dose to the patient from an FX006 40 mg vial is 32 mg. Hence, past clinical studies using a FX006 40 mg dose under the current resuspension conditions (5 mL of diluent) should be considered to have delivered a 32 mg dose of TA. All future studies performed with FX006 from the date of Investigator’s Brochure Version 7.0 forward will reflect a 32 mg dose. Completed studies Study FX006 -2011 -001 was a Phase 2b, mul ti-center, randomized, double -blind, dose -ranging, active comparator study. The primary objectives of this study were to assess the magnitude and duration of pain relief of a single 3 mL IA injection of FX006 ( 10, 40, or 60 mg) relative to 40 mg of TAcs and assess the general tolerability of FX006. Study FX006 -2011 -002 was a Phase 2, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, active comparator study. The primary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of a single 3 mL IA injec tion of FX006 (10, 40 , or 60 mg), characterize the systemic PK profile of TA from FX006 relative to 40 mg of TAcs , and characterize the effects on the hypothalamic - pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis of FX006 relative to 40 mg of TAcs . Study FX006 -2013 -005 was a Phase 2, open -label, single administration study. The objectives of this study were to characterize the local duration of exposure of TA and to assess the safety and general tolerability of a single 3 mL IA injection of FX006 (1 0 or 32 mg) relative to 40 mg of TAcs . Study FX006 -2014 -006 was a Phase 2b, multi -center, randomized, parallel group, dose -ranging study. The primary objectives of this study were to assess the magnitude and duration of pain relief of a single 5 mL IA i njection of FX006 (20 mg or 32 mg) relative to placebo (normal saline) and assess the safety and general tolerability of FX006. FX006 -2014 -007 was a prospective, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, proof of concept, active comparator -controlled study. The primary objective of this study was to assess the analgesic effect of a single 5 mL IA injection of FX006 ( 32 mg) relative to 40 mg of TAcs (active control) in patients with moderately symptomatic post -traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) of the knee. Due to the challenges of enrolling military personnel with PTOA, this study was discontinued early. Study FX006 -2014 -008 was a Phase 3, multi -center, double -blind, randomized, placebo - and active comparator -controlled study. The primary objective of this study was to assess the magnitude and duration of pain relief of a single 5 mL IA injection of FX006 ( 32 mg), relative to normal saline (placebo contr ol) and 40 mg of TAcs (active comparator). Study FX006 -2015 -009 was a Phase 2, open -label, single administration study. The objectives of this study were to characterize the local extent and duration of exposure of TA from FX006 and TAcs , characterize t he systemic PK of FX006 and TAcs , and assess the safety and general"

Study FX006 -2015 -010 was a Phase 2, multi -center, double blind, randomi zed, parallel group study. The primary objective of this study was the assessment of the effects of a single 5 mL IA injection of FX006 ( 32 mg) on blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, relative to 40 mg of TAcs . 5.2.5. Clinical Pharmacokinetics Overall, FX006 displayed a favorable plasma PK profile relative to TAcs. The PK observations in Study FX006 -2015 -009 resulted in a controlled and stable release of TA from PLGA microspheres into synovial tissues, where concentrations remai ned high relative to plasma concentrations for at least 12 weeks. TA was absorbed systemically, with a plateau in plasma TA concentrations occurring in the first 24 hours post -dose, and slow elimination from the systemic circulation observed in the weeks thereafter . Relative to TAcs, FX006 32 mg produced substantially lower peak plasma and systemic exposure to TA. FX006 performed as expected, prolonging the residence of TA in the joint while minimizing systemic exposure to TA. 5.2.6. Clinical Pharmacodynamics In Study FX006 -2011 -002, s uppression of cortisol in the days following injection produced by the 10 and 40 mg dose of FX006 was less than that produced by injection of TAcs ; the 60 mg dose of FX006 produced effects similar to TAcs 40 mg. Cortisol suppression subsequent to Day 1-2 associated with all doses of FX006 would not be expected to be of clinical consequence in adult patients without otherwi se comprised HPA axis function. In Study FX006 -2015 -010, treatment with FX006 32 mg resulted in a statistically s ignificant (p=0.0452) reduction in blood glucose elevation relative to TAcs over a 72 -hour period following IA injection . The time in glycemic target range (70 -180 mg/dL) (American Diabetes Association, 2016 ) was greater for FX006 as compared to TAcs over the 48 hours post IA injection, providing another indication of the improvement in glycemic control. O ver the entire time course of the 15 -day post injection glucose monitoring period, blood glucose levels associated with FX006 remained at levels similar to or lower than those produced by TAcs . This observation is consistent with PK studies demonstrating low systemic exposure to TA associated with FX006. 5.2.7. Clinical Efficacy 5.2.7.1. Study FX006 -2011 -001 In Study FX006 -2011-001, a dose -ranging, active comparator trial of a single IA injection of FX006 in patients with OA of the knee:  The 40 mg dose of FX006 produced a statistically significant (p<0.05, 1 -sided) and potentially clinically meaningful improvement in pain reli ef relative to TAcs between Weeks 5 and 10 and also demonstrated significant improvement over TAcs (p<0.05,"

(Bodick et al, 2015 ) 5.2.7.2. Study FX006 -2014 -006 In Study FX006 -2014 -006, a P hase 2b dose -ranging, placebo -controlled trial of a single IA injection of FX006 in patients with OA of the knee:  The 20 and 32 mg doses of FX006 achieved maximal analgesic effect of similar magnitude at Week 5 post -injection. A dose effect was evident in the maintenance of maximal effect, which persisted through Week 9 with FX006 20 mg and through Week 13 with FX006 32 mg. In secondary outcomes that assessed pain, stiffness, function, and Patient and Clinical Global Impressions of Change, 32 mg FX006 demo nstrated significantly better or trending better outcomes versus placebo at Weeks 4, 8 , and 12.  The 32 mg FX006 dose was associated with rapid onset of action, larger magnitude of analgesic effect, and prolonged duration of action relative to placebo. 5.2.7.3. Stud y FX006 -2014 -008 In Study FX006 -2014 -008, a Phase 3 double -blind, randomized, single -dose study to assess the safety and efficacy of FX006 for the treatment of pain in patients with OA of the knee:  32 mg FX006 administered as a single IA injection provided more rapid onset of action, increased magnitude of analgesia, and prolonged duration of effect relative to placebo.  When compared to 40 mg TAcs , 32 mg FX006 was numerically superior at Weeks 2 throug h 19 on the weekly mean of average daily pain ( ADP ) scores, although it did not achieve statistical significance, likely as a result of an unexpected loss of assay sensitivity in that measure. However, in pre -specified exploratory OA specific measures, com pared to 40 mg TAcs , 32 mg FX006 achieved statistical significance through 12 weeks on WOMAC A (pain), WOMAC B (stiffness), and WOMAC C (function) and the validated KOOS QOL subscale.  A single IA injection of 32 mg FX006 was well tolerated, with systemic and local safety profiles generally similar to placebo and 40 mg TAcs 5.2.8. Clinical Safety The evaluation of 687 patients treated with a single IA injection of FX006 at any dose in the FX006 clinical studies suggests that it was well tolerated with systemic and local safety profiles similar to those of TAcs and placebo. The safety data from the completed FX006 clinical studies are largely consistent."

Severe or life threatening events occurred in the FX006 -treated patients at a rate of 3.0% as compared to 5.0% and 2.6% in the placebo and TAcs groups, respectively,  In the FX006 -treated patients (n=687) , the most common TEAEs were:  Arthralgia (in any joint) 9. 8% (n= 67)  Headache 5. 4% (n= 37)  Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 3. 1% (n= 21)  Joint swelling 2.8% (n=19)  Contusion and back pain 2.3% (n=16)  Nasopharyngitis 2.2% (n=15)  The rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low and consistent across groups (FX006 1. 9%; placebo 1.1% ; TAcs 2.3%); none were considered related to the study drug.  Acros s all studies there were no deaths. In Study FX006 -2014 -008, qualitative assessments based on X-rays of the index knee at 24 weeks post injection included joint space narrowing (JSN), subchondral bone changes, osteonecrosis, and insufficiency fracture.  The overall rate of JSN worsening of at least 1 -grade between baseline and Week 24 was low and similar among treatment groups (5.0% [7/140], 4.1% [6/148], and 3.5% [5/145] of patients with both baseline and Week 24 X -rays in the FX006 32 mg, placebo, and TA cs groups respectively); for all but 1 of these 18 patients, JSN worsened by 1 grade only. The remaining patient (in the placebo group) had a 2 -grade worsening in JSN (from 0 at baseline to Grade 2 at Week 24).  No FX006 -treated patient had X -ray evidence o f treatment -emergent insufficiency fracture, subchondral bone changes, or osteonecrosis at Week 24.  Eighteen patients discontinued the study prior to Week 24 and completed a final X - ray as part of early termination visit. Of these, 2 patients, 1 in the FX0 06 32 mg group and 1 in the placebo group, had a 1 -grade increase in JSN. There were no reports of insufficiency fracture, subchondral bone changes, or osteonecrosis. Please refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for further safety details. 5.2.9.

The same individual may serve in multiple roles (e.g., a physician sub -investigator may serve as both the Injector/Aspirator and/or Assessor). 7.3. Discussion of Study Design 7.3.1. Rationale for Study Population Patients with pain associated with OA of the knee as defined by clinical and radiologic criteria that are otherwise in good health or that have chronic conditions (for example, hypertens ion) that are well controlled are included. In general this population tolerates IA injections of commercially available corticosteroids ( Habib 2009 ). In prior clinical studies of FX006 in this population, single injections of up to 60 mg of FX006 were well tolerated. 7.3.2. Rationale for Dose Selection The rationale supporting dosing at this level couples nonclinical data summarized in the Investigator Brochure (Section 4), and clinical experience with FX006. In study F X006 -2011 - 001, the prior dose -ranging study that included 10, 40, and 60 mg doses of FX006 and TAcs (e.g., Kenalog®-40 Injection), a dose response was evident between 10 and 40 60 mg doses over the entire 12 weeks of therapy. At no point in the course of t herapy did the 60 mg dose provide additional improvement relative to the 40 mg dose. Thus, it was assumed that the minimum dose to achieve maximal efficacy was >10 and ≤40 mg. As well, 40 mg FX006 has been shown to be well tolerated in previous single dos e clinical trials . 7.3.3. Rationale for Study Design Evidence from non -clinical repeat dose studies, the overall safety profile of 32 mg FX006 being well tolerated and the common practice of repeating corticosteroid injections support the evaluation of repeat administration of 32 mg FX006. 7.3.4. Rationale for Study Parameters The clinical safety parameters to be assessed (adverse events, physical examinations, index knee examinations, index knee X -rays, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations) are standard"

Intra -articular Injection Procedure IA injections will be performed by the assigned injector. The injector may choose the position of the knee (e.g., extended or flexed ), the approach for th e injection (e.g., medial or lateral) and the numbing agent to be used (e.g., ethyl chloride, subcutaneous lidocaine; IA anesthetics are not allowed) based on standard of care. Sterile technique should be used. Prior to injection, the index knee should b e thoroughly cleansed using a bactericidal solution. The index knee will be aspirated in all cases prior to administration of study medication. Following attempted aspiration, 5 mL of the reconstituted FX006 will be injected into the synovial space. Refer to the Pharmacy Binder for detailed instructions on how to prepare FX006. The same needle used for IA injection of the study medication may also be used for synovial fluid aspiration, thereby allowing for a single injection with syringe replacement. The injector will use a 21 gauge or larger needle for injection and aspiration of fluid. Patients should be advised to avoid strenuous activities or prolonged weight -bearing activities for approximately 24 to 48 hours following the injection and to also maintain a stable lifestyle with regard to physical activity throughout the durat ion of the study. In the event that the patient has an immediate reaction (e.g., tenderness, increased pain, swelling, effusion, decreased mobility of the index knee), the patient should be treated according to local clinical guidelines and physician exper ience (see also Protocol Section Section 8.1.5 ). 7.5.9.

Since height is commonly measured in centimeters, divide height in centimeters by 100 to obtain height in meters. Example: Weight = 68 kg, Height = 165 cm (1.65 m) Calculation: 68 ÷ (1.65)2 = 24.98 Pounds and inches Formula: weight (lb) / [height (in)]2 x 703 Calculate BMI by dividing weight in pounds (lbs) by height in inches (in) squared and multiplying by a conversion factor of 703. Example: Weight = 150 lbs, Height = 5'5"" (65"") Calculation: [150 ÷ (65)2] x 703 = 24.96"

The injector/aspirator will attempt to aspirate synovial fluid from the index knee using sterile technique. The volume of the synovial fluid obtained will be recorded in t he eCRF. If no synovial fluid is obtained then 0 mLs should be recorded. Procedures for sample collection, handling, storage and shipment will be described in the Study Laboratory Manual. The synovial fluid samples will be preserved for potential future analyses of biomarkers that may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA and/or be associated with responsiveness to FX006 treatment . 7.9.13. Treatment Administration At Baseline/Day 1 and the week at which the second dose is to be administered (if the p atient is eligible to receive a second dose), the following will occur:  Study medication will be prepared by the pharmacist/coordinator (Refer to the Pharmacy Binder for instructions on how to prepare FX006).  Synovial fluid will be aspirated from the ind ex knee just prior to administration of study medication (refer to Section 7.9.12 for more details of the synovial fluid aspiration).  The injecto r/aspirator will perform the IA injection of the study medication (refer to Section 7.5.8 for instructions). 7.9.14. Review of Adverse Events and Concomi tant Medications After receiving study medication, the patient will be monitored for any AEs. Review of any Concomitant Medications will also be performed and documented in source documentation. Refer to Section 8.1 for further information in regard to reporting of AEs. Refer to Section 7.6 for further information in regard to allowed and restricted concomitant medication."

CLINICAL SAFETY ASSES SMENTS Safety evaluations will be based on the assessment of AEs occurring after the initiation of study medication on Day 1 through the last study visit. Results of clinical safety assessments are to be recorded in the patient’s medical records and transcribed to the appropriate eCRF, including the AE eCRF for clinically significant findings. 8.1. Adverse Events 8.1.1. Definitions An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be :  Any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  Any clinically significant abnormality f ound on an ECG, laboratory test or physical examination.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinical significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition, which is temporally associated with the use of the medicinal (investigational) product, is also an AE. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death, o This serious criterion applies if the patient’s death is a direct outcome of a reported AE.  Is life -threatening, o This serious criterion refers to an event in which the patient was at substantial risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  Requires inpatient hospitalizatio n or prolongation of existing hospitalization, o This serious criterion applies if the reported AE requires at least a 24 -hour inpatient hospitalization or, if in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, prolongs an existing hospitalization. A hospitaliza tion for an elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by this criterion because a “procedure” or a “treatment” is not an untoward medical occurrence."
41,page_41,"Flexion Therapeutics, Inc . Protocol FX006 -2016 -011 FX006 Version 2.0 16 October 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 42 of 57  Results in permanent or significant disability/incapacity, or o This serious crite rion applies if the “disability” caused by the reported AE results in a substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. o This serious criterion applies if a patient exposed to a medic inal (investigational) product gives birth to a child with congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should also usually be considered seri ous. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.1.2. Evaluating and Recording of Adverse Events At each visit all AEs that occur from the time of treatment and throughout a patient’s study participation that are observed, elicited by the site personnel , or reported by the patient, will be recorded in the source documentation and ap propriate section of the AE eCRF and evaluated by an assessor . Minimum information required for each AE includes type of event, duration (start and end dates), severity, seriousness, causality to investigational medicinal product, action taken, and outcome . Severity of AEs will be graded by the Principal Investigator using the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 4.0 (refer to the Study Manual or http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm )."
42,page_42,"Flexion Therapeutics, Inc . Protocol FX006 -2016 -011 FX006 Version 2.0 16 October 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 43 of 57 For AEs not listed in the CTCAE, the following definitions should be used : Grade 1 Mild Symptomatic or mild symptoms Clinical or diagnostic observations only Intervention not indicated Grade 2 Moderate Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated Limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( ADL )* Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening Hospitalization or prolon gation of hospitalization indicated Disabling Limiting self care ADL** Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences Urgent intervention indicated Grade 5 Death related to AE *Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. **Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. The relationship of the AE to the investigational medicinal product should be specified by the Principal Investigator, using the following definitions: 1. Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable association with treatment. 2. Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the investigational medicinal product , and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists. 3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration of the investigational medicinal product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected drug; the reaction could have been produced by the study medication or could have been produced by the patient’s clinical state or by other modes of therapy administered to the patient . 4. Probably Related: The reaction follows a reasona ble temporal sequence from administration of study medication ; is confirmed by discontinuation of the study medication or by rechallenge; and cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state. 5. Definitely Relate d: The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of study medication; that follows a known or expected"

Protocol FX006 -2016 -011 FX006 Version 2.0 16 October 2017 CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 of 57 response pattern to the study medication; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the study medication, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. If discernible at the time of completing an AE eCRF, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by the Investigator and recorde d on the appropriate AE eCRF . However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by the Investigator to be a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separa te AE on the appropriate AE eCRF. 8.1.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events When an SAE occurs, the Investigator or designee must log into the electronic data capture (EDC) system and complete the SAE Report form within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. The SAE will automatically be reported to the Medical Monitor or designee electronically. Follow -up information relating to a SAE must be reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator by entering new information into t he electronic SAE form. The updated SAE will automatically be reported to the Medical Monitor or designee electronically. If one is unable to log into the EDC system, the SAE hotline may be contacted (information located in the Investigator Site File in th e Study Contact list). All SAEs that occur at a given site should, in addition, be reported by the Investigators to the responsible IRB /EC without undue delay, if applicable according to IRB /EC requirements. During the conduct of the study, the Sponsor will provide expedited safety reports ( AEs classified as serious, unexpected and at least possibly related to investigational product) to the investigative sites as notification of new safety findings. If this occurs, the investigative site must report th e information to their IRB /EC per local guidelines (may be submitted by the Sponsor or designee for sites that use a central IRB) . 8.1.4. Safety Monitoring Roles The site personnel will carefully monitor each patient throughout the study for possible AEs. All AEs will be documented on the eCRF designed specifically for this purpose, and will be followed until either completely resolved or until a stable chronic outcome is determined by the Principal Investigator . SAEs will be reported in accordance with Section 8.1.3. The Medical Monitor must promptly review all information relevant to the safety of an investigational new product received from any source. The Medical Monitor will also review alert laboratory results in real time and will contact Investigators as needed to ensure that issues are managed in an appropriate manner. The medical monitor and the Sponsor will review safety data approximately on a quarterly basis, accessed through the EDC system and associated reporting tools, in order to identify potential safety issues/trends that may not be apparent through individual AE reporting. If systematic review identifies a pattern of concern, Sponsor wi ll take steps to address the issues including , but"

Each review will be documented and filed in the Trial Master File. 8.1.5. Clinical Management of Index Knee -related Events In the event that the patient has an immediate reaction following administration of study medication or returns to the clinic with an acute exacerbation (e.g., tenderness, increased pain, swelling, effusion, decreased mobility of the index knee ), the patient should be treated according to local clinical guidelines and physician experience. If the index knee is aspirated at any time after administration of study medication for any reason, the volume of synovial fluid aspirated must be documented, s ynovial fluid should be (1) cultured, (2) evaluated for presence of crystals , and (3) assessed for white cell count at a local laboratory, and the results should be documented. Any event that is a change from the patient’s baseline status (new or worseni ng case) should be reported as an AE and those meeting the definition of serious must be reported in accordance with Section 8.1.3 . 8.1.6. Pregnancy All pr egnancies occurring during the study will be reported in the same timeframe as SAEs. All reports of pregnancy, including male patients who conceive, must be followed for information regarding the course of the pregnancy and delivery, as well as the conditi on of the newborn. Follow -up information concerning the outcome of the pregnancy should be provided to the Sponsor in a timely manner. Additional follow -up is not needed when a newborn baby is healthy."

Statistical an d Analytical Plans A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and approved prior to database lock for this study that describes the final analyses to be completed for safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints . If, after the study has b een completed, changes are made to the statistical analysis plan referenced below, these deviations to the plan will be listed, along with an explanation as to why they occurred, in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). The key aspects of those analyses are summarized below. 9.1.1. Interim Analysis No formal interim analysis is planned for the primary safety endpoints in this open -label study to assess the safety and tolerability of FX006 after repeat administration . However, interim analysis may be conducted with exploratory endpoints to examine efficacy signals f ollowing administration of one or two doses of 32mg FX006 . These interim analyses on exploratory endpoints may be completed for data review , regulatory updates , and/or publication (or presentation at congr esses) for this open -label study. Any interim analysis completed will have an interim analysis plan written and approved to describe the purpose and analytical objectives of the interim analysis. Final analyses , described in the protocol and statistical a nalysis plan, will be conducted after completion of the study, when all subjects have either discontinued the study early (prior to Week 52) or completed the study through Week 52. 9.1.2. Final Analyses All final analyses will be completed following database lock . Final analyses specified in the protocol and SAP will be completed and reported in the CSR . Interim analyses conducted with exploratory endpoints to examine efficacy signals prior to database lock will also be reported in the final CSR. Post-hoc, or addi tional exploratory analyses, not defined in the SAP may be completed to further understand ing and elucidat ion of the study results. Any post -hoc, exploratory, analyses completed will be clearly identified as such in the final CSR . 9.2. General Considerations a nd Methods Data collected in this study will be presented using summary tables, figures, and patient data listings. Summary tables will present data by treatment group and, if applicable, by time of collection. Continuous variables will be summarized usi ng descriptive statistics, specifically the number of patients (n), the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, and coefficient of variations (%CV) . Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages. Confidence interv als will be provided where appropriate for derived endpoints . Figures will be used to support the presentation of certain data. Sensitivity analyses may be performed to examine the effect of missing data, as well as the effect of Baseline imbalance for secondary endpoints . All confidence intervals (CIs), statistical tests, and resulting p values will be reported as 2 -sided. Significance will be assessed at α = 0.05 level and the significance level will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons in the exploratory efficacy endpoint analyses."

Analysis Populations Three main analysis populations are planned for this study as follows:  Safety Population: All patients who received study medication . The Safety Population will be used to assess safety and tol erability for the primary endpoint.  FAS Population: All patients who received study drug and provide at least one post - baseline efficacy endpoint assessment. The FAS population will be used to examine exploratory efficacy endpoints.  Biomarker Population: All p atients who received study medication and provide at least one synovial fluid sample for biomarker analysis. During the course of this study interim analyses may be completed to examine efficacy signals. Populations utilized for those interim analyse s will be clearly defined in an interim analysis plan, and in the final CSR. 9.2.2. Study Data Study data identified in this protocol are to be collected, and source verified, on eCRF at sites completing the study. All study data will be formulated into data set s to provide transparency, traceability, and integrity of trial analysis results from collection source. Observed study data will be mapped to the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC ) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) and serve as the so urce data from the trial. All study analyses will be completed using analysis data sets that are derived from the SDTM and follow the CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADaM) architecture. 9.2.2.1. Clinical Data – CDISC Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) Domains will be ma pped to CDISC SDTM version 3.2. No derived data required for analysis are included in the SDTM domains. All SDTM domains will be fully documented with define documents (DEFINE.XML) and a Study Data Reviewer’s Guide (SDRG) after database lock and final anal yses are completed. 9.2.2.2. Analysis Data – CDISC Analysis Data Model (ADaM) All planned and exploratory analyses will be completed using CDISC compliant ADaM data sets derived from the SDTM domains for this study. Analysis data sets will contain all derived study endpoints required for analysis. All ADaM analysis data sets will be fully documented with define documents (DEFINE.XML) and an Analysis Data Reviewer’s Guide (ADRG) after database lock and final analyses are completed. 9.2.3. Study Variables for Assessment Please refer to Section 7.7.1 for study variables for the primary safety endpoint . 9.2.4. Sub-Groups and Covariates No pre -planned sub -groups are identif ied for this study. Sub-groups may be defined for interim analyses of exploratory efficacy endpoints. In the final analysis, Sub-groups may also be defined"

Covariates for exploratory efficacy analyses will be fully defined in the SAP and interim analysis plans. 9.3. Determination of Sample Size A sample size of approximately 100 patients who receive two doses of FX006 is considered a reasonable sample size in or der to assess the safety profile of repeat administration of FX006. No formal power and sample size calculations have been made as the analysis of the efficacy data collected from this study will be consid ered exploratory and hypothesis -generating for future multiple dose studies of FX006. In order to ensure at least 100 patients who receive two doses of FX006 are enrolled and followed for 52 weeks, approximately 200 patients will be enrolled based on an estimate that approximately 66% of patients enrol led will be eligible to receive a second dose of FX006 and approximately 75% of subjects who receive a second dose will complete the study through Week 52. 9.4. General statistical Methods 9.4.1. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline chara cteristics will be listed by study site and patient , and will be summarized by treatment. Frequencies and proportions will be presented for the categorical variables and descriptive statistics will be presented for continuous variables. 9.4.2. Exposure Treatmen t exposure will be listed by study site and patient , and will be summarized by dose s administered, as well as total exposure to FX006 . Time between FX006 exposure (1st and 2nd doses) will be summarized. 9.4.3. Exploratory Efficacy Analyses The examination of eff icacy is exploratory in this study. Data from the WOMAC® questionnaire will be presented in by -patient listings with summary presentation of the data and exploratory analyses. Analysis of the magnitude of pain relief observed with WOMAC A (pain) , stiffnes s (WOMAC B), and function (WOMAC C) will be explored between patients who receive one or two doses of FX006 will be explored with longitudinal mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed effects of number of doses (1 or 2) received, and a dose by t ime interaction . Model covariates will include study site, and potentially other variables. Subject will be a random effect in the model. The exact configuration for the MMRM will be fully described in the SAP or interim analysis plans. A within subject analysis will be completed to examine the differences in WOMAC scores following the first dose, and then following a second dose of FX006. Change from baseline for the first dose and change from last assessment prior to second dose will be completed with linear models. The details of the linear model will be specified in the SAP Evaluation of dose -response"

The time to maximal pain relief response with WOMAC A (pain) following the first and second doses of FX006 will be examined using a Kaplan -Meier (KM) procedure. Questionnaire data f rom the GPAQ domains (occupational physical activity, transport -related physical activity, and physical activity during discretionary or leisure time) will be described descriptively at the two time points collected ( Screening and Week 12). The change in G PAQ domain scores and total score will be examined with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with summaries comparing patients who receive one dose to those receiving two doses of FX006. GPAQ information collected at Screening will be utilized to normali ze steps per day based on lifestyles activity. GPAQ information will be a model covariate in subsequent analyses. 9.4.4. Safety Analyses AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ) dictionary. Incidences (number and percent) TEAEs, those events that started after dosing or worsened in severity after dosing, will be presented by treatment group. Incidences of TEAEs will also be presented by maximum severity and relationship to stu dy medication. Similar presentations will be provided for serious AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from the study, or AEs leading to death. Analysis of AE data will include examination of the incidence rates and changes in severity of TEAEs and index knee r elated TEAEs following the first dose and second dose, as well as the cumulative incidence of TEAEs after all doses of FX006. Both the number of events and the number of patients experiencing an event will be examined to assess the by patient cumulative incidence of TEAEs associated with repeat administration . The cumulative TEAE incidence rate will also be compared with total exposure to FX006. Clinical laboratory data and vital sign information will be presented as descriptive summary statistics for value and change from Baseline at each individual time point."
