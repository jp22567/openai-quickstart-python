SOBI003 is administered as weekly i.v. infusions over a period of time of 4 hours. The stu dy treatment period comprises 24 weekly infusions. Prior to initiation of each infusion, the patients are pretreated with a single dose of non - sedative antihistamine. If infusion -related reactions occur, then the infusion duration may be expanded up to 24 hours and supportive medication may be administered, at the discretion of the investigator. The study is planned to consist of 3 dose cohorts, each comprising 3 patients, provided that no significant safety concern arise. An additional cohort comprising 3 patients may be added, if deemed necessary to more accurately characterize the safety, tolerability, PK or PD. The screening visit can be performed up to 12 weeks prior to the first SOBI003 infusion . At the screening visit, the MPS IIIA diagnosis is veri fied and the genotype is determined at a central laboratory. Patients are assigned to a dose cohort in strict consecutive order as the eligibility criteria have been confirmed. Treatment initiations will be staggered within each cohort in order to be able to observe, interpret and treat possible adverse reactions and to ensure that such reactions can be dealt with promptly. For each cohort, S afety Review Committee meetin gs are scheduled approximately 3 week s after completion of the 3rd patient’s 4th dose a dministration. Based on the safety, immunogenicity, PK and PD data, the SRC will determine what dose to apply in the next cohort . An independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor safety data at pre - specified intervals . Upon completion of the 24 -week t reatment period with satisfactory tolerability, the patient is offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment by participation in an extension study. Number of subjects planned: 9 In case of an additional 4th cohort and replacements of prematurely withdrawn patients, the number of patients will not exceed 1 5. Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: MPS IIIA patients , as confirmed by both a documented deficiency in sulfamidase enzyme activity in concordance with a diagnosis of MPS IIIA and no rmal enzyme activity level of at least one other sulfatase measured in leukocytes , that are ≥12 to ≤72 months of age and that have a developmental age ≥12 months. Patients with at least one S298P mutation in the SGSH gene are excluded, as well as patients that have received prior stem cell or gene therapy, or enzyme replacement therapy f or MPS IIIA."

MPS IIIA is a rare disease with rapid progression from early childhood, often resulting in death during the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. Currently there is no approved treatment and to date, therapy is limited to symptomatic treatment and relief of symptoms. The unmet medical need is therefore high."
20,page_20,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 21 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 This first -in-human Phase I/II study is designed to determine the safety, tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of SOBI003 in pediatric MPS IIIA patients. Healthy volunteers with normal enzyme levels are not a suitable population as they are not a representative population for assessment of safety, tolerability, immunogenici ty and PD . 5.1 Background 5.1.1 MPS IIIA MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo A, is an inher ited LSD that is progressive, life -shortening and rare. MPS IIIA is one of 4 distinct subtypes of MPS III (denoted IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID) ( 3). MPS IIIA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SGSH gene that result in absence of or a deficiency in the enzyme sulfamidase (N -sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase). Lack of sulfamidase activity leads to insufficient degradation of HS and lysosomal accumulation of HS and its metabolites in lysosomes throughout the body ( 4). As of today, 142 mutations have been described in the SGSH gene coding for sulfamidase ( 5). Data suggest a geno - and phenotype correlation and that patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for the S298P mutation have a slower progression of the disease ( 6). Depending on disease severity, patients have a median life -expectancy of about 15 years. The clinical course of MPS IIIA can be divided into 3 phases ( 7). In the first phase, which usually starts between 1 and 4 years of age, a developmental delay becomes apparent after an initial normal deve lopment during the first 1 to 2 years of life. The most prominent finding in this phase is speech d elay ( 6,7,8). The diagnosis of MPS IIIA is usually established during the second phase, which generally starts around 3 to 4 years of age. This phase is characterized by increasing behavioral problems with hyperactivity, aggressive and destru ctive behavior as well as reduced attention span (7), which responds poorly to standard medications and behavioral -based interventions ( 9). A pronounced and rapid decline in cognitive skills becomes evident and the sleeping pattern is disturbed with extreme difficulty in falling asleep and with frequ ent awakening ( 10). In the third and final “quiet” phase , behavioral symptoms diminish while motor retardation emerges with walking and swallowing difficulties sometimes requiring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. The progressive neurodegeneration causes spasticity, seizures, loss of speech, and severe dementia , which ultima tely results in a vegetative state ( 9). Patients usually die from respiratory infections in the end of the second or beginning of the third decade of life ( 11,12) although patients with a slowly progressing phen otype may live longer ( 6). 5.1.2 SOBI003 SOBI003 is a chemically modified variant of recombinant human sulfamidase. SOBI003 is a sterile solution for i .v. infusion after dilution . In this Phase I/II study, SOBI003 is administered once weekly."
21,page_21,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 22 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 By modification of the sulfamidase glycans, the uptake of SOBI003 systemically is strongly reduced. This translates into a reduced serum clearance as demonstrated in m ice. SOBI003 passes the blood -brain barrier (BBB) presumably by adsorptive mediated transcytosis, whereby the increased plasma exposure facilitates generation of pharmacological relevant levels of SOBI003 in the central nervous system (CNS ) compartment. On ce SOBI003 enters the target cells and reaches the lysosomal compartment, it shows enzymatic activity and stability comparable to that of unmodified sulfamidase, as demonstrated in fibroblasts of MPS IIIA patients. 5.1.3 SOBI003 nonclinical development In a MPS IIIA mouse model with a spontaneous missense mutation of the SGSH gene, disease manifestations similar to the human conditions are obtained, including lysosomal storage of HS and neurological pathology. In these mice, repeated i.v. administration of SOBI003 resulted in a dose and time dependent clearance of HS in brain. The reduction in HS translated into improvements in terms of lysosomal size and neuroinflammation as well as beneficial effects on behavioral impairments . HS reduction in cerebrosp inal fluid ( CSF) correlated with reduction of HS in whole brain of MPS IIIA mice following repeated i.v. administration of SOBI003 , thus support ing the use of HS reduction in CSF as a biomarker of disease modification. In MPS IIIA mice, a relationship betw een treatment effect and SOBI003 dose level and treatment duration was observed. The reduction of HS in brain was related to the accumulated active SOBI003 dose. The return to baseline HS biomarker levels after discontinuation of treatment was also a gradu al process in this mouse model. To quantify and understand the dose, time, concentration and effect relationship in MPS IIIA mice, a semi -mechanistic in silico model was developed based on mouse PK, distribution of SOBI003 to the brain, SOBI003 entering target cells, the intracellular retention of SOBI003 and an intracellular SOBI003 concentration - effect relationship on HS reduction. Human fibroblasts of an MPS IIIA patient ( GM00879, Coriell Institute ) were used for in vitro determination of SOBI003 cell en try rate, cell retention, and intracellular concentration -effect relationship. Allometric scaling from rat and cynomolgus monkey to human was applied to predict clearance and volume of distribution in patients (body weight 20 kg). Translating the mouse in silico model to human repeated weekly administration of 3 mg/kg, SOBI003 is predicted to gradually achieve a brain HS reduction of ~ 35 % after 3 months and ~ 45 % after 6 months treatment. Thus, according to model -based simulations using the in silico mod el, the 3 mg/kg dose level is expected to gradually elicit a pharmacological effect in CNS in humans. Repeated weekly administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg SOBI003 is predicted to achieve a brain HS reduction of ~ 75 % and ~ 80 % after 3 months and ~ 80 % and ~ 85 % respectively after 6 months treatment relative to baseline. Nonclinical safety assessments have been performed to support the SOBI003 development program. The nonclinical safety studies were performed in accordance to international standards for dr ug development and OECD Principles of GLP. A 3 -month toxicity study was performed in MPS IIIA mice, a disease model to evaluate any potential interactions of the drug and the"
22,page_22,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 23 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 disease. A 1 -month toxicity study in healthy non -human primates (cynomolgus monke y) was also performed. In addition, to support the clinical development in pediatric patients, juvenile rats were treated for one month from 10 days up to 5 weeks of age, which corresponds to a life - span in humans ranging from neonates up to the age of 6 y ears. Throughout the nonclinical safety program SOBI003 was administered by i.v. infusion every third day following p re- treatment with anti-histamine to appropriately resemble the clinical treatment regimen. In the species tested, the treated animals did not show any signs of adverse effects. Thus, the safety evaluation of SOBI003 has shown that it is well -tolerated . In favor of SOBI003 treatment was also improvements in the disease state in MPS IIIA mice , such as lower incidences and/or severity of micros copic findings and with lower kidney, liver and spleen weights . However, the histopathological examinations revealed that the treatment of all three species at higher doses were associated with an accumulation of eosinophilic material in the cytoplasm of m acrophages of various origin; liver, lymph nodes and the heart. The observations were clearly dose dependent and did not cause any detected harmful effects or other negative consequences to the animals. The observations were partially reversible after 4 weeks withdrawal of treatment. The anomalies were judged to be a result of a normal physiological function of tissue macrophages to scavenge proteins and the observed accumulation may be due to the high protein load. Thus, since these findings were not consi dered as adverse the NOAEL was set to the highest dose administered in the three species tested, i.e., 300 mg/kg in the mice and rats and 150 mg/kg in the cynomolgus monkeys. The lowest SOBI003 serum exposures at the NOAEL dose levels in these species wer e observed in the mice following the 300 mg/kg dose, where mean C max,ss was 86.3 and 163 μmol/L and mean AUC τ,ss was 718 and 934 μmol*h/L in in male and female mice, respectively. Based on predicted steady state PK in patients (C max,ss 0.89, 3.0, and 5.9 μ mol/L; AUC τ,ss 11.5, 38.5, and 77.0 h·μmol/L at dose levels 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg), the margins to SOBI003 exposure in the pivotal toxicity studies are thus at least 100 -fold for a starting dose of 3 mg/kg and at least 10 - fold for a dose of 20 mg/kg. Further details are presented in the SOBI003 investigator b rochure . 5.1.4 SOBI003 immun e mediated reactions In an initial explorative study in MPS IIIA mice, where the efficacy of 3 different sulfamidase derivatives was assessed (whereof SOBI003 was one), hypersensitivi ty reactions were encountered following treatment with SOBI003 . Mice were given the test articles at 30 mg/kg every other day as a bolus injection without antihistamine pretreatment. The study was terminated due to hypersensitivity reactions in connection with the fifth i.v. dose. A second study was performed, where the mice were pretreated with the antihistamine chlorpheniramine, and the injection rate was extended to approximately 5 to 10 seconds per injection. The same test articles, doses, and dose frequencies were applied as in the initial study, and the second study could be finalized as planned without any abnormal observations (a 25 -day treatment period with a total of 13 injections). Subsequently, antihistamine pretreatment was included in the c hronic efficacy studies."
23,page_23,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 24 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 The nonclinical studies in MPS IIIA mice show that ADAs are generated against SOBI003. The ADA response did not compromise safety or alter the exposure, as assessed at 24 hours after last dose administration. A number of chronic ef ficacy studies have been performed with antihistamine pretreatment in MPS IIIA mice without observing any obvious toxicities or lack of efficacy. In cynomolgus monkey a repeated dose paradigm with doses once every third day indicated that ADAs have an impa ct on SOBI003 exposure. ADAs did not appear to impact the Cmax in plasma, but possibly the AUC. Apart from these deviations, exposure after the last dose was similar to that observed after the first dose. No ADA development was seen in the pivotal juvenile rat toxicity study. Development of ADAs is a common finding in ERTs and correlates to the degree of endogenous enzyme expression ( 14, 15, 16, 17). Nonclinical assessments of immunogenicity of human proteins, applying in silico , in vitro , or animal models have, so far, shown only limited or no translatability to the clinical situation. The polypeptide sequence of SOBI003 is identical to human sulfamidase. However, as a result of use of the CHO expression system and the glycan modifications, through which some peripheral carbohydrate ring structures in the glycans are linearized, the ov erall structure of SOBI003 is not identical to human sulfamidase. Therefore, an immune reaction to SOBI003 may be expected in analogy to what occurs with other ERTs. ADAs and their impact on safety, PK and PD are monitored closely in the Phase I/II study. 5.2 Study ra tionale SOBI003 is being developed for treatment of MPS IIIA. Scientific advice on the nonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) development was obtained from the FDA on 16 February 2016 and from EMA on 28 June 2016. A pre -IND meet ing was held with the FDA on 21 June 2017 to obtain agreement on the conduct of this first -in-human study with SOBI003. This first -in-human study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of SOBI003 at 3 dose levels to provide knowledge needed to optimize the further evaluation of SOBI003 in patients with MPS IIIA . Given the above and that for ERTs, healthy volunteers are not a representative population for assessment of tolerability, immunogenicity or PD, the SOBI0 03 first -in-human study is conducted in MPS IIIA patients. The severity of disease and the limited number of patients with an acceptable level of mental and physical stability to allow study assessments warrant a condensed clinical development program. Thi s integrated Phase I/II study will therefore also include the establishment of a clinically relevant PD dose-response relationship for SOBI003. 5.3 Potentia l risks and bene fits MPS IIIA is an irreversible, progressive, life -shortening disease with no existin g effective therapeutic alternative. SOBI003 provides a potential clinical benefit by reducing the levels of"
24,page_24,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 25 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 stored HS and its metabolites and thereby reducing neuroinflammation which potentially could reduce the clinical manifestations. Apart from ADA dev elopment in two species (MPS IIIA mouse and cynomolgus monkey) out of the three included in the pivotal toxicity program, which is an expected finding considering the foreign nature of a human protein to animal species, the nonclinical safety evaluation of SOBI003 did not show any signs of adverse effects , thus SOBI003 was well -tolerated . Given the observed pharmacological and toxicological profile in the non -clinical studies, it is judged that SOBI003 can be given to man in a carefully monitored First -In-Human study. Adherence to study inclusion/exclusion criteria, staggered dose escalation, close clinical monitoring, and stopping rules will be applied . Hypersensitivity reactions/immune -mediated adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis and infusion reactio ns, are commonly reported for lysosomal ERTs. To reduce the incidence and severity of these adverse reactions, slow infusion rates, prolonged infusion duration and pretreatment with antihistamines will be applied. Severe and potentially life -threatening ad verse hypersensitivity/immune -mediated reactions may however still occur. Close clinical supervision by medical staff that are experienced with ERT treatment will be applied during and after the infusions. This will ensure early detection and adequate tre atment of potential adverse reactions. Potential hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic events and infusion related reactions will be treated in accordance with the current anaphylactic algorithm ( 19) including treatment with antipyretics and additional antihistamines to manage milder hypersensitivity/immune -mediated reactions. Availability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and i mmediate access to emergency medical services will be secured. Potential delayed hypersensitivity reactions may occur outside the hospital setting (refer to Section 7.1. for minimum hospitalization periods during study participation). Parents/caregivers will be carefully informed of potential signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions and of the importance to seek immediate medical attention. The potential cli nical benefit of the 24 -week treatment period of this study is expected to be limited as the need of ERT is expected to be life -long. Therefore , patients that complete the 24 - week treatment period will be offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment by p articipation in an extension study. Furthermore, the dose -levels applied in this study are expected to be sufficiently pharmacologically active to result in peripheral and central reduction of HS, potentially also reducing or stabilizing neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration with potential effect on clinical manifestations including amelioration of neurocognitive dysfunction in these patients with MPS IIIA. These predictions are based on current nonclinical data, and are thus to be confirmed in clinical studies. Potential study procedural risks include the use of sedation/general anesthesia, the surgical procedure and use of a central venous access port. To minimize study related risks, local hospital procedures will be applied for the procedures. The se lection of anesthetic method will be in accordance with local hospital routines and as judged by pediatric anesthesiologist with prior experience from MPS patients. The local surgeon will make the decision on which vein to be used for the central venous ac cess port for each individual patient. The parents/caregivers will be"

This includes the actions to take in case an infection is suspected. SAEs are captured from the time the IC F is signed and adverse events are captured from the start of the first SOBI003 infusion. In summary, the potential benefits of SOBI003 treatment are considered to outweigh the foreseeable risks. 6 Stud y objectives and endpoin ts 6.1 Primar y obje ctive The primary objective is : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOBI003 at different dose levels. 6.1.1 Prima ry end point The primary endpoint to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SOBI003 is:  Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEA Es) and Serious Adverse Ev ents (SAE s) 6.1.2 Secondary endpoints related to the primary objective The secondary endpoints to evaluate the safety and to lerability of SOBI003 are:  Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation )  Laboratory safety variables (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry and urine analysis) 6.2 Seconda ry obje ctives The secondary objectives are the following: 1.

SOBI003 is administered as weekly i.v. infusions ov er a period of time of 4 hours. The study treatment period comprises 24 weekly infusions. Prior to initiation of each infusion, the patients are pretreated with a single dose of non -sedative antihistamine. If infusion -related reactions occur, then the infu sion duration may be expanded up to 24 hours and supportive medication may be administered , at the discretion of the investigator. The study is planned to consist of 3 dose cohorts, each comprising 3 patients. The principal investigator and Sobi may decide to replace patients withdrawn prematurely , when applicable. An additional cohort comprising 3 patients may be added, if deemed necessary to more accurately characterize the safety, tolerability, PK or PD. The total number of patients to be expo sed to SOBI003 is not to exceed 15. The study population is MPS IIIA patients that are 1 to 6 years of age, excluding patients with the S298P genotype. The study is planned to be conducted in the U.S.A. , Turkey , Netherlands and Germany , at up to five study sites in total. A central venous access port is used for SOBI003 infusions and for PK, PD and safety laboratory blood samplings. Blood sampling from additional peripheral line is applied in accordance with local hospital routine and also to verify PK analyses from the central line (Section 7.5.6.1 ). Refer to Section 7.5.1.3 for details on insertion of the port ."
29,page_29,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 30 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 At the start of screening , i.e., when the ICF is signed, the majority of patients are expected to already have a confirmed MPS IIIA diag nosis, either by genotyping or verification of reduced sulfamidase enzyme activity. The anticipated number of screen failures is therefore expected to be low , i.e., 10 to 20% or up to 2 patients. The screening visit can be perform ed up to 12 weeks prior to the first SOBI00 3 infusion . At the screening visit, the MPS IIIA diagnosis is verified and the genotype is determined at a central laboratory (see Section 7.5.2.1 ). To determine the patient’s developmental age, the VABS -II is assessed by interviewing the patient’s parent/caregiver and the mean of the subdomain age - equivalence scores is determined. Once the patient eligibility has been confirmed , visits are scheduled for baseline assessments and insertion of a central venous access port (see Section 7.5.1.3 ). The baseline assessments and procedure s should be performed within 6 weeks prior to the first SOBI003 infusion. There should however be at least 2 weeks between the insertion of the venous access port and the first SOBI003 infusion , and the VABS -II and BSID -III/KABC -II should be assessed within 2 weeks prior to the first SOBI003 infusion . The total study duration for an individual patient will range from 31 to 36 weeks . Patients are assigned to a dose cohort in consecutive order as the eligibility crite ria have been confirmed , with prioritization of the younger patients. There is thus no restriction or requirement regarding the site distribution of patients per cohort, i.e., patients within one cohort can be recruited at only one site or at multiple sites. Treatment initiations will be staggered within each cohort in order to be able to observe, interpret and treat possible adverse reactions and to ensure that such reactions can be dealt with promptly. For the first patient w ithin each dose cohort, the investigator will revie w safety data, including the safety laboratory results, and signs and symptoms captured up to Day 6 of the dosed patient and notify Sobi in writing of his conclusion of adequate safety for exposing a new patient to the same SOBI003 do se level . Once the adequate safety has been concluded for the first patient, invasive baseline assessments of the next patients in the cohort can be initiated . There will be a minimum of 3 days between treatment initiations in the 2nd and 3rd patient within the cohort. Before the 3rd patient within the same dose cohort is exposed to SOBI003, the investigator will review available safety data and signs and symptoms of the dosed patient(s) at his /her site and notify Sobi in writing of his conclu sion of adequate safety for exposing a new patient to the same SOBI003 dose level . Sobi will then confirm whether a new patient can be dosed. Should the investigator or Sobi have any safety concerns, then an ad hoc SRC meeting will be summoned to determine dosing of additional patients. For each cohort, SRC meetin gs are scheduled approximately 3 week s after completion of the 3rd patient’s 4th dose administration. Prior to commencing invasive baseline assessments of patients for the next cohort, the SRC will review pre -specified safety, immunogenicity, and PK data to confirm that continued dosing is safe. In addition, PD data in terms of HS in serum and urine , as well as any available HS levels in CSF, will be reviewed. Based on the safety, immunogenicity, PK and PD data, the SRC will determine what dose to apply in the next cohort (see Section 7.5.5.9 )."

The dose level for Cohort 1 is selected on the basis of nonclinical data, the PK/PD in silico model and the emerging toxicology data (see Section 7.4.5.1 ). Close clinical monitoring of patients will be required during and after SOBI003 administration for any symptoms of anaphylaxis , hypersensitivity reactions, circulatory and/or respiratory changes, urticaria, or other signs of related reaction s. Anaphylactic reactions will be treated in accordance with current anaphylaxis algorithm “ Hypersensitivity to Biological Agents - Updated Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment ” issued by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAI) (19).

An emergency card containing details on how to seek medical help will be provided to each parent/caregiver and they will be instructed to always carry the emergency card with them. The c ard will also contain brief details on the study treatment and contact details to site staff in order to secure appropriate medical management of any emergency situation that has to be managed outside the study site. Depending on the distance and any trave lling difficulties, the patient and parent (s) may be relocated for the full study duration. The families are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses and , if applicable, for caregiver meals during the hospitalization periods. Appointed study coordi nators will assist the families with travel and accommodation arrangements. Upon completion of the 24 -week treatment period with satisfactory tolerability, the patient is offered to receive continued SOBI003 treatment by participation in an extension stud y. A DMC will monitor safety data at pre -specified intervals throughout the 24-week and the extension studies. 7.2 Discussio n of study de sign Regulatory advice on the design of the Phase I/II study was obtained from the FDA on 21 June 2017. The non-controlled design of the FIH study is justified by the MPS IIIA disease severity, rapid progression, lack of available treatment and the limited number of potential pa tients for study participation. Three sequential dose levels with 3 patients in each cohort will enable assessment of safety and tolerability, as well as characterize a pharmacodynamic dose -response relationship."
32,page_32,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 33 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 A study duration of 24 weeks has been chosen to enable establishment of a dose -response relation in terms of reduction of HS in CSF. Patients between 1 and 6 years of age who have not received previous treatment for MPS IIIA with an ERT, gene - or stem cell therapy will be eligible to participate in this study. Patients carrying the S298P mutation, a mutation that is associated wi th a slower progression of disease, will be excluded to reduce the variability in HS levels in CSF. Patients below 1 year are considered more vulnerable and it would be preferable to initiate inclusion of such patients after the safety of SOBI003 has bee n established in older patients. In addition, the lower age limit of 1 year has been selected to reduce the potential variability in SOBI003 PK and to ensure that the blood sampling volumes needed for the Phase I/II study can be collected. Applying the European Commission guidance (20), the study -related blood loss should not exceed 3% of the total blood volume during a period of 4 weeks and should not exceed 1% at any single time. In an average 1 year -old child with a bodyweight of 10 kg, it is thus considered acceptable to draw blood volumes of 8 mL as a single draw and 24 mL over a 4-week period, assuming an estimated blood volume of 80 mL/kg . These volumes are consid ered appropriate to adequately monitor safety and to generate data enabling conclusions on PK and PD. The upper age limit of 6 years has been selected to exclude patients that are close to progressing or who have progressed to a more severe state of diseas e which might interfere with protocol compliance. As a precautionary measure , staggered dosing is applied. For the first patient within each dose cohort, t he investigator will revie w safety data, including the safety laboratory results, and signs and symp toms captured up to Day 6 of the dosed patient and notify Sobi in writing of his conclusion of adequate safety for exposing a new patient to the same SOBI003 dose level . There will be a minimum of 3 days between treatment initiations in the 2nd and 3rd patient within the cohort. This staggered treatment initiation is expected to be sufficient to monitor for acute and subacute adverse events prior to treating additional patient s at the same dose level . For each cohort, SRC meetings are scheduled approxim ately 3 week s after completion of the 3rd patient’s 4th dose administration. The 4 -week treatment period prior to dose escalation is chosen to enable a detection of an early immunogenicity response following limited number of repeated doses. In addition, b ased on current data, steady -state of SOBI003 in serum is expected to have been approached at this time point. 7.3 Selection of study po pulation 7.3.1 Inclusion criteria A patient must fulfill the following criteria in order to be included in the study: 1.

During the informed consent process, the investigator will clarify that it is essential for the patient’s safety to be willing to comply with the study protocol requirements, including study safety and immunogenicity assessments following a potential withdrawal of study treatment. When a patient is withdrawn from study treatment, the date and time of the last SOBI003 infusion and th e date and reason for treatment withdrawal should be clearly described in the relevant sections of the case report form (CRF). If a patient is removed from treatment because of an adverse event (AE), the reason for treatment withdrawal should always be sta ted as ‘adverse event’ irrespective of whether this was the investigator’s or the patient’s primary caregiver(s) decision. The study assessments as specified in Section 7.5.1.13 should be completed as soon as possible after making the treatment withdrawal decision. If study treatment is withdrawn due to AE(s), additional safety assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator, as warranted by the AE(s) leading to treatment withdrawal."

A patient that is withdrawn from the study should be examined as soon as possible , whenever possible, irrespective of the reason for withdrawal . Refer to Sections 7.3.3.1 and 7.5.1.13 for guidance on applicable study assessments to be completed when the decision to withdraw from the study coincides with the decision to withdraw study treatment. For any patient that is found to be ADA -positive after completion of the repeated Early Termination assessments (as specified in Sections 7.5.1.13 and Table 3), every effort should be made to continue ADA samplings at approximately monthly basis until the ADA has disappeared or titers have stabilized at a lower level (refer to Sections 7.5.5.3 and 7.5.6.1 ). Irrespective of the study assessments to be perfo rmed in case of treatment and/or study withdrawal, a patient that is withdrawn from study treatment due to an adverse event, should be followed up until the AE(s) leading to treatment withdrawal are either resolved or have stabilized even after the patient ’s participation in the study is over. Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve . 7.3.4 Replacem ent of withdrawn patient s The principal investigator and Sobi may decide to replace patients that are withdrawn prematurely from treatment , when applicable.

SOBI003 is administered as 4 -hour i.v. infusions given o nce weekly for a durat ion of 24 weeks. In case of occurrence of infusion reactions, the infusion duration may be prolonged up to 24 hours at the discretion of the investigator. Three dose levels of SOBI003 will be assessed, provided that the SRC concludes that the safety profile is acceptable. The planned lowest dose level is 3 mg/kg (cohort 1). For cohorts 2 and 3, the dose level s will be selected on basis of at least 4 -week safety, PK, immunogenicity, and PD data of prior dose cohort(s) as well as applicable toxicology data (refer to Section 7.4.5 ). An additional cohort comprising 3 patients may be added, if deemed necessary for safety, tolerability, PK or PD evaluation. SOBI003 solution , 20 mg/mL, is mixed with NaCl 0.9% infusion solution prior to administration. For a bodyweight < 25 kg, the total infusion vol ume is 10 0 mL. For a bodyweight ≥ 25 kg, the total infusion volume is 250 mL. Actual materials to be used for mixing SOBI003 solution with NaCl infusion solution (i.e., infusion solutions, syringes and needles) and for administering the infusions (i.e., infusion lines, syringes, manifolds, venous access ports) must be preapproved by Sobi to secure that all materials are compatible with SOBI003.

Possible deficiencies related to the handling , storage and quality of the IMPs should be reported to the study monitor and also directly to complaints@sobi.com. 7.4.3 Metho d of assigning patient s to a treatment gro up Upon provision of signed informed consent, patients are assigned a site -specific enrolment number in strict consecutive order. Upon completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of patient eligibility, including confirmation of sulfamidase enzymatic activity, patients are assigned a subject number and allocated to a dose cohort in strict consecutive order. The terminology of “enrolled patients” refer to patients that have been assigned an enrolment number. The terminology of “included patients” refer to patients that have been assigned a subject number (and hence, assigned to a specific cohort) . The first 3 included patients are thus assigned to Cohort 1 and administrations of SOBI003 at 3 mg/kg/week. 7.4.4 Select ion of dos es 7.4.5 Select ion of dose levels 7.4.5.1 Dose level for Cohort 1 The starting dose of 3 mg/kg has been selected based on the Maximum Recommended Starting Dose (MRSD) which is derived from the NOAEL defined in the pivotal toxicology studies and an estimation of the pharmacologic ally active dose (PAD). The nonclinical safety evaluation of SOBI003 did not show any signs of adverse effects. Thus, the safety evaluation of SOBI003 has shown that it is well -tolerated. Also, improvements in the disease state in MPS IIIA mice were show n. A dose dependent, partially reversible accumulation of eosinophilic material in the cytoplasm of macrophages of various origin was observed in all three species, but these were considered to be a result of a normal physiological function of tissue macro phages and were therefore not considered to be adverse. Consequently, the NOAEL was set to the highest dose administered in the three species tested, i.e. , 300 mg/kg in the rodents and 150 mg/kg in the cynomolgus monkeys . Based on predicted steady state PK in patients (Cmax 0.89 μmol/L; AUC τ,ss 11.5 h·μmol/L for the dose level 3 mg/kg), the margins to SOBI003 exposure in the pivotal toxicity studies are at least 100 -fold for a starting dose of 3 mg/kg. Further details are presented in Section 5.3.13 of the investigator br ochure ."
37,page_37,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 38 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 The MRSD is estimated to 2 .4 mg/kg and has been based on the NOAEL derived from the pivotal toxicology studies in MPSIII A mice. The lowest HED when calculated from the NOAELs was obtained from the MPS IIIA mice constituting the most sensitive species in the toxicology studies. The highest dose in this study, 300 mg/kg did not cause any adverse effects. The NOAEL can therefore be determined to be at least 300 mg/kg. The body weight -adjusted human equivalent dose (HED) can thus be calculated to be 24 mg/kg , and by using a 10-fold-safety margin the MRSD will be 2.4 mg/kg. The PAD has been estimated to 3 mg/kg. This is based on model -based simulations using an in silico model where the 3 mg/kg dose level is expected to elicit a potential pharmacological effect in CNS. A repeated dose of 3 mg/kg SOBI003 in humans will gradually result in a HS reduction in the brain of ~ 35% after 3 months and ~ 45% after 6 months treatment, whereas only negligible effect is expected after a single dose of 3 mg/kg. The Minimal Anticipated Biological Effect L evel ( MABEL ) for SOBI003 is based on peripheral HS reduction in liver, spleen, heart, and lung following single dose administration in MPS IIIA mice , and has been set to 0.1 mg/kg . The SOBI003 dose levels that are expected to produce a pharmacological effe ct in the CNS are much higher, and the SOBI003 exposure in the CNS is much lower than peripherally according to nonclinical distribution studies. A starting dose of 3 mg/kg is based on PAD and the estim ated MRSD (2.4 mg/kg), which however is higher than th e MABEL for peripheral effects (0.1 mg/kg ). Sobi considers a starting dose of 3 mg/kg justified given the nature of the target, the low risk for off -target toxicities with biologics like SOBI003, that acute toxicities related to on -target sulfamidase enzym e activity are not expected and that SOBI003 does not possess any agonistic properties. Furthermore, the MPS IIIA mouse is considered a relevant pharmacology and toxicology species for SOBI003 ( 21). Finally, MPS IIIA is a chronically debilitating, progressive, irreversible, life -shortening disease with no effective curative treatment available where the favorable benefit/risk ratio for SOBI003 supports the use of a PAD for the selection of the starting dose . 7.4.5.2 Dose levels for Cohort 2 and 3 With a starting dose of 3 mg/kg and given adequate safety, the planned mid and maximum dose levels are 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively. The SRC will review pre -specified safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data to confirm that continued/escalating dosing is safe (see Section 7.5.5 .9). SRC can also decide to await further safety data, apply the same or a lower dose level for the next cohort, halt or discontinue the study. The highest expected target dose of 20 mg/kg will be guided by emerging safety and tolerability data in this study. Predicted serum conc entrations of SOBI003 at 20 mg/kg in humans are 5.9 µmol/L for C max,SS and 77.0 h*µmol/L for AUC τ,SS. This provides a 15 -fold margin between predicted exposure at 20 mg/kg and the NOAEL in the most sensitive species (MPS IIIA mice) (for details, refer to S ectio n 5.3.13 of the SOBI003 investigator bro chure ). Based on the preclinical PK/PD model translated to patients, the effect on HS reduction is predicted to be both time and exposure dependent. Repeated weekly administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg SOBI003 is p redicted to achieve a brain HS reduction of ~ 75 % and ~ 80 % after 3"
38,page_38,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -001 Confidential Page 39 of 88 Version 2 .0 Final Date 06 Jul 2018 months and ~ 80 % and ~ 85 % respectively after 6 months treatment relative to baseline (refer to Section 7.1 of the SOBI003 investigator brochure) Dose escalations will continue until t he maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved (refer to Section 7.5.5.9.1 ) or expected target dose is reached. 7.4.6 Selection and timing of doses for each patient Upon completion of the screening assessments and confirmation of patient eligibility, including confirmation of sulfamidase enzymatic activity, patients are assigned a subject number and allocated to a dose cohort in strict consecutive order. At the time o f the first SOBI003 infusion, the patient should not have clinical ly significant evidence of ongoing infection, as judged by the investigator , or ongoing treatment with antibiotics . In such cases, the first infusion should be postponed until the infection has resolved. SOBI003 is administered as 4 -hour i.v. infusions given o nce weekly for a duration of 24 weeks. The infusions are administered by qualified health care professionals . Every effort should be made to have the infusions administered every 7th day. A +/ - 1-day window is applied after the 4th infusion. Therefore, if the first infusion was administered for instance on a Wednesday, then the 5th to the 24th infusions can be administered on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays . In case of signs and/or symptoms of ongoing infection at subsequent infusion occasions, infusion may be postponed, as judged by the investigator. If the infusion needs to be postponed more than 3 days, then the investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s MD to determine the timi ng of the next infusion (i.e., whether to await the next scheduled infusion). Within 30 to 60 minutes prior to each infusion, a single dose of a non-sedative antihistamine should be administered. The antihistamine can either be e.g., cetirizine, levo-cetirizine, loratadine, des -loratadine or fexofenadine, and the administered doses wi ll be in compliance with locally approved labeling. The antihistamine agent is selected at the discretion of the investigator. Antipyretic medication may also be administ ered, at the discretion of the investigator . The actual doses of SOBI003 to be administered should be based on the patient’s bodyweight at 4-week intervals (i.e., the actual dose administered at Weeks 1 to 4 is based on the bodyweight obtained pre -infusion at Week 1, the actual dose administered at Weeks 5 to 8 is based on the bodyweight obtained pre -infusion at Week 5, etc.). The body weight is obtained either on the day prior to the infusion or the day of infusion . SOBI003 concentrated solution is diluted with NaCl 0.9% infusion solution prior to administration. For a bodyweight < 25 kg, the targeted total infusion volume is 100 mL. For a bodyweight ≥ 25 kg, the targeted total infusion volume is 25 0 mL. If the infusion bag contains an overfill volume, the infusion should continue un til the infusion bag is emptied. The final concentration of SOBI003 in the infusion bag will be calculated based on the added volume of SOBI003 to the infusion bag, and the total volume in the infusion bag."

The infusion rate will be set to deliver the remaining 97% of the dose/infusion volume over the next 3 hours. Infusion rate schedules are provided in a separate IMP manual . In case of occurrence of infusion reactions, the infusion duration may be prolonged up to 24 hours at the discretion of the investigator. The drug accountability records will capture sufficient det ails to verify the amount of SOBI003 administered at each infusion occasion. 7.4.7 Prior and concomitant thera py Other therap ies considered necessary for the patient’s welfare including melatonin for sleep disorder may be given at the discretion of the investig ator. Patients on low dose genistein (<10 mg/kg/day) may continue treatment on the same dose throughout the study. All such therapy that is administered or used from the time of enrolment until completion of the study must be recorded in the CRF. This incl udes prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over -the-counter medications and the anesthetic drugs administered during study procedures (oxygen is not captured). Preferably, the treatment regimen should be unaltered during the study an d thus only adjusting dose or medication(s) when medically warranted. No other medicinal product under investigation may be used concomitantly with the IMP(s) in this study. In addition, prior exposure to stem cell or gene therapy and ERT for MPS IIIA wil l not be allowed. As described in Section 7.4.6 , a single dose of an oral non -sedative antihistamine should be administered prior to start of each SOBI003 infusion . Each administration is recorded in the CRF. In case of identified infusion -related reactions, immediate treatment is given at the discretion of the investigator. Depending on symptoms, this may e.g., be antipyretics such as acetaminophen (paracetamol), c orticosteroids or additional antihistamines. Anaphylactic reactions will be treated in accordance with current anaphylaxis algorithm “Hypersensitivity to Biological Agents - Updated Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment” issued by the AAAI ( 19). Necessary equipment for resuscitation must be available during study drug infusion . If clinically justified, patients who develop high titer antibodies that affects PK/PD and/or safety may benefit from the use of an immune tolerizing regimen. As there is no proven immune tolerizing approach established for ERTs in MPS IIIA, approaches use d in other LSDs ( 24) may be applied at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with Sobi Medical Director. 7.4.8 Treatm ent com pliance Product accountability reco rds will be kept.

A physical examination is performed. The parent/caregiver is given an actigraph together with the actigraph log and is instructed on how to apply and use the device and how to complete the log (see Section 7.5.4.5 ). Written instructions are also provided, including on wh en to make the 7 -day baseline assessment of sleep pattern. The aim should be to have the recording completed prior to any anesthesia/sedation is applied . Blood is collected to have a baseline assessment of hsCRP, IL -1ra, TNFα, IgE and tryptase in case of o ccurrence of an acute reaction or anaphylactic reaction during the study treatment period. For patients for whom separate informed consent has been provided for future research, whole blood, serum and urine (for biomarker analyses) is collected and sent fo r storage at the central laboratory. When possible, these baseline blood samples should be collected at least 4 weeks prior to the planned start of SOBI003 infusion in order to minimize the total blood volume drawn within one -month timeframes. A central v enous access port is inserted. The surgical procedure is performed in accordance with local hospital routines, including the applicable anesthetic procedure to apply , the selection of central vein, and confirmation of subsequent venous access by X -ray. The brand and type of port must however be preapproved by Sobi ( see Section 7.4.1 ). The parents/caregivers will be trained in the management of the port in accordance with local hospital routines. This includes the actions to take in case an infection is suspected. There should be at least 2 weeks between the insertion of the venous acces s port and the first SOBI003 infusion. A skin biopsy is taken for assessment of CRIM status in fibroblasts. The biopsy should preferably be obtained at least 2 weeks prior to the first SOBI003 infusion. General anesthesia /sedation is applied in accordance with local hospital routines and as determined by the anesthesiologist . CSF sampling (a total of 0.9 mL) for PK, ADA and HS assessment s and MRI scanning of brain, liver and spleen are completed while the patient is anesthetized.

The neurocognitive developmental age (months) is derived on the basis of the BSID -III cognitive total raw score and BSID -III age -normative data. The neurocognitive developmental age (months) is derived from the mean AEq scores on the NVI of the KABC -II. The Development Quotient (DQ) is obtained by dividing the neurocognitive developmental age with chronological age. Neurocognition assessments are performed by child development specialists/psychologists with prior experience of MPS IIIA patients. Prior to st udy initiation, additional study -specific assessment training is provided in order to reduce between -site variability. Each patient should preferably have the same assessor throughout the study in order to reduce within -patient variability. Attempts shoul d be made to have the assessments made at least 5 days after any anesthesia/sedation. When practically feasible, the aim should be to have the assessments performed in rested children early during the day, i.e., prior to 1 pm. The aim should also be to rou ghly keep the same assessment time point for an individual c hild, i.e., morning/afternoon. To ensure that the BSID -III and KABC -II assessments are performed in accordance with the study instructions, completed assessment forms will be sent to a central rea der (NeuroCog Trials) for data quality assurance, calculation of final scores and determination of Age Equivalence scores . 7.5.4.3 Language Language is assessed at Baseline and at Week 24. Expressive and receptive language are assessed by the BSID -III language m odule and the VABS -II communication domain. In addition, written language is assessed by the VABS -II communication domain.

A subset of the actigraphy data is coded to be analyzed in a subsequent separate blinded analysis of the manually edited dataset. The following parameters will be determined on the basis of recordings in the actigraph log :  Bedtime (Clock time child is put to bed )  Wake time (Clock time of child is taken out of bed )  Time in bed (Time between Bedtime and Wake time) The following variable s are derived as obtained from the actigraph software :  Sleep onset (Clock time for ﬁrst appearance of a predetermined nu mber of consecutive min of sleep)  Sleep offset (Clock time for last of a predetermined number of consecutive min of sleep)  Sleep period (Time between sleep onset and sleep offset)  Total sleep time (TST, Duration of sleep in sleep period)  Wake after sleep o nset (WASO, number of minutes scored as wake during sleep period)  Sleep efﬁciency (Percentage sleep: TST/time in bed)  Night waking frequency ( number of night wakings)  Night waking duration (Sum of minutes scored as night waking)  24 h sleep duration (amount of sleep in a 24 -h period) Sleep onset latency is determined as Time between bedtime (as recorded on the actigraph log) and sleep onset (as captured by the actigraph software )"

Adve rse ev ents include the following:  Abnormal test findings , as specified below .  Clinically significant signs and symptoms .  Changes in physical examination findings .  Unexpected p rogression/worsening of underlying disease . In addition, signs and symptoms resulting from the following should also be handled according to the same principles as Adverse Events:  Overdose .  Withdrawal of treatment .  Interactions .  Abuse .  Misuse . Abnormal test findings An abnormal test finding , e.g. abnormal laboratory analysis results, vital signs or ECG, should be recorded as an Adverse Event in any of the following situations:  The test is associated with accompanying symptoms . Note, that the symptom , not the test result, should be recorded a s an AE .  The test result leads to a medical/surgical intervention including withdrawal of IMP(s) or discontinuation from the study . Repeat/confirmatory testing is not considered a medical intervention.  The investigator considers the test result to be clinically significant . Preexistin g conditions A preexisting condition (i.e., a disorder present before the adverse event reporting period started and noted on the pretreatment medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as an advers e event unless the condition worsens or episodes increase in frequency during the adverse event reporting period."

Howeve r, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse eve nt and the resulting appendectomy entered in the c omments section of the CRF . Serio us adverse ev ent (SAE) An adverse event that meets one or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious:  Results in d eath.  Is life-threatening (i.e., at i mmediate risk of death) .  Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization .  Results in p ersistent or significant disability/incapacity .  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., in an offspring to the study subject) . Other medically important adverse events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or developmen t of dependency or abuse. Serious also includes any other event that the investigator or company judges to be serious . Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via IMP shall also be considered serious. Hospitali zation Hospitalization includes tran sfers within a hospital (e.g. from the hospital ward to the intensive care unit) and also includes admissions less than 24 hours. The following situations are not considered hospitalizations (although other SAE criteria may still apply):  Outpatient procedu res / ambulatory care .  Emergency department visits . Hospitali zation in the absence of an adverse event occurring during the study should not be considered a n SAE . This includes:  Hospitalization due to a pre -existing condition not associated with a worsening of the pre-existing condition .  Protocol specified admission .  Elective admission, e.g. due to cosmetic surgery .  Pre-planned admission for a condition specified at Baseline for the patient ."

Adver se event reporting pe riod The period for recording adver se events , including SAEs , on the CRF begins upon receiving the first dose of investigational medication and ends at completion of the Week 24 visit . In addition, SAEs should be reported, from the time the ICF is signed until 28 days past the last dose of IMP. Furthermore , any SAE should be reported to Sobi irrespective of the time of occurrence if a causal relationship between the event and the IMP(s) is suspected.

Severe is a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction. For example, a headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious events listed above. Causality assessment For each adverse event , the in vestigator or sub -investigator must make a causality assessment on the basis of his/her clinical judgment to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the IMP(s) caused the adverse event. The adverse event is assessed as related or not related to the IMP(s) with the following definitions: Related The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). Not Related The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study product administration, or can be reasonably explained by the su bject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). Serious adverse event rep orting Both serious and non -serious adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event page of the CRF as specified in the CRF instructions. The form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the general adverse event CRF page. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms. Any SAE must be reported by the investigator if it occurs during the clinical study whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the investigational product. An SAE report consists of the SAE form including medical history and co ncomitant medications. A copy of these forms must be emailed or faxed within 24 hours at: • SAE reporting email address: INCDrugsafety@INCResearch.com • SAE reporting toll fax number: +1 877 464 7787 • SAE reporting country specific toll -free fax numbers In addition, to the SAE reporting to INC, the investigator must via email notify the Sobi Medical Director and Drugsafety@sobi.com. The investigator shall provide INC Research with sufficient information to enable a complete medical assessment of the repor ted event. Best efforts shall be made by the investigator to provide INC Research with additional information related to any SAE as requested. The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to document fully the event before notificati on of a SAE, though additional information may be requested. Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospital case records, and autopsy reports should be obtained. All new information obtained, relevant to an SAE report, should be f orwarded to INC Research within the same timeframe as the initial information."

In addition, INC Research, on be half of Sobi, will expedite the reporting to all concerned investigators, to the IECs/IRBs, where required, and to the regulatory authorities of all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected. The expedited reporting to the regulatory authority in the U.S.A. will however be managed by Sobi. Follow -up of unresolved adverse ev ents All adverse events should be followed until they are resolved or the investigator assesses them as chronic or stable , or the patient ’s participation in the study ends, i.e., until completion of the Week 24 visit. For patient s entering the extension study, all AEs and SAEs occurring after Week 24 visit, should be noted in the extension study SOBI003 -002. How to report changes in an ongoing adverse event during a patient 's participation in the study is described in the CRF instructions. In addition, all serious and non -serious adverse events assessed by the investigator as related to SOBI003 should continue to be followed until they resolve or until the investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable”, even after the patient 's participation in the study is over. 7.5.5.2 Labora tory safety asse ssments Biochemistry, hematology, coagulation and urine analyses are conducted at a cen tral laboratory (BARC) . The time points for sample collection are summarized in Table 10 as well as the analyses performed at each sampling occasion. At the discretio n of site personnel, urine collection bags will be used as needed. In case of acute infusion reaction or anaphylactic reaction (AE grade III or greater but may also include grade II at the discretion of the investigator ), blood is collected for central laboratory analyses of C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL -1ra, TNFα, IgE, and tryptase. To facilitate interpretation of the analyses resul ts, blood is also collected at B aseline to enable comparison. When possible, the Baseline blood sample should be collected at least 4 weeks prior to the planned start of SOBI003 infusion in order to minimize the total blood volume drawn within one-month timeframes. Depending on the severity of the reaction and at the discretion of the investigator additional analyses may be p erformed at local laboratory to better understand the mechanism of the reaction.

Blood samples are obtained through the central venous access port from the Baseline visit onwards to characterize SOBI003 PK in serum . Separate blood samples from a peripheral venous line are collected in parallel for samples (marked with * below) in order to compare serum SOBI003 concentrations in samples collected from a peripheral line with samples from the central venous access port line , which is used also for the i.v. administration of SOBI003. The purpose of these parallel samples is to confirm that the SOBI003 i.v. infusion does not interfere with the blood sampling. A blood volume of 0.3 mL will be collected from the central venous a ccess port and an additional 0.3 mL blood will be collected from the peripheral venous line when applicable. Duplicate serum aliquots will be prepared at all sampling time points to allow for re -analysis if needed. Serum s amples are collected at S creening and Baseline . Thereafter , frequent sampling is conducted at Weeks 1, 4, 12, and 24 at the following time points: 4 h* (end of infusion), 6*, 12*, 24*, 48, 96, 120 and 168 h after start of infusion. In addition, samples are collected before start of infusion and at completion of the infusion at Weeks 2, 3 and 8 . In case SOBI003 infusion is prolonged, PK sampling time points will be adjusted . PK samples will be collected 2 h and 8 h after end of infusion and thereafter 24 h a fter start of infusion, and thereafter as for the or dinary PK-sampling schedule for the 4 h infusion. A reduced PK blood sampling schedule is applied for patients with low bodyweight to avoid exceeding blood draw volume limits. Details on PK blood sampling are given in Table 6. Acceptable deviations from these planned sampling time points are: 4 h (end of infusion) (+0.5h), 6 (± 0.5h), 12 (± 0.5h), 24 (± 0.5h), 48 (± 0.5h), 96 (±1h), 120 (± 1h) and 168 ( - 1h). CSF samples (0.5 mL) are collected during general anesthesia at Baseline and at Weeks 12 and 24 for determination of SOBI003 . Tripl icate aliquots are required for each sampling time -point. At the time of CSF sample collection , a blood sample will also be collected for determination of SOBI003 in serum . In case the time point for the CSF sample is deviating from the planned time - point, the blood sampl ing should be adjusted accordingly. In addition, at each time point a sample is collected for immunogenicity, a blood sample is obtained for determination of SOBI003 in serum. In case of a time deviation for the immunogenicity sample, the time for the PK s ample should be adjusted accordingly, or an addit ional PK sample may have to be collected. Should any patient permanently discontinue SOBI003 treatment prior to Week 24, t hen a PK and an immunogenicity sample should be obtained as soon as possible after the decision of early treatment withdrawal , as wel l as 30 to 40 days after the last SOBI003 administration .

In addition, serum is also collected on Day 2 at Week s 12 and 24. CSF (0.2 mL ) is collected at Baseline and at Weeks 12 and 24 for analyses of HS. The HS analyses are performed at a central laboratory (York Bioanalytical Solutions Limited, York YO26 6QR, United Kingdom). The HS polymer itself is highly heterogeneous and therefore it is not possible to analyze at the intact molecule level. The detection of HS levels is initiated by depolymerization of the polymer mixture enzymatically, followed by analysis of the constituen t disaccharides ( 22). The polymer mixture includes the HS polymer as well as accumulated intermediate HS degradation products. Throughout this protocol, the term “HS” is used for the assessed disaccharide levels. Effects of SOBI003 on HS storage in affected cells are assessed by measuring HS in serum and CSF using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). The total level of HS is measured by analyzing s elected disaccharides derived from enzymatic digestion (adaptation of method described in Naimy et al. 2016 [22). Sampling, storage and shipment details are provided separately in the study -specific Laboratory Manual . Heparan sulfate in urine Urine (3 mL) samples are collected at Screening, Baseline, and pre -infusion at Weeks 2 to 4, 8, 12 and 24 , and if applicable, at Early Termination of SOBI00 3 treatment , for analysi s of HS. In addition, urine is also collected on Day 2 at Week s 12 and 24. The urine HS analyses are performed at a central laboratory (Greenwood Genetic Center, 106 Gregor Mendel Cir, Greenwood, South Carolina 29646, U .S.A.). HS is quantified using stable isotope dilution -tandem mass spectrometry. The urine sample is treated with methanol to produce HS polymer dimers that are separated by ultra -performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem m ass spectrometry (MS/MS). The assay reports the concentration of HS relative to the creatinine concentration in the urine. Sampling, storage and shipment details are provided separately in the study -specific Laboratory Manual . 7.5.7.2 Future bioanalytical research As local regulations permit and provided that additional separate caregiver consent is given, blood, urine and CSF samples are collected for future analyses . At Baseline, blood (2 mL), urine (2 mL) and CSF (1 mL) samples are collected for future biomarker analyses. At Week 22, blood and urine are collected for future biomarker analyses and additional blood (2 mL) is collected for future genetic research. At Week 24, CSF is collected for future biomarker analyses."

The samples will be stored at a central laboratory (York Bioanalytical Solutions Limited, Yor k YO26 6QR, United Kingdom ) for a maximum of 10 years following study completion (i.e., last patient’s last visit in this study). MPS IIIA is a very rare and sever e disease for which there is a lot of research ongoing to further increase the understanding of disease pathology as well as diagnosis. The purpose of the sample storage is to allow future exploration/confirmation of new research findings. This includes:  SGSH genotypes  Geno - and/or phenotype associated correlations with possible impact on safet y, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK and PD related to SOBI003 treatment  Biomarkers in serum, urine and/or CSF with possible relation to the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, PK and PD of SOBI003 The results of any such analyses will not be included in the Clinical Study Report for this study, but reported separately when analyzed, thus enabling exploration of any emerging novel disease - related discoveries of e.g., previously unknown disease alleles, inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1Ra, TNFα, calprotect in, neopterin) , other HS biomarkers (e.g. HS metabolites), components of the complement system, and neurodegeneration (e.g., T-tau, hepatocyte growth factor, calbindin D) . Sampling details are provided separately in the study -specific Laboratory Manual . 7.5.7.3 Appropria teness of mea surements Storage of HS in brain lysosomes causes pathological changes such as neuroinflammation and inhibition of autophagy in the MPS IIIA mouse model (23). As demonstrated in nonclinical studies, SOBI003 treatment reduces blood and brain HS levels , has favorable effect s on pathophysiological parameters such as neuroinflammation and lysosomal size and shows trends towards normalization of behavi or in mice. Furthermore, the levels of HS derivatives in brain homogenate and CSF are strongly correlated, and the HS reduction at different dose level s of SOBI003 is paralleled in these two compartments. Patients with MPS IIIA have elevated CSF HS levels in CSF as compared to healthy individuals (24). Also in humans, a reduction of HS in CSF is expected to mirror the reduction in brain and thus be a useful PD tool fo r dose selection. 8 Quality control and quality assu rance This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, study specific procedures, INC Research SOPs , the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. Monitoring visits to the study site are performed periodically during the study, to help ensure compliance with the protocol, study specific procedures and applicable regulatory requirements.

Thre e sequential dose levels with 3 patients in each cohort has been evaluated to be sufficient to allow assessment of safety and tolerability concerns, as well as characterize a PD dose-response relationship in this rare population with a high unmet medical need. 9.2 Definitio n of study pop ulations The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses. Safety set (SAF): The SAF will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP. Full-analysis set (FAS) : The FAS is the efficacy analysis set and will consist of all patients who have a baseline and at least 1 post baseline assessment of any secondary or exploratory assessment. PK analysis set (PK): This PK set will comprise patients where at least one SOBI003 dose has been adminis tered correctly and where SOBI003 serum or CSF concentration data is available without any protocol deviation interfering with these results . The SAF is used for the safety analysis, the FAS is used for the secondary and explorative efficacy variables . Patients in this study who are up to 30 months of age and was initially assigned a dose at least as high as the dose selected for a planned phase III study will be included in a future primary analysis population for demonstrating efficacy. Efficacy will be e valuated using combined data from the FIH study and the extension study, a planned Phase III trial and the corresponding patients in a recent NH study ( 24), the latte r serving as control patients and consisting of the 5 patients with a rapid progressive MPS IIIA disease and a baseline age of 12 to 30 months. 9.3 Over all statistical and analytical pl an 9.3.1 Gene ral statistical iss ues A detailed description of the stat istical analyses to be performed will be documented in a statistical analysis plan to be completed prior to database lock ."
