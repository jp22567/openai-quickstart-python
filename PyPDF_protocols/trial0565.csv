Brief title Study of efficacy of fevipiprant in patients with nasal polyposis and asthma Sponsor and Clinical PhaseNovartis Phase 3b Investigation typeDrug Study type Interventional Purpose and rationaleNasal polyposis is a common disorder, affecting up to 4% of the population. Although the causes remain unclear, nasal polyposis has been associated with a numb er of conditions including, asthma, infection, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity. Nasal polyposis with concomitant asthma has a prevalence ranging from 2% -66% although it is usually in the region of 30% of those nasal polyposis patients who are ref erred to (ear, nose, throat) ENT departments. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fevipiprant 150 mg and 450 mg compared to placebo in the reduction of nasal polyps size and the effect on symptoms, quality of life and smell via patient -reported outcomes in patients with nasal polyposis (NP) and concomitant asthma. Primary Objective(s) In patients with nasal polyps with a polyp size score ≥ 4 at baseline, to demonstrate a difference in mean change from baseline in polyp size at Week 16, measured by the nasal polyp score (NPS, assessed by nasal endoscopy with central reading), between fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separately) and placebo Secondary ObjectivesTo evaluate the effect on sy mptoms as measured by the na sal congestion score (NCS) with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily), compared with placebo following 16 weeks of treatment. To evaluate the effect on quality of life as measured by the Sino -Nasal Outcome Test -22 (SNOT -22) with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily), compared with placebo following 16 weeks of treatment. To evaluate the effect on Smell as measured by the university of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily), compared with plac ebo following 16 weeks of treatment. To evaluate the effect of fevipiprant 150 mg and 450 mg compared with placebo in terms of general safety/tolerability following 16 weeks of treatment. Study design This is a Phase 3b, Proof -of-concept study with a rand omized, m ulticenter, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study design to determine the ability of fevipiprant plus SoC compared to placebo plus SoC to reduce the size of NPs. The study will include: Screening period of 2 weeks to assess eligib ility; Run-in period of 4 weeks where patients will utilize mometasone furoate spray (200 µg once daily, administered as two 50 µg actuations into each nostril); Treatment period of 16 weeks (with visits held every month for study procedures) and a Follow -up period of 2 weeks following the last dose of study"
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 drug to collect additional data for safety variables. Patients will continue to use the mometasone furoate SoC throughout the treatment period. Population The study population will consist of approximately 93 male and female patients aged 18 and above, diagnosed with nasal polyposis with nasal polyp size score ≥ 4 (nasal polyp score, assessed by nasal endoscopy) with a minimum score of 2 in each nostril; and a concomitant diagnosis of asthma. Key Inclusion criteriaWritten informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Patients aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of nasal polyposis with nasal polyp size score ≥ 4 and a minimum score of 2 in each nostril, measured by nasal endoscopy at screening and prior to randomization on Run - in/Treatment Day 1 (to ensure no reduction in NPS following the use of the mome tasone furoate SoC therapy). Patients with a concomitant diagnosis of asthma for a period of at least 6 months prior to screening. Have been on a stable asthma treatment regimen of at least inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, any dose), alone for at least 6 months prior to Screening or ICS for 6 months prior to Screening with any other required inhaled asthma medication (long -acting bronchodilator (LABA), long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)) added at least 6 weeks prior to Screening. Key Exclusion criteriaAsthma exacerbation, within 6 weeks prior to Screening that required systemic corticosteroids, hospitalization, or emerg ency room visit. When patients experience an exacerbation between screening and the end of the 4 week Run -in period, and prior to randomization, they will be considered screen failures and can be eligible for re -screening only once the required 6 weeks pos t-exacerbation window has passed. Chronic/maintenance use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) defined as any continuous use of OCS for a period of 1 month or more within 1 year of Screening. Use of biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslisumab, dupilumab, benra lizumab etc., for asthma or any other indications) that has potential to interfere/affect asthma or NP disease progression, within 6 months of the start of the Run -in period. Use of medication for sino -nasal s ymptoms (antibiotics with or without OCS) withi n 30 days of Screening or during the Run -in period. Any contra- indications to inhaled or nasal steroids e.g. narrow angle glaucoma, or any other as decided by the Investigator. History of nasal surgery (including polypectom y) within 6 months prior to scree ning. Patients with asthma control questionnaire -5 questions (ACQ -5) ≥ 1.5 at Screening Study treatmentQAW039 150 mg and QAW 039 450 m g once daily Matching placebo to QAW 039 150 mg and QA W039 450 mg once daily Efficacy assessmentsAssessment of nasal poly p score by nasal endoscopy Assessment of nasal congestion using the nasal congestion score questionnaire Assessment of quality of life using the SNOT -22 questionnaire Assessment of smell using the university of Penns ylvania smell identification test"

Primary Objective: The primary aim of the study is to evaluate achange in nasal polyp size with fevipiprant (150mg or 450mg once daily, separately) as compared to placebo. This will be evaluated by using the NPS) which is assessed by nasal endoscopy. The total NPS is recorded as the sum of the right and left nostril scores with a range of 0 to 8. A decrease in the NPS is considered a favorable outcome. The analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted according to the intention to treat principle using the full analysis set (FAS) population and using a mixed modelrepeated measures (MMRM) approach. Secondary Objectives: Nasal Congestion Score: The change in NCS will be analyzed using an MMRM model. Quality of Life (SNOT -22):The treatment group difference in terms of change from baseline at Week 16 in SNOT -22 wi ll be estimated using an MMRM model. Smell (UPSIT): The treatment group difference in terms of change from baseline at W eek 16 in UPSIT will be estimated using an MMRM model. Safety and Tolerability: For all safety analy ses, the safety set will be used. A ll listings and tables will be presented by treatment group. Safety summaries will be primarily based on on -treatment data with selected tables also presented for the all data after the first intake of study drug, while all databased safety data will be li sted. The on -treatment period lasts from the date of first administration of study treatment to 30 day s after the date of the last actual administration of any study treatment.

Nasal Polyposis (NP) is a common disorder, affecting up to 4% of the population. Although the causes remain unclear, NP has been associated with a number of conditions including asthma, infection, cystic fibrosis and aspirin sensitivity . The polyps themselves are benign lesions arising from the mucosa of the nasal cavity , which present typicall y as single or multiple polypoid masses, causing symptoms including nasal obstruction, anosmia, post nasal drip, rhinorrhea and, less commonly , facial pain ( Newton andAh- See 2008 ). NP is diagnosed either by a clinical examination or more commonly via nasal endoscop y. Computerized tomograph y (CT) scans are useful but do not provide optimal understanding of the disease extension, as the polyps can be indistinguishable of the anatom y, so endoscopic direct observation is more accurate for diagnosis. Treatment can range from the use of corticosteroid nasal spray s (e.g. mometasone furoate) to surgical interventions. It is common for patients to have relapses, requiring repeated surgeries. NP with concomitant asthma has aprevalence ranging from 2%-66% (Orlandi et al 2016), usually considered in the range of 30% of the NP patients for those referred to ENT departments (Larsen ); and it is 58% in those patients with a nasal polyps score ≥ 4 (Bachert et al 2016). Nasal polyp score is assessed by nasal endoscop y using the following scale (Gevaert et al 2013): Table 1 -1 Nasal Poly p Scale Poly p Score Poly p Size 0 No polyps 1 Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate 2 Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate 3 Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate 4 Large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity Prostaglandin D2 (PGD 2) is one of the major prostanoid inflammatory mediators identified in airway inflammatory diseases. The PGD 2type 2 receptor (DP2) usually mediates these pro- inflammatory effects. There is evidence that the DP2 pathway and PGD 2have an effect on NP physiopathology : The in-vitro study by Perez -Novo et al showed that in nasal poly ps taken from 10 patients there was an increased release of PGD 2. Pre-treatment with IgE/anti -IgE was significantly impacted b y pre -incubation with diclofenac. This suggests that in immunologica lly activated NP tissue, PGD 2produced by mast cells promotes the migration of Th2 cells through a DP2 dependent mechanism ( Pérez -Novo et al 2010)."
18,page_18,"Novartis Confidential Page 19 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 The study by Mjosberg et al showed that tissue taken from nasal pol yps in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis contained larger proportions of DP2 than mucosa from uninflamed nasal cavities from healthy donors ( Mjösberg etal2011). It has been shown that the expression of DP2 receptors is associated with the pathophy siology of Chronic Rhinosinusitis along with NP formation (Yamamoto et al2009). Elevated percentages of mast cells are found in the sino -nasal mucosa of chronic rhinosinusitis patients with NPs ( Shaw et al)when compared to a health y control group. Fevipiprant (QAW039) is a DP2 competitive antagonist in investigation in severe asthma. It exerts its effect by binding to DP2 receptors on eosinophils, Th2 and ILC2 cells in the blood and tissues; thus, inhibiting migration and activation of these cells into the airway tissues and reducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chevalier et al 2005). It is proposed that fevipiprant will also be a suitable treatment for NP. Moreover it's once daily oral regimen could increase compliance when compared with the current standard of care of nasal spray s. 1.2 Purpose A Phase 3b Proof -of-Concept study to evaluate the efficacy of fev ipiprant (QAW039) (150 mg and 450 mg once daily) compared with placebo, as add- on to mometasone furoate treatment standard -of-care (SoC), in reducing endoscopic nasal polyp score (NPS) and nasal congestion score (NCS) in adult ( ≥ 18 y ears) patients with na sal poly posis (NP) and concomitant asthma. 2 Objectives and endpoints Table 2-1 Objectives and related endpoints Objective(s) Endpoint(s) Primary objective(s) Endpoint(s) for primary objective(s) In patients with nasal polyps with a polyp size score ≥ 4, to demonstrate a difference in mean change from baseline in polyp size at week 16, measured by the nasal polyp score (NPS, assessed by nasal endoscopy with central reading), between fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separately ) and placebo.Reduction (in terms of change from baseline to week 16) in NPS for fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separately) as compared to placebo.

The study willinclude: Screening period of two weeks to assess eligibility ; Run-in period of 4 weeks where patients will utilize mometasone furoate spray (200 µg once daily , administered as two 50 µg actuations into each nostril); Treatment period of 16 weeks (with vis its held ever y month for study procedures); and a Follow -up period of two weeks following the last dose of study drug to collect additional data for safet y variables. Patients will continue to use the mometasone furoate SoC throughout the Treatment period. Approximately 93 patients will be enrolled into this study. Please refer to Table 8-1for the clinical visit schedule and the details of procedures to be performed at each visit. Figure 3 -1 Study Schematic 4 Rationale 4.1 Rationale for study design The overall purpose of this study is to determine the ability of fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once dail y) plus SoC (mometasone furoate 200 µg dail y), compared with placebo plus SoC, to reduce the size of nasal polyps during a 16 week Treatment period, assessed by nasal endoscop y"
20,page_20,"Novartis Confidential Page 21 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 with central reading. The study will also determine if fevipiprant (150 mg and 450 mg once daily ) plus SoC, compared with placebo plus SoC, can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life and smell, assessed via patient -reported outcomes (PROs) and the UPSI T. 4.1.1 Rationale for choice of background therapy Mometasone furoate is the standard of care for nasal polyposis as per British society for allergy and clinical immunology (BSACI) treatment guidelines and will be utilized throughout the study , from the start of Run-in until the completion of treatment. 4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment QAW039 will be administered at doses of 150 mg and 450 mg once daily as oral film-coated tablets (FCTs) in this study . These doses have been selected for the ongoing asthma trials and are based on the following rationale: The 450 mg once daily dose was selected because at a dose of 450 mg once daily, > 98% receptor occupancy is expected at stead y state allowing inhibition of eosinophil migration over the entire treatment interval. Meanwhile in Study [CQAW039A2208] , QAW039 caused significant reduction of sputum eosinophils in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The reduction in sputum eosinophils was comparable to that observed with the anti -IL5 antibodies, mepolizumab ( Pavord et al 2012) and reslizumab ( Castroet al2011 , Castro et al 2015 ). A lower dose of 150 mg once daily was selected because it was the lowest dose of QAW039 with “maximal efficacy” on the endpoint of FEV1 in a prior dose-ranging study (Study [CQAW039 A2206] ) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma (GINA treatment steps 4 and 5) as add -on to low -dose ICS. This dose is ½ log lower than the highest dose. 4.3 Rationale for choice of control drugs (comparator/placebo) or combination drugs All patients in thi s study will receive mometasone furoate nasal spray (MFS) as SoC treatment with QAW039 or placebo administered as an add -on therap y. Patients currentl y using nasal corticosteroid drops or lavage will transfer on to MFS at the start of the Run -in period. The use of placebo will permit the assessment of a reduction in nasal poly p score (NPS) along with improvement in symptoms, quality of life (QoL) and smell for patients treated with QAW039, in comparison to those on placebo, who will be on the nasal poly posis SoC therapy only. Additionall y, the use of placebo will permit a controlled evaluation of the safet y of QAW039. This study does not include an active comparator since QAW039 will be given as an add -on therap y to standard of care therap y in patients with a NPS ≥ 4. 4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations Not applicable as no interim analy sis will be performed on this study ."
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 4.5 Risks and benefits QAW039 is a potent and highly selective oral DP2 receptor antagonist being developed as a potential therap y treatment for patients with severe asthma. DP2 is a receptor for PGD 2, which mediates the activation and migration of Th2 cells and eosinophils, some of the key inflammatory cell ty pes in asthma. Recruitment of these cells into the lung i s partly responsible for the intermittent airway obstruction, which leads to wheezing and shortness of breath characteristic of asthma. QAW039 is at least 300-fold selective for the DP2 receptor compared to other available prostanoid receptors and to cy clo oxygenase -1 and cy clooxy genase -2, and it has been demonstrated to be a potent in-vitro inhibitor of human whole blood eosinophil activation and induction of Th2 cy tokines. After oral dosing in rats, QAW039 inhibited pulmonary eosinophilia induced by the PG D2metabolite DK -PGD 2. The potential benefits of QAW039 therapy need to be balanced against its potential risks. The risk to patients in this study will be minimized by compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria and close clinical monitoring. All pat ients will remain on the background SoC asthma therap y the y were taking at screening throughout the study. Women of child- bearing potential and sexually active males will be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the stud y, and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they should not be entered or continue in the study . The overall clinical experience with QAW039 includes 12 studies: 10 (6 in healthy volunteers and 4 in patients) have completed and 2 (in patients) are ongoing. The completed phase 2 studies consist of 3 in patients with asthma and 1 in patients with allergic rhinitis. The ongoing Phase 2 studies include one study in patients with asthma ([CQAW039A2214] ) and 1 study in patients with atopic dermatitis ( [CQAW039X2201] ). QAW039 has been well tolerated in populatio ns studied to date at total daily doses up to 500 mg given for up to 12 weeks. In the 10 completed studies, 16 patients reported 17 SAEs, no deaths due to SAEs were reported, and 5 discontinuations due to SAEs were reported. Of the 16 patients reporting SA Es, 12 patients reported 13 events, 2 patients reported 2 events and 2 patients reported 2 events in the QAW039, placebo, and montelukast treatment groups, respectivel y. There were no SAEs with a suspected causal relationship to QAW039. There have been no adverse events of idiopathic drug reactions. Cardiovascular risks: Transient, increases in heart rate were observed in a cardiovascular safet y pharmacology study in dogs. These changes were not associated with any significant alterations in blood pressure, ECG interval duration, morphology or rhy thm or any structural changes in cardiac tissues. No cardiac findings have been identified in the healthy volunteer and patient studies completed to date apart from an observed imbalance in the frequency of post -randomization cardiac adverse events in study [CQAW039A2206] with a higher incidence in the QAW039 treatment group (1.7%) compared with either placebo (0.7%) or montelukast (0%) treated patients. The cardiac events comprised a number of different non -serious arrh ythmias and one serious adverse event of pericarditis not suspected to be related to study drug b y the Investigator. Three of the events in the QAW039 treatment groups occurred during the washout period and"
22,page_22,"Novartis Confidential Page 23 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 resolved on treatment. Based on the inability to identify discernable trends with QAW039 dose, regimen, time -of-onset, patient age and gender, concomitant medication, event ty pe and following detail ECG review, it was considered that these were most probably coincidental events without a causal assoc iation to study drug. A formal QTc study has not been completed for QAW039. Monitoring for changes in vital signs, ECGs and biochemical parameters will be conducted. Liver toxicity :Dose -dependent increases in liver weights with concomitant hepatocellular hypertrophy were the primary findings during 2- and 13 -week toxicity studies in mice. These changes were considered to be a species -specific adaptive metabolic response with no relevance for humans. Liver toxicity findings have not been identified in the h ealth y volunteer and patient studies completed to date. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) will be conducted as described in Section 16.2 of this protocol. Potential risk of idiosy ncratic drug reactions CCN362 is an a cylglucuronide metabolite of QAW039 and its potential to covalentl y bind to plasma proteins, such as albumin, was demonstrated in the human ADME (Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) study of QAW039 ( [CQAW039A2104] ). In the literature, in vivo binding of acy l glucuronides to proteins has been reported to be associated with rare idiosyncratic drug reactions (IDRs), although a causal connection of protein adduction to IDRs remains uncertain ( Regan et al 2010 ). There have been no IDRs observed with QAW039 treatment in completed clinical trials. Surveillance of adverse events for identification of IDRs will be conducted. Drug -drug interactions: QAW039 and CCN362 did not show any relevant inhibition or induction of the cy tochrome P450 isoenzy mes or inhibition of ubiquitous efflux transporters. The most potent in- vitro inhibition by QAW039 was found for OATP1B1, but clinically only a small impact was observed at 450 mg/day (~2-fold increase in Cmax of simvastatin aci d and rosuvastatin without change in AUC). Based on these data, as well as recommendations in the simvastatin label, simvastatin doses of > 20 mg per day should not be co-administered with QAW039; no relevant impact on the disposition of other co- medicatio ns are expected with QAW039 dosed up to 450 mg/day . Patients on doses of simvastatin > 20 mg, doses of atorvastatin > 40 mg, doses of pravastatin > 40mg, or doses of pitavastatin > 2 mg per day (Elsby et al2012 , Deng et al 2008, Noé etal2007 , and Kalliokoski andNiemi 2009), as well as patients on any statins with high CK levels (> 2 X upper limit of norm al (ULN)) at screening (Visit 1) will be excluded from the stud y. Furthermore, patients on statin medication who are included in the study will have regular monitoring for relevant symptoms and be subject to discontinuation based on persistent myalgia and blood CK levels ( Jacobson 2008). Overall, the safet y profile of QAW039 has been favorable across studies. Three Phase 2 studies in patients with asthma demonstrated the effect of QAW039 across the range of asthma severi ties (mild to severe). For detailed information on the studies described below, please refer to the I nvestigator's Brochure (IB)."

Patients will be advised that between visits they could take their rescue medicati on for symptoms of asthma. Rescue medication (i.e., SABAs) will either be supplied to the Investigator sites locally by the Novartis country pharma organization (CPO) or sourced locall y and reimbursed by Novartis. Nebulized salbutamol/albuterol is not allowed as rescue medication and will not be supplied. Should patients develop any sino-nasal exacerbations during the course of the study , the treating physician should follow their normal treatment regimen with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. Short term oral or nasal decongestants may also be utilised as a rescue therapy however the assessment of NPS must not be performed within 3 day s of their use. Use of rescue medication must be recorded on the concomitant medications in the CRF. 6.3 Subject numbering, treatment assignment, randomization 6.3.1 Subject numbering Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the patient is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Center No.) (as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it, so that each subject is numbered uniquel y across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available. 6.3.2 Treatment assignment, randomization At randomization visit, all eligible subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The Investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the pati ent, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify unique medication numbers for the first packages of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomizatio n numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and Investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the r esponsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supplies using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s)."

The subject must also be instructed to contact the Investigator if he/she is unable, for an y reason, to take the study treatment as prescribed. Compliance will be assessed by the Investigator and/or study personnel at each visit using pill counts and information provided by the subject. This information should be captured in the source document at each visit. All study treatment dispensed and returned must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log. All doses of study drug taken at the clinic visits must be from the newl y assigne d medication bottles, except at the end of treatment (EOT) visit when the medication returned by the patient should be used. 6.6.2 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency code breaks must only be undertaken when it is required to in order to treat the subject safel y. Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the Investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the subject. The Investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The sy stem will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The Investigator will provide: protocol number name subject number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that unblinding"

Following an y emergency breaking of the blind, the subject wi ll be withdrawn from the study . 6.7 Preparation and dispensation Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging as described under investigational and control drugs section. Investigator staff will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). The study medication has a 2 -part label (base plus tear-off label), immediately before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, site personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document. 6.7.1 Handling of study treatment and additional treatment 6.7.1.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and prope rly, and kept in a secured location to which only the Investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis CPO Qualit y Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number. The Investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed b y monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients/subjects will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. Atthe conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the Investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the Investigator folder at each site. 6.7.1.2 Handling of additional treatment The following non -study treatment has to be monitored specificall y: Mometasone furoate 200 µg used as SoC SABA (such as salbutamol 100 µg) The non-investigational treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the Investigator and designees have access.

QAW039 will be supplied as tablets. Since the tablets for QAW039 150 mg and QAW039 450 mg are not identical, treatment will be double -dummy and patients will ta ke 2 tablets of study medication (one tablet of blinded QAW039 at 150 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg or one tablet of blinded QAW039 at 450 mg dosage strength to be given together with one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg or one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 150 mg and one tablet blinded placebo to QAW039 450 mg) once dail y as described below. During the Run-in period, all patients will start treatment with mometasone furoate 200 µg daily, administered as 2 50 µg into each nostril, in the morning. Patients will continue to use their standard asthma therap y, as needed. If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation during the Run-in period, the patient is considered Run-in failure and can bere-screened only once 6 weeks have passed after full recovery from the exacerbation. At the Randomization Visit (Treatment Day 1) patients will be randomized to receive one of the three stud y treatments: QAW039 150 mg once daily QAW039 450 mg once daily placebo once dail y The treatment period will continue for a period of 16-weeks and patients will continue to take the mometasone furoate SoC in addition to the study treatments, during the treatment period. The investigational treatment will be dispensed in medication packs (bottles) at each clinic visit during the treatment epoch with enough medication supplied to cover the period between patient visits and to allow for late visits and other unforeseen events. All dosages prescribed and dispensed to the p atient must be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF. At clinic visits, patients will receive a witnessed dose of study medication. These in-clinic witnessed doses will be given after the completion of all pre-dose assessments (see Section 8) and should be given at approximately the same time at each clinic visit. Between clinic visits, patients will take study medication once daily in the morning. Patients will be instructed to take their study medication at approxima tely the same time each morning. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded in the IRT sy stem. The Investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatment exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient’s safet y and the validity of the study .

35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 7 Informed consent procedures Eligibl e patients/subjects may only be included in the study after providing signed (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/ IEC-approved informed consent, or, if applicable after such consent has been provided by a legall y acceptable representative( s) of the patient. In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient must be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate assent by personall y signing and dating the informed consent document or a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedures (e.g. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the patient source documents. Novartis will provide to Investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the Investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/ IEC, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/ IEC approval. Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study . If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they must not be entered in the stud y. Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator's Broc hure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator notification or an aggregate safet y finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the subject. Subjects might be asked to complete an optional questionnaire to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience. 8 Visit schedule and assessments Assessment schedule lists all of the assessments and indicates with an “X” or an ""S"", the visits when they are performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the patient’s source documentation with those events marked by an ""X"" being captured in the CRF/Clinical Database and those marked with an ""S"" will be captured in source documentation only. Patients should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule or as close to the designated day/time as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients who prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, and the adverse event and co ncomitant medications recorded on the CRF."

It is permissible to re -screen a patient if he/she fails the initial screening; however, each case must be discussed and agreed with No vartis on a case -by-case basis. 8.1.1 Information to be collected on screening failures Subjects who signed an informed consent form and subsequently found to be ineligible prior to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Form. The demographic information, informed consent, and Inclusion/Exclusion pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject experienced a serious adverse event during the screening phase (see SAE Reporting Section, Section 10.1.3 for reporting details). If the subject fails to be randomized, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s of the screen fail that the subject was not randomized. Subjects who are randomized and fail to start treatment, e.g. subjects randomized in error, will be considered an early terminator. The reason for early termination shoul d be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Form. 8.2 Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all patients include: Date of birth (where allowed by local legislation) Age (ca lculated) Sex Race and ethnicity Patients initials (where allowed by local legislation) Height and Weight BMI (calculated) Baseline ph ysical examination (not databased other than in the context of relevant medical history ) Vital signs Date of diagnosis of asthma Relevant medical history/ current medical condition present before signing the informed consent Asthma Control (ACQ-5) Prior concomitant medication (Both asthma/NP related and non -asthma/NP related) 8.3 Efficacy The following assessments of efficacy will be performed: Nasal Poly p Score Patient- reported Outcomes (NCS and SNOT -22)"

The initial assessment will be performed at screening to assess the patient ’s eligibility on the study . Patients will be deemed eligible with a NPS ≥ 4 with a minimum score of at least 2 in one nostril, determined by central reading at screening and prior to randomization, using the following scale (Gevaert et al 2013): Table 8 -2 Nasal Poly p Scale Polyp Score Polyp Size 0 No polyps 1 Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate 2 Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate 3 Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate 4 Large polyps causing complete obstruction of t he inferior nasal cavity NPS will be re -assessed at Treatment Day 1 to both re -confirm eligibility for the study but also for a baseline measurement. The central reading result must be received for the baseline assessment, prior to randomization. At the 8and 16-week treatment visits, NPS will again be re-assessed for efficacy . The readings from the endoscopies performed will be uploaded for central reading for NPS determination. The nasal endoscopy may be performed on a different day from the other study procedures as long as this is performed within approximately 5 day s of the original scheduled visit. Note that the nasal endoscopy procedure should not be performed within 3 days of any concomitant use of oral or nasal decongestants. 8.3.2 Patient Reported Out comes A patient reported outcome (PRO) is an y report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directl y from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else. Patient reported outcomes may provide quantitative information for patients regarding the ‘impact on daily life’, which is of key importance, for patients and their physicians and also for health technology assessments. In this study , two PROs are used to assess the improvement in symptoms (nasal congestion score) and quality of life (SNOT -22). All PROs should be completed prior to any other assessments (especially the nasal endoscop y) to avoid any influence on the responses. 8.3.2.1 Symptoms (Nasal Congestion Score) The nasal congestion score is asse ssed via a questionnaire where the patients are asked ""Is your nose blocked?"" with responses ranging from 0 = not at all, to 3=severe. The test is performed within the clinic at the visits outlined in Table 8-1on a tablet comp uter and the questionnaire is outlined in Section 16.4."

The questionnaire consists of 22 questions relating to various quality of life indicators and answers are scored from 0 (no problem) to 5 (problem as bad as it can be) with questions relating to the patients experience in the previous 2 weeks. The test will be self-administered by the patient via a tablet computer at the clinic visits outlined in Table 8-1and takes only a few minutes to complete. The final outcome is a total score from 0 to 110. 8.3.3 Smell (UPSIT) For this study , any change in the patients sense of smell will be assessed using the Universit y of Pennsylvania Smell I dentification Test. The test comprises of a kit which will be supplied to sites. The test includes 4 workbooks, each of which contains 10 microencapsulated (scratch and sniff) odors with forced choice responses accompany ing each test item. The sites will also be supplied with the relevant instruction manual and scoring key . The test is administered at the clinic visits and usually takes 10-15 minutes to complete. The result is a score out of 40 and this will be captured within the Clinical Database by the site personnel. 8.3.4 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments The efficacy assessments outlined above are deemed to be sufficien t for the objectives of the study . 8.4 Safet y Safety assessments are specified below with the assessment schedule detailing when each assessment is to be performed.

The remaining COAs used on this study are documented as follows. 8.5.1.1 Asthma Control Questionnaire (A CQ-5) In this study the ACQ -5 will be used as Exclusion criterion at screening in order to identify those subjects who are currentl y symptomatic and who may exacerbate during the Run-in or treatment periods. The ACQ -5 will be self -administered at the clinic during the screening visit and it onl y takes a few minutes to complete. Patients will be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to the sy mptom questions on a 7 -point scale (0=no impairment, 6=maximum impairment). The questions are equally weighted and the ACQ -5 score is the mean of the 5 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severel y uncontrolled) (Juniper et al 1999; Juniper et al 2005) ( Section 16.6)."

The Investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would negativel y impact the risk/benefit of trial participatio n. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Withdrawal of informed consent (and the Investigator must prematurel y withdraw the patient from the study ); Pregnancy ; Female subjects non -compliant with the chosen effective method of contraception during the study : The Investigator must provide appropriate advice on the continued use of effective contraception for at least one week (at least 5 half-lives of QAW039) after stud y drug discontinuation and follow up with the subject as appropriate at least to the end of this period; Any protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s safety ; Liver laboratory test abnormality / event (see Section 16.2 ): Abnormal liver laboratory results requiring discontinuation – refer to Table 16-1 -Section 16.2 ; If the Investigator considers it appropriate after the confirmation of a liver safet y monitoring signal:"
44,page_44,"Novartis Confidential Page 45 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 ALT or AST ≥ 5 xULN, or ALT or AST ≥ 2.5xUL N andtotal bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 1.5xUL N ( Section 16.2 ); Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the Investigator, taking into consideration the subject’s overall status, prevents the subject from continuing participation in the study; Premature unblinding of study treatment for a patient for an y reason; please refer to Section 6.6.2 ; Total white blood cell count < 1000 cells/µL ; Patient requires SCS/OCS use for a period of more than 5 consecutive day s during the study . Any OCS/SCS use in addition to this allowed 5 days of treatment will result in withdrawal; If patients on statin therapy complain of persistent muscle pain without any obvious cause for greater than 3 day s, accompanied b y an increase in CK levels >10xULN or persistent intolerable muscle pain, regardless of the accompany ing CK level; If a patient undergoes nasal surgery , including but not limited to the following: treatment of nasal pol yposis, septal deviation correction, turbinectomy, para -nasal sinus drainage, nasal plastic surgery , hypophy sis tumor nasal approach. If a patient develops a medical condition, that requires consistent use of prohibited treatment as per Section 6.2.2 or if patient exhibits a behavior of non -compliance regarding prohibited medication. If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort to understand the primary reason for the sub ject’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information. Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see withdraw of informed consent section,). Where possible, they should return for the assessments indicated in the Assessment schedule ( Table 8-1). After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should to be collected at clinic visits or via telephone visits: new/concomitant treatments including OCS use adverse events/Serious Adverse Events If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, ever y effort (e.g. telephone, e - mail or letter) should be made to contact the subject/pre -designated contact as specified in the lost to follow -up section. This contact should preferabl y be done according to the study visit schedule. If the patient cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the patient, or with a person pre-designated by the patient. This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. The information alread y collected during the study including your samples will still be used according to applicable laws"
45,page_45,"Novartis Confidential Page 46 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 The Investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient’s discontinuation from study treatment. 9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e-mail or letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow - up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table. Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/anal ysis in accor dance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicabl e legal requirements. 9.1.3 Lost to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the Investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed or until the end of the study . 9.1.4 Early study termination by the sp onsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons (including slow enrollment), or for regulatory or medical reasons. In taking the decision to terminate, Novartis will alway s consider the patient welfare and safet y. Should early termination be necessary , patients must be seen as soon as possible (provide instruction for contacting the"
46,page_46,"Novartis Confidential Page 47 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 patient, when the patient should stop taking drug, when the patient should come for a final visit) and treated as a prematurely withdrawn patient. The Investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protectio n of the patient’s interests. The Investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial. 9.2 Stud y completion and post -study treatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. Study completion for a patient will occur after he/she has completed 16-weeks of treatment (through the follow - up visit) or they have prematurel y withdrawn. Completion of the study will be when all randomized patients have completed 16 weeks of treatment and the post -treatment follow -up visit. Patients who have been screened when enrolment target has been met will be allowed to proceed onto study participation. For all patients a safet y follow -up visit should be conducted (e.g. by telephone) 14 days after last visit (Week 16). The information to be collected at this follow up visit includes adverse events, concomitant medications and SAEs. When the patient has completed all scheduled study assessments or prematurely withdrawn from the study , the Investigator must contact the IRT to record the patient completion /discontinuation and complete applicable eCRF . 10 Safety monitoring and reporting 10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements 10.1.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), sy mptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study . Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The Investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual subject and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments."
47,page_47,"Novartis Confidential Page 48 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2): 1.the severit y grade mild: usually transien t in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities 2.its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the sy mptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are n ot caused by the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease can only be evaluated meaningfull y by an anal ysis of cohorts, not on a single subject. 3. its duration (start and end da tes) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 4.whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met 5.action taken regarding with study treatment 6.its outcome i.e., its recovery status or whether it was fatal All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: Dose not changed Dose Reduced/increased Drug interrupted/withdrawn Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history of the subject. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least 14 days (or 5 half-lives or end of study visit, whichever is longer) following the last dose of study treatment Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or symptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant change s from"
48,page_48,"Novartis Confidential Page 49 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with the underl ying disease. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Section 16.1. 10.1.2 Serious adverse events An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: fatal life-threatening Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines). resul ts in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: 1.routine treatment or monitoring of the studie d indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition under study 2.elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 3.social reas ons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s general condition 4.treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situation s should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outco mes listed above. Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to the ICH- E2D Guidelines). All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred."
49,page_49,"Novartis Confidential Page 50 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 10.1.3 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days following the last administration of study treatment must be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Detai led instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the Investigator folder provided to each site. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a Chief Medical Office and Patient Safety Department associate may urgently require further information from the Investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all Investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirement s in participating countries. 10.1.4 Pregnancy reporting To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to deter mine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the Inves tigator to the Novartis Chief Medical Office and Patient Safet y. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. 10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professiona l, subject or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects."

The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as AE/SAE): Liver laboratory triggers, which will requ ire repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow- up monitoring and contributing factors are recorded on the appropriate CRFs Please refer to Table 16-1-Appendix 2 in Section 16for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver event defined in Section 16.1-Appendix 2 should be followed up by the Investigator or designated personnel at the trial site, as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of liver events are outlined in Table 16-2 -Appendix 2. Repeat liver function test (LFT) to confirm elevation. Thes e liver chemistry repeats will be performed using the central laboratory. If results will not be available from the central laboratory , then the repeats can also be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safet y of the subject. If a liver event is s ubsequently reported, an y local liver chemistry tests previously conducted that are associated with this event should have results recorded on the appropriate CRF. If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the subject will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate."

Every renal laboratory trigger or renal event as defined in Table 16-3 -Appendix 3 should be followed up by the investiga tor or designated personnel at the trial site as summarized in Section 16 . 11 Data Collection and Database management 11.1 Data collection Designated Investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electroni c Case Report Forms using fully validated software that conforms to US CFR 21 Part 11 requirements. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the electronic data capture (EDC) system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data by the Investigator staff. The Investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data entered into the eCRF is complete, accurate and that entry andupdates are performed in a timely manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered is complete and accurate. After final database lock, the Investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigational site. All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification."
52,page_52,"Novartis Confidential Page 53 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 11.2 Database management and quality control Novartis personnel will review the data entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC sy stem. Designated I nvestigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make an y necessary changes to the data. Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classificat ion system. Medical history /current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Randomization codes and data about all study treatment(s) dispensed to the subject and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The data will be sent electronically to Novartis at specific timelines. Each occurrence of a code bre ak via I RT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis . Laboratory samples will be processed by a central lab and the results will be provided elect ronically to Novartis. The PROs will be recorded on site by patients on tablet computers and the database from the vendor will be provided electronically to Novartis. The videos of the nasal endoscopies will be provided to the vendor (either b y upload to a cloud server or postage of encrypted USB drives) for central reading. Videos will be read by two independent reviewers to assign the nasal polyp score with a third adjudicating reader making the decision on NPS should the original two readers not agree d uring their assessment. Once all the necessary actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatm ent codes will be unblinded and made available for data analy sis.Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement b y Novartis development management. 11.3 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eCRFs) with the Investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP complianc e and the quality/integrit y of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enro llment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these"
53,page_53,"Novartis Confidential Page 54 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversi ght. The Investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The Investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the subject (a signed cop y is given to the subject). The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No infor mation in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 12 Data analy sis and statistical methods The primary efficacy and safet y analyses will be conducted at the time the trial ends. All data captured in the stud y up to the end of st udy will be anal yzed and reported. Any data analysis carried out independently by the Investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 12.1 Analysis sets The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) will be comprised of all randomized patients w ho meet both of the following criteria: Received at least one dose of study treatment Have a baseline NPS score ≥ 4 as measured b y the central reader. According to the intent to treat principle, subjects will be anal yzed according to the treatment they have been assigned to at the randomization. However, if patients received study treatment without being randomize d into the study they will be excluded from the FAS. The Safet y Anal ysis Set (SAF) includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the randomized/assigned treatment if the patient took at least one dose of that treatment or the first treatment received if the randomized/assigned treatment was never received. The anal ysis of the primary objectives will be performed on the FAS. The FAS will be used for the analysis of all other efficacy variables. The SAF will be used in the analy sis of all safet y variables."

The duration of exposure (expressed in weeks), the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received and actual duration of exposure) and the relative dose intensity (computed as the ratio of dose intensity and planned dose intensity ) will be summarized by means of descriptive statistics. The number of patients with dose adjustments (reductions, interruption, or permanent discontinuatio n) and the corresponding reasons will be summarized for the study treatment. Compliance with study medication over the course of the entire study will be summarized as the percentage of days with study medication intake during the period from first intake to last intake. All fevipiprant dosing data will be listed. Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies prior to and after the start of the study treatment will be listed and summarized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification sy stem in the Safety Anal ysis Set. Concomitant nasal poly p related medications will be summarized by pre-defined category . 12.4 Analysis of the primary endpoint(s) The primary aim of the study is to evaluate a change in nasal polyp size with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separatel y) as compared to placebo. This will be evaluated by using the nasal polyp score (NPS) which is assessed by nasal endoscop yand determined by central reading . The total NPS is recorded as the sum of the right and left nostril scores with a range of 0 to 8 . A decrease in the NPS is considered a favorable outcome. The analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted according to the intention to treat principle using FAS population."

The primary null hy potheses are: H0 450: the reduction in the polyp size at 16 weeks from the baseline as measured b y the NPS in fevipiprant 450 mg QD plus the SoC is less than or equal to the reduction in the polyp size as measured by the NPS i n placebo plus the SoC for the population. H0 150: the reduction in the polyp size at 16 weeks from the baseline as measured b y the NPS in fevipiprant 150 mg QD plus the SoC is less than or equal to the reduction in the polyp size as measured by the NPS in placebo plus the SoC for the population. The primary alternative hy potheses are: HA 450 : the reduction in the poly p size at 16 weeks from the baseline as measured by the NPS in fevipiprant 450 mg QD plus the SoC is greater than the reduction of the poly psize as measured b y the NPS in placebo plus the SoC for the population HA 150: the reduction in the polyp size at 16 weeks from the baseline as measured b y the NPS in fevipiprant 150 mg QD plus the SoC is greater than the reduction of the poly p size as me asured b y the NPS in placebo plus the SoC for the population Family wise Ty pe I error rate control The family wise type I error rate will be controlled at a 1-sided 2.5% level across the primar y null hypothesis using graphical approach specified by Figure 12-1 (Bretz et al 2011).

Directed edges between the vertices specify how the local significance levels are propagated in case of significant results. Statistical model for primary variable The primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in nasal poly p score from baseline to Week 16. Baseline NPS is defined as the last measurement performed before the first dose of study drug. The absolute change from baseline NPS values will be defined as the NPS at the timepoint minus the NPS at baseline. The primary efficacy variable will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) approach (fevipiprant 450 mg plus SoC and fevipiprant 150 mg plus SoC). The model will include change from baseline to follow -up timepoints every 4 weeks through week 16 as response variables, fixed -effects factors for treatment, visit, treatment × visit interaction, nasal polyp score baseline value, and baseline × visit interaction. An unstructured correlation structure will be assumed for the repeated measures within patients. Parameters will be estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton -Raphson algorithm. The least square mean change in nasal polyp score from baseline to week 16 alongside with 95% confidence interval and the P-value corresponding to the least square mean differenc e will be presented. The change in the least square mean will also be plotted against the visits to look at the general trend of the values across the visits. The absolute change from baseline in NPS will be summarized by treatment arm and timepoint 12.4.3 Handli ng of missing values/censoring/discontinuations Despite all attempts to ensure complete follow -up for all patients, some patients may not be followed for nasal polyp size for the whole planned study duration of 16 weeks. The primary analysis will be done using a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) approach. Under the assumption that the missing values are missing at random (MAR), this provides asymptoticall y unbiased and consistent estimates of the treatment effects. 12.4.4 Sensitivity and Supportive analy ses Sensitivity Analysis 1:A responder analysis of patients achieving a reduction of at least 1 in the Nasal Polyp score would be performed using a logistic regression, including terms for treatment, visits and interaction between treatment and visit. Sensitiv ity Analysis 2: The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated using the MMRM approach after imputing the Nasal Polyp Scores following surgery , only for patients who are considered as study withdrawals due to undergoing surgical procedures, by using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) technique. All other missing values will be imputed under the MAR approach within the MMRM model. Sensitivity Analysis 3: The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated using the MMRM approach after imputing the Nasa l Polyp Scores following surgery only for patients who are considered as study withdrawals due to undergoing surgical procedures, by using the worst"

All other missing values will be imputed under the MAR approach within the MMRM model. 12.5 Analysis of secondary endpoints The secondary objectives include: To evaluate the effect of symptoms as measured by the nasal congestion score with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separately) as compared to placebo, in terms of reduc tion in NCS from baseline to week 16. Nasal congestion is defined as the objective restriction of the nasal cavity airflow caused by mucosal pathology and or by mucosal secretions when anatomical variations have been excluded. The nasal congestion score is calculated based on the responses from the patients in Question 1 from the nasal congestion questionnaire outlined in Section 16.4. The questionnaire has four questions relating to the symptoms of nasal obstruction with each question having four categories ranging from 0 -3, where the scores relate to the degree of severity as follows: 0 = Not at all 1 = Mild 2 = Moderate 3 = Severe The score however is calculated based on the response to the first question in the questionnai re. The change in Nasal Congestion Score (NCS) will be analy zed using an MMRM model with visit, treatment, interaction between visit and treatment and the baseline average NCS as covariates. The least square mean change in Nasal Congestion Score from basel ine to week 16 alongside with 95% confidence interval and the P-value corresponding to the least square mean difference will be presented. To evaluate the effect on quality of life as measured by the sino-nasal outcome test (SNOT - 22) with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg once daily, separately) , compared to placebo, in terms of increase in QoL score from baseline to Week 16. SNOT-22 measures the quality of life in patients facing nasal obstructions (Section 16.5). There are 22 items available on the questionnaire. Each item in the questionnaire are followe d by five options to choose from: 0 = No problem 1 = Very Mild Problem 2 = Mild or slight Problem 3= Moderate problem 4 = Severe Problem 5 = Problem as bad as it can be. The scores for each of the items are added to get a total out of 110, with 110 being the worst signifier of qualit y of life. Also the questionnaire has the option for the patient to select the five most important items affecting their health which are analy zed separatel y to give a rating across the patients The treatment group difference in terms of change from baseline at Week 16 in"
58,page_58,"Novartis Confidential Page 59 Amended Protocol Version 03(Clean ) Protocol No. CQAW 039A2322 SNOT- 22 will be estimated using an MMRM model with change from baseline as the response variable, adjusted for visits (Week 4, 8, 12 and 16), treatment, interaction between visit and treatment and baseline SNOT - 22. The least square mean change in SNOT-22 Score from baseline to week 16 alongside with 95% confidence interval and the P-value corresponding to the least square mean differe nce will be presented. To evaluate the effect on smell as measured by the university of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT) with fevipiprant (150 mg or 450 mg, once daily) ,compared to placebo, in terms of increase in smell score from baseline t o Week 16. The universit y of Pennsy lvania smell identification test (UPSIT) is a test for smell identification to test an individuals olfactory response. The test is a measure of an individual's ability to detect odor. It consists of 4 workbooks of 10 ques tions, giving a total of 40 questions. On each page, there is a different ""scratch and sniff"" strip which are embedded with a microencapsulated odorant. There is also a four choice multiple choice question on each page. The scents are released using a penc il. After each scent is released, the patient smells the level and detects the odor from the four choices. There is an answer column on the back of the test booklet, and the test is scored out of 40 items. The score is compared to scores in a normative database from 4000 normal individuals, this tells the level of absolute smell function. The score also indicates how the patient does in accordance to their age group and gender. The maximum score achievable on the scale is 40. The treatment group difference in terms of change from baseline at Week 16 in UPSI T will be estimated using an MMRM model with change from baseline as the response variable, adjusted for visits (week 4, 8, 12 and 16), treatment, interaction between visit and treatment and baseline UPSI T. The least square mean change in UPSI T Score from baseline to week 16 alongside with 95% confidence interval and the P-value corresponding to the least square mean difference will be presented. To evaluate the general safety and tolerability of fevipipran t (150 mg and 450 mg, separately) as compared to placebo. Safety and tolerabilit y assessments were based on the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluation, and 12-lead electrocardiogram fi ndings. 12.5.1 Safety Variables For all safet y analyses, the safet y set will be used. All listings and tables will be presented by treatment group. Safet y summaries will be primarily based on on-treatment data with selected tables also presented for the all data after the first intake of study drug, while all databased safet y data will be listed.

Considering this factor, the sample size was calculated under an 80% p ower and 1.25% one sided alpha for comparison of each of the two dose levels of fevipiprant and SoC with placebo and SoC. A 10% dropout rate is considered as appropriate with reference to prior studies (omalizumab study by Gevaert et al 2013 and dupilumab study by Bachert et al 2016). From prior literature standard deviation of 1.8 is considered as appropriate for the change of score from baseline at 16 weeks in Nasal Poly p Score. The sample size calculation was performed using the software PASS 2008 using inequality tests using difference of two independent means with equal variance. The randomization will be performed in a 1:1:1 ratio for the two separate doses level of fevipiprant (450 mg and 150 mg) and the placebo arm. Under these assumptions (effect size = 1.5, equal SD = 1.8,power = 80% for each arm individually , one- sided alpha = 0.0125 and dropout = 10%), the total sample size y ielded was 93 with 31 patients in each arm. The sample size provides a power of 80% for each comparison but since we will be testing correlated hy pothesis using a Dunnet's test, this is a lower bound on the power. The real power is expected to be higher if in at least one of the 2 dosages i.e. fevipiprant 150 mg or fevipiprant 450 mg, the standardized effect size (in other words, keeping the assumption of an SD of 1.8 in each group) is equal to the clinicall y significant value of 1.5 and there is some treatment benefit in the other groups as well. However, if the effect size is equal to 1.5 in both of the groups, the power will be substantially higher i.e. around 93% 13 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures 13.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed and shall be implement ed, executed and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations (including European Directive 2001/20/EC, US CFR 21), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Decla ration of Helsinki. 13.2 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC Before initiating a trial, the Investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RB/IEC) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to subjects.

Pol yps will be evaluated using the following scale: Poly p Score Poly p Size 0 No polyps 1 Small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate 2 Polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate 3 Large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate 4 Large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity Note: Scoring system is used to evaluate polyp size in each nasal passage by means of video nasal endoscop y. Nasal polyp score is the sum of unilateral polyp scores for each nasal passage.The scoring is modified to accommodate patients who have had a middle turbinectomy , such that the poly p must reach the top of the inferior turbinate to be graded as Score 2. If the patient has polyps between the middle turbinate and septum meaning that polyps are coming from posterior ethmoid cells, one point was added, but not if the polyp scale was alread y confirmed. The grade of polyps in each nasal cavity of all patients will be taken into account in the results. A video of each endosc opy will be recorded and initially saved locally within the clinical site. For endoscopy procedures performed at screening, the initial assessment of eligibility will be performed locall y by the Investigator with the video files then uploaded for assessmen t of the NPS and confirmation of eligibility by central reading. This should be confirmed before the patient enters the run-in period. The endoscop y will be assessed at the end of the run-in with baseline NPS assigned locally by the Investigator . Should the Investigator deem the patient eligible for randomization then the baseline video will be uploaded for central reading assessment. The final result from the central readers must be received to re-confirm eligibility , prior to randomization. Upon confirmat ion of eligibility , the endoscop y assessments from Treatment Day 1 onwards, will also be uploaded to the vendors cloud based sy stem for central reading assessment of the NPS. Should this upload not be possible due to local restrictions or logistics, the endoscop y video will be posted to the vendor on an encry pted USB drive. The vendor will utilize two independent experts who will each review the video and assign a score for NPS for that patient at the specific timepoint. Should there not be an agreement bet ween the two reviewers, a third review will act as adjudicator and will make the final decision on the NPS. Full training on the use of the vendors cloud based sy stem will be provided."
