Clinical Study Protocol AE051-G- 16-007 13 Amendment 4, Version 5.2 – 8 Oct 2018 CONFIDENTIAL 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background 1.1.1 Psoriasis Plaque psoriasis is the most common form of psoriasis. It is a mild to severe inflammatory autoimmune disease with primary skin manifestation characterized by raised, well-demarcated, itchy erythematous circular -to-oval plaques covered with adherent silvery white scales. In addition to the skin- related manifestation, concomitant with psoriatic arthritis and nail psoriasis may be experienced by some patients. Also, it is reported patients consider itch to be the most bothersome symptom of psoriasis and is more likely to cau se absence from work and reduced work productivity than psoriasis related pain or scaling . 1 The number of patients with psoriasis is estimated to be approximately 7.5 million in the US, 7.5 million in the EU, 420 thousand in Japan and the worldwide prevalence of psoriasis is calculated to be 0.6 to 4.8% . 2-5 It is also known that the quality of life (QOL) of the psoriasis patients is lower than that of patients with cancer or diabetes .6 As a result, psoriasis markedly restricts the social activities of patients. Psoriasis is trig gered by the cells and molecules of both, innate and adaptive immune systems. The inflammatory cells infiltration consists mainly of dendritic cells, macrophages and T cells in dermis, and T cells and neutrophils in epidermis. These cells are activated thr ough antimicrobial peptide such as β- defensins and auto- antigens including LL -37 and a disintegrin -like and metalloprotease domain containing thrombospondin type 1 motif -like 5 (ADAMTSL5 ). 7,8 Various cytokines produced by these immune cells play a cruc ial role in the development of psoriasis. Clinical studies of biologics targeting cytokines have revealed that Interleukin (IL) -17 and IL -23 play highly important roles in the disease progression and exacerbation of psoriasis. 9-12 A 1.1.2 Trea tmen t of Psoriasis The goal of psoriasis treatment is to achieve rapid remission induction, long -term control of skin manifestations and improve the QOL. The current pharmacotherapy for psoriasis mainly consists of topical vitamin D3 analogues and topical cort icosteroids, and systemic treatments such as cyclosporine and methotrexate (MTX) may be used depending on the symptoms. For patients with concomitant psoriatic arthritis and those who have not sufficiently responded to conventional systemic treatments, biologics targeting tumor necrosis factor -ɑ (TNF -ɑ), IL -23, IL-17, etc. may be used. Cyclosporine and MTX, which form the core of the systemic treatment, exert their actions more rapidly and effectively compared with the topical drugs, and can induce remissio n in some patients . 14 However, these drugs raise many safety concerns: long -term treatment with cyclosporine may cause nephropathy or increase the blood pressure and MTX may lead to myelosuppression and a wide variety of other side effects. Biologic therapies can achieve remis sion in many patients, making a huge contribution to the advances in psoriasis treatment. However, there are concerns related to biologics, which have yet to be addressed: (1) inadequate response to therapy in approximately 30% of the patients (2) increased risks for infections and cancer development"

Clinical Study Protocol AE051-G- 16-007 14 Amendment 4, Version 5.2 – 8 Oct 2018 CONFIDENTIAL (3) high financial burden (4) lack of availability of long -term safety data for these compounds (5) hypersensitivity reactions, such as infusion reaction, injection site reaction and (6) generation of neutraliz ing antibodies.15,16 Base d on these considerations, the next generation therapies for psoriasis are expected to be represented by cost -effective, highly- efficacious and safe oral drugs that can induce remission rapidly and achieve complete remission with high probability. Unlike the existing drugs for systemic treatment that are indicated only for severe cases, cost, as well as the safety profile of the new generation therapeutics must allow prescribing those to any patient regardless of the severity of the disease. 1.1.3 Interleukin-2-i nducible T -cell Kinase Interleukin-2- inducible T -cell kinase (ITK) is a non -receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is mainly expressed in T cells, mast cells, and natural killer cells. In the T cells, the molecule plays a role in transmitting stimulation tr iggered by the antigen via the T cell receptor (TCR) located on the cell membrane. 17 When antigen is presented with the major histocompatibility complex on the antigen- presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages, T cells are activated by recognizing the antigen via the TCR. As a result of activation, T cells produce cytokines such as interleukin- 2 (IL -2), interleukin- 17 (IL -17) and interferon γ ( IFNγ) and accelerate their own proliferation. It is also considered that T cells are significantly involved in the development of tissue inflammation and damage by activation of other inflammatory cells by these cytokines. Findings that indicate a relationship between ITK and pathological changes have been reported. T cells obtained from ITK -knockout mice could not show IL -2 production in response to stimulation mimicking antigen presentation, which led to decreased cell proliferation. Cell proliferation is also less sensitive in the mixed lymphocyte reaction if obtained from mice of a different strain. 18 Furthermore, it has been reported that ITK-knockout mice show impaired response in allergic airway inflammation induced by th e antigen: the production of various cytoki nes in the T cells in lymphoid tissues, the infiltrative inflammatory cell counts in the airway, and the secretion of airway mucus.19 This information suggest s that ITK may be involved in the development of pathological changes in autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection and allergic diseases of which the onset and exacerbation are caused by an excessive immune response to the antigen."

Subjects with other types of psoriasis will be excluded from the study to ensure a homogenous study population.

From a safety perspective, study restrictions will be implemented based on the m of nonclinical and clinical data available to date. These include restrictions aiming to minimize the risk to the participating subjects, to min imize the confounding factors in the assessment process and to monitor and adequately manage any safety -related findings. Thus, subjects at high risk of developing immunosuppression- related AEs, such as infections or malignancies, including those with pre -existing conditions (e.g., clinically -manifested or latent TB, active infections with HBV, HCV or HIV) or significant hematological condition are excluded from participating in the study.

Other, ge neral safety -related restrictions, such as cardiovascular -system -related, hepatic and renal function- related restrictions, as well as the known safety signals associated with other compounds with similar mechanism of action on the market or in development, have been implemented. 1.3.2 Justification for Study Design A parallel grou p, placebo-controlled design will be employed in this study, to assess the effect of JTE -051 on the efficacy parameters and to evaluate the safety of JTE -051, compared to placebo in subjects with plaque psoriasis. Briefly, upon completion of all protocol-m andated screening procedures, the qualified subjects will be randomized at Visit 2 in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the following five parallel dose groups: JTE -051 50 mg QD, JTE-051 100 mg QD, JTE-051 150 mg QD, JTE -051 200 mg QD or placebo QD (17 subjects to be randomized per arm; see Section 3.8.1.6 for considerations related to sample size calculation), and will receive the double -blind treatment f or 12 weeks followed by a 4-week Follow- up Period. The single ascending dose study (AE051-U-11-001) data demonstrated no food effect on the PK of JTE -051; thus, study drug will be administered regardless of meals; nonetheless, based on the PK characteristics of the compound, the protocol requires the study drug administration in the morning to ensure an approximately 24- hour period between dosing, (see Section 1.2.2). The duration of the double- blind t reatment period is sufficient to obtain proof- of-efficacy in subjects with plaque psoriasis , as an initial step in development. The duration of the Follow -up Period is set to approximately 4 weeks, standard duration for similar out- patient studies administered an investigational product. Based on the PK characteristics of JTE -051 (see Section 1.2.1) , this period is considered conservative, . The efficacy parameters assessed in this study are consistent with the standards in the industry in similar psoriasis trials ; appropriate efficacy analyses are planned, as detailed in Section 3.8.3.2. To minimize the chance s of errors, all calculations of derived parameters will be done by the Sponsor based on the appropriate core data points collected and documented by the Investigators. With respect to safety, adequate procedures have been implemented to minimize the risks to the study subjects (based on the compound’s MOA and the nonclinical and clinical data available to date [see Sections 1.2.1, 1.2.2 for summary information and the IB for detailed information]) and to facilitate further characterization of the safety profile of JTE -051. 1.3.3 Justification for Dose Selection The selection of JTE -051 doses in this study is based on the collective data from nonclinical pharmacology/toxicology studies and Phase 1 clinical studies."

Withdrawal by Subject : subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. However, if a subject withdraws consent because of experiencing an adverse event, the reason fo r subject termination should be documented as the adverse event. 2. Adverse Event: a clinical or biological adverse event or intercurrent condition(s), requiring study drug discontinuation, whether or not related to the study drug If grade 3 findings (defined as severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living [ADL] such as bathing, dressing, undressing, feeding self, usin g the toilet, taking medication, but not bedridden), according to the CTCAE29, are noted in a subject, he/she must be promptly evaluated by the Investigator (including repeat tests, evaluation of the baseline parameters, concomitant medications, etc.) for potential withdrawal from the study. Every effort should be made to discuss with the study’s Medical Monitor prior to final decision, unless not feasible, based on safety considerations. Notes: • The investigator may decide to evaluate or withdraw the subject from the study based on findings of lesser than grade 3 severity, according to his/her judgment. l 3. Consistent Non- complian ce with Study Drug (i.e., <80% or >120% compliance at two consecutive study visits ; exceptions on a case -by-case basis may be permitted if approved by Sponsor or designee). Note: Compliance will be evaluated at every study visit during the Treatment Period . If compliance of <80% or >120% is identified at a study visit, the Investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. 4. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Not Met : If a subject who did not meet any of the study inclusion or exclusion criteria is identified after the randomization, the Investigator, Medical Monitor and Sponsor will review that subject profile, including the medical history, prior and current concomitant medications, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and clinical laboratory test results. Since such deviations are usually noted after randomization , the decision to be made is to allow the subject to continue the study or not. For such cases, a n exception may be permitted on a case- by-case basis if the subject was randomized into the study due to a minor error determined to be of no clinical and/or safety risk to the subject . Some of the examples where case- by-case basis exceptions may be allowed are as follows:"

The sPGA assessments should be performed on all psoriatic lesion s by the same evaluator throughout the study. The sPGA is used to determine the severity of subject’s psoriatic lesion at a gi ven time point. The psoriatic lesion will be graded for induration, erythema and scaling based on the scales below. The sum of the 3 scales will be divided by 3 to obtain the final sPGA score. Induration (I) 0 = no evidence of plaque elevation 1 = minimal plaque elevation, ~0.25 mm 2 = mild plaque elevation, ~0.5 mm 3 = moderate plaque elevation, ~0.75 mm 4 = marked plaque elevation, ~1 mm 5 = severe plaque elevation, ~1.25 mm or more Erythema (E) 0 = no evidence of erythema, hyperpigmentation may be present 1 = faint erythema 2 = light red coloration 3 = moderate red coloration 4 = bright red coloration 5 = dusky to deep red coloration Scaling (S) 0 = no evidence of scaling 1 = minimal; occasional fine scale over less than 5% of the lesion 2 = mild; fine scale dominates 3 = moderate; coarse scale dominates 4 = marked; thick, nontenacious scale dominates 5 = severe; very thick tenacious scale predominates Add I+E+S = _______________/3 = ________ (Total Average) Physician’s Static Global Assessm ent based upon above Total Average 0 = Cleared, except for residual discoloration 1 = Minimal – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 1 2 = Mild – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 2 3 = Moderate – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 3 4 = Marked – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 4 5 = Severe – majority of lesions have individual scores for I+E+S/3 that averages 5 Note: Scores should be rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., if the total is ≤1.49, the score should be 1; if the total is ≥1.50, the score should be 2) except if the score is ˃0 and ˂1, score should be treated as 1."

For a given subject, t he PASI assessments should be performed by the same evaluator throughout the study. The PASI score will be derived as indicated in Table 7. The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration) and scaling (desquamation). The average degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0 to 4. The area covered by lesions on each body region is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that particular body region. Further practical details help the assessment: 1. The neck is assessed as part of the head. 2. The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk. 3. The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs. 4. When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed. Because the head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of the body surface area, respectively, the PASI score is calculated using the following formula: PASI = 0.1(EH+IH+DH)AH + 0.2(EU+IU+DU)AU + 0.3(ET+IT+DT)AT + 0.4(EL+IL+DL)AL Where, The PASI scores can range from 0, corresponding to no signs of psoriasis, up to a theoretic maximum of 72.0, corresponding to maximal signs of psoriasis."

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medical (investigational) product. Serious Adverse Event: As provided by the ICH criteria, an SAE is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: • death • a life -threatening adverse drug experience • inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • a persistent or significant disability/incapacity • a congenital anomaly/birth defect • other important medical event Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experien ce when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Adverse Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product (IMP) related to any dose administered. Note: The phrase ""responses to a medicinal product"" means that a causal relationship between the medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction: An adverse reaction, the nature (specificity) or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., IB). Death: Death represents an outcome and a SAE criterion, not an event term. The medical condition with the fatal outcome should be reported unless the cause of death is unknown, in which case the term “Death” is acceptable. Inpatient Hospitalization/Prolongation of Hospitalization: Any admission (even if less than 24 hours) to a healthcare facility. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., medical floor to the coronary care unit). Initial and prolonged hospitalizations that do not meet this SAE criterion include those due to social and/or convenience reasons (e.g., lack of personal care at home, unable to transfer to non-acute facility), admission to rehabilitation/hospice/skilled nursing facilities, emergency"

Clinical Study Protocol AE051-G-16- 007 58 Amendment 4, Version 5.2 – 8 Oct 2018 CONFIDENTIAL room visits, same -day/outpatient/ambulatory procedures, and those for pre -planned, elective procedures for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen after the informed consent has been signed (no AE present). However, if the hospitalization was prolonged due to a complication of a pre -existing c ondition, the complication (diagnosis of same) would qualify as an SAE. Disability: A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. Life-threatening: Any adverse drug experience that places the patient or subject, in the vi ew of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Physical Examination, n, Vital Signs, Laboratory Test and ECG Abnormalities: Any abnormalities fulfilling the criteria for an SAE should be reported as such, in addition to being recorded as an AE in the CRF. Any abnormal vital sign, physical ( finding or laboratory/ECG result which is clinically significant (i.e., meets one or more of the following conditions) should be recorded as a single diagnosis on the AE page in the CRF: • Accompanied by clinical symptoms • Leads to permanent discontinuation of study drug • Requires a change in concomitant therapy (e.g., addition of, interruption of, discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or treatment). This does not apply to abnormal vital signs, physical finding or laboratory/ECG results that do not mee t the clinical significance criteria or those which are a result of an AE which has already been reported. Pre-existing conditions that are detected at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), including abnormalities in ECG, physical examination, n n, vital signs and laboratory tests, are considered to be medical history 3.6.2 Assessing Adverse Events When completing appropriate forms for reporting the AE, the Investigator will be asked to assess the AE as follows: Seriousness of Adverse Event: • Serious : The AE meets a criterion of the SAE definition. • Not Serious: The AE does not meet a criterion of the SAE definition. Severity of Adverse Event : • Mild : No interference with functioning. • Moderate: No significant interference with functioning. • Severe: Significant interference with functioning."

Clinical Study Protocol AE051-G-16- 007 59 Amendment 4, Version 5.2 – 8 Oct 2018 CONFIDENTIAL Relationship of Adverse Event (Causality): The Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IMP caused or contributed to the adverse event. General ly, the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest causal relationship should be documented. Factors to be taken into consideration when assessing causality include: subject’s underlying and pre-existing conditions, prior/concomitant medications, timing of o nset relative to study drug administration, the known PK characteristics of JTE -051, the currently -known safety profile of JTE -051, known class effects of similar MOA drugs and any other information that is considered relevant by the Investigator. Akros Pharma Inc. evaluates the relationship of an AE to the study drug using the following three categories: • Not Related • Possibly Related • Related Action Taken with Regard to Study Drug : Akros Pharma Inc. evaluates the action taken with the treatment product and/or interacting product using the following four definitions: • Dose Not Changed: The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was maintained at the same dose level • Drug Interrupted : The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was temporarily discontinued and then re- started • Drug Withdrawn: The subject was on treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred, and the study drug dosing was permanently discontinued • Not Applicable: The subject was not receiving treatment with the study drug when the AE occurred (i.e., AE occurred before the first study drug administration or after the last study drug administration) Other Action Taken: • None • Additional Treatment Given for the AE • Therapeutic/ Diagnostic Procedure • Other (including discontinuation/reduction of a concomitant medication due to the AE) Outcome to Date: • Not Recovered/Not Resolved: The subject has not yet recovered from the AE; the event has not improved (follow -up of all serious AEs will be continued until the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained). • Recovering/Resolving : The subject has not yet recovered from the AE, however, the event is improving (follow -up of all serious AEs will be continued until the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained). • Recovered/Resolved : The subject recovered from the AE with no sequelae. • Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae: The subject recovered from the AE with sequelae. • Fatal : The subject’s death was a result of the AE."

However, pre -existing conditions detected as part of the screening procedures should be documented as medical history. Worsening of the underlying condition (i.e., plaque psoriasis) or signs/symptoms associated with this condition should not be reported as an AE unless they meet at least one serious criterion; in such case when they would be reported as both an AE and an SAE.

Serious Adverse Event Reporting Reporting by Investigators Detailed instruction regarding SAE reporting will be provided in the appropriate documents outside of this protocol. A brief, non- all-inclusive summary is provided below. Any SAE experien ced by a study subject after signing the informed consent up to 28 days after the last dose of study drug will be reported to the Sponsor or designee . Additionally, SAEs that occur after this period will also be reported to the Sponsor or designee if the Investigator considers the SAE possibly related or related to the study drug. Serious adverse events (both initial reports and follow -up information) must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s (site’s) awareness or notification of the event. The Investigators should make every effort to provide complete information when reporting the SAE (both for initial reports, as well as for follow-ups). The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided, the condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the subject dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow -up information, the Investigator must submit it to the Sponsor or designee. The Investigator is also required to submit SAE reports to the IRB/IEC in accordance with local requirements. All investigators involved in studies using the same IMP will receive any Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) reports for onward submission to their local IRB/IEC as required.

The subject/partner should be followed by the Investigator until completion of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor or designee . At t he completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the outcome of the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE as described above. Overdose Reporting: An overdose is a significant variation from the recommended/scheduled dosage for a product. For the purposes of this study, overdose is defined by any confirmed use of blinded study medication of more than four tablets once a day. If such situations occur, the Investigator should provide additional training to the subject on study drug dosing instructions and emphasize the importance of compliance. Currently there is no known antidote to JTE- 051, thus appropriate symptomatic and/or supportive care is to be provided at the Investigator’s discretion, as needed. The subject’s continued eligibility will be left to the judgment of the Investigator. Information on overdoses in subjects is collected by the Sponsor or designee. Should a subject experience an overdose during the course of the study, the investigator or qualified designee must report the overdose as soon as possible, but not later than the timeframe requested by the Sponsor or designee after the investigator or qualified designee first becomes aware of the overdose. Instructions will be provided on how to collect this information. 3.7 Identification of Treatments 3.7.1 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups After subject signs the informed consent, each site will assign potential study subjects an eight -character subject number. This number will consist of a four -digit site number (with the first two digits representing the country -specific number and the next two digits representing the site -specific number) and a three- digit subject number assigned in a sequential manner. The hyphen between the site and subject number will account for the eighth character. This number will represent the su bject’s identifier throughout the study. Following confirmation of eligibility at Visit 2, the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be contacted by the site and it will assign the subject a four -digit randomization number that will correspond to a r andomly assigned treatment group. 3.7.2 Identity of Investigational Products E"

On the scheduled study visit days, subjects should not take study drug prior to arriving to the site. At the site, study drug will be administered from the previously supplied blister card, if available, after all study procedures have been completed (except for appropriate PK samples collection procedures as discussed in Figure 2). If no tablets from the previously supplied blister cards are available, then the subject should dose from the new blister card supplied at that visit. Randomized subjects will receive three study drug blister cards at Visits 2 and two study drug blister c ards at Visit 3. Subjects will receive four blister cards each on Visits 4 and 5. The subjects will be instructed to use the blister cards on a first- in/first- out basis and to return all study drug blister cards from the former visit for accountability and compliance assessment at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 for accountability and compliance assessment. Following completion of accountability and compliance assessments, any unused blister card or a partially used blister card with the study drug available will be r eturned to the subject . At Visit 6 , study drug will not be dispensed. In the event that the subject does not take the study drug on a given day during the Treatment Period, the subject should not take more than the daily dosage on the following treatment day. 3.7.6 Management of Clinical Supplies The Investigator will have responsibility for the control and proper distribution of all study drug (including any investigational product or reference product) in accordance with this protocol. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study drug will be stored at the site at recommended storage temperatures and conditions, in a secured area, free of environmental extremes, with restricted access. The Investigator also ensures that all study drug will be dispensed only to study subjects who have provided written informed consent and have met all entry criteria. Study drug accountability will be performed by the Investigator or designee at each study visit during the Treatment Period, according to the schedule of procedures presented in Table 1. Study drug compliance will be assessed and documented per the Good Clinical Practices ( GCP ). 3.7.7 Randomization Approximately 8 5 eligible subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized into this study. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio (17 subjects per treatment group) to receive JTE -051 50 mg, JTE -051 100 mg, JTE -051 150 mg, JTE-051 200 mg or placebo QD. Randomization will be stratified based on prior exposure of subjects to biologic therapy (i.e., biologic treatment- naïve vs. biologic treatment -experienced subj ects). An IWRS will b e employed for the randomization activities. It will use a stratified randomization algorithm that takes into account the strata specified above. The randomization code will be controlled by an unblinded member of the Sponsor or designee who will provide the randomization code to select laboratories, se e Section 3.7.8."

The JTE -051 50 mg tablets, as well as the placebo tablets will be supplied as unbranded tablets which are identical in appearance. The laboratory performing the JTE -051 plasma concentration assessments will be unblinded to facilitate ana lysis of only the samples from the JTE -051- treated subjects. Plasma samples from placebo -treated subjects may be analyzed as needed (see Section 3.5.6.32.2). 3.7.9 Breaking the Blind The study drug code may be broken by the Investigator for a particular subject only in the event of a serious adverse experience, which the Investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the identity of the study drug by using the IWRS. Every effort must be made to contact the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to breaking the code. If this is not possible and the situation is an emergency, the Investigator may break the blind to identify the treatment assignment for the specific subject only and must contact the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor as soon as possible thereafter. The Sponsor may also elect to break the blind for cause. If the blind is broken, appropriate documentation should be completed as soon as possible. Additionally, breaking of the blind may be performed by sponsor designated independent member not involved in the clinical conduct of the study for regulatory reporting purposes, as appropriate. 3.8 Statistical Methods This section provides an abbreviated st atistical analysis plan (SAP) for the efficacy, safety and PK . A formal SAP will be developed at a later time. Statistical issues not addressed in this section may be developed in the formal SAP. The plans outlined in this section may be modified in the SAP; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis may also be reflected in a protocol amendment, as appropriate. Other deviations to the SAP will be discussed in the study report. 3.8.1 Subject Population for Analysis 3.8.1.1 Randomized Population The randomized population consists of all subjects who are randomized at Visit 2 to one of the five treatment groups: JTE -051 50 mg QD, JTE-051 100 mg QD, JTE-051 150 mg QD, JTE-051 200 mg QD and matching placebo QD. 3.8.1.2 Safety Population Safety population consists of the randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of the study drug and have at least one post-randomization safety data."

The analysis of the primary efficacy parameter will be repeated on the PP population if it excludes 20% or more of the subjects from the ITT population. Additional efficacy analyses using the PP population may be performed if deemed appropriate. 3.8.3.1 Efficacy Parameters The primary efficacy parameter is the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 75 at EOT. The secondary efficacy parameters are (evaluated at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16, unless otherwise stated) : • Percent change from baseline in PASI score; • Proportions of subjects achieving PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100; • Proportion of subjects achieving a sPGA score of 0 or 1; • Change from baseline in sPGA score; • Percent change from baseline in the psoriasis affected BSA; • Change from baseline in Skindex-16; 3.8.3.2 Efficacy Data Analysis For the purpose of efficacy analysis, the EOT value is defined as the last value taken during the double-blind treatment period after the first dose of study drug , without any treatment intervention. Conventional statistical evaluations for efficacy parameters will also be conducted as described below : For the primary efficacy parameter (PASI 75 at EOT), the Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare each JTE -051 dose group with placebo."

It includes fixed effects for treatment, time, treatment by time interaction, the stratification factor and the appropriate baseline and subject as the random effect. The appropriat e baseline will be the parameter from which the efficacy parameter is derived, e.g., PASI score at Week 0 for the analysis of percent change from baseline in PASI score. The treatment effect of each JTE -051 dose group relative to placebo at the same time point will be estimated. A linear trend test at each time point will be computed using appropriate linear contrast. All analyses will be performed two -sided at the 5% significance level. No formal multiple comparison adjustment will be made, therefore , results should be interpreted with the multiplicity in mind. The estimated treatment effect (relative to placebo) from the model, along with a two -sided 95% CI and p- value, will be tabulated where appropriate. The Newcombe’s CI of the rate difference between J TE-051 dose and placebo will be computed when performing the Fisher’s exact test. Graphical presentations of the treatment profile may be depicted. Sensitivity analysis, model fit assessment may be conducted and data transformation may be employed if appropriate. Descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters over time will be presented by treatment. It will include the number of subjects (N), arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum for continuous parameters, and in frequency tabulation form for dichotomous parameters."

For parameters analyzed both by time point and with multiple time points, these two approaches would strengthen the findings when they are similar. For continuous efficacy parameters, no imputation will be employed. This is because the mixed effect model gives valid estimates if the missing data mechanism is “missin g at random”, a common assumption made as the first approach for analysis. For the sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, i.e., PASI 75 at EOT, missing data may be imputed by all possible combinations of success and failure. The robustness of the finding can be evaluated using the tipping point analysis based on the plausibility of the imputed values. Other missing data imputation methods may be employed for additional sensitivity analysis if deemed necessary. 3.8.4 Safety Analyses The safety population will be used for the safety data analysis unless otherwise stated. 3.8.4.1 Safety Parameters The safety parameters are: • Adverse events • Clinical laboratory safety tests • Vital signs, ECG parameters 3.8.4.2 Safety Data Analysis Descriptive statistics of vital signs, ECG parameters, and clinical laboratory data will be presented by treatment in tabular form with N, arithmetic mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum, or in frequency tabulation form as appropriate.

Population estimates of PK parameters of JTE -051 such as the apparent oral clearance of drug following extravascular administrat ion (CL_F) and apparent volume of distribution following extravascular administration (V_F) will be estimated and inter -subject variability of these parameters will be characterized. The effect of intrinsic/extrinsic factors (e.g., age, body weight, gender, race, use of concomitant medications) on the pharmacokinetics of JTE -051 will be evaluated. Other PK parameters will be determined and reported as deemed appropriate.
