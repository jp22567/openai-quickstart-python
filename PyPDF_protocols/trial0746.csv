All in vestigators involved in the conduct of the clinical investigati on will be qualified by educat ion, training, or exper ience to perform their tasks and this training will be documented appropriately. 1.1 Background and Rationale Mitral valve disease (MD) is the most common form of heart disease. The frequency of new cases of MD malformations significantly increases with age, from less than 2% at the age of up to 65 years, to 8.5% for the age group 65–75 years and 13. 2% in the age group 75 years and older. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the types of malformation of the MD, which involves lack of coaptation of the valve leaflets, which leads to a reverse flow of blood from the le ft ventricle to the left atrium. A pr onounced progression of MR has a poor prognosis and leads to left ventricular failure, pulmo nary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, stroke and death. Depending on the et iology, MR is classified into 2 types: (1) primary, or degener ative, and (2) secondary, or functional. Degenerative MR (DMR) is caused by an atomical changes in the leaflets and chords of the mitral valve and is the most common type of MR in the world. Functional FMR (F MR) is caused by remodeling and dyssy nchrony of the left ventricle and is usually associated with cardio myopathy, or coronary heart disease; MR is secondary to left ventricular dysfunction, the mitral valve itself is morphologically normal. According to the treatment guidelines, surgical reconstruction is the preferred treatment opt ion for chronic degenerative MR (DMR). Other treatment options include surgical valve replacement surgery. Despite the stringent requirements imposed during the operati on, these methods are characteriz ed by high mortality during the"
9,page_9,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 10 from 61 operation, reduced survival, worse retention of postopera tive left ventricular function and higher long-term morbidity. Functional MR includes ischemic MR (fixation of the posterior cusp, lead i ng to a posteriorly directed release of MR inside the left atrium) and no n-ischemic MR (displacement of bot h papillary muscles , resulting in a center-directed release of MR). The prevalence of FMR is underestima ted due to its “secondary” nature (patients present with heart fa ilure CH is more likely due to LV dysfunction than heart disease). With this type of MR, pharmacotherapy is the preferred first-line therapy. Other treatment options include surgical reconstruction or surgical valve replacement. Surgical interventions of this type remain problematic, partly due to the fact that patients are characterized by severe comorbidities. Moreover, these patients have a high probability of postoperative relapses from moderate to severe MR, and t here is no evidence that operations of this kind prolong life. To minimize the risks associat ed with surgery, or to treat inoperable patients, a new class of therapy was developed based on tra nscatheter methods, the so-cal led “edge-to-edge” case ment reconstruction. Percutaneous combination procedure can be considered for both pati ents with symptomatic severe primary MR, and secondary MR. This type of therapy is considered for patients who are consi dered inoperable or at high risk for open-heart surgery and have a life expectancy of more than 1 year. This procedure is unique and can be performed using the MitraClip NT implantable clip. At the moment, more than 40,000 procedur es have been performed worldwide us ing MitraClip NT System . The system is a transcutaneous implant able mechanical clamp that is us ed to increase the coaptation of the mitral valve leaflets, resulting in significant reduction of mitral regurgi tation through the heart cycle. According to studies published in, patients show a greater safety profile after 12 months compared with the research group that underwent the traditional operation. As a result, the purpose of this study will be the clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of the MitraClip NT System in the treatment of symptomatic chronic severe mitral regurgitation. 1.2 Rationale for Conducting this Clinical Investigation Mitral regurgitation is the most comm on pathology of t he heart valve in the world. Patients with severe MR experience various symptoms of exhaustion, such as shortness of breath, an abnormal heart rhythm, dizziness, and fatigue. The quality of life of such patients suffe rs greatly, their mobility is limited, the number of hospitalizations associat ed with heart failure increases, and morta lity increases. Chronic severe MR is often associated with heart failure; in a ddition, it can be fatal if left unattended. Although surgery to restore or replace the mitral valve is current ly considered a standard procedure for this case, many patients with clinically significant MR are at an unacceptable risk, and t herefore no surgery is performed for them. To optimize the load, such patients are often forced to take various drugs (in particular, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiote nsin II receptor blockers), which can temporarily relieve MR symptoms, but do not eliminate their cause. As a result, a signifi cant proportion of patients receiving medical treatment"
10,page_10,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 11 from 61 continue to develop heart failur e and deteriorate the quality of life. In this regard, there is a significant clinical need to search for treatment options for moderate to severe MRI for patients with a hi gh level of surgical risk. The MitraClip NT System is the first commercially available ca theter-based option for the treatment of MR. The MitraClip NT System was developed as an alternate percutaneous technol ogy which may serve as a viable therapeutic option for patients at high risk for open-heart surgery. Treatment with the MitraClip NT System allows patients to undergo a less invasive procedure that can me chanistically reduce MR and allow for improved quality of life. The MitraClip NT procedure is performed under general anesthesia without the use of a heart-lung machine, with recovery typically lasting two to three days. 2.0 CLINICAL INVESTIGATION OVERVIEW 2.1 Clinical Investigation Overview The objective of this study is to evaluate safety an d effectiveness of the Mitr aClip NT procedure in the Russian population for treatment of Mitral Regurgitation. 2.2 Devices To Be Used in th e Clinical Investigation 2.2.1 Name of the Devices Under Investigation The table below provides the list of the medical devices imported into the Russian Federation for the purpose of this clinical investigation.

Steerable Guide Catheter is also us ed to properly position MitraClipNT System on the mitral valve. A dilator is used to introduce a catheter into the femoral vein and the left atrium. The Clip Delivery System consists of three major co mponents: 1) the Delivery Catheter 2) the Steerable Sleeve and 3) the MitraCli p NT Device. The Clip Delivery System is introduced into the body through a Steerable Guide Catheter which includes a dilator.
17,page_17,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigation Plan Version: 1.0 Page 18 from 61 Figure 2 – Main Parts The Delivery Catheter and Steerable Sleeve handles (Figure 3) provide the user wi th the means to position, actuate, and deploy the MitraClip NT Device. The Delivery Catheter handl e consists of a Fastener, Lock Lever, Actuator Knob, Arm Positioner , Gripper Lever, and two flush ports. The Fastener is used to temporarily secure the Delivery Catheter position relative to the Steerable Sleeve, to prevent inadvertent manipulation of the MitraClip NT Device once the leaflets have been grasped. The Lock Lever is used to lock and unlock the lock mechanism of the MitraClip NT Device. The Arm Positioner is used to open, close, and invert the MitraClip NT Device Arms and advance or retrac t the actuator mandrel. The Gripper Lever is used to hold the Grippers in the raised position or to release them to the lowered position. The Actuator Knob is rotated in the counterclockwise di rection to unthread the actuator mandrel from the MitraClip NT Device threaded stud. The flush ports are standard female luer fittings t hat allow for aspiration of air and infusion of liquids (e.g., heparanized saline) into the thru -lumens of the Delivery Catheter. The Delivery Catheter consists of a long, flexible hydrophilic-coated multi-lu men shaft secured to the MitraClip NT Device at the distal end and to a handle at its proximal end. T he lumens are used as conduits for the MitraClip NT Device release lines (i.e., Lock Li nes and Gripper Lines) and the MitraClip NT Actuator Mandrel. The distal tip of the Delivery Catheter is radiopaque to allow vi sualization under fl uoroscopy and is designed to be securely attached to the MitraClip NT Device.

Rationale for the MitraClip NT System Russian Trial is s ubsequently presented in the c ontext of this scientific body of evidence. EVEREST I Desi gn and Results The EVEREST I Feasibility tri al was the first prospective, multi-c enter, non-randomized trial to evaluate the preliminary safety and effect iveness of the percutaneous MitraClip System in patients with moderate-to- severe (3+) or severe (4 +) MR in surgical cand idates. After undergoing the MitraClip procedure, patients were followed at discharge, 30 days, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and every year ther eafter through 5 years. An independent Echocard iography Core Laboratory (E CL) assessed MR severity and other echocardiographic parameters at baseline and fo llow-up. The last patient has completed 5-year foll ow-up and the study is now closed. A total of 55 patients were enrolled in th e trial. The MitraClip device was implanted in 89% of patients and the trial met its pre-specified safety acc eptance criter ion, demonstrating mechanistic feasibility of implant and safety of the MitraClip System and procedure. There were no intra-p rocedural deaths. The procedure time averaged approximately 4 hours, pat ients were hemodynamically stabl e during the proc edure, and the average length of hospital stay was approximately 3 days. A majority of patients (70.9%) experienced reduction in MR severity to 2+ or less at discharge. No MitraClip device embolizations occurred in this cohort. The rate of single leaflet device a ttachment (SLDA) in th is initial cohort of pat ients treated was 10.2%. A majority of SLDAs were detected early (within 30 days post- MitraClip procedure). Patients demonstrated"
24,page_24,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 25 from 61 improvement in NYHA Functional Class and left ventricular measurement s that were sustained through 5 years. At 5 years, freedom from death was 86.4% and freedom from mi tral valve surgery was 55.1%. The results of the EVEREST I trial at 5 years provide evidence of the safety and long-t erm durability of the MitraClip device in the early cohort of patients treated in the United States. EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT ) Design and Results The EVEREST II RCT is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial in which patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR were randomized in a 2:1 ratio between the Device group (MitraClip device) and the Control group (mitral valve surgery). Patient follow-up occurred at discharge, 30 days, 6, 12, 18 and 24 mont hs and yearly thereafter through 5 y ears. An independent Echocardiography Core Laboratory (ECL) assessed MR severity and ot her echocardiographic par ameters at baseline and follow-up. The trial was in tended to demonstrate superior ity of safety balanced agai nst reduced effectiveness of the MitraClip device when compared to mitral valve surgery. All patients have complet ed 5 years of follow- up and the study is now closed. The trial enrolled 279 patients: 184 in the Device group and 95 in the Cont rol group. Of these, 178 patients in the Device group underwent the MitraClip procedure and 80 patients in the Control group underwent mitral valve surgery. The trial met both pr imary safety and effect iveness endpoints. There were no intra-procedural deaths. Among patients who underwent the MitraClip procedure in the Device group ( MitraClip patients), a device was implanted in 89 % of patients. The procedure time av eraged approximately 3 hours, patients were hemodynamically stable during the procedure, and the average length of hospital stay was less than 3 days. In comparison, the average length of hospital stay for pat ients undergoing surgery in the Control group (surgery patients) was days. A large majority (94.9%) of MitraClip patients were dischar ged home without home healthcare. In compar ison, 71.3% of surgery patients were discharged home without home healthcare. A majority of MitraClip device patients (77%) experienced reduction in MR severity to 2+ or less at discharge, while 100% of patients undergoing mitra l valve surgery in the Control group experienced reduction in MR severity to 2+ or less. Patients who underwent the MitraClip procedure experienced a 30-day majo r adverse event rate (composite of death, myocardial infarction (M I), re -operation for failed surgical repair or replacement, non-elective cardiovascular surgery for adverse ev ents, stroke, renal failure, deep wound infection, ventilation for greater than 48 hours, GI complicati on requiring surgery, new onset of permanent atrial fibrillation, septicemia and major bleeding complication) of 7.9% versus 50% in patients who underwent mitr al valve surgery in the Control group. Exclud ing the most common event of major bleeding complication, MitraClip device patients still experienced a lower ma jor adverse event rate (4.5%) than surgery patients (11.3%) (p=0.057). Through 30 days, MitraClip patients experienced a lowe r site-reported adverse event rate than surgery patients in the following cat egories: cardiac rhythm disorders (atrial arrhythmias, bradyarrhythmia, ventricular arrhythmia), congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, anemia, infections, neurologic events and respiratory events. At 30 days, MitraClip patients experienced a higher event rate than surgery patient s in the following categories: atrial septal defect, myocardial ischemia , residual or recurrent MR, single leaflet device attachment (SLDA), gastrointestinal bleed, and vascular complic ations such as hematoma, bleed or bruising. Beyond 30 days through 5 years, site-reported adverse events occu rred at a low rate in both MitraClip and surgery patients and ther e was no signal for an el evated adverse event rate in either group."
25,page_25,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 26 from 61 Through 5 years, ther e was only one co nfirmed case of mitral stenosis (0.6%) report ed in patients implanted with the MitraClip device. Through 5 years, no MitraClip device embolizations have occurred. SLDAs occurred at a lower rate (6.3%) than that observed in the EVERE ST I trial (10.2%). A majority of the SLDAs were detected early (within 30 days post- MitraClip procedure). There was no difference in mortality rates between patients treat ed in either group dur ing the entire 5-year follow-up period. Freedom from mort ality at 12 months, 24 months, 3 y ears, 4 years and 5 years was 93.7%, 90.0%, 87.5%, 83.4% and 81. 2% respectively in MitraClip patients, and 92.3%, 89.6%, 85.3%, 82.3%, and 79.0%, respectively in surgery patients. Therefore at 5 years, the MitraClip device continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile and does not present any long-term safety concerns. Freedom from mitral valve surgery in MitraClip patients at 12 months, 24 months, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years was 78.9%, 78.2%, 77.6%, 76.0%, and 74.3%, res pectively, and freedom from re-operation in surgery patients was 97.4%, 96.0%, 94.4%, 94.4%, and 92.5%, re spectively. Weibull estimates of freedom from death, mitral valve surgery and MR > 2+ at 12 months, 24 months, 3 y ears, and 4 years was 60.8%, 55.4%, 52.0%, and 49.5%, respectively, in MitraClip patients; and freedom from death, re-operation and MR >2+ was 89.0%, 82.6%, 77.6%, and 73.3%, respectively, in su rgery patients. While ther e was an initial drop in freedom from death, mitral valv e surgery and MR > 2+ due to MitraClip patients undergoing mitral valve surgery within 12 months of the MitraClip procedure, these patients did not experience any worse deterioration in durability than surgery patients beyond 12 months. Significant and meaningf ul clinical benefits were observed in both MitraClip nd surgery patients, which were sustained through 5 years:  MR reduction to 2+ or less at 5 year s was in 82.1% of MitraClip patients and 97.6% of surgery patients  Reduction in left ventricular end diastolic volume and dimension was observed in both MitraClip and surgery patients, which wa s sustained through 5 years  Improvement in NYHA Functional Class wa s demonstrated in both gr oups, with 91.5% of MitraClip patients and 97.6% of surgery patients free from NYHA Functional Class III or IV symptoms at 5 years The results of the EVEREST II RCT dem onstrate the continued sa fety, durability of effe ctiveness and clinical benefit of the MitraClip device through 5 years. These results are co nsistent with the ex pectation of superior safety and reduced effectiveness of the MitraClip device when compared to mitr al valve surgery. These results support an overall favorabl e risk to benefit profile of the MitraClip device through 5 years. EVEREST II High Risk Regi stry Design and Results The EVEREST II High Risk Regi stry is a single-arm prospective, mult i-center clinical trial enrolling high surgical risk patients with moderate-to-s evere (3+) or severe (4+) MR. Pati ents were considered high surgical"
26,page_26,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 27 from 61 risk if either their Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) predict ed operative mortality risk was ≥ 12%, or the surgeon investigator determine d the patient to be high risk due to the presence of pre-specif ied risk factors. After undergoing the MitraClip procedure, patients were followed at discharge, 30 days, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months and yearly thereafter through 5 years. All patients have complete d the required 5 years of follow-up and the study is now closed. An in dependent Echocardiograpy Core Laboratory (ECL) assessed MR severity and other echocardiographic paramet ers at baseline and follow-up. A total of 78 patients were enroll ed in the EVEREST II High Risk Regi stry. The device was implanted in 96.2% of patients. There were no intra-procedural deaths. The proc edure time averaged approximately 3 hours, patients were hemodynamically stable during the procedure, and the average length of hospital stay was less than 4 days. A majority (75. 6%) of these high surgical risk patients were discharged home without home healthcare. A majority of patie nts (71.8%) experienced reduction in MR severi ty to 2+ or less at discharge post- MitraClip procedure. The 30-day operative mortality for mitral valve replacement (using STS version 2.52) was 7.7%, which was statistically significantly lower than the predicted surgical mortality. The trial thus met the pre-specified primary safety endpoint. This rate wa s comparable to the observed mort ality at 30 days in the Concurrent Control (8.3%). Major adverse events at 30 days occurred at a rate ( 26.9%) consistent with their co- morbidities, with transfusions ≥ 2 units of blood contributing the majo rity of events. At 12 months, freedom from death in the High Risk Registry patie nts was higher (75.4%) than that observed in the Concurrent Control (55.3%). SLDAs occurred at a low rate (1.3%). MR reduction to 2+ or less in this high surgical risk population was su stained in 75.0% of patients through 5 years. For this high surg ical risk population with limited options to treat MR, safe reduction of MR is clinically meaningful, as observed in the following endpoints: 45% reduction in the 12-month rate of hospitalizati on for heart failure post- treatment compare with the 12-month rate prior to MitraClip intervention Reduction in left ventricular end di astolic volume and dimension, and left ventricular end systolic volume, which was sustained through 5 years NYHA Functional Class was impr oved from approximately 90% of patients in NYHA Functional Class III or IV at baselin e to 83.7% free from NYHA Functional Class III or IV sympt oms at 5 years. The results of the EVEREST II High Risk Registry demons trate continued sa fety, durab ility of effectiveness and clinical benefit of the MitraClip device through 5 years. These result s support an overall favorable risk to benefit profile of the MitraClip device in high surgical risk patients through 5 years. EVEREST II REALISM Stud y Design and Results The objective of the EVEREST II REALISM Continued Access Registry was to collect data on the use of the minimally-invasive catheter-based MitraClip device under “real- world” conditions in high risk and non-high risk patients with moderate-to-severe (3+) or severe (4+) chronic MR. REALISM was a prospective, multi- center, Continued Access Registry. The study enrolled patients in two arms: the high risk and non-high risk arms."
27,page_27,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 28 from 61 Eligibility for the Non-High Risk arm was the same as for the EVEREST II RCT and that for the High Risk arm was the same as for the HRR. Enrollment in the Continued Access REALISM study was initiated on Januar y 22, 2009. A total of 899 patients (628 High Risk, 271 Non-High Risk) were enrolled and treated in t he EVEREST II REALISM Continued Access Study. Enrollment in the No n-High Risk arm of the study conc luded on April 14, 2011 and enrollment in the High Risk arm concluded on December 19, 2013. In the United States, patients that did not meet the eligibil ity criteria for REALIS M were treated under FDA’s special IDE for Compassi onate Use and Emergency Use. A total of 59 Compassionate Use patients and 7 Emergency Use patients have been tr eated under these IDE provisions between December 14, 2010 and February 22, 2013. As expected, the high risk patients had a higher incidence of significant co-morbiditi es than the non-high risk patients. Patients enrolled in t he REALISM High Risk arm had similar baseline characteristics and co- morbidities as those enrolled in the High Risk Regi stry. Although patients enroll ed in the REALISM Non-High Risk arm under the same eligibility criteria as the EVEREST II RCT, REALISM Non-High Risk patients were older on average by 7 years than the EVEREST II RCT patients. Mortality and major adverse events at 30 days and 12 months in the REALISM High Risk and Non-High Risk arms wer e consistent with the arm (h igh risk vs non-high risk) in which they were enrolled. Sa fety results of the REALISM study provide further evidence that the “real-world” use of the MitraClip device continues to perform as expected based on the EVEREST II Random ized Controlled Trial an d High Risk Registry. COAPT Randomized C ontrolled Trial (RCT) Design and Results The COAPT Trial is a prospective, randomized, parallel ‐controlled, multicenter c linical evaluation of the MitraClip Device for the treatment of clinically significant FMR in sympt omatic HF subjects who are treated per SoC and who have been determined by the site’s local heart team as not appr opriate for MV surgery. COAPT enrollment was limited to a ma ximum of 100 investigational sites. During the enrollment phase, 614 subjects were randomized at 78 investig ational sites. An additional 51 roll ‐in subjects were treated by operators at 34 sites without recent or prior experi ence with the MitraClip Device, in order to gain hands ‐on experience before randomizing subjects in the trial. Patients were randomiz ed in a 1:1 ratio to the MitraClip Device or to Control group (no device). Randomization was stratified by study site and cardiomyopathy etiology (i.e. ischemic or non ‐ischemic). Subjects were elderly, with a mean age of 74.5 ‐years in roll ‐In subjects and 72.2‐years in randomized subjects. Females comprised 37.3% of roll ‐In subjects and 36.0 % of r andomized subjects. Baseline NHYA Functional Class was predominantly II/III. Mean LVEF was 36.7% in the roll ‐In cohort and 31.3% in the randomized cohort. The STS mortality risk scores reflect a population of highly co morbid subjects with a mean replacement score of 11.1% and 8.2% for roll ‐in and randomized subjects, respectively, and a mean repair score of 7.9% and 5.8% for roll ‐in and randomized subjects, respectively. Majority of subjects in both"
28,page_28,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 29 from 61 the roll‐In and randomized cohorts presented with prior MI , CAD, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, arrhythmia, and renal disease. Diabetes and history of percutaneous transluminal cor onary angioplasty (PTCA) we re present in over one third of subjects, with COPD additionally present in over one ‐third of roll ‐In subjects. Approximately half of the subjects in the roll ‐In cohort and 40% in the r andomized cohort had prior cor onary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Follow‐up visits were required at 1 week (phone contact), 30‐ days, 6‐months, 12 ‐months, 18 months, 24 ‐ months, and annually thereafter through 5 ‐years. The COAPT 3‐ year data was recently pres ented at the 2019 Transcatheter (TCT) conference at San Francisco by Dr. Michael Mack with the August 2, 2019 data cut ‐off date. Consistent with the 2 ‐year outcomes, the patients in the dev ice (MitraClip + GDMT) arm cont inued to see significant benefit over the control (GDMT on ly) arm in the COAPT study. Overall 58 out of 312 GDMT patients (18.6%) had crossed over to the MitraClip arm at this timepoint (crossover was allowed after 2 years of follow up per protocol). Primary effective ness of all hospitalizations for HF were 169 in 95 patients in device arm vs 299 in 158 patients in control arm at 2 years (NNT=3.1 [95% CI 1.9, 8.2]. Same tr end was observed with 220 HFH in 114 patients in device arm vs 378 in 196 patients in cont rol arm at 3 years (NNT=3.0 [95% CI 2. 4, 4.0] per the ITT analysis. The benefit to the patients in the device arm was even more pronounced if the control patients who crossed over to the devic e arm were censored at the time of crossover (NNT=2.8 [95% CI 2.2, 3.7] at 3 years. All ‐cause mortality or HF hospitaliz ation had similar trend with ev ent rate of 58.8% for device arm and 88.1% for control arm at 3 year s (NNT = 3.4 [95% CI 2.7, 4.6], aga in more pronounced with censoring of the control patients at the ti me of crossover (NNT=3.5 [95% CI 2.8, 4.8] at 3 years. The freedom from device related comp lications (primary safe ty endpoint) did not show any worsening in the 2‐3 year period and was identical to t he 2 year outcomes of 1.4% for the true device related complications (SLDA, device embolization, endocarditis/mitral stenos is requiring surgery, or any other device related complication requiring surgery). T he progressive heart failure requiring LVAD or heart transplant however increased from 3.8% to 7.4% from 2 ‐3‐year period owing to the very aged population with multiple comorbidities. The quality of life as assessed by ANCOVA analysis of the KCCQ summary score for complete 2 ‐year data showed an improvement of 7.8±2.3 po ints for the device arm compared to decline of 12.1±2.3 points for the control arm. Similarly, 6MWD out comes showed a decline of 55±10.8 poi nts for the device arm vs decline of 93.5 ±10.9 for the control ar m. Adverse event rates were consistently low and strongly in favor of the device arm. Overall, the data c oncluded that at 36 months transcatheter mitral leaf let approximation with the MitraClip was safe, provided durable reduction in MR, reduced the rate of HF hosp italizations, and improved survival, QOL and functional capa city compared to GDMT alone. Based on this clinical evidence clin ical benefit of MitraClip Syste m continues to demonstr ate significant benefit to MR patients and is suitable for use in the study for safe ty and efficacy in the Russian population. 2.2.5 Description of th e Control Devices N/A."

No additional follow–up will be requ ired or data recorded from subjects once withdrawn from the clinical investigation, except for t he status (deceased/alive). Howeve r, if a subject withdraws from the investigati on due to problems related to the safety or performance of the device under investigation, t he investigator s hall ask for the subject's permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of t he clinical investigation. Lost-to-Follow-up If the subject misses two consecutiv e scheduled follow-up time points and the attempts at contacting the subject detailed below are uns uccessful, then the subject is considered lost-to-follow- up. Site personnel shall"
37,page_37,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 38 from 61 make all reasonable efforts to locate and communicate with the subject (and docum ent these efforts in the source documents), including the foll owing, at each contact time point: A minimum of two telephone calls on different days over the specif ied follow-up wi ndows to contact the subject should be recorded in t he source documentation, including date, time and initials of site personnel trying to make contact. If these attempts are unsuc cessful, a letter (certified if applicab le) should be sent to the subject. If a subject misses one or more non-c onsecutive follow-up contact time points, it will be considered a missed visit. The subject may t hen return for subsequent visi ts. If the subject misses two consecutive time points and the above-mentioned attempts at communic ating with the subject are unsuccessful, the subject will be considered lost-to-follow-up. Note: Telephone contact with General Practiti oner, non-clinical investigation ca rdiologist or re lative without the presence of the subject or indire ct documentation obtained via discharge letters will not be considered as subject contact. 5.7 Number of Subjects Sixteen (16) subjects will be register ed in the clinical investigation. 5.8 Total Expected Duration of the Clinical Investigation The expected duration of enrollment is 1 month. The expected duration of each su bject’s participation is 1 month, including the scheduled visits and data collection for this clinical investigat ion that will occur at 10 days and 30 days. Subjects will be exited from the trial at the conclusion of thei r 30-day follow-up visit. Therefore, the total duration of the clinical investigation is expected to be 2 months. 6.0 TREATMENT AND EVALU ATION OF ENDPOINTS 6.1 Baseline/Pre-procedure/Pre-treatment Transthoracic & Transesophageal Echocardiograms to Confirm Subject Eligibility Eligibility assessments based on transthoracic echocar diogram (TTE) must be pe rformed based on images obtained within 90 days prior to MitraClip NT procedure. Eligibility assessments based on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) mu st be performed based on im ages obtained within 180 da ys prior to procedure. Informed consent must be obtained prior to any non-st andard of care assessments for trial eligibility. Baseline Assessments Once the patient has given the informed consent and was found to be suitab le for inclusion in the study, the baseline assessment will be performed. If collected with in past 30 days, the screening assessments may be used for the baseline information of the patient. Medical history Physical examinati on of the patient Evaluation by Local Site Heart Team"

Similarly, discontin ue dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitors for a sufficient du ration to ensure restoration of normal coagulation. Subjects may be treated with heparin during this period at the tr eating physician’s discretion. If heparin is used, it must be discontinued ≥ 4 hours prior to the MitraClip NT procedure for intravenous un fractionated heparin (UFH). Administer a dose of ticlopid ine, at a dosage determined by the Investigator, either just prior to, or immediately following the proced ure. If a subject is already treated with other th ienopyridine antiplate let drug other than ticlopidine, it is not needed to r eplace the drug with ticlopidine. Subject Preparation Prior to the MitraClip NT procedure, subjects must be assessed to ensure there is no significant change in the subject’s overall condition (e.g., stroke, MI, active infection, endocarditis, he modynamic instability, etc.) that would preclude treatment. If the subject has experienced any significant change that would preclude treatment, the subject must be treated and reassessed for the clinical investigation. Such subjects are not considered registered. Prior to the MitraClip NT procedure, baseline activat ed clotting ti me (ACT) must be determined following transseptal puncture for the MitraClip NT procedure. ACT and hepar in administration (or alternative anticoagulation therapy ) must be recorded. Subjects must be prepared for the procedure as per t he institution’s st andard practice for a percutaneous procedure, general ane sthesia, and TEE. MitraClip NT Procedure"
39,page_39,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 40 from 61 Refer to IFU including stor age and handling requirements, preparation for use, pre-use checks of safety and performance, and precautions to be taken after use. Subjects are required to undergo an additional transesophagea l (TEE) echocar diogram within 3 days prior to the procedure to rule out the pres ence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation. This echocardiogram may be performed immediately pr eceding initiation of the MitraClip NT procedure. If a thrombus is identified, the subject may be pharmaco logically treated to resolv e the thrombus and, if successful, the subject may be reassessed for the clinical investigation. Femoral vein transseptal catheterizat ion will be co mpleted in accordance wi th the Instructions For Use (IFU). Subjects will be considered register ed upon femoral vein puncture for transseptal access in preparation for the MitraClip NT System insertion. Following transseptal crossing, administer intravenous heparin (or alternative anticoagulation therapy; e. g., bivalirudin) in accordance with standard hospital practice. Maintain an ACT (activated clotting time) of > 250 seconds throughout the procedure. The Steerable Guide Catheter (Guide) is inserted into the femoral vein and advanced across the transs eptal puncture. Fluoroscopic and ec hocardiographic guidance will be used during the procedure to visualize the devices and the vasculature and cardiac anatomy. For subjects with r enal dysfunction, intravenous contrast should not be used during the proc edure unless absolu tely necessary. The Guide is positioned over the mitral valve and the MitraClip NT System is inserted into the Guide and proper ly positioned over the mitral valve. The MitraClip NT Delivery Catheter is advanced until the MitraClip NT device emerges from the tip of the Gu ide into the left atrium. Manipulati ons of the catheter tip (via the control knobs on the handl es) will continue in the left atrium until the MitraClip NT device is properly oriented perpendicular to the line of coaptation of the mitral valve. The MitraClip NT device is opened and advanced across the mitral valve into the vent ricle then pulled back to grasp the le aflets. Two-dimensional and/or 3- dimensional echocardiography and color flow Doppler are used to evaluate th e presence of a double orifice, leaflet insertion, MitraClip NT device position and re sidual MR. If the MitraClip NT device is not positioned properly or MR has not been a dequately reduced, addi tional grasping may be attempted and the MitraClip NT device may be inverted in the left atrium as required for additional grasping a ttempts. When placement is successful, the MitraClip NT device is closed and deployed from the Delivery Catheter. The catheters are then removed from the subject. If MR reduction is not adequate, an additional MitraClip NT device may be placed at the implanter’s discretion, depending on patient clinical condition, mitral va lve area and mean Mitral Valve Gradient. A maximum of two (2) MitraClip NT devices may be implanted in subjects registered in this trial. Post-MitraClip NT Procedure Immediately following the MitraClip NT procedure, heparin (or alternativ e anticoagulatio n therapy; e.g., bivalirudin) must be discon tinued and the ACT shou ld be monitored in accordance with hospital protocols. Vascular sheaths should be removed according to usual hospital practice."
40,page_40,"MitraClip NT System Clinical Investigati on Plan Version: 1.0 Page 41 from 61 Administer additional intr avenous doses of antibiotics at approximately 6 and 12 hour s (or per institutional guidelines) after the completion of the procedure. Subjects will receive standard post- cardiac catheterization procedure care as judged appropriate by t he Investigator. Subject weight, blood pressure, heart rate and temperat ure must be obtained prior to subject discharge from the hospital. At discharge, each subj ect implanted with a MitraClip N T device(s) must be provided an Implant Identification Card. An Implant Identific ation Card is included in the package with each MitraClip NT System. The subject must be instructed to keep this Impl ant Identification Card on their person at all times. The serial number of all implanted MitraClip NT device(s) must be recorded on t he Implant Identification Card. The Investigator must instruct all subjects who receive the MitraClip NT device of the need for prophylaxis for endocarditis, as recommended in th e guidelines for the pr evention and treatment of infective endocarditis. Subjects must be instructed to notify t he Investigator or the subject’s prim ary care physician in the event that a procedure recommended by this Gui deline is planned, so that prophylactic antibio tics can be prescribed. Post- MitraClip NT procedure anticoagulation is recommended per t he Investigator’s discr etion as follows: 1.Reinitiate warfarin, dabigatran or factor Xa inhibitor (if disc ontinued for the MitraClip NT procedure) at pre-procedure levels or as appropriate. If chronic oral antic oagulation is used, then aspirin and ticlopidene use are not recommended, but are allowed if otherwise indicated for other conditions. 2.If chronic oral anticoagula tion is not used, it is strongly reco mmended that either daily ticlopidence and/or aspirin (81 mg) is administered for 6 months or longer. If aspirin is to be used, a dose of 325 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA ) may be administered either pre- or immediately post- MitraClip NT procedure followed by 81 mg per day for 6 months or longer per Institutional standar ds and at the discretion of the Investigator. Follow-up for All Subjects Clinical follow-up will be performed at the follo wing intervals for all enrolled subjects, regardless of whether a MitraClip NT device was successfully implanted: Discharge post- MitraClip NT procedure 10 days follow-up office visit (t his visit must be conducted even if subject is in hospital); 30 days. Withdrawal or Discontinuation All subjects should continue to be monitored and treated per applicable standards of ca re consistent with the subject’s condition. Subj ects implanted with the MitraClip NT device must also be evaluated for device integrity. The follow up visits (discharge, 10 day, and 30 day) will include followi ng assessments.

There may be risks related to the devic e under investigation that are unknown at present. Likewise, the exact frequency of the risk may be unknown. A risk management assessment was carr ied out and documented in the framework of the main plan and risk management report, including: 1. Hazard analysis for each device; 2. Purpose of the device and char acteristics affecting safety; 3. Potential hazards; 4. Potential clinical harm and asso ciated serious consequences; 5. Ratio Analysis of clin ical risk and benefit. An analysis of the types and conseque nces of failures was developed for assessing the risks associated with a medical device in order to determine whether it can be used for its intended purpose. As part of the procedure, the manufacturer identified the hazards associated with the use, design and procedures. Hazards with an unacc eptable level of risk have been redu ced to an acceptable level by changing the design, test ing, and other mutually acceptable measures. Currently, the manufacturer uses a proce dure to assess the severity of clin ical risks on a scale from minor to critical risks. If unacceptable levels of the risk index were identified, measures were needed to reduce the risks. Based on the analysis, all identified and foreseeable hazards and associated risks were identified and reduced to acceptable levels. The requirements for risk management comply with the e ssential requirements of An nex I to Council Directive 93/42 / EEC on medical devices."
