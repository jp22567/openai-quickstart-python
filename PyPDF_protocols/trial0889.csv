This is a single arm trial. Study design: This is an open label, multicenter, efficacy pilot study. Key Efficacy Assessments: 1. The primary endpoint is the annualized relapse rate (ARR) from the time of cessation of natalizumab treatment . 2. A key secondary endpoint is freedom of relapse at 12 months . 3. A key secondary endpoint is the number of new/enlarging T2 lesions on magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI). 4. A secondary endpoint is the number of gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing lesions on MRI. 5. An exploratory endpoint is the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). 6. An exploratory endpoint is retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness assessment by optic coherence tomography (OCT). 7. An exploratory outcome will be the assessment of quality of life (Q oL) measures by a pre-defined, self-administered testing battery. Key Safety Assessments 1. To minimize the risk of transitioning MS patients from natalizumab to alemtuzumab who already have progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML), all enrolled patients will undergo a brain MRI within 14 days prior to receiving alemtuzumab. 2. To minimize the risk of herpetic infections while on alemtuzumab, anti -viral prophylaxis for herpetic viral infections should be administered on the first day of each treatment course and continued for a minimum of 2 months following treatment, or until the CD4 lymphocyte count is > 200 cells/microliter, whichever occurs later. 3. There may be an exaggerated cytokine response in some patients. Thus, patients will be monitored and management based on the treating physician’s best judgement from the final dose of natalizumab to the end of the first course of alemtuzumab treatment. 4. Each relapse will be treated with pulse corticosteroids as per best clinical judgment."

Two or more confirmed clinical relapses during the trial would allow rescue therapy as per best clinical judgment. 6. Five or more Gd + lesions at the 6 month MRI assessment over the baseline assessment will result in a follow -up scan after 60 days and will count as one relapse. Should a confirmed clinical relapse occur within the 60 day period, it will still count as a single relapse. 7. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted using intent -to-treat (ITT) principles for efficacy to ensure that safety considerations and withdrawals have not altered results. 8. Patients who withdraw from study treatment will be observed as mandated by REMS. Data analysis: The sample size of 40 patients was chosen to obtain a clinically meaningful result as defined by neurologists. All outcome measures at 12 months prior to natalizumab treatment, on natalizumab treatment, and on alemtuzumab will be assessed and compared. We will control secondary and exploratory endpoints for multiple comparisons by testing sequentially the proportion of relapse- free patients, EDSS change, and T2 -hyperintense lesion volume change. We will analyze the proportion of patients who are relapse- free with a proportional hazards model. We will analyze changes from baseline in ED SS at the pre- defined time points with a mixed model for repeated measures. We will make treatment comparisons of all available 3 month assessments with a non- parametric test for repeated measures. We will analyze changes in T2- hyperintense lesion volume, and RNFL thickness with a ranked AN COVA model. We will analyze proportions of patients with new or enlarged T2- hyperintense or Gd + lesions with logic regression."

A pathological hallmark of this disorder is the infiltration of immune- competent leukocytes into the brain and spinal cord. Natalizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha (α)4 chain of the integrin very late activation antigen (VLA) -4. Natalizumab is currently considered the most effective approved therapy in reducing clinical and paraclinical MS disease activity. Our group has made several novel observations with regard to the pharmacodynamic properties of natalizumab: (1) Compared to controls, natalizumab- treated MS patients had significantly fewer white blood cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, CD19 + B cells, and CD138 + plasma cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); (2) CD4 +:CD8 + ratios in the CSF of MS patients treated with natalizumab were reversed, and not statistically different from those in HIV -infected controls; (3) elevated serum anti -Human Herpesvirus (HHV) -6 IgG, and HHV -6A DNA were detected in the CSF of a subset of patients on natalizumab therapy. In summary, these data indicate that natalizumab therapy substantially alters the composition of immune -competent cells in the CSF of patients with MS. Since its first approval for patients with MS in November 2004, more than 200 patients treated with natalizumab have been diagnosed with PML, a CNS infection with the polyomavirus JC. PML is typically observed in the setting of prolonged and severe immunosuppression, most commonly in p atients infected with HIV. Natalizumab is currently administered monthly as monotherapy to approximately 100,000 patients with MS, and treatment is recommended to continue indefinitely without treatment interruptions. 1.1 Biological rationale for proposed trial Natalizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody against alpha4-integrin that was first approved in November 2004 for patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) based on the results of two phase III trials (1 , 2). Natalizumab blocks the egress of leukocytes from the peripheral blood into the CNS. In the short term, the therapeutic benefits are likely due to its effect on lymphocytes as shown by our laboratory and other investigators (3-6 ). Long- term, the number of myeloid cells that serve as antigen presenting cells (APC) in perivascular spaces is likely also substantially reduced (7 ). Despite its tremendous efficacy, there are two observations that have limited the use of natalizumab in patients with MS."

This potential side effect has substantially limited the use of an effective therapy. An algorithm was recently developed to estimate PML incidence in MS patients considering or receiving natalizumab based on duration of natalizumab treatment (1-24 or 25-48 months), prior immunosuppr essant use (yes or no), and anti -JCV antibody status (positive or negative) (8 ). Based upon the two established ri sk factors for PML, PML risk was lowest in patients treated with natalizumab for 1- 24 months without prior immunosuppressant use, (0.19 cases per 1000 patients), and greatest in those with both risk factors, natalizumab treatment for 25-48 months and prior immunosuppressant use (4.3 cases per 1000). When anti -JCV antibody status was included as a third risk factor, PML risk was lowest in patients who were anti -JCV antibody negative (0.11 per 1000), and highest in patients with all three factors, (11 per 1000). The most recent data indicate that MS patients on natalizumab with all three risk factors appear have a risk of 1:44 to develop PML (9 , 10). 1.1.2 Disease-reactivation after cessation of natalizumab therapy While natalizumab is a tremendously effective therapy, disease activity returns 3 to 6 months after treatment discontinuation in a predictable manner. The best data in this regard were generated by O’Connor et al, who analyzed clinical relapses in 1,866 patients, and gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions in 341 patients from the AFFIRM, SENTINEL, and GLANCE studies of natalizumab, and their respective safety extension studies ( 11). Annualized relapse rates and Gd lesions both increased shortly after natalizumab interruption and peaked between 4 and 7 months. A consistent return of disease activity was observed regardless of overall natalizumab exposure, whether or not patients received alternative MS therapies, and in patients with highly active MS disease. The return of disease activity may be explained by its biological activities. Leukcoytes are sequestered out of the CNS into the peripheral blood, where they assume a more inflammatory phenotype. Krumbholz et al. demonstrated that natalizumab therapy increased CD19 + mature B cells in peripheral blood 2-3-fold more than that of other lymphocytes and monocytes compared to pre-treatment levels (12). The increase of immature CD19+CD10+ pre- B cells in peripheral blood was 7.4-fold. This pattern remained stable during treatment for up to 16 months. Kivisakk et al showed that the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing interferon gamma (IFNγ), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin (IL) -17 upon anti -CD3 stimulation increased 6 months after initiation of natalizumab treatment and remained elevated throughout"
11,page_11,"Sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy trial Confidential Version 1.0 11 STU112016- 060, Stuve, Form A, Mod_10, 06 -14-19 (1) 11 the follow -up (13). The frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing CD25, HLA -DR, and CCR6 ex vivo was increased at one or more time points during treatment. Our lab showed in a cohort of 23 patients that return of clinical disease activity in patients who stopped taking natalizumab correlated with the re-constitution of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (5 ). 1.2 Alemtuzumab in RRMS Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal therapeutic antibody that rapidly depletes CD52+ cells. Alemtuzumab is effective in ameliorating MS disease activity. In the CARE- MS I phase III trial, a 55 % relapse rate reduction with alemtuzumab (12 mg/d) over interferon-beta (IFNβ) was observed for alemtuzumab treated patients after 24 months (14). Significantly more (78 %) alemtuzumab treated patients remained relapse-free at month 24 compared with 59 % of IFNb1a-treated patients, which equates to a 55 % risk reduction. In the CARE -MS II phase III trial a 49 % reduction in relapse rate was observed in patients treated with alemtuzumab (12 mg/d) compared with those treated with IFNβ -1a over the two years (15). Significantly more alemtuzumab treated patients remained relapse-free at month 24 compared with IFNβ -1a treated patients. While these data provide a rational for the use of alemtuzumab in patients with MS, many experts considered the efficacy of this agent in the two phase III studies as perhaps somewhat disappointing. Again, its biological effects may explain this incomplete treatment effect of alemtuzumab. Mainly, there is currently no evidence that alemtuzumab has any biological effect in the CNS. Thus, the number and function of autoimmune-prone lymphocytes and pre-inflammatory myeloid cells that reside in the brain and spinal cord is not reduced. 1.2.1 Immune-reconstitution after alemtuzumab therapy in MS MS is considered an autoimmune disorder of the CNS. However, an autoantigen has not been identified. Thus, the creation of peripheral tolerance will best be inferred by the disease status. Recent data from an Immune Tolerance Network (ITN) trial that tested autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in patients with very aggressive MS (HALT trial) showed that the reconstitution of the T cell receptor repertoire predicts treatment responses: • Patients who failed treatment had a significantly less diverse TCR (CD4 + and CD8+) at 2 months post-transplant than “others” • Treatment effectively reduced dominant baseline CD4+ TCR clones, did not reduce dominant CD8 TCR clones • Patients who recovered CD8+ T cells at year 1 had a less diverse CD8+ TCR repertoire • The reconstituted CD8+ T cell repertoire was dominated by large clonal expansions"
12,page_12,"Sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy trial Confidential Version 1.0 12 STU112016- 060, Stuve, Form A, Mod_10, 06 -14-19 (1) 12 • There was up to a 100% “renewal” (ablated new) of the CD4+ T cell repertoire; there was less renewal within the CD8+ T cell repertoire • Treatment resulted in a “new” Top 100 CD4+ TCR repertoire at 2 months post- transplant Immune-reconstitution after alemtuzumab therapy is very similar to that after autologous HSCT. This is perhaps not surprising, as in both treatment paradigms there is almost a complete re-constitution of the lymphocyte compartment that is driven by autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells. As stated above, alemtuzumab targets CD52, which is a 12-amino-acid glycosylated GPI-bound membrane protein (16, 17). CD52 is expressed on a number of cells derived from the lympho-monocytic cell lineage, including T and B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells and most monocytes and macrophages. By contrast, neutrophils and precursors cells of the hematopoietic lineage do not express CD52 (18-20). The exact biological function of CD52 is not fully understood; CD52 binding may induce T cell activation, and CD52 may be a stimulatory co -factor required for regulatory T cells (Treg) ( 18, 19). Alemtuzumab depletes CD52 + cells through ADCC and likely also through activation of the complement cascade (20- 23). Cellular depletion is initiated rapidly resulting in almost complete disappearance of CD52+ cells from the circulation shortly after alemtuzumab administration. Experimentally, complement -mediated cell lysis of leukemic B cells occurs within 1-4 hours after addition of alemtuzumab in vitro (24 ). Lympho-monocytic cells in the periphery are eventually repopulated from pools of stem cells and certain progenitor cells that do not constitutively express CD52. Monocytes and B cells reach pre-alemtuzumab levels in the peripheral blood approximately three to six months after treatment, with B cell levels exceeding baseline levels by 124-165% (21, 22, 25, 26). T cells repopulate considerably slower; CD8 + T cells reach baseline levels only after a median of 30 months, and CD4+ T cells after a median of 61 months (21). The lower limits of normal for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are reached earlier with medians of 12 and 11 months, respectively (27 ). It is particularly noteworthy that Tregs repopulate distinctly before CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in their specific enrichment in the peripheral blood (21 , 26). 1.3 A potentiation of efficacy through sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy Natalizumab treatment sequesters leukocytes out of the CNS into the peripheral blood. Immediate sequential alemtuzumab therapy will deplete these cells more completely than alemtuzumab monotherapy, and prevent reactivation of disease activity previously treated with natalizumab. Thus, we hypothesize that sequential natalizumab – alemtuzumab therapy will prevent disease activation after cessation of natalizumab, and will provide sustained disease"

Each participant will be assigned a unique identification number and these numbers, rather than names, will be used to collect, store, and report participant information. 5.4 Deviations Any protocol deviations that impact patient safety will be reported within 7 days to the principal investigator and the IRB. Deviations from the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be minimized via eligibility criteria checks prior to initiation of alemtuzumab therapy . 5.5 Premature patient withdrawal Patients may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: • Withdrawal of the informed consent • Lost to follow- up • Withdrawal at the investigator's discretion Patients should be withdrawn at any time if the investigator concludes that it would be in the patients' best interest for any reason. Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be considered withdrawn if they state an intention to withdraw, or fail to return for visits, or become lost to follow up for any other reason. Protocol violations should not lead to patient withdrawal unless they indicate a significant risk to t he patient's safety. If premature patient withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must determine the primary reason for a patient's premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on a CRF. For patients who are lost to follow -up (i.e., those patients whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to withdrawal), the investigator should show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the patient, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. In the case of death, a patient will be considered withdrawn. Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will not be replaced."

The principal investigator (PI) has adopted the use of the National Cancer Institute's manual Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE; published June 10, 2003) for application in adverse event reporting. The purpose of using the CTCAE system is to provide a standard language to describe toxicities, to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data, and to facilitate the assessmen t of the clinical significance of all adverse events. The CTCAE provides the following grades and descriptions in the CTCAE manual (v3.0). Adverse events should be recorded and graded 1 to 5 according to the CTCAE grades provided below: Grade 1 = Mild adverse event Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event Grade 4 = Life- threatening or disabling adverse event Grade 5 = Death Note: In contrast to the CTCAE guidelines provided the National Cancer I nstitute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (published June 10, 2003) all adverse events are to be reported and graded whether or not they are related to disease progression or treatment. 6.4.12 Relationship to study treatment The relat ionship or attribution between an adverse event and an investigational product is determined by the site investigator and recorded on the appropriate case report form and/or SAE reporting form. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) provides the following descriptors and definitions (one category classified as unrelated [Code 1] and 4 categories classified as related [Codes 2- 5]) for assigning an attribution to each adverse event (for most recent update of terminology see http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf ). The investigator's determination of drug- relatedness (attribution) for each adverse event should be recorded in the source documentation. 6.4.13 Serious adverse event reporting The following process for reporting a serious adverse event will ensure appropriate compliance with the ICH guidelines (http://www.ich.org/products/guidelines/quality/article/quality - guidelines.html) .

In addition to telephone reporting, these events must be entered on the Serious Adverse Event Form (MedWatch) . 6.4.14 Study drug discontinuation At the initial clinic visit, study patients will be made aware of potential side effects of alemtuzumab. At each patient visit, patients will be inquired about any of these side effects. Should it be felt by the patient and the examining physician that these side effects warrant discontinuation of study drug, the offending therapeutic intervention will be terminated. 6.4.15 Pregnancy (SAE reporting requirements) Any pregnancy that occurs during a clinical study with an investigational drug must be repor ted as an SAE for tracking purposes only. All pregnancies that are identified during this study need to be followed to conclusion and the outcome reported. Female participants should immediately inform the investigator of pregnancies and future treatment options should be discussed . The site investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours (as described above in SAE Reporting) using the SAE form. The site investigator should counsel the participant and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the participant should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy, and a follow -up SAE reporting form should be submitted detailing the outcome. 6.4.16 Study completion and post-study treatment Outside the scope of this study, the intention is to follow all study participants in participating centers long -term, and to record disease activity and treatment response. 6.4.17 Role of key site personnel The treating physician and other designated qualified personnel will see the participant.

The participant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any screening study procedures. If the inclusion criteria are met at the screening visit, the participants will be enrolled in study. Each participant will be assigned a unique study ID. 7.3 Patient demographics and baseline characteristics Each selected study site has a large population representing diverse age, backgrounds, and ethnicity. This study will enroll all patients that meet the inclusion criteria. 7.4 Treatment exposure and compliance The participant will receive treatment at study visits 3 and 7 Because study drug is administered IV in the presence of research team members, participant will be 100% compliant. 7.5 Efficacy Efficacy will be assessed by clinical evaluation and MRI scanning. Clinical evaluation includes neurological examination, and EDSS assessment. Brain MRI will assess T1 lesion load, T2 number and lesion load, number of Gd + lesions. 7.5.1 Definition of a relapse A clinical relapse is defined as new neurologic symptoms, lasting at least 24 hou rs, is associated with an increase in the EDSS by ≥ 0.5 points, and consistent with new demyelination. Two relapses must be separated by at least 30 days. Due diligence to rule out pseudoexacerbations will be up to the PI in each individual case . 7.5.2 EDSS A standard EDSS will be performed at certain study visits (screening or baseline, 6 months , 12 months , and any relapse visits). This will include both a composite score and subsection score, recorded on a CRF. The EDSS is a scale providing a disability score (0 to 10) based on neurological examination and information about how the patient is able to perfor m tasks such as long walking. The EDSS may be conducted by a different doctor than the one the patient typically sees for treatment of MS. In order to make sure that this EDSS doctor is as objective as possible, the patient should not explain to this doctor how he/she is feeling that particular day, what symptoms may be bothersome at that time, or what treatment the patient is currently receiving for MS (s ee Appendix 2."

Study participants at the Dallas VA. the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Center of Dallas, and the Neurology Center of San Antonio will be scanned on similar scanners at their sites, using compatible software sequences . All imaging data will be analyzed at the AIRC. The AIRC, in partnership with other North Texas institutions, aims to further research in magnetic resonance imaging and translation of discoveries into clinical practice. 7.5.4 Standard MRI protocol performed at all sites Standardized MRI studies of the brain will be performed at weeks 0 and 96. Clinical imaging studies of the brain and/or spinal cord performed during or immediately following the onset of a clinical exacerbation will be performed at the discretion of the site PI with scan costs covered under the medical standard of care. A clinical MRI of the cervical spinal cord with and without contrast will be recommended to study participants at week 0 and week 96 as medical standard of care. The MS specialist with neuro-imaging expertise will be responsible for ensuring that a uniform protocol (“Dummy scans”) is implemented at specified sites for the collection of uniform, multi -center data for post processing. In addition, this specialist will evaluate all MRI studies of the CNS for interval change (i.e. new and enlarging T2 lesion(s), gadolinium enhancement) during follow -up imaging studies and imaging studies acquired during clinical events. At Year 2, changes in T2-lesion volumes, and brain atrophy (SIENA) will be determined. Standard imaging protocol: 1.

Post-Contrast 3D T1-Weighted Volumetric Gradient Echo Images A post-contrast 3D T1-weighted volumetric gradient echo image will be performed following Series 5 which will allow for at least 5 minutes to elapse prior to the acquisition of the post-contrast images to assess for blood brain barrier breakdown. The expected acquisition time is 4-5 minutes. 7.5.5 OCT The OCT tests measure peripapillary RNFL thickness using the Spectralis OCT device (Heidelberg Engineering), the Cirrus OCT device (Carl Zeiss Meditec) or comparable devices. All scans will be performed by the same experienced operator. An internal fixation target will be used because it provides the highest reproducibility. All participants will undergo testing using the RNFL image acquisition protocols on either Spectralis OCT (RNFL Circle Scan), the Cirrus OCT (200 x 200 ONH Scan), or a comparable device on each eye. In addition, ganglion cell layer (GCL), and inner plexiform layer (IPL) will be assessed by measuring their combined thickness in a 4.8 × 4.0 mm oval with a longer horizontal axis. Each patient will be longitudinally assessed on the same machine. The database name should be de-identified with the study assigned identifier. The default printing protocol will be used to print out the RNFL report on both eyes. RNFL protocols on the Spectralis OCT, the Cirrus OCT, or comparable devices generate a thickness map with mean thickness, thickness of the four quadrants (superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal)."

All of the proposed procedures are validated, safe, and standard assessments that are utilized in the clinical practice of neurology or ophthalmology. In a limited number of participants, testing may require dilation of the eyes prior to assessment using standard ophthalmic solution if the data capture is not possible without dilating their eyes. This may cause minimal discomfort to the participant. Vision may become more sensitive to sunlight, the drops may cause a slight stinging sensation upon administration, and vision may be blurry for up to four hours after initial dilation. 7.5.6 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The C -SSRS is used extensively across primary care, clinical practice, surveillance, research, and institutional settings. It is a suicidal ideation rating scale to evaluate suicidality in ages 12 and up. It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from ""wish to be dead"" to ""active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent."" This will be administered by research staff. See Appendix 3. 7.5.7 Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL) This is a self -administered assessment of quality of life. It measures the pleasure one derives from being able to do their work well, feelings of hopelessness and difficulties in dealing with work or in doing their job effectively, and work -related, secondary exposure to extremely stressful events.

Blood will be collected at the study sites, in Cyto -Chex BCT tubes for flow Cytometry, ACD tubes for isolation of PBMC’s and SST tube to collect serum. and shipped to the PI’s laboratory at UT Southwestern by FedEx express overnight. Samples collected at UT Southwestern will be picked up in the clinic. 8 Data Analysis The sample size of 40 patients was chosen to obtain a result that would be seen as meaningful by neurologists. Disease activity is expected to be extremely low on natalizumab and subsequently on alemtuzumab. Thus, it will be impossible to power a superiority or non-inferiority study. All outcome measures will be assessed in the 12 months prior to natalizumab, on natalizumab, and on alemtuzumab. We will control secondary endpoints for multiple comparisons by testing sequentially the proportion of relapse-free patients, EDSS change, and T2-hyperintense lesion volume change. The analysis of the acquired standardized imaging data will include a qualitative assessment of structural features suggestive of progressive multi -focal leukoencephalopathy (PML), T2 -weighted lesion volumes, T1-weighted lesion volumes, a determination of new or enlarging T2 foci, the presence of acute blood brain barrier compromise and number of identified contrast enhanced lesions, and an assessment of brain volumetric changes by SIENA between the baseline and year 2 MRI study. We will analyse the proportion of patients who are relapse-free with a proportional hazards model. We will analyse changes from baseline in EDSS at the pre-defined time points with a mixed model for repeated measures. We will make treatment comparisons of all available 3 month assessments with a non-parametric test for repeated measures. We will analyze changes in T2-hyperintense lesion volume, and RNFL thickness with a rank ed ANCOVA model. We will analyse proportions of patients with new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions or Gd+ lesions, and those who were free from disease activity, with logistic regression."
