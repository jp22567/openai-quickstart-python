CHF is the end stage and main death cause of most cardiovascular disease. Recent European data (ESC-HF pilot study) demonstrate that 12-month all-cause mortality rates for hospitalized and stable/ambulatory HF patients were 17% and 7%, respectively, and the 12- month hospitalization rates were 44% and 32%, respectively [2]. The Cardiovascular Health Study, a US longitudinal cohort of community-dwelling older adults, reported 1-, 5-, and 10-year mortality rates of 19%, 56%, and 83%, respectively, after the onset of HF [3]. The prevalence of CHF is approximately 1–2% of the adult population in developed countries, rising to 10% among people ˚70 years of age [4-6]. In China, CHF was reported to 0.9 %, 0.7% and 1.0% for the general population, the males and females, respectively. Also, prevalence of CHF increased substantially with aging, which is 0.4%, 1.0%, 1.3 % and 1.3 % in 35 -44, 45 -54, 55-64, 65 -74 years of age groups, respectively [7] . The large societal burden of CHF presents a subs tantial financial challenge to the health care system, with estimated annual direct costs of $2.8 billion in Canada [8]. In the United States, estimated yearly expenditures of $30.7 billion are expected to rise to $69 billion/y by 2030 [9], with proportional increases forecast in China over this time frame as well. (OHYDWHG+HDUW5DWHDQG&+) Increased resting HR has been shown to be a negative prognostic indicator in failure [10].The BEAUTIFUL study found that patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and a heart rate (HR) >70 bpm had increased cardiovascular mortality, increased HF hospitalization, myocardial infarction, and need for coronary revascularization [11]. ȕ-blockers work in chronic HF by antagonizing the effects of the sympathetic nervous system. This results in decreased heart rate, increased diastolic filling times, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. They have been used in th e treatment of CHF for decades but their benefits were only confirmed through ra ndomized controlled trials in th e late 1990s and early 2000s. The most important trials were the CIBIS II (bisoprolol) [12], COPERNICUS (carvedilol) [13], and MERIT-HF (metoprolol CR/XL) [14] trials. When looked at in combination, more than 9000"

Results showed a relativ e risk reduction (RRR) in mortality versus placebo of approximately 34 % and a RRR in heart failure hospitalization of 28–36% [15]. A recent meta-analysis of 23 trials looking at the use of ȕ-blockers in the treatment of heart failure found that the magnitude of heart rate reduction is significantly associated with survival benefit, independent of the actual dosage used. Every HR re duction of 5 bpm resulted in an 18 % reduction in mortality [16]. Beta blockers could reduce heart rate and this is consistently reflected in current guidelines for CHF. It was recommended to control the heart rate to 55-60 bpm for these patients in most clinical guidelines, LQFOXGLQJ &KLQHVH+HDUW)DLOXUH*XLGHOLQH [17]. 3.1.3 Bisoprolol titration in CHF Bisoprolol is a beta-1 selective blocker with the highest selectivity for this receptor, in doses less than 10 mg it has very little or no effect on beta-2 receptors. Bisoprolol was first tested in CHF in the CIBIS I trial which enrolled 641 patients and showed improvement in functional class, less hospitalizations for heart failure and a trend to improved survival. The much larger randomized CIBIS II assigned 2647 patients with class III or IV HF and an LVEF <40% to Bisoprolol or placebo; the patients also received standard therap y with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. After an average follow-up of 1.4 years, the trial was prem aturely stopped when the benefits were observed in the active treatment group: significant reduction in total all-cause mortality (11.8 versus 17.3 percent] that was independent of the severity or cause of HF. This benefit was primarily due to a reduction in SCD (3.6 versus 6.3%, 3< 0.001], with a non-significant trend toward fewer deaths from HF; significant 15% reduction in hospital admissions for any cause and a 30% reduction in admissions for HF ( 3< 0.0001). CIBIS II showed that both baseli ne heart rate and its change over time are prognostic markers, with lower baseline heart rate and greater reductions being better [12]. Not only did Bisoprolol increase survival and reduce hospital admissions in CIBIS II, it also cut the cost of care in so doing [18]. A recent study reported an attempt to Bisoprolol up-titrate toward guideline-recommended dosages offers additional benefit in terms of restorati on of LV systolic function and remodeling for HF patients with systolic dysfunction [19]. Although clinical trials have consistently shown overall high beta-blocker tolerability, many patients even in the trial setting were unable to achieve target beta-blocker doses. For example, the mean dose of carvedilol in the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival (COPERNICUS) trial [13] was 37 mg compared with the target dose of 50 mg/d and, in the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Interventi on Trial in Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) [14], metoprolol succinate dose on average was 159 mg as compared with the target dose of 200 mg. Only about two thirds of the patients in both these trials reached target doses. These results not only suggest that heart rate may be a major determinant of the ability to titrate beta-blocker dose and their tolerability, but that it may also serve as a therapeutic target for beta-blocker therapy. It has been shown that beneficial effects of beta-b lockers are related to the magnitude of heart rate reduction [20], which favors the selective beta1-adrenoceptor-blocker bisoprolol [21].In CIBIS-ELD trial [22], indicates the heart rate after up-titration, predicted all-cause mortality risk in elderly"

Achieved resting heart rate between 55 and 64 bpm bisoprolol up-titration was associated with lower long-term mortality risk and the lowest frequency of adverse events. For every 10 bpm. increa se in heart rate, a correspondi ng 19% increase was seen in all- cause mortality after adjusting for age, sex, beta-blocker pre-treatment, ventricular function, heart rate, and NYHA class at baseline. This finding is consistent with results from a large prospective observational survey, where 26% of the patients were uptitrated to the target dose [23]. However, up-titration is frequently associated w ith challenging, dose-related side effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, dizziness, and sometimes worsening of concomitant COPD, predominantly with non-selective beta-blockers [24-26]. As a consequence, recommended target doses can rarely be reached. A recent analysis dem onstrates that among other dose-related effects, heart rate reduction was the major factor limiting beta-blocker up-titration to recommended doses [27]. To sum up, data from various clinical studies have demonstrated elevated resting heart rate is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic systolic heart failure (CHF). It has also been shown that titration of doses of BBs improves outcomes of morbidity and mortality in CHF patients with reduced ejection fraction. Howeve r, there is only few studies to investigate the heart rate reduction during Bisoprolol up-titration in Chinese CHF. It remains unclear about the magnitude of heart rate reduction during Bisoprolol up-titration in Chinese CHF and this study serves as the first one to explore. Th is study will mainly inve stigate the he art control efficacy of oral Bisoprolol during the up-titration, as well as other efficacy, safety and compliance in treatment of Chinese CHF patients.  5LVNEHQHILWDVVHVVPHQW a.The pre-clinical, clinical-pharmacological and clin ical results together form a rational basis for the planned clinical trial. b.The risk-benefit relationship has been carefully cons idered in the planning of the trial.

Beta blockers are one of the cornerstones of heart failure pharmacotherapy since they were proven to reduce morbidity and mortality and conseq uently recommended by clinical guidelines. Therefore it will violate the basic ethical benefits when a placebo control group was set in this trial. Because the main purpose of this trial is to explore the heart rate cont rol under different doses of Bisoprolol, but not head-to-head comparison of heart rate control level, no other active control drug group was set. Due to good efficacy of Biso prolol and aim of this trial, open label and non- randomized design was adopted. Resting heart rate is chosen for the assessment of primary endpoints because it is an easy and applicable st andard to guide clinical practice recommended by all guidelines for CHF treatment. Bisoprolol is proven to improve prognosis for chronic heart failure patients with good efficacy on heart rate cont rol.

After each question, circle the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 to show how much your life was affected. If a question does not apply to you, circle the 0 after that question. ©1986 Regents of the University of Minnesota, All rights reserved. Do not copy or reproduce without permission. LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE® is a registered trademark of the Regents of the University of Minnesota. Instructions for Data Collection and Scoring ˖ 1. Patients should respond to the questionnaire prior to other assessments and interactions that may bias their responses. You might tell the patient that you would like to get his or her opinion before doing your medical assessment. 2. Ample, uninterrupted time should be provided for the patient to complete the questionnaire. We recommend that th e patient answer the questions without being influenced by others such as their spouse or family members. Studies show that patient proxies often have different perspectives. 3. We recommend that you use the first question to give the respondent more detailed instructions as follows. a. Read the introductory paragraph at the top of the questionnaire. b. Read the first question with the respondent – “Did your heart failure prevent you living as you wanted during the last month (4 weeks) by causing swelling in your ankles or legs?” Then tell the respondent - If you did not have any ankle or leg swelling during the past month (4 weeks) you should circle the zero (0) after this question. If you did have swelling that was caused by a sprained ankle or some other cause that you are sure was not related to heart failure, you should circle the zero (0) after this question. If you had swelling that might be related to your heart condition, then rate how much the swelling prevented you from doing things you wanted to do or feeling the way you would like to feel. In other words, how much did the swelling affect your life? Circle either the 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 to indicate how much the swelling affected your life during the past month – zero (0) means not at all, one (1) means very little and five (5) very much."

The entire questionnaire may be read directly to the patient if one is careful not to influence responses by verbal or physical cues. Check to make sure the patient has responded to each question. If a question does not apply to the patient they should circle the zero (0). Ma ke sure there is only one answer clearly marked for each question. Score the questionnaire by summating the responses to all 21 questions. In addition, a physical dimension score (items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13 on the version sent with these instructions) and emotional dimension score (items 17, 18, 19, 20, 21) have been identified by factor analysis and may be scored by simple summation to further characterize the effect of heart failure on a patient’s life. Partially complete questionnaires do occur despite best efforts to minimize missing data. However, missing data can greatly bias the data and complicate analysis. To reiterate, you need to make sure the respondents understand to mark zero for any items that do not apply to them, rather than leave a blank. Whenever possible review the questionnaire before the respondent leaves to make sure there are no unanswered questions or questions with more than one answer. Several methods to impute missing data are discussed in the literatu re, Multiple imputation using completed questions and perhaps other study variables to predict missing responses should be considered. If a missing response is not imputed, the item will be eliminated from that person’s score (the sum of responses). Since intermittently missing data can greatly affect within-person changes in scores, you might want to use the same subset of questions to represent a person at all times by omitting questions that have missing data at any point in time. We do not have any recommendations about when missing data become too extensive to render the information being collected useless."
