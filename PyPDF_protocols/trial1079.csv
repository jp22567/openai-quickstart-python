9,page_9,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 10 MBPS205 Study Schematic Number of Participant s: The nu mber of participants is based on power considerations for the trabecular vBMD (radius) derived from HRpQCT at Month 12. The primary analysis method for this endpoint will be on the change from baseline within each treatment group, so the primary hypothesis to be tested is H0: µT ≤ 0 vs. H1: µT > 0 where µT denotes the change from baseline for each dose of Setru sumab. Under the assumption s of a maximum change from baseline of , a standard d eviation at both timepoints of and a correlation between both measurements of , a sample size of 25 patients per group yields approximately 80% power for a one -sided test with significance level 0.025, if the data are analysed on the log scale using a t -test. For a change from baseline of , with standard deviation as above the one -sided test would have a probability of 80% to yield a p -value below 5%, being considered indicative of a trend . Following a review of the trabecular vBMD (radius ) derived from HRpQCT at Mon th 6 of those subjects within the 20 mg/kg Setrusumab open label treatment group, a change from baseline standard deviation of ³ was observed. This yields to a correlation between baseline and Month 6 visits of (much higher than the that was originally assumed). If such a correlation is observed at Month 12, given 25 subjects per arm, the one -sided test would have a probability of 80% to yield a p -value below 5% for a change in baseline of . As a secondary analysis, the MCPMod approach will be applied to the data in order to assess a non-flat dose -response curve and to obtain information about the underlying dose -response curve. Due to the missing placebo group, the power of this approach depends heavily on the underl ying dose -response curve. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Treatment Groups and Duration : Participants will be qualified during a 28 -day screening period, followed by 12 months of study treatment . At the end of treatment in MBPS205, participants will continue into the follow -up period for 12 months .

11,page_11,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 12 Statistical Meth ods: General Statistical Methods The evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed on the full analysis set (FAS, intention to treat analysis). Results for the per -protocol analysis set will be considered supportive. Safety endpoints will b e analysed on the safety analysis set. The primary analysis will be performed after all patients have completed their initial 12-month study period or have withdrawn prior to completion. Analyses for the follow -up period will be carried out separately to the primary analysis once all patients have completed the 12 months follow -up period , or have withdrawn from it. Generally, data will be tabulated by treatment group. Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be presented as appropriate. Categorical data will be described using absolute and relative frequencies; for continuous variables, the following descriptive summary statistics will be presented: number of observations, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, minimum, lower quartile, median, upper qu artile, maximum. Continuous variables will be log transformed where appropriate. Time to event variables (e.g., time to first fracture) will be analysed using Kaplan -Meier methods, and quartiles for the median time to event will be presented together with their 95% confidence intervals. Data for placebo participants and open -label BPS804 20 mg/kg participants will be reported separately from the comparison between the randomized, blinded treatment groups. In particular for the primary analysis , the open -label BPS804 20 mg/kg participants’ data will not be pooled with the blinded BPS804 20 mg/kg participants’ data. Efficacy Analysis The HRpQCT results will be log transformed and an ANCOVA model will be used to calculate Least Square Means ( LSMeans ) for the change from baseline , using baseline values as a covariate and treatment group and stratum as a factor . LSMeans for each treatment group will be calculated and tested against the null hypothesis of 0 in an a priori hierarchical approach, starting with the hi ghest dose. Differences between LSMeans will also be displayed but will be analysed in an exploratory fashion only. The type I error rate will be 5% two -sided. P -values above 5% but below 10% (two -sided) will be considered as indicative for a trend. The LSMeans will further be analysed using the MCPMod methodology, using the following candidate models:  EMax (ED 50 of 1.5 mg)  Exponential (δ = 2)  Sigmoid EMax model with parameters ED50 = 10 mg and h = 2.4 Parameter estimates and predicted values for each dose will be calculated for all models. Th ese analys es will be done primarily on the trabecular vBMD (radius) . It will be repeated for the bone strength on FEA for supportive evidence. LSMeans and LSMean differences between treatment groups will be back -transformed to their original scale for descriptive purposes . After sub stracting the geometric mean of the log baseline values, the back -transformed LSMeans will correspond to the percentage change from baseline, Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

The remaining efficacy variables will be analysed according to their scale using general methods as described above. Exploratory Analyses Exploratory endpoint variables will be analysed according to their scale using general methods as described above. Safety Analyses Variables will be analysed according to their scale using general methods as described above, and results will be presented overall and by treatment group. Follow -Up Period Analyses Variables will be analysed according to their scale using general methods as described above. Results will be presented overall and by initial treatment assignment. In addition, subgroup analyses will be performed for HRpQCT, DXA, vertebral radiog raph, CTX -1 and P1NP based on the administration o f zoledronic acid during the follow -up phase (none; at Month 12; at Month 18). Also, the frequency of administration of zoledronic acid during the follow -up phase will be related both to the site and to the 12 months outcome for both primary efficacy endpoints.

Background Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a serious and debilitating genetic disorder that is characterised by fragile bones that break easily, often with little or no physical trauma. Patients may suffer from recurrent f ractures, bone deformity, bone pain, muscle weakness, hearing loss, fatigue, joint laxity, curved bones, scoliosis and short stature. In the most severe cases, OI can be life-threatening. It has been shown that patients with OI have a higher mortality rate, at all ages, with an increased risk of death from respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and trauma. Basilar invagination may lead to neurological consequences. Diagnosis of OI is based on the clinical features of the disease but may be confirme d by collagen or DNA testing. OI comprises of a group of disorders which primarily arise from mutation in the genes encoding Type I collagen. In about 85% of cases, autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes (17q21.33 and 7q21. 3) which encode the alpha 1and 2 chains of Type 1 collagen. Autosomal recessive forms of OI are also observed and are caused by mutations in the LEPRE1, CRTAP, and PPIB genes (1p34.1, 3p22 and 15q21 -q22). Autosomal recessive forms are in most cases severe or even lethal (Willaert et al, 2009 ; Ward et al, 2002 ; Lindahl et al, 2014 ; Valadares et al, 2014 ). Setrusumab is a fully human anti -sclerostin neutralising monoclonal antibody. Sclerostin, encoded for by the SOST gene, is an osteocyte -secreted glycoprotein and is functionally a negative regulator of bone formation. Lack of sclerostin in humans (sclerosteosis) ( Online Mendelian Interitance in Man [OMIM ] entry #269500 ) and van Buchem disease ( OMIM entry #239100 ) results in life-long increased bone formation in the entire skeleton leading to increased bone mineral mass, density and strength ( Balemans et al 2001 ; Brunkow et al 2001 ; Balemans et al 2002 ; Staehling -Hampton et al 2002 ). Setrusumab has an affinity of 21 pM for human sclerostin and reverses the human sclerostin -mediated inhibition of canonical Wnt signalling and in vitro bone mineralisation, a surrogate assay for bone formation, with EC 50 values of 13 nM and 150 nM, respectively. Based on significantly increased bone remodeling (turnover) in untreated OI patient s (Rauch et al 2000 ), it is hypothesised that OI patients who receive setrusumab will experience an increase in bone mineral density (BMD) via induction of osteoblast differentiation (a pathway that is blocked by sclerostin) ( Winkler et al 2005 ), an improvement in bone structure and strength, and hence a reduction of fracture incidence. While setrusumab could increase matrix and collagen production, it should be noted that a change by setrusumab in the defective collagen structure is not expected. Setrusumab has been studied in 4 clinical trials involving 106 participant s, 83 of whom received setrusumab . Study CBPS804A2201 was a randomised, open -label intra -patient dose escalation study (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) with an untreated reference group to evaluate safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and pharmacodynamics ( PD) of multiple infusions of setrusumab in 14 adults (male and female participant s between 18 and 75 years of age) with moderate OI. After administration of setrusumab , median amino -terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1NP ), carboxy -terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (P1CP ), bone -specific alkaline phosphatase Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"
20,page_20,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 21 (BSAP ) activ ity and osteocalcin ( OC) levels were increased at Day 43 by 84%, 53%, 59% and 44%, respectively, while corresponding biomarkers remained unchanged or declined moderately in the untreated reference group. The most commonly reported adverse events ( AEs) were headache, influenza, arthralgia and fatigue. None were considered related to the study drug and gave no indication of target organ toxicity. There were no clinically significant abnormalities of haematological, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, electrocardi ogram (ECG) or vital sign data. Bioanalytical results showed that setrusumab had a very similar PK profile in adult participant s with moderate OI when compared with other populations studied previously. Serum sclerostin levels increased following each dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg with an insignificant increase between the 10 and 20 mg/kg doses and a peak time lag behind the PK profile. This is consistent with observations from studies in healthy postmenopausal women ( CBPS804A2101 ) and participant s with hypophosphatasia ( CBPS804A2202 ). Thus, adult participant s with moderate OI given escalating doses of setrusumab demonstrated significant increases in bone formation biomarkers and lumbar spine BMD indica ting enhanced skeletal remodeling and bone formation. This was the first clinical evidence that an anti -sclerostin antibody can significantly improve bone metabolism in adult participant s with moderate OI. A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of setrusumab is provided in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB). 4.2. Study Rationale Current management of OI is directed towards preventing or controlling symptoms, maximising independe nt mobility and improving bone mass and muscle strength. Current interventions include exercise and physical therapy, rehabilitation, and pain management. Surgery may prove necessary for individuals with severe malformations or basilar impression. Rodding, a procedure in which metal rods are surgically placed in the long bones of patients with OI to prevent fractures, is often used to treat individuals with OI. However, none of these treatments affect the underlying bone pathology. There are no FDA or EMA a pproved pharmacological therapies for the treatment of OI. Bisphosphonates are widely used in the treatment of OI patients, despite a lack of solid evidence that they are beneficial. Studies have shown increased BMD , but there is no strong evidence in adults that they improve clinical features of OI, especially fracture rate or other features such as deformities, pain, or mobility. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and analogues have also been studied for the treatment of OI, but they do not seem to improve the cli nical course of OI and their safety profile is a concern. Therefore, there is a high unmet need for a safe and effective pharmacological treatment for OI. setrusumab has demonstrated an increase in bone formation markers, a decrease in bone resorption markers and an increase in BMD in non -clinical and early clinical studies. It is therefore considered a good candidate for further development in the treatment of OI. The current study aims to determine whether treatment with setrusumab in participants wit h OI is able to improve parameters reflecting bone structure, as measured with high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography ( HRpQCT ), towards those of normal (unaffected) individuals. As described in Section 6.4, HRpQCT is able to measure not only total volumetric BMD (vBMD) but also to discriminate between the cortex and trabecular vBMD (Tr. vBMD) , Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"
21,page_21,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 22 which may be more reflective of the u nderlying pathology than the standard measure of a real BMD as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ). This method also provides a means by which bone strength can be calculated, using finite element analysis ( FEA ). Although these parameters are not of direct clinical relevance to patients’ clinical wellbeing, they are considered to be appropriate at this stage of development because (a) they a re objective measures, (b) they can be assessed within a reasonable timeframe and (c) they are likely to be predictive of clinical benefit. In order to determine the most appropriate dose of setrusumab required to achieve these changes, 3 doses will be studied over a 10 -fold dose range . At each dose level, a comparison will be made between post -treatment and baseline values. In order to determine the time -course of the effect, a substudy will be performed in which one quarter of the patients have additional scans at 3 months. Since an additional scan cannot be blinded, this part of the study will be open -label. 4.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Since there are no approved pharmacological therapies for OI, patients participating in this study have the possibility to receive a potentially beneficial treatment, at a potentially therapeutic dose for a period of time consi dered long enough to achieve a benefit. It is expected that at least one of the doses of setrusumab will be sub -therapeutic; therefore patients randomised to this dose are not expected to receive any therapeutic benefit from participation. However, no prov en therapy will be withheld during the study until the final analysis is performed when all subjects in the blinded treatment arms have completed 12 months of treatment with setrusumab . Data from this study will provide confirmation about whether setrusuma b is efficacious for the treatment in adult osteogenesis imperfecta . The procedures being undertaken in the study are not expected to present any risk to participants. Radiation doses ar e kept to a minimum; HRpQCT uses a relatively low dose of radiation which is confined to the periphery and avoids exposure of radiologically sensitive organs. Bone biopsy may be unpleasant for participants, but this will not be mandatory and will be done as an optional sub-study. In non -clinical and early clinical studies with setrusumab , no safety concerns have been identified and the maximum dose proposed for the current study is well below the NOAEL from non-clinical studies. Further information can be found in the IB. More detailed in formation about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of setrusumab may be found in the I B and Participant Information Leaflet .

Overall Design MBPS205 is a phase 2, multice ntre, multinational , double -blind, dose range -finding study comparing 3 blinded doses of setrusumab (20 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) and an open -label treatment arm (20 mg/kg) . Participants will be randomi sed 1:1:1:1 into the 4 trea tment arms and will receive study treatment ( setrusumab ) for 12 months. Participants will have HRp QCT scans of their non-dominant distal radius at baseline, 3-month (for open -label participants only), 6-month and 12 -month time points to determine the effect of treatment on Tr. vBMD. Following completion of the study treatment participant s can receive a n optional single dose of zoledronic acid and will enter 1 2 months follow -up period and will have visits at Months 14, 18 and 24 to establish the rate of offset of treatment effect. Participants will also receive follow -up telephone calls at Months 16 and 21. Participants can receive a n optional further dose of zoledronic acid at Month 18 at the discretion of their treating physician . During the follow -up period p articipants will have HRpQCT scans of their non -dominant distal radius and tibia at Month 18 and Month 24. For the purposes of the stud y protocol 1 month is defined as 28 days. Figure 1: MBPS205 Study Schematic 6.2. Number of Participant s Approximately 100 participants will be randomi sed to complete the study. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted in approximately 28 centres in 5 countries. 6.3.

27,page_27,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 28 to achieve approximately 50, 80 and 90% of maximal sclerostin inhibition and thereby provide sufficient information to allow a dose to be selected. At each dose level, a comparison will be made between post -treatment and baseline values. In order to determine the time -course of the effect, a substudy will be performed in which one quarter of the patients have additional scans at 3 months. Since an additional scan cannot be blinded, this part of the study will be open -label. Fractures in adults with OI are likely to result from a combination of alterations in bone matrix quality, bone mass, bone microstructure and bone geometry. A variety of methodologies may be used to assess these bone parameters before and after treatment , thereby providing evidence of reduced fracture risk. The methodologies include mea surement of soluble bone turnover biomarkers in the circulation, DXA, high resolution computed tomography, HRpQCT, bone biopsy, high resolution magnetic resonance imaging as well as microindentation and nanoindentation (OsteoProbe). However, HRpQCT appears to be the best option to measure treatment effects in this clinical study for the following reasons. HRpQCT is a non -invasive technique that provides high resolution images of the bone that are directly amenable to quantification. By focussing on the extr emities, HRpQCT not only reduces the radiation dose (compared to lumbar quantitative computed tomography ( QCT )), but enhances patient comfort and compliance. HRpQCT is able to measure not only total vBMD but also to discriminate between the cortex and trabecular vBMD. In addition, the microstructure of bone can be assessed (trabecular bone volume, number of trabeculae per millimetre, inhomogeneity of the network, trabecular thickness, cortical thickness and cortical porosity). HRpQCT has been used in participant s with OI and compared to healthy participant s in 2 independent studies ( Kocijan et al., 2015 , Folkestad et al., 2012 ). The data were largely consistent between the studies and provide information on HRpQCT endpoints as follows: • The relevant endpoints and their quantification in OI patients • The expected variability of the endpoints • The observed differences between OI and healthy bone provide an indication of potential clinically meaningful effect sizes • The bone lesion in adults with OI resides largely in the trabecular region with the cor tical region being similar to healthy participant s • Tr. vBMD is the parameter that most effectively differentiates bone density between OI and healthy bone • BV/TV is the parameter that most effectively differentiates bone microstructure between OI and he althy bone FEA is a well -established modelling technique that moves beyond measures of bone density and microstructure and provides a predictive measure of the whole bone strength (Engelke et al., 2013 ). HRpQCT provides images of sufficient resolution to allow effective FEA. FEA has been used in OI to determine bone strength as well as response to treatment with teriparatide ( Orwoll et al., 2014 ). Accordingly, FEA can provide additional valuable information that is relevant for the determination of fracture risk in OI. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"
28,page_28,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 29 In addition to HRpQCT, the other methodologies for examining the likely impac t of setrusumab on bone quality will be investigated. B MD measured by DXA, vertebral radiographs, bone turnover markers and qualitative examination of bone biopsies will also be studied in order to further charac terise the effects of setrusumab and help to confirm the activity of the selected dose. 6.5. Justification for Dose Selection Setrusumab doses targeting the EC 50 (1.5 to 2 mg/kg monthly), EC 75-80 (6 to 8 mg/kg monthly) and EC 90 (15 to 20 mg/kg) for sclerostin i nhibition were identified through modelling and simulation using the available data from clinical studies with setrusumab . Adult participant s with moderate OI given escalating doses of setrusumab demonstrated significant increases in bone formation biomarkers and lumbar spine BMD indicating enhanced skeletal remodeling and bone formation . Therefore, study participants will receive either 2, 8 or 20 mg/kg setrusumab IV, administered monthly for 12 months. Since 90% of maximal sclerostin inhibition is expected to occur with the highest dose (20 mg/kg) this dose will be used for the open label group, which is designed to determine the rate of onset of effect with more frequent scans. The dose with the most positive benefit/risk profile based on HRpQC T analysis and safety after 12 months of treatment will be selected for further study. Participants will continue on their allocated dose until 12 months to evaluate whether treatment effect is maintained at 12 months. 7.

Blinding With the exception of the open -label treatment arm, investigators and participants will remain blinded to each participant’s assigned study treatment throughout the course of the study. In order to maintain this blind, an otherwise uninvolved 3rd party ( pharmacist) will be responsible for the reconstitution and disp ensation of all study treatment. A separate unblinded Clinical Research Associate (CRA ) will monitor the pharmacy . In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will be allowed access to un blinded study treatment records at the site(s) to verify that randomi sation/dispensing has been performed accurately. The IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. The study blind may be bro ken if, in the opinion of the investigator, it is in the participant’s best interest to know the study treatment assignment. Mereo must be notified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded study treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant’s condition (eg, antidote is available). In this case, Mereo must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reas on that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF , as applicable. 8.4. Preparation/Handling/Storage /Accountability The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment On written confirmation by the investigators , the pharmacist will contact the IWRS, enter the participant number and weight.

Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants may voluntarily discontinue investigational treatment for any reason at any time. If the participant no longer wants to take part in the study, they will be asked to attend a n end of treatment visit and 60 -day follow -up visit and be discontinu ed from the study. The investigator should discontinue investigational treatment of a given participant if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the participant’s well-being. However, the participant should be followed up t o the end of the study and all study procedures should be performed per protocol. Investigational treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances and the n further steps need to be discussed with the medical monitor: 1. Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to study drug injection 2. Diagnosis of malignancy during study 3. Evidence of pregnancy 4. Absolute corrected QT interval ( QTc) corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) is >500 msec and rise from baseline, confirmed by triplicate ECGs, is ≥60 msec (Refer to Section 10.4.3) 5. Any of the following confirmed laboratory abnormalities:  Renal function values that require discontinuation: o Discontinue investigational treatment for a participant if individual serum creatinine incre ases ≥ 50% compared to baseline (and is considered clinically significant), or in the event of treatment -emergent proteinuria (albumin: creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g or > 30 mg/mmol; protein: creatinine ratio (PCR) ≥ 500 mg/g or > 50 mg/mmol), unless the eve nt is not drug related, or if the risk/benefit assessment supports continuing investigational treatment. Note: A renal event leading to participant discontinuation should be followed up until event resolution (serum creatinine within 10% of baseline , PCR within 50% of baseline ), stabilises or becomes not clinically significant, or is assessed as being chronic.  Liver laboratory values that require discontinuation o Confirmed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) (for more than 2 weeks) o Confirmed ALT or AST > 3 times the ULN and confirmed bilirubin total > 2 times ULN (unless elevated bilirubin is related to confirmed Gilbert’s syndrome) Note: If the laboratory abnormality is considered causa lly related to study drug, study treatment will be permanently discontinued. In cases in which a causal relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is evident), study treatment will be discontinued but it may be resumed when the laboratory abnormality is sufficiently normalised. A decision to resume study treatment will be made jointly by the investigator and medical monitor (medical monitor’s written approval is required). Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Sponsor decision If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline in QTcF after enrolment; the investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study and if any change in participant management is needed . This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be documented . Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed . 9.1.1. Temporary Discontinuation Study drug dosing may be tempo rarily suspended in the event of: 1. Clinically important laboratory abnormalities 2. Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery 3. Use of prohibited treatment 4. Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the participant ’s safety 5. Sponsor decision After a laboratory abnormality leading to a delay of dosing normalises sufficiently, study treatment may resume at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. Similarly, study treatment may resume after t he medication leading to suspension of dosing is discontinued. A decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor. The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, even without c onsultation with the medical monitor if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the participant ’s best interest. However, the medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study dru g discontinuation. 9.1.2. Rechallenge Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor. 9.2. Discontinuation from the Study  A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, o r may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavio ural, or administrative reason .  If the participant withdraws consent for disclos ure of future information, the s ponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent .  If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested , and the investigator must document this in the site study records .  Refer to the SoA for data to be collecte d at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.

HRpQCT HRpQCT scans, including calibration, should be performed according to MBPS205 Imaging Charter and Training Manual on distal non-dominant arms unless the arm has been supported with rods or there i s significant deformity. In this case, the investigator should document that the dominant limb was selected and specify the rationale. If rodding (or other metal implant) is present in both distal tibiae, or if severe deformities do not physically allow en try of either lower limb into the HRpQCT scanner, please discuss the participant ’s involvement in the study with the study medical monitor prior to inclusion in the study. HRpQCT will be used to measure the primary efficacy endpoint of trabecular volumetr ic BMD of the radius (see SoA). In addition, HRpQCT will be used to examine other aspects of the tibial and radial trabecular and cortical bone volume and microarchitecture. Morphological analysis will measure or derive bone volume, trabecular number, thickness and spacing, cortical volume and thickness, structure model index, connectivity density and degree of anisotropy. Exploratory end points will be assessed with time -lapse dynamic in vivo morphometry of HRpQC T image datasets. Morphological analysis procedures are described in detail by ( Liu et al 2010 ) and in the MBPS205 Imaging Charter and Manual. Refer to Appendix 6 for Radiation Exposure. 10.1.1.2. Dual-Energy X -ray Absorptiometry Bone mineral density will also be evaluated using DXA . T-Score will be calculated based on actual measured bone density value . Change in TBS from baseline will be assessed from D XA images using TBS (iNsight software). Lean and fat body mass will be evaluated using whole body DXA. Calcium tablets should not be taken 2 hours prior to DXA lumbar scan . Refer to Appendix 6 for Radiation Exposure and the MBPS205 Imaging Charter and Imaging Training Manual for further details of the DXA including patient positioning. 10.1.1.3. Radiography Vertebral radiographs will be used to assess the number of historic vertebral fractures, the percentage change in numbers of vertebral fractures from baseline at 6 and 12 months and the percentage change in vertebral height from baseline . Genant’s semi -quantitative method and 6-point quantitative morphometry will be use d to evaluate vertebral fractures and vertebral height , as detailed in the Imaging Charter. Fracture assessment , confirmed by central radiographic reading, will be carried out separately for peripheral including all major long bones, minor bone (digits, ribs) and vertebral fractures . Fractures without clinical symptoms, detected only by means of radiographic investigations will not be included in the analysis . Date of diagnosis (defined as first occurren ce of symptoms of fracture) will be adopted for all time to event analyses . Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Bone Biopsy Bone biopsies will be performed once at either Month 6 or Month 12 in a sub-set of participants. Informed consent will be obtained using a specific bone biopsy consent form. Double labelling of bone, according to the procedure detailed in the MBPS205 Bone Biopsy Manual, will be carried out before the bone biopsy procedure to allow determination of the level of bone turnover, and bone formation and mineralisation rates . All biopsies will be analysed at a central laboratory as per the MBPS205 Bone Biopsy Manual. 10.1.3. Audiometry This procedure can be omitted if the investigative site does not have the capability to complete the audiometry assessment. Participants will be asked to remove any thing which might affect the test results such as spectacles, earrings and hearing aids. The ear will be examined with an otoscope to assess the requirement for wax removal and to determine whether the eardrum has suffered any damage which may reduce the a bility of sound to be transported to the cochlea. The audiometric test will be carried out using standard or automatic audiometers. The participant will be asked to indicate whether they can just hear or cannot hear a certain sound; the sound level may be increased from a very low level or reduced from a high level. Headphones will be fitted to the participant and the test performed on each ear. A th reshold test will be performed first in which each ear will be subjected to sound at a frequency of 1 kHz at varying levels of intensity ranging from low to high and high to low. This will be repeated several times in order to derive an average threshold f or the test. Following this pre -check, both of the participant ’s ears will be tested through a range of frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 kHz) and hearing loss recorded for each frequency via a series of sound exposures. The decibel hearing loss will b e recorded using the grading scores in Appendix 7. 10.1.4. Patient -Reported Quality of Life The SF -12 is a generic, 12 -item survey that measures 8 domains of health: physical function ing, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. It yields scale scores for each of these 8 domains and 2 summary measures of physical and mental health: The Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component Summary. The EQ -5D-5L is a standardi sed measure of health status comprised of a descriptive system of 5 health -related quality of life states (i.e., mobility, self -care, u sual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of overall health. Each dimension is rated on a 5 -point response scale indicating severity of problems, where 1 is “no problems” and 5 is “extreme problems”. The 5 questions are scored and together contribute to the EQ -5D index (utility) score between 0 and 1 (1 being perfect health), which will be calculated using the developers’ algorithm based on country -specific reference score sets. The EQ -5D VAS is a measure of overall self -rated health status, used and analy sed separately from the index score. The VAS ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicative of better overall health. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE /AESI can be found in Appendix 4. AE will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant 's legally authori sed representative) . The investi gator a nd any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, a nd reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE/AESI and remain responsible for following up AE that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8.7). 10.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE /AESI Information All AE and SAE /AESI will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF. All SAE s/AESIs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4. The investigator will submit any updated SAE /AESI data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are no t obligated to actively seek AE or SAE /AESI in former study participant s. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE /AESI , including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor . The method of recording, evaluating , and assessing causality of AE and SAE /AESI and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE /AESI reports are provided in Appendix 4. 10.2.2. Method of Detecting AE and SAE /AESI Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE /AESI . Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 10.2.3. Follow -up of AE and SAE /AESI After the initial AE/SAE /AESI report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE s/AESIs , will be followed until resolution, stabili sation , until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 9.3).

Statistical Considerations 11.1. Sample Size Determination The nu mber of participants is based on power considerations for the trabecular vBMD derived from HRpQCT at Month 12. The primary analysis method for this endpoint will be on the change from baseline within each treatment group, so the primary hypothesis to be te sted is H0: µT ≤ 0 vs. H1: µT > 0 where µT denotes the change from baseline for each dose of Setrusumab. Under the assumptions of a maximum change from baseline of , a standard deviation at both timepoints of and a correlation betwe en both measurements of , a sample size of 25 patients per group yields approximately 80% power for a one -sided test with significance level 0.025, if the data are analysed on the log scale using a t -test. For a change from baseline of , with standard deviation as above the one -sided test would have a probability of 80% to yield a p -value below 5%, being considered indicative of a trend . Following a review of the trabecular vBMD (radius ) derived from HRpQCT at Month 6 of those subjects withi n the 20 mg/kg Setrusumab open label treatment group, a change from baseline standard deviation of was observed. This yields to a correlation between baseline and Month 6 visits of (much higher than the that was originally assumed). If such a correlation is observed at Month 12, given 25 subjects per arm, the one -sided test would have a probability of 80% to yield a p -value below 5% for a change in baseline of . As a secondary analysis, the MCPMod approach will be applied to the data in order to assess a non-flat dose -response curve and to obtain information about the underlying dose -response curve. Due to the missing placebo group, the power of this approach depends heavily on the underlying dose -response curve. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Statistical Analyses The statistical evaluation will be performed by ICON using SAS®, Version 9.3 or later and ADDPLAN DF 4.0 or later . The main population for efficacy analysis will be the FAS. Results for the mFAS, per-protocol (PP) population and the Non -restricted FAS will be considered supportive. Data for placebo participants and open -label BPS804 20 mg/kg subjects will be reporte d separately from the comparison between the randomized, blinded treatment groups. In particular for the primary analysis , the open -label BPS804 20 mg/kg participants’ data will not be pooled with the blinded BPS804 20 mg/kg participants’ data.

Analyses for the follow -up period will be carried out separately from the primary analysis when all participants have completed the 12 months follow -up period , or have withdrawn from it. Data will be analysed by either enumeration of participant s displaying distinctive characteristics within each treatment regimen or by descriptive statistical summaries such as means, standard deviations (SD), minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and maximum for continuous measures. Continuous measures will be log transformed where appropriate. Categorical variables will be presented by the number of observations and absolute and relative (%) frequency. Time to event variables will be analysed using Kaplan -Meier methods, and quartiles for the median time to event will be presented together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) . For efficacy data summary statistics (N, mean , SD, median, minimum and maximum for continuous data, and N [%] for categorical data) will be presented at each visit.

Details of the analysis and methods are provided in a separate statistical validation a nalysis plan. A primary efficacy analysis and unblinding will be performed when all data up to and includ ing Month 12 has been collected in the blinded treatment arms. A Clinical Study Report (CSR) will be prepared based upon the results of this analysis. The data collected during the 12 -month follow -up period will be analysed separately and published in the CSR addendum. The SAP will be developed and finali sed before database lock and will describe the selection of participants to be included in the analyses, and procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. Below is a summary of planned statistical analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints. 11.3.1. Efficacy Analyses Analyses for the primary efficacy endpoints and selected secondary endpoints will be analysed on the FAS, mFAS, the Non -restricted FAS and the PP samples, while analyses for the remaining secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed on the FAS sample only. The mFAS will be used for analysis of HRpQCT endpoints only. Gene ral methods as described above will be applied to the efficacy endpoints; specific analyses are described below. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary The HRpQCT results for the Trabecular vBMD (radius) will be log transformed and an ANCOVA model will be used to calculate Least Square Means (LSMeans) for the change from baseline, using baseline values as a covariate and treatment group and stratum as a factor. LSMeans for each treatment group will be calculated and tested against the null hypothesi s of 0 in an a priori hierarchical approach, starting with the highest dose. Differences between LSMeans will also be displayed but will be analysed in an exploratory fashion only. The type I error rate will be 5% two -sided. P-values above 5% but below 10% (two-sided) will be considered as indicative for a trend. For supportive evidence, this analysis will be repeated on the mFAS, Non-restricted FAS in both versions and the PP population. Further, Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Events Meeting the AE Definition  Any abnormal laboratory test results (h aematology, clinical chemistry, or urin alysis) or other safety assessments ( eg, ECG , radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease ).  Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.  Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  ""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharma cological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"
67,page_67,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol MBPS205 Mereo Biopharma 3 Ltd. 68 Events NOT Meeting the AE D efinition  Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition.  The disease/di sorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant ’s condition.  Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE.  Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital).  Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the star t of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met ( eg, hospitali sation for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c. Requires inpatient hospitali sation or prolongation of existing hospitali sation In general, hospitali sation signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitali sation are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitali sation or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitali sation” occurred or was necessary, the A E should be consid ered serious. Hospitali sation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Version: 7 Date: 19 Jul 2019"

Results in persistent disability/incapacity  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) whic h may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption . e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations:  Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropr iate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitali sation but may jeopardi se the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outc omes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious . Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitali sation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse . Definition of AESI An adverse event of special interest (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate. Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterise and understand it. Depending on the nature of the event, rap id communication by the trial sponsor to other parties (e.g. regulators) might also be warranted (CIOMS VI and ICH E2F) AESIs for setrusumab Some AEs, despite their severity or outcome, will be expedited due to the relevance for participant safety or stu dy treatment safety profile. These events should be reported to the Sponsor/designee within 24 hours.

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the Safety CRO .  The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE /AESI . Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE /AESI reported during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interfere s with normal everyday activities .  Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utili sed for rating the int ensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined a s ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE , NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE /AESI .  A ""reasonable possibility"" of a relationship convey s that there are facts , evidence , and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  The investigator will use clinical judgm ent to determine the relationship.  Alternative causes, such as underlying disease (s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.

Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  Documented hysterectomy  Documented bilateral salpingectomy  Documented bilateral oophorectomy Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant ’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 2. Premenarchal 3. Postmenopausal female  A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be us ed to confirm a post menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wi sh to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrol ment . Contraception Guidance Males Participants  Male participants with female partners of child bearing potential do not need to use contraception during the treatment period. Setrusumab is non -genotoxic and, teratogenicity or feto -toxicity is not expected at sub -therapeutic levels*. In that situation no male contraception is required with WOCBP ( Clinical T rial Facilitation Group Guidelines) *The female exposure from vaginal transference of a monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) is from a male partner is very limited. Semen levels are 1 -2% of plasma and that vaginal absorption is assumed maximum 10% (in cyno its only 1%).
