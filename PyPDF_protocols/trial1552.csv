The rational for this change is that the endpoint criteria is not justifying adjudication of these events. 5.8 Echocardiographic Sub - studyAn additional section has been added in order to capture information related to the ech ocardiographic sub -study. 6.3 Recording of adverse events (AEs) 6.3.2.2 Renal eventsClarification added based on feedback that the criteria was too vague, regarding what is considered an AE of interest in terms of renal events. 6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.5 Adverse events based on examination and testsLimiting the recording of AEs to not include potential renal endpoints that are based on examination and tests, i.e., laboratory results only, unless fulfilling the serious adverse event (SAE) criteria or adverse event leading to discontinuation of IP (DAE) criteria. The reason not to record these endpoints related to laboratory findings is that protocol mandated laboratory values will be systematically analysed. 6.4.1 Reporting of SAEs consider ed to be potential endpointsLimiting the event types that are being withheld from reporting to health authorities to include only HF endpoints and fatal AEs, i.e., AEs related to renal endpoints will not be withheld. The rationale for this limitation is t o simplify the SAE reporting and to minimise the risk for withholding renal AEs of interest, which should be reported, and which could be confused for being a"

The study popul ation will include patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV HF with reduced left ventricular eject ion fraction (LVEF ≤40%), i ncreased N -terminal pro-B-type natri uretic pept ide (NT-proBNP) levels and eGFR ≥30 ml/min/1.73 m2. Pati ents shoul d be clinically stable and optimized on heart failure therapie s according to local guidelines at the time of enrolment (and background standard of care therapy for type 2 diabetes when applicable). To ensure stabilit y, doses of evidence based heart failure medicat ions (other than diuret ics) can neit her have been inc reased nor decreased for at least 4 weeks prior to inclusio n in the study . The study popul ation will include patients both with and without ty pe 2 diabetes, as the beneficial haemodynamic effects of dapagliflozin appear to be independent of the glycaemic effect, and can therefore be expected in both groups. To ensure balance between the diabet ic and non -diabetic cohorts, stratificat ion will be emplo yed, wi th inclusion of at least 30% of each cohort. Duration of treatment This study is event driven. The an ticipated durati on of the study is approximately 33 m onths with an estimated m ean treatm ent peri od for a patient of 24 months. The study closure procedures will be init iated when the predetermined number of primary endpo ints are predi cted to have occurred (n=844) i.e., the study end date (SED). The study durati on may be changed if the event rate or randomisat ion rate i s different than ant icipated. The study may be terminated early if eit her a clear beneficial or harmful effect of the study treatm ent is detected during the Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC) review. Investigational product , dosage and mode of administration Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either dapagliflo zin 10 m g or pl acebo. Every attem pt shoul d be made to m aintain pat ients on dapagliflo zin 10 mg or matching placebo during the course of the study . In addi tion to the preferred 10 mg dose, the 5 mg dose of dapagliflozin can be used in the study when clinically indicated. If the dose has been decreased to 5 mg, the dose should be increased back to dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo as soon as, in the opinio n of the invest igator, the patient’s condit ion is stable. Statistical methods The primary object ive of the study is to determine the superiorit y of dapagliflo zin versus placebo in re ducing the incidence of the primary com posite endpoint. Assuming a true hazard ratio of 0.80 between dapagliflozin and placebo, using a one -sided alpha of 2.5%, 844 primary endpo int events will provide a statistical power of 90% for the test of the primar y composite endpo int. Thi s is based on an overall 1:1 allocat ion between dapagliflozin and placebo."
8,page_8,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 9 (102)The study is event -driven. With an annual event rate of 11% in the placebo treatment group, 4500 pati ents are estimated to provide the required number o f primary events, based on an anticipated recruit ment period of 18 m onths and an average follow -up peri od of approximately 24 m onths. All patients who have been randomised to study treatm ent will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) irrespective o f their protocol adherence and cont inued participat ion in the study . The primary variable is the time to first event included in the primary com posite endpo int. The primary analysis will be based on the intention to treat (ITT) principle using the FAS, usi ng events confirmed by adjudicati on. In the analysis o f the primary com posite endpoint, treatm ents (dapagliflozin versus placebo) will be co mpared using a Cox proportional hazards model wit h a factor for treatment group, stratified by t ype 2 diabetes (T2D) status at randomisat ion, and adjust ing for history of hospi talisat ionfor heart failure. The p -value, hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval will be reported. An interim analysis is planned to be performed when 75% of the primary endpo ints are adjudica ted, using a Haybitt le-Peto rul e. The interim analysis will assess superiorit y of dapagliflozin to placebo. A closed testing procedure including a pre -specified hierarchical ordering of the primary and secondary endpoints will be utilized. No m ultiplicity control is placed on the exploratory endpo ints."

INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study Despite advances in management and treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), HF continues to be a major cause of mortalit y, initial and recurrent hospi talisat ions, and suboptimal qualit y of life. The prevalence and incidence of HF cont inues to increase glo bally. An est imated 38 millio n people are affected by HF worldwide (Braunwald 2015 ) with over 1 millio n hospi talisations annually in the United States and Europe ( Ambrosy et al 2014 ). The annual glo bal economic burden in 2012 was estimated to be $108 billio n (Cook et al 2014) and is proj ected to increase dramatically as the popul ation ages. The current treatment paradigm for HF invo lves the simultaneous targeting of mult iple pathways including the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone axis (RAA), the autonomic system, and symptom atic treatment with diuret ics. Although increased efficacy in the sacubitril/valsartan arm led to early closure of the PARADIGM -HF tri al, the m ortalit y rate rem ained high ( McMurray et al 2014 , Sacks et al 2014 ). Even with best possible treatment, the five year survival rate for HF is worse than for most cancers ( Braunwald 2015 ). For pati ents wi th chronic HF, worsening sympto ms require prom pt medical attenti on, add to the burden of hospital and non -hospi tal settings and also have a considerable econo mic impact ( Ponikowski et al 2016 , Okum ura et al 2016 ). Recent ly, in pat ients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high cardio vascular (CV) risk, the sodium glucose co -transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, empagliflozin (JARDIANCE™), demonstrated a m arked reduction in CV m ortali ty (38% rel ative ri sk reducti on [RRR]), all - cause mortalit y (32% RRR) as well as 35% RRR in hospitalisat ion from HF co mpared with placebo when added to background standard of care treatment ( Zinman et al 2015). In a secondary analysis of HF outco mes, em pagliflo zin reduced the risk of hospitalisat ion for HF or cardi ovascular death by 28 % in patients wi th HF at baseline ( Fitchett et al 2016 ). Dapagliflozin (Forxiga™/Farxiga™) is a highly selective and rev ersible inhibitor of human renal SGLT2, the major transporter responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of act ion results in a direct and insulin -independent eliminat ion of glucose by the kidneys. In addit ion to the im proved glycaemic control, the persistent loss of glucose wi th associ ated cal ories in the urine, results in a consistent and maintained reduct ion of the total body weight. Further, dapagliflozin induces a diuresis, natriuresis and a decrease in blood press ure wi thout a concomitant increase in heart rate. Possible mechanisms for SGLT2 inhibitor benefit in patients with heart failure could include osmotic diuresis and reductions in arterial st iffness, weight, blood pressure, serum uric acid"
20,page_20,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 21 (102)and albuminuria. Other potential mediators include a shift in fat oxidat ion and increased circulat ing concentrations of ketone bodies which may serve as a more efficient fuel source for the failing heart ( Ferrannini et al 2016 ). The alterations in haemodynamics and renal physio logy are attributed to glucose -independent mechanisms and can therefore be expected to be similar even in the absence o f diabetes ( Rajasekeran et al 2016 ). Data on the effect of SGLT2 inhibit ion in pat ients without di abetes is limited. However, dapagliflozin has safely been administered in healthy volunteers over a broad dose range (up to 500 mg given as single dose) ( Kasichayanula et al 2014 ). Dapagliflo zin effect ively inhibited SGLT2 also in healt hy vo lunteers without any observed events of hypoglycaemia. Furtherm ore, a clinical study with canagliflozin (INVOKANA™), showed clinically relevant blood pressure and weight reducti ons in obese non -diabetic patients without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia ( Bays et al 2013 ). Dapagliflozin has been invest igated in a thorough T2D clinical development program. In addition, the tri al DECLARE -TIMI58 (D1693C00001) is ongo ing and includes >17,000 T2D patients wi th elevated CV ri sk to eval uate dapagliflozin 10 mg on CV outcome. Available data fro m a CV outcom e meta -analysis showed that dapagliflozin is not associated with increased CV risk and the results even suggested the potential for a beneficial effect on heart failure hospitalisat ions (Sonesson et al 2016 ). In a post -hoc analysis fro m the pool ed database fro m the dapagliflozin development program, patien ts wi th a history of T2D and concomitant heart failure (171 patients received dapagliflo zin 10 m g and 149 pati ents received placebo), had a si gnificant reducti on in weight, bl ood pressure (BP) and glycosylated haemoglo bin(HbA1c) and dapagliflozin was well tolerated. Vol ume deplet ion and hypoglycaemia adverse events (AEs) were balanced between the groups ( Kosiborod et al 2015 ). Al though very few HF hospi talisat ion events occurred, numerically these favoured dapagliflozin vs place bo. The aim of the proposed study is to invest igate the efficacy and safety o f dapagliflozin in patients wi th an established diagnosis of HFrEF (with or without T2D) where the prevalence and unmet needs for reducing CV mortalit y and heart failure events as well as improving symptoms remain high. 1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 1.2.1 Rationale for study design and population This is a rando mised , doubl e-blind, parallel -group study . Rando misat ionand double blinding will minimize potential bia s. This will be a multicentre study in numerous geographic regio ns to provi de a wi de applicabilit y of resul ts. The target population includes male and female patients with an established diagnosis o f HFrEF for ≥2 months, and at high risk of CV death or HF events. Although patients may have been previously hospitalised for HF (but prior hospitalisat ion is not required) they must be clinically stable and optimized on HF therapies according to local"
21,page_21,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 22 (102)guidelines at the time of enrolment. To ensure stabilit y,doses of evidence based HF medicat ions (other than diuret ics) can neit her have been increased nor decreased for at least 4 weeks prior to inclusio n in the study . The study popul ation will include patients both with and without T2D, as the beneficial hemod ynamic effects appear to be independent of the glycaemic effect, and can therefore be expected in both groups. It was notable in EMPA -REG outcom e study , studying the effect of empaglifl ozin that the reducti on in CV death and HF was similar across baseline HbA1c subgroups, i.e., did not seem to be dependent on the level o f baseline glycaemia. From published data we anticipate that approximately 40% of the HFrEF study popul ation will have diabetes ( Kristensen et al 2016 ). To ensure balance between the diabetic and non -diabetic cohorts, stratificat ion will be emplo yed, wi th inclusi on of at least 30% of each of these cohorts. The control group will receive placebo. All pat ients will be treated for their HFrEF accor ding to local guidelines on standard of care treatment for HF. 1.2.2 Rationale for primary outcome measure The m ain object ive of the study is to investigate whether dapagliflozin, compared wit h placebo, reduces the incidence of CV death or hospitalisat ion for HF or equivalent event (i.e. an urgent HF visit) when added to background standard of care treatment. A HF event is defined as hospitalisat ion for worsening HF or an equivalent event (i.e., an urgent HF visit leading to an urgent, unplanned, assessment by a physician (e.g., in an Emergency Departm ent) and requi ring treatment for worsening heart failure (other than just an increase in oral diuretics), in accordance wit h the draft definit ion CDISC: Standardized Definit ions for Cardi ovascular and Stroke Endpoi nt Events in Clinical Trials ( Hicks et al 2014). Acknowledging changing practice patterns and geographic variabilit y in the use of hospi talisat ion in HF treatment, the more inclusive definit ion of “a heart failure event” is used. HF events consisting o f both HF hospitalisations and urgent HF visit s requi ring urgent intensificat ion of treatment (as described in the CDISC [ Hicks et al 2014 ]) are com ponents of the primary endpoint. Given the current financi al pressures, parti cularly in the USA, to reduce HF hospitalisat ion, using the more tradit ional measure of HF hospitalisation only, risks missing a significant number of events. The CDISC definit ions of urgent HF visit are similar to those for heart failur e hospi talisati on (except that an increase in oral diuret ic is not sufficient to qualify as a si gnificant increase in HF therapy ) and provi de robust and object ive criteria for accurately capturing true cases of worsening HF. The rationale for including ou tpatient urgent HF events, in addit ion to hospital admissio ns, is that it is the occurrence of worsening of the patient’s condit ion necessitating treatm ent, and not the place of treatment, that is important. Importantly, episodes of worsening HF treated i n the outpatient or emergency department setting are associated with an increased risk of subsequent death similar to that seen fo llowing a hospi tal admissi on (Okum ura et al 2016 )."
22,page_22,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 Octo ber 2017 23 (102)1.2.3 Rationale for secondary outcome measure The rati onale for including CV death or hospitalisation for HF, but excluding non -hospi talised urgent HF visits, is that this is the more convent ional com posite HF endpo int, may be regarded as including “harder” outcomes and will allow direct comp arison wi th other HF trials. The rati onale for including total number of hospitalisat ions (including re -hospi talisat ions) for HF is to capture the impact of recurrent non -fatal HF hospitalisat ions. Taken together with CV death, these events give a bette r estimate of the full burden o f HF on patients and healt h- care system s than time -to-first event analysis. This outcome also provides a more detailed understanding of the potential treatment benefit in patients with chronic HF as it takes account of the e ffect of therapy on addit ional as well as first events. While CV death and HF hospitalisat ions are clearly important to pati ents and healt h-care system s, the impact of HF on patients’ symptoms and physical/social funct ioning i s also important. In order to evaluate these aspects of the impact of HF, we will use the Kansas Cit y Cardi omyopathy Quest ionnaire (KCCQ), a disease -specific pat ient reported outcomes (PRO) measure developed for patients with chronic HF. The KCCQ has shown to be a valid, reliable and responsive measure for patients with HF ( Green et al 2000 , Spertus et al 2005). The rati onale for the secondary renal com posite endpoint is that renal dysfunct ion is very commo n in heart failure, m ay lead to discont inuat ion of disease -modifying therapies and is associ ated wi th poor outcom es. SGLT2 inhibit ion has previously shown beneficial effects on renal outcomes in pat ients with T2D and concurrent established cardiovascular disease (C VD) ( Wanner et al 2016 ) and if this effect was also found in HF it could be of considerable benefit. This potential renal benefit is simultaneously being evaluated in a separate study evaluat ing dapagliflozin trea tment on renal outcomes in pat ients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). All-cause m ortali ty will be assessed as a secondary endpoint because it is important to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin on non- cardi ovascular, as well as cardiovascular, mortalit y and hence overall mortalit y. 1.2.4 Rationale for dose selection The m arketed dose (10 m g) of dapagliflozin has been demo nstrated to be well tolerated and effect ive for the treatment of T2D but the efficacy on CV mortalit y and/or HF outcom es in patients wi th HFhas not been evaluated. From a pharmacokinet ic and pharmacodynamics perspective, 10 mg dapagliflozin is appropriate for use in patients with HF as this dose is expected to near maximally inhibit SGLT2 in the kidney. Also this dose was found to be well tolerated in a CKD stage 3 study (estimated glo merular filtrat ion rate (eGFR) 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73m2) (Kohan et al 2014 ). In addi tion to the preferred 10 mg dose, the marketed 5 mg dose of dapagliflo zin may be used in the study when clinically indicated, however, i t is expected to provide less inhibit ion of renal SGLT2 and thus exert less pharmacodynamics effects, see Section 3.9.1 , for details."

Additio nal considerat ions relevant for the target popul ation are described below. Dapagliflozin has not been shown to induce hypoglycaemia in non -diabetes pati ents. I n clinical pharmaco logy studi es, heal thy subjects have been treated with single oral doses up to 500 m g and m ultiple oral doses of 100 m g up to 14 day s without any hypoglycaemic events. Events related to volume deplet ion (including reports of dehydration, hypovo lemia, or hypotension) and events related to changes in renal funct ion have been thoroughly evaluated in the dapagliflozin phase III program. In a large pool consist ing of 21 active -and placebo - controlled studies, serious adverse events (SAEs) of vo lume deplet ion were infrequent ly reported and the proportion was lower for patients treated with dapagliflozin than control (0.1% versus 0.2%). SAEs of renal impairment/failure were also rarely reported and balanced between treatment groups in the clinical trial program . Nine (0.2%) SAEs were reported in the dapagliflozin group and 5 (0.1%) SAEs were reported in the control group. In a recent analysis o f patients wi th pre-exist ing HF using pooled data fro m previous dapagliflozin studies ( Kosiborod et al 2016), the rate of hypovolemic events was similar between dapagliflozin and placebo. Although the phase III data in pat ients with CKD 3 show an increased frequency of overall renal events in patients treated with dapa gliflozin as com pared wi th placebo, m ost of these events have been related to laboratory detected transient increases in creat inine. In an analysis using pooled data on a subset of patients with CKD 3, micro or macro albuminuria and treatment with angiot ensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE- I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) there was no meaningful difference between dapagliflozin and placebo in terms of SAEs of renal impairment/failure or SAEs of volume depletion (Sjöström et al 2015 ). Loop -diuret ics are widely used in the target patient population and are also allowed in this study . In the dapagliflozin phase III program, patients using loop diuret ics were more likely to have an event related to volume deplet ion regardl ess of whether they were treated wi th dapagliflozin or placebo. During the short -term period a pool ed analysis showed 6 (2.5%) subjects wi th events in patients on dapagliflozin 10 mg and 4 (1.5%) in patients on placebo. When including the long -term extens ion peri ods of the phase III trials in the analysis, the corresponding values were 7 (3.0%) versus 7 (2.7%) for dapagliflozin and placebo, respectively ."
24,page_24,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 25 (102)Furtherm ore, other post hoc safet y analyses of importance to the current target populat ion have not i dentified any indicat ion of an increased risk of marked abnormalit ies in potassium levels ( ≥ 6mmo l/L) in eit her patients with CKD 3 and ACE -I/ARB treatm ent (Sj öström et al 2015 ) or in pat ients on concomitant treatment with potass ium sparing agents ( Kosiborod et al 2016 ). 1.3.1.1 Protection against risks This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place to monitor and minimize any potenti al heal th risks to parti cipat ing pat ients. In order to ensure t he safet y of all pat ients participat ing in AstraZeneca sponsored studies, reviews of all safet y informat ion from all ongoing clinical dapagliflozin studies are conducted as they become available. In addit ion, an independent Data Monitoring Co mmittee (DMC) will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients by reviewing safet y data throughout the study . 1.3.2 Potential benefits to patients All HF patients in the study will be optimally treated according to standard of care and dapagliflozin or pl acebo will be administered on top of this treatment. T he hypothesis is that dapagliflozin will reduce CV mortalit y or hospi talisati on of HF or equivalent event in patients rando mised to active drug. Dapagliflo zin is also known to decrease bod y weight (or p revent weight gain) as well as lower BP and is believed to be nephroprotective through non - glycaemic mechanisms. All patients participat ing in clinical trials irrespect ive of whether treated with active treatment or not, generally receive closer medical at tention than those in ordinary clinical practice which may be to their advantage. 1.3.3 Conclusion Considering the non -clinical and clinical experience with dapagliflozin and the precaut ions included in the study protocol , parti cipat ion in this study shoul d present a minimal and thus acceptable risk to patients who meet the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria and consent to take part in thestudy. At the tim e of writing thi s clinical study protocol, no available SGLT2 inhibitor is indicated for HF risk reduction in p atients with HFrEF. The Phase IIb/III program in T2D has established the efficacy and safet y of dapagliflozin in lowering glucose (as assessed by HbA1c). Another SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, has demonstrated reduction in HF hospi talisat ion and CV mort ality in pat ients with T2D and CVD ( Zinman et al 2015 ). The dapagliflozin programme has also provided hypothesis -generat ing data suggesting lower incidence of hospitalisat ion for HF with dapagliflo zin treatment. This clinical study will test this hypothesis in a rigorous fashion. The potential results could offer substantial benefit to patients wi th HFrEF. 1.4 Study Design This is an international, mult icentre, parallel group, event -driven, randomised, double -blind , placebo -controlled study in patients with chronic HFrEF, evaluat ing the effect of dapagliflozin"

It is estimated that approximately 7000 patients at approximately 500-600 si tes in 20 -25 countri es will be enrolled to reach the target of approximately 4500 randomised patients. The investigat ional product (IP) will be added to the prescribed background therapy for HF (and background therapy for T2D when applicable) as considered appropriate by the investi gator and in accordance with regional standards of care. The ant icipated durati on of the study is approximately 33 months. The study closure procedures will be init iated when the predetermined number of primary endpo ints is predicted to have occurred (n=844), i.e., the study end date (SED) (see Figure 1). The study durati on may be changed if the event rate or randomisat ion rate is d ifferent than anticipated. The study may be terminated early if eit her a clear beneficial or harmful effect of the study treatment i s detected during the DMC review. An echocardiographic sub -study is planned to be conducted in a subset of patients (approx . 300-400 patients) in the Dapa -HF tri al. The sub -study is designed to evaluate the impact of dapagliflozin at a dose of 10 mg daily , com pared to placebo, in addit ion to convent ional heart failure treatment, on changes in cardiac structure and funct ionas determined by echocardiography."

Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled pati ents see Secti on3.4. 3.3 Patient enrolment and randomisation Invest igator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered pre - study screening."
34,page_34,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 35 (102)The Investigator(s) will: 1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the pati ent or thei r guardi an/legal representative before any study specific procedures are performed. 2. Assign patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’, which will be used to identify the pat ient throughout the study . The enrolment code (E -code) will be assigned in the Interactive Vo ice/Web Response System (IxRS). 3. Determine patient eligibilit y, see Sect ion 3. 4. At visit 2, perform the rando misat ion transact ion in the IxRS system. Re-enrolment one single t ime is allowed considering that the pat ient has not been previously rando mised. The same E -code that the patient received at the first enrolment will be used. All enrolment assessments and procedures, including re -signing the inform ed consent form , shoul d be perform ed again. 3.4 Procedures for ha ndling incorrectly enrolled or randomised patients Patients who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any circumstances, be enrolled or receive study medicat ion. There can be no except ions to this rule. Patients who are enrolled, but su bsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria must not be rando mised or init iated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study . Where a patient does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mised in error, or incorrectly started on treatment, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study physician immediately, and a discussio n should occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the invest igator regarding whether to continue or discont inue the patient fro m treatm ent. Study treatm ent m ust be di scontinued in all cases where cont inued treatment is deem ed to pose a safet y risk to the pati ent. In those cases where continuat ion of study therapy is judged not to present a concern related to safet y and disease management, the r ationale for continuing study therapy must be cl early documented. Regardless of what is decided about IP, all rando mised patients should remain in the study and the patients should continue to be followed up in accordance with defined study procedures. 3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups Randomisat ion to IP will be performed via IxRS at Visit 2 in balanced blocks to ensure approximate balance between the treatment groups (1:1). The IxRS will allocate the IP through a randomisatio n scheme and provide the rando misat ion number and the appropriate Kit IDs fro m IP available at the study site. The randomisat ion codes will be computer generated and loaded into the IxRS database."
35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 36 (102)At all visits where IP is dispensed, site personnel will do a kit verificat ion in IxRS before provi ding the IP bottle to the patient. Detailed instruction on how to use the IxRS system will be provided to study sites. 3.5.1 Stratification and capping The recrui tment will be continuously mo nitored in order to achieve adequate proportio ns of patient sub -popul ations. 3.5.1.1 Stratification Randomisat ion will be stratified in IxRS based on patients with and without T2D at the time of rando misat ion in order to ensure approximate balance between treatment groups within each sub -popul ation. T2D at the time of rando misation is based on:  Established diagnosis of T2D OR  HbA1c more or equal to 6.5% (48 mmo l/mol) shown at central laboratory test at enrolment (visit 1) 3.5.1.2 Capping The intent is to enrol as ty pical cross -section of patients with HFrEF and to include representative proportions of diabet ic and non -diabeti c pat ients. The number of rando mised patients wi th and wi thout T2D will be monitored in order to ensure a minimum o f 30% in each sub -popul ation. Rando misat ion may be capped (i.e., no more patients can be rando mised in a specific sub -popul ation) if the pre -determined limit is reached. Randomisat ionof patients based on geographic region will be monitored to ensure global representation. LVEF value, NYHA class and atrial fibrillat ion statu s may be capped in IxRS to avoid over -or under -representation of these pat ientsubgroups. 3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding The blinding of treatment is ensured by using a double -blind technique. The dapagliflozin tablets and the respect ive placebo tablets will be i dentical in size, col our, sm ell, and taste. The bottles wi th IP will be l abelled wi th unique ident ification numbers. No m ember of the extended AZ study team , personnel at study sites, or any clinical research organi sation (CRO) handling study data will have access to the randomisat ion scheme during the study . The AstraZeneca (AZ) personnel or delegate generating the rando misat ion scheme and the Supply Chain Study Management m ay be able to access the rando misat ion scheme as appropriate."
36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 37 (102)3.7 Methods for unblinding Individual treatment codes, indicat ing the rando mised treatment for each patient, will be available to the invest igator(s) or pharmacists fro m the IxRS. Instructions for code breaking/ unblinding will be described in the IxRS user manual that will be provided to each site. The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisat ion. The investigator documents and reports the action t o AZ, without revealing the treatment given to patient to the AZ personnel. It is always the investigator who decides when to unblind but it is recommended that the invest igator first contacts th e AZ study physician for consultation regarding the need for unblinding. If unblinding is deemed necessary, the invest igator can perform the unblinding in IxRS and must document all act ions taken. The number of individuals at the study site who become aware of treatment status should be kept to the absolute minim um (including keeping the patient blinded if possible). Treatment with study medicat ion shoul d be continued if possible. AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be causally related to an invest igational product and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authori ties. Treatm ent codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisio ns on the evaluabilit y of the data from each individual patient have been m adeand docum ented. 3.7.1 Unblinding for bioanalytical laboratory personnel PK samples will be analysed at the bioanaly tical laboratory only for pati ents on active IP. The bioanalyt ical laboratory will therefore have access to the treatment codes but will not shar e the codes with the sponsor or others invo lved in the study until the blinding is broken for the study after cl osure. 3.8 Restrictions There are no specific dietary or activi ty restri ctions. For restricted concomitant medicat ions see Section 7.7. 3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product (IP) If the patient temporarily or permanent ly discontinues from IP, it is important that the scheduled study visit s, data collect ion and procedures continue according to the stu dy protocol until study closure (see Secti on 3.9.3 ). Patients m ay be di scontinued from IP in the fo llowing si tuations: 1. Patient deci sion. The pati ent is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without prejudice to further treatment. 2. AE or other safet y reasons that, in the opinion o f the invest igator, contraindicates further dosing with IP."

DKA, consider to temporary interrupt IP if DKA is suspected. If DKA is confirmed, IP should be discont inued permanent ly. 5. Positive pregnancy test (di scont inue IP and notify AZ representative). 3.9.1 Evaluation of volume status and investigational product (IP) dose reduction/interruption Dapagliflozin is a SGLT2 inhibitor which by it s mechanism of action reduces the reabsorption of glucose and sodi um in the proximal tubules in the kidney . SGLT2 inhibit ion has a mild diuretic effect and an init ial haemodynamic change with an init ial increase in creatinine may occur. Unexpected acute declines in eGFR If an unexpected, acute decline in kidney function is observed, the patient should be evaluated. Volume deplet ion, hypotensio n, inter- current medical problems and concomitant drugs may cause increases in blood creatinine. Urinary tract infect ion and urinary obstructi on shoul d be considered (the latter especially in men). Several drugs may cause a decline in kidney funct ion, especially non -steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and certain ant ibiotics such as trimethoprim. If any drug is suspected of causing or contribut ing to worsening kidney funct ion, their use should be re -considered. Volume depletion/hypotension Patients wi th clinically relevant symptoms/signs o f suspected volume deplet ion and/or hypotension, should have their re gular medicati on reviewed, and consideration given to reducing the dose of, or stopping conco mitant non -essent ial medicat ions, as assessed on an individual basis, including diuret ics and drugs that lower blood pressure (except essential treatm ents –see be low). The need for convent ional diuret ics (or the dose of diuretic used) shoul d be re -evaluated in light of the patient’s symptoms and signs. In patients with heart failure, discont inuat ion of diuret ic should only be undertaken caut iously. Hy potensi on m ay also occur with other blood pressure lowering drugs and once again the need for (and dose of) non-essent ial agents of this ty pe (e.g., cal cium channel bl ockers, al pha adrenoceptor antagonists and nitrates) should also be re -considered. IP dose reduction If the above ment ioned measures do not lead to a reso lution of clinically relevant vol ume depletion, hypotension and/or unexpected worsening of kidney function, a dose reduction of IP to dapagliflozin 5 mg or matching placebo may be considered and the p atient’s condit ion re-evaluated after any dose adjust ment."
38,page_38,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 39 (102)Essential treatments Essential disease modifying/evidence based treatments such as ACE -I or ARBs or sacubitril/valsartan, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and beta -blockers for patients wi th HF, should NOT be reduced in dose or discontinued unless all other measures fail to improve the pati ent’s si tuation. In the setti ng of acute worsening of HF or other acute situations it may be acceptable to interrupt treatment on a temporary basis in ce rtain circumstances (eg, an ACE -I/ARB if the patient has experienced a significant deterioration in renal funct ion, a beta - blocker if the patient is unduly bradycardic or hy potensive, an MRA if the patient has hyperkalaemia). Patients at risk of volume dep letion Temporary interrupti on of IP m ay be considered in patients thought to be at risk o f volume depletion/hypotension, such as pat ients with an acute m edical illness potentially causing volume depletion because of inadequate fluid intake or fluid/blood loss (e.g., gastroenteritis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage), or those undergoing major surgery . 3.9.2 Investigational product (IP) restart or dose increase from dapagliflozin 5 mg to 10 mg or matching placebo Restart of rando mised IP is always encouraged. Whenev er possible, rando mised IP should be restarted if stopped or the dose increased if previously reduced. Even if a premature treatment discontinuat ion visit (PTDV) was completed due to discont inuat ion of IP, this should not prevent the patient to return to randomised IP if deemed appropriate. Every attem pt shoul d be made to m aintain patients on dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo during the course of the study . If the dose has been decreased to 5 mg or interrupted, the dose should be increased back to dapagliflo zin 10 m g or m atching placebo or re - introduced as soon as, in the opinio n of the invest igator, the patient’s condit ion is stable. 3.9.3 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product (IP) At any time, pati ents are free to dis continue IP. A patient that decides to discont inue will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, the patient will be seen and assessed by an invest igator. Adverse events will be fo llowed up, see Section 6, and all IP should be returned by the pat ient. Generally AEs, SAEs and potential endpo int events should not lead to IP discont inuat ion, unless there is a clear clinical rationale to do so. Discontinuati on from IP is not th e sam e as co mplete wi thdrawal from the study . If a pati ent is completely wi thdrawn from study , see Secti on 3.10.2 ."
39,page_39,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 40 (102)It is essent ial to collect data for all pat ients throughout the study . Optimally , a pati ent wh o discontinue fro m IP shoul d for that reason attend all study visit s according to plan until study closure. Al ternat ively, if the patient does not agree to this approach, modified fo llow-up should be arranged. Pati ents who agree to some kind of modified follow up are still participat ing in the study. The modified visit s and procedures that are done will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If a patient for some reason cannot be reached during the study , every attem pt shoul d be made to retrieve as much informat ion regarding this patient as possible. The site should continuously try to reach the pati ent, the patient’s family or pre -ident ified contact person and search for informat ion regarding the patient’s status in applicable sources to protect the validit y of data. The attempts should be registered in the medical records. 3.9.3.1 Patient undergoes the premature treatment discontinuation visit (PTDV) and continues according to plan The preferred follow -up approach for all patients who prematu rely and permanent ly discontinue IP i s that the pati ent undergoes the premature treatment discont inuat ion visit (PTDV) and then cont inues study visits according to plan (see Table 1). The PTDV should be done as soon as possible a fter last IP dose. 3.9.3.2 Patient agrees to undergo modified follow -up If the patient does not agree to continue study visits according to plan, but agrees to undergo modified fo llow up, a PTDV should be done (see Section 4.2.6 ). The subsequent visits until the study closure will be done as modified follow -up (e.g., less frequent visits, regular telephone contacts, a contact at study closure, or other m eans) in order to ascertain whether any endpo ints or safet y events have occurred. 3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 3.10.1 Screen failures Screen failures are enrolled pat ients who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and therefore m ust not be randomised. These patients should have the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Scre en Failure’ (i.e., patient does not meet the required inclusio n/exclusio n criteria) in the eCRF. This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not rando mised pat ients). 3.10.2 Withdrawal of informed consent Patients are free to withdraw fro m the study at any time (IP and assessments), without prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawal o f consent should only occur if the pat ient does not agree to any kind of further assessments or contact whatsoever. If agreed by the patient, a PTDV should be perform ed. Discont inuat ion of IP in itself is not considered withdrawal of consent."
40,page_40,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 41 (102)Withdrawal o f consent m ust be ascertained and documented in writ ing by the investigator who must inform the AZ representative and document the wit hdrawal o f consent in the eCRF and medical records. A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AE. The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs reported outside of the clinical study . If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrolment and rando misat ion codes cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. Data generated to the time of complete withdrawal from the study will not be destroyed. To ensure validit y of study data, i t is very imp ortant to collect as much data as possible throughout the study and especially vital status (dead or alive) at study closure (also for patients who have withdrawn their informed consent). The invest igator will therefore attempt to collect informat ion on a ll pat ients’ vital status from publicly available sources at study closure, even if informed consent has been withdrawn completely , in com pliance wi th local privacy laws/pract ices. 3.11 Discontinuation of the study The study may be stopped if, in the judgment o f AstraZeneca, patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically relevant findings. The judgment may be based on recommendat ions from the DMC, see DMC Charter for details. The study can also be stopped based on results of the interim analysis (see Secti on 8.5.6 ). In terminat ing the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the protecti on of the pati ents’ interests."

SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT The Principal Invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all personnel invo lved in the study are familiar with the content of this section. 6.1 Definition of adverse events (AEs) An AEis the development of an undesirable medical condit ion or the deteri oration of a pre - exist ing medical condit ion following or duri ng exposure to a pharmaceut ical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical co ndition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal resul ts of an invest igation (e.g., laboratory findings, ECG). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condit ion occurring a t any time, including run -in or washout periods, even if no study treatm ent has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs. The term AE in this docum ent refers only to the categori es of events described in Sect ion 6.3. 6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event (SAE) An SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, washout, follow - up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing criteria:  Results in death  Is immediately life -threatening  Requi res in -patienthospi talisat ionor prol ongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion  Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of the abilit y to conduct normal life functions  Is a cong enital abnorm ality or bi rth defect  Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may requi re medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix A."
62,page_62,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 63 (102)6.3 Recording of adverse events 6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events AEs will be co llected fro mrando misat ion (Visit 2) throughout the treatment period until and including the patient’s last visit. SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent throughout the treatment period until and including the patient's last visit. AEs shoul d be recorded in the eCRF only if:  It qualifies as an SAE (as defined in Sect ion 6.2)  The AE is the reason for perm anent di scontinuat ion from IP (DAE )  The AE is the reason for IP interruption or dose reduction  It qualifies as an AE of interest : Volume deplet ion Renal events Major hypoglycaemic events Fractures Potenti al DKAs AEs leading to amputation and A Es leading to a risk for l ower limb amputati ons (“preceding events”) A potential endpo int (see Secti on 5.1) that fulfils the AE criteria. NB: not all potential endpo ints are per definit ion an AE, e.g. a potential endpo int solely related to l aboratory findings (see Section 6.3.5 ) shoul d not be recorded unless any of the above ment ioned criteria is met. An AE/SAE could be associated with more than one potential endpo int. In such scenario, only one AE/SAE shoul d be reported but all potential endpo ints should be reported individually . 6.3.2 Adverse events of interest 6.3.2.1 Volume depletion Events of vo lume deplet ion (e.g., dehy dration, hypovol emia, or hy potensi on) will be recorded in the eCRF as AEs."
63,page_63,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 64 (102)6.3.2.2 Renal events Renal events, such as an acute clinically relevant decline in kidney function as judged by the investigator, will be recorded in the eCRF as AEs. If the event also qualifies as a potential endpo int as defined in Section 5.1.4 , a separate eC RF will also be co mpleted. 6.3.2.3 Major hypoglycaemic event A major hypoglycaemic event is defined as an event that requires assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrates, glucagon, or take other corrective actions. Plasma glucose concentr ations m ay not be available during an event, but neurological recovery following the correcti ve acti ons is considered sufficient evidence that the event was induced by a low pl asma gl ucose concentrati on. Maj or hypoglycaemic episodes will be recorded in th e eCRF as an AE and on an addit ional eCRF page. 6.3.2.4 Fractures All fractures will be recorded in the eCRF as AEs. 6.3.2.5 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) All potential events of DKA will be recorded in the eCRF and submitted to an independent DKA Adjudicat ion Co mmit tee, see Section 6.8.5 . 6.3.2.6 Adverse events (AEs) leading to amputation and AEs leading to a risk for lower limb amputations (“preceding events”) To ensure that data on amputations is systemat ically collected, am putati ons and underlying condi tions will be recorded on a specific eCRF page. The adverse event leading to amputation shoul d be recorded in the eCRF as AE/SAE. In addit ion, non- serious and seri ous AEs putting the patient at risk for a lower limb amputati on (“preceding events”) s hould also be recorded i n the eCRF as AE/SAE whether or not it is leading to an amputation. The lower limb “preceding events” of interest are vascular, diabetic foot related, wounds, infect ions and neuropathies for which addit ional information will be co llected (for details see eCRF instruction). 6.3.1 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are fo llowed up by the Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional inform ation for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary . 6.3.2 Variables The fo llowing variables will be collect for each AE:"

Severit y is a measure of intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria described in Sect ion 6.2. An AE of severe intensit y need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limi ted degree of disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2."
65,page_65,"Clinical Study Protocol Drug Substance Dapagliflozin Study Code D1699C00001 Version 2.0 Date 26 October 2017 66 (102)6.3.3 Causality collection The invest igator will assess causal relat ionship between the IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a reasonable possibilit y that the event may have been caused by the invest igational product?’ For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’. A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y question is found in Appendix A. 6.3.4 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms All AEs spontaneously reported by the pati entor reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems sinc e the previous visit/you were last asked?’ , or reveal ed by observati on will be co llected and recorded in the eCRF (if fulfilling the criteria as specified in Sect ion 6.3.1 ). When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is pref erred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis i s known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 6.3.5 Adverse events based on examinations and tests The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vi tal signs will be summarised in the CSR. Deteri oration as com pared wi th baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory values, vital signs shoul d therefore onl y be reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the investigational product. If deteri oration in a laboratory value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or s ymptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting invest igator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low Hb val ue). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s). 6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally relat ed to the invest igational product, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF. If any SAE occurs in the course of the study , then investi gators or other si te personnel inform the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it . The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all the necessary informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data en try site within 1"

For fatal or life -threatening AE where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active follow-up is undertaken immediately. Invest igators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up informat ion on a previously reported SAE within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of i t. Once the invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative. If the WBDC system is not available, then the investigator or other site personnel reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone in accordance with SAE reporting timelines. The AstraZeneca representative will advise the investigator/site personnel how to proceed. 6.4.1 Reporting of SAEs considered to be po tential endpoints In order to avoid unnecessary unblinding of efficacy endpoint events, certain SAEs which are also potential endpo ints (i.e., fatal AEs and HF events) will not be reported to health authori ties Clinical data for the above ment ioned events will be recorded as AEs/SAEs as well as on separate event forms in the eCRF. Recording of a suspected endpoint should be done within the same t imeframes as defined for SAEs (see Section 6.4). In addit ion, fatal AEs and potenti al HF endpoints will be centrally adjudicated by an independent CEA committee (see Section 5.1.1 and 6.8.4 ). If adjudicat ion confirms the endpo int, the SAE will not be reported to health authoritie s.However, if it is determined by the CEA committee that a potential endpo int does not meet the endpo int criteria, the event will be reported (according to the timelines specified in Section 6.4) to AZ pati ent safet y data entry site and if applicable to the healt h authorit ies (note that the clock starts when the adjudicat ion results are available). 6.5 Overdose Dapagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 500 mg/day in single dose testing in healt hy vo lunteers and up to 100 mg/day in repeat dose testing for 14 days in healt hy volunteers and patients with T2D. Suspected single intake of more than 50 tablets of 10 mg dapagliflozin tablets or repeated intake of more than 10 tablets of 10 mg dapagliflozin tablets shoul d be r eported on the eCRF overdose module. If an overdose is suspected, monitoring of vital functions as well as treatment should be performed as appropriate.

The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the invest igator to ensure that all relevant informat ion is provided to the AZ Patient Safet y data entry site. For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting t imelines apply, see Sect ion 6.4. For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s. 6.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AZ. 6.6.1 Maternal exposure If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study IP shoul d be discont inued immediately . Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that the investigat ional product under study may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital abnormalit ies/bi rth defects and spontaneous miscarri ages shoul d be reported a nd handled as SAEs. Elect ive abortions without complicat ions should not be handled as AEs.

Also in situations when the patient is not on IP, treatment with open label SGLT2 inhibitors during the study , coul d interfere wi th the interpretation of study resul ts and shoul d therefore not be given unless all other possibilit ies to treat the patient properly has been considered . 7.7.2 Recording of concomitant treatment Detailed recording o f medications rel ated to HF (see Section 7.7.3), diabetes (see Section 7.7.4 ) as well as other relevant cardiovascular medicat ions (e.g., statins, ant ihypertensive and antithrombotic agents) will be made throughout the study . In addit ion, all conco mitant medicat ions will be recorded at the time o f any SAEs, potential endpoints and AEs of interest (as defined in sect ion 6.3.2 and 6.4). Also, cardiac and heart failure related procedures will be captured during the study (see Secti on 7.7.5.1 ).Recording of other concomitant medications will be made at randomis ation (visi t2) and at SCV. 7.7.3 Heart failure (HF) medications To be eligible, the patient shoul d be on background standard of care therapies for HF according to local guidelines. Standard evidence based treatments will include eit her an ACE inhibitor, ARB o r sacubitril/valsartan in co mbinat ion with a beta -blocker, as well as an MRA where appropriate unless contraindicated or not tolerated. If the patient for any reason is not on background standard of care medicat ions at baseline, the reason for this will b e recorded i n the eCRF. Most patients will also require a diuret ic, generally a loop diuretic such as furosemide, to control symptoms. Optimizat ion of volume status, and proactive adjust ment of di uretic doses may help minimize any deleteri ous effects on hypovo lemia/vo lume depletion accentuated by the diuret ic effects of the IP. Patients shoul d remain on stable doses of medications which will allow assessment of incremental dapagliflozin effect. Dose reduction or discontinuation o f proven effect ive therapies shoul d be avoi ded unless all other measures fail to improve the patient’s situat ion. In heart failure, use of ACE -I/ARBs, Sacubitril/Valsartan, mineralocortico ids and beta - blockers is supported by evidence from previ ous clinical tri als. However, i f the pat ient’s condi tion warrants a change in any of these standard evidence based medicat ions, it will be allowed at the discret ion of the invest igator. If patients require dose adjustment of background therapy to avoi d signs/symptom s of vol ume depleti on, diuretics should be decreased prior to adjust ing other medicat ions."

Furtherm ore it is expected that some patients will develop T2D during the course of the study .

In bri ef, the ADA/EASD recommends lowering HbA1c to < 7.0% in most patients. Less stringent HbA1c goals, e.g., 7.5 to 8% or even slight ly higher may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hy poglycaemia, advanced complicat ions, extensive comorbid condit ions and those in whom the target is difficult to attain despite intensive self- management education, repeated counselling, and effect ive doses of mult iple glucose- lowering agents, including ins ulin. 7.7.4.2 Treatment of patients with established diagnosis of type 2 diabetes Patients wi th T2D at randomisat ion will cont inue their T2D treatment. Patients are eligible for adjustments in their ant i-diabetes treatm ent at the discret ion of their diabetes he alth care provi der. Di abetes m edicati ons at baseline and any changes throughout the study , will be recorded in the eCRF. 7.7.4.3 Use of medications known to cause hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycaemia . Therefore, patients treated with insulin or SU have a higher risk of experiencing hypoglycaemic events com pared with those treated wi th other anti diabetic agents. Therefore a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogues may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combinat ion with study medicat ion. Reduction o finsulin by 10 -20% (total daily dose) and SU by 25- 50% and increased frequency of blood gl ucose m onitoring may be consi dered in pati ents receiving insulin and/or SU and wi th baseline HbA1c <7% at randomisat ion. 7.7.5 Other concomitant treatment Medicat ions other than described above, which is considered necessary for the patient’s safet y and wellbeing, may be given at the discret ion of the invest igator and recorded in the appro priate sections of the eCRF as applicable. 7.7.5.1 Cardiac and heart failure related procedures During the course of the study , inform ation will be recorded regarding any cardiac and heart failure rel ated procedures in a specific eCRF module. The procedures will b e collected from time of rando misat ion to SCV. Procedures include but are not limited to: PCI/CABG, pacemaker implantation, mechanical fluid removal etc."

STATIS TICAL ANALYSES BY AS TRAZENECA 8.1 Statistical considerations All personnel invo lved wit h the analysis o f the study will remain blinded unt il database lock and protocol vio lations have been ident ified and documented. A co mprehensive Statist ical Analysis Plan (S AP) will be developed prior to first patient rando mised and any subsequent amendments will be documented, with final amendments completed pri or to unblinding of the data . The results of the key study outcom e will be independent ly validated by an external statisti cal team . 8.2 Sample size estimate The primary object ive of the study is to determine the superiorit y of dapagliflo zin versus placebo in reducing the incidence of the primary com posite endpoint. Assuming a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80 between dapagli flozin and placebo, using a one -sided alpha of 2.5%, 844 primary endpoint events will provide a statist ical power of 90% for the test of the primary composite endpoint . Thi s is based on an overall 1:1 allocat ion between dapagliflozin and placebo. The stu dy is event -driven. The assumed HR of 0.80 is considered as clinically relevant and has taken into account the HF outcomes in the EMPA -REG tri al. With an annual event rate of 11% in the placebo treatment group, 4500 patients are estimated to provi de the r equired number of primary events, based on an anticipated recruit ment period of 18 m onths and an average fo llow-up peri od of approximately 24 m onths. The assumed placebo event rate of 11% is based on a review of recently published clinical studies in the HFrEF populat ion, including the PARADIGM -HF tri al. This study is a group sequent ial design study with one interim analysis using Haybittle -Peto boundary (a one -sided alpha=0.001), leaving a one -sided alpha of 2.496% for the final analysis. In addit ion, the expected number of patients who will be lost to fo llow-up is expected to be small; hence, these are not considered in the determinat ion of the sample size. 8.3 Definitions of analysis sets 8.3.1 Full analysis set All patients who have been randomised to study treatment will be included in the Full analysis set (FAS) irrespect ive of their protocol adherence and cont inued participat ion in the study . Patients will be analysed according to their randomised IP assignment, irrespect ive of the treatm ent actually receive d. The FAS will be considered the primary analysis set for the primary and secondary variables and for the exploratory efficacy variables."

Patients will be analysed according to the treatment actually received. The Safety analysis set will be considered the primary analysis set for all safet y variables. 8.4 Outcome measures for analyses 8.4.1 Primary outcome measure The primary outcom emeasures are detailed in Section 2.1. 8.4.2 Secondary outcome measure The secondary outcome m easures are detailed in Section 2.2. 8.4.3 Safety outcome measure The safet y outco me measures are detailed in Sect ion 2.3. 8.4.4 Exploratory outcome measure The exploratory outcom e measures are detailed in Section 2.4. 8.5 Methods for statistical analyses 8.5.1 Hypotheses The Ty pe I error rate for the analysis of the primary endpo int will be adjusted for the interim analyses performed by the DMC. For the primary endpoint the following hypothesis will be tested at the 2.496% 1 -sided level: H0: HR [dapagliflo zin:placebo] ≥1 Versus H1: HR [dapag liflozin:placebo] <1 8.5.2 Closed testing procedure A closed testing procedure including a pre -specified hierarchical ordering of the primary and secondary endpoints will be utilized. The Ty pe I error will be controlled at a one -sided 0.02496 l evel for m ultiplicity across primary and secondary endpoints and in considerat ion of planned interim analyses. Statistical significance will be assessed in the pre -specified order of the endpo ints as specified in Sect ion 2.1and 2.2. The testing procedure will cont inue down the hierarchy if the preceding endpo int is rej ected at a one -sided 0.02496 l evel and will stop if the preceding endpo int is not rej ected at a one -sided 0.02496 level. Exploratory endpoints will be tested at a one -sided 0.025 l evel wi thout adjust ment for multiplicity.

The primary analysis will be based on the ITT pri nciple using the FAS, using events adjudicated and confirmed by CEA. In the analysis o f the primary com posite endpoint, treatm ents (dapagliflozin versus placebo) will be co mpared using a Cox proportional hazards model wit h a factor for treatment group, stratified by T2D status at randomisat ion, and adjusting for history ofhospi talisat ionfor heart failure. In general, the analysis will use each pat ient's last contact as the censoring date for patients wi thout any primary events. The p -value, HR and 95% c onfidence interval will be reported. The contribut ion of each component of the primary co mposite endpo int to the overall treatm ent effect will be examined. Methods similar to th ose described for the primary analysis will be used to separately analyze th e time fro mrando misat ionto the first occurrence of each com ponent of the primary com posite endpoint. Last contact will be treated as the censoring date for patients without the endpoint of interest. HR and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulat ive incidence to the first occurrence of any event in the primary endpoint will be calculated and plotted, for overall analysis and for the individual components. 8.5.4 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) The time -to-event sec ondary variables will be analysed in the similar manner as the primary variable, including time to the first occurrence of hospitalisat ion for HF or CV death, time to the first occurrence of any of the com ponents of the renal co mposite endpo int, and time t o death fro m any cause. A co mposite outcome of all HF hospitalisat ions (first and recurring) and CV death will be analysed by the semi -parametri c proporti onal rates m odel (Lin et al 2000 ) to test the treatment effect and to quantify the treatment difference. Other analysis methods may also be considered. Change from baseline to each visit for KCCQ will be analysed with a repeated measures method. This model will be used to assess the time point of 8 months, alth ough summaries at all visits will also be presented. A responder analysis, where a response is defined as a clinically meaningful change of 5 or more points of the Total Symptom Score, will also be perform ed. 8.5.5 Subgroup analysis Subgroup variables for the p rimary efficacy endpoint and secondary efficacy endpo ints include demography , baseline disease characterist ics, baseline conco mitant medicat ions and others. Cox proportional hazard model, the semi -param etric proporti onal rates m odel, or the repeated m easures m odel will be perform ed to examine treatment effects within relevant"

The p -values for the subgroup analyses will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons as the tests are exploratory and will be interpreted descript ively. Treatm ent differences with 95% confidence intervals will be reported for each subgroup. HRs and CIs for overall analysis and subgroups will be presented with forest plots as well. Further details o f the subgroup analysis, including the list of subgroup variabl es, will be provided in the SAP. 8.5.6 Interim analysis An interim analysis is planned to be performed when 75% of the primary events are adjudicated, using a Haybitt le-Peto rul e. There will in principle be one planned interim analysis, with the possibilit y of the DMC to do subsequent interim analysis if they deem necessary . The significance level for final analysis will be determined by the Haybittle -Peto funct ion based on the actual number and timing of interim analyses. The interim analysis will assess sup eriority of dapaglifl ozin to pl acebo. The interim analysis will have a one -sided alpha level of 0.001. At the interim analysis, the primary com posite endpoint will be first ly tested at the specified alpha level. If superiorit y is achieved for the primar y endpo int, then the superi ority of dapagliflozin to placebo on CV deaths will be tested at a one -sided l evel of 0.001. If CV death is significant, then an act ion is triggered whereby the DMC will evaluate the totalit y of the efficacy data and safet y data, to determine if benefit is unequivocal and overwhelming such that the DMC recommends ending the study . 8.5.7 Sensitivity analysis Details o f the sensit ivity analysis will be provided in the SAP. 8.5.8 Analysis of safety variables The number and percent of patients with SAEs, DAEs, AEs leading to dose reductions and temporary interrupti ons, and AEs of interest, will be summarized by treatm ent group. Changes in clinical chemistry /haematol ogyparameters will be summarized over time by treatm ent group.

Hospitalisation Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE , although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissio ns and/or surgi cal operati ons planned before or during a study are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patientwas enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study . Important medic al event or medical intervention Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important m edical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi talisat ion, disabili tyor incapaci ty but may jeopardize the patient or may requi re medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These should usually be considered as serious. Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgement must be used.  Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone treatm ent  Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcystein e  Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  Blood dy scrasia (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi talisat ion  Development of drug dependency or drug abuse A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the fo llowing factors when deciding if there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug."

Has the patient actually received the suspect drug? Di d the AE occur i n a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect drug?  Consistency wit h known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical properties?  De-challenge experience. Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose of the suspect drug ?  No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca (AZ) would not normally reco mmend or support a re-challenge .  Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship . In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such a s:  Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?  Is there a known mechanism? Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual cas e. The expressio n ‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship. The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough inform ation to m ake an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the case, i t is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’. Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study has deteri orated due to l ack of effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y."

For transport purposes the classificat ion of infectious substances according to risk groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions (DGR) in the 46th edit ion (2005). I nfect ious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt. There i s no di rect relati onship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever virus:  are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602. Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for inclusio n in Category A. Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, Hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ty pes 1 and 2. They are assigned th e following UN number and proper shipping name:  UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category B  are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650 Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens  Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations  Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging  Biological samples transported in dry ice requi re addi tional dangerous goods specification f or the dry -ice content  IATA co mpliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as applicable  Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to local reg ulations which requi re that they are al so packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to contain any risk of infect ion or contaminat ion by using approved couriers and packaging / containment materials at all times. The IATA 650 bio logical sample containment standards are encouraged wherever possible when road or rail transport is used."
