Other Assessments: • Hair quality assessment including normalization of exclamation point hairs and hair shedding will be described. • Vellus and Indeterminate scalp hair will be described. • Non-scalp hair assessments (body and nasal hair) will be described. Pharmacokinetic: The concentration of ATI-502 in the blood predose at Visit 2 and at trough at Visit 4, Visit 6 and Visit 9 will be measured by a bioanalytical lab using fully validated analytical methods. Safety: • Safety variables to be assessed include: adverse events, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign measurements (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respiration rate, heart rate, and oral body temperature), and electrocardiograms. Statistical Methods: Sample Size / Power Calculations The planned sample size is approximately 95 enrolled subjects with approximately 45 subjects enrolled with AT or AU. The sample size estimate wa s based on published results from a similar study (Crispin et al. 2016) where 32% of subject s receiving active drug achieved at least a 50% relative reduction in hair loss (SALT 50) under similar conditions. For the current study, the primary efficacy analysis is mean % change in hair loss, evaluated using SALT scores. That analysis is expected to have greater statistical sensitivity than the SALT 50 responder analysis, which is also a secondary efficacy analysis in the current study. We assume the pooled results of 600mg and 800mg treatment groups in the current study will achieve the same or higher SALT 50 response rate (32%) as the published results above, and pooled Vehicle plus 400mg treatment groups will not achieve more than a 6% SALT 50 response rate. Based on a comparison of those two pooled groups, the current study is anticipated to have no less than 80% power with a 10% subject dropout rate for the SALT 50 analysis. Because the primary efficacy analysis of mean percent reduction in hair loss using SALT scores is expected to be more sensitive than the SALT 50 responder analysis, t he power for the primary analysis is also expected to be no less than 80%. Statistical Methods The primary efficacy variable will be the percent change from Baseline in the SALT score at Week 24 (Visit 9 ). This represents the percentage of hair regrowth. It will be calculated as the change from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 24 (Visit 9), divided by the baseline and expressed as a percentage. Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF ) methodology. The a nalysis will be conducted on the percent change from baseline over time including all visits using a mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) . The adjusted mean (LS Mean) for percent change from baseline in the SALT score at each visit, estimated from the MMRM, with the estimated standard error and 95% confidence interval (CI), will be presented in tabular and graphic format. The difference in the adjusted means between treatment groups and the associated 95% CI of the difference will be pro vided. No adjustment for multiplicity will be made. The model"

The primary analysis will be based on the Intent- to- Treat (ITT) population. Statistical signifi cance for primary efficacy endpoint will be declared if at least one treatment group comparison at the Week 24 visit has a two -sided p-value less than or equal to 0.05. Secondary Efficacy Analyses A secondary sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoin t will be conducted using the PP population. This analysis will use the same methodology as described for the primary analysis just applied to the PP population. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the change from Baseline in the ALODEX score , ASAA (CR & SR), AF HA (CR & SR) , PhGIS, SGIS, AIA, SGSHQ, and DLQI as well as the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 50% hair growth compared with Baseline based upon the SALT score and ALODEX score, separately . SGITS responses at Week 12, 24, and 28 will be summarized. Various secondary responder efficacy endpoints will be defined based upon the SALT score, the ALODEX score and the AAA (Clinician and Subject) questionnaires. Details of these responder definitions will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Global Impression of Change (Clinician and Subject) at Week 24 (Visit 9) will be used in the psychometric evaluation of the scores from the ASAA (CR and SR), respectively. Non -Scalp Hair Loss Assessment , Vellus an d Indeterminate Hair Assessment and Hair Q uality Assessment including normalization of exclamation point hairs and hair shedding will be described. The analysis for percent change in ALODEX score will used the same methodology as specified for the primary efficacy analysis. Other parameters will be analyzed as detailed in the statistical analysis plan. Data collected in this trial will be used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed patient -reported and clinician-reported outcome (PRO and ClinRO) questionnaires. A measurement -focused statistical analysis plan will detail the data analytic strategy used to achieve the measurement property and score interpretation objectives. The anticipated psychometric evaluation analyses for the newly developed PRO and ClinRO questionnaires may include the following: score description, score reliability, score construct -related validity and score interpretation. Pharmac okinetic Analyses The concentration of ATI -502 in the blood will be summarized (mean [SD], minimum, median maximum) predose at Visit 2 and at trough at Visit 4, 6, and 9. Safety Data Safety analyses will include descriptive statistics calculated on the safety parameters using the safety population. The proportion of subjects with treatment- emergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by treatment and Medical Dictionary for R egulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class. Vital signs and clinically significant abnormal laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented by treatment group. Data from all randomized and treated subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety summaries by study treatment group will include listings by study medication of adverse events incidences within each MedDRA System Organ Class, and changes from pre-dose values in vital signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented b y study medication showing the proportion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class."

INTRODUCTION Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. is developing ATI-501 for the treatment of alopecia areata, alopecia universalis, and alopecia totalis . ATI -501 is a potent highly selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3). 1.1. Overview of Alopecia Areata Alopecia areata (AA) is an autoimmune dermatologic condition, which, in its mildest form, is typically characterized by patchy non -scarring ha ir loss on the scalp and/or body. More severe forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis (AT), and total loss of all the hair on the scalp and body- importantly, including loss of eyebrows, eyelashes, and intranasal hair- known as alopecia universalis (AU). While spontaneous regrowth of hair is common in the milder form of AA (patchy), where the hair loss may wax and wane, in patients with the extensive hair loss of AT or AU, spontaneous hair regrowth is rare. AA affects both ma les and females across all ethnic groups and ages, and with a lifetime risk of 1.7% (Safavi 1995). About two-thirds of affected individuals are 30 years old or younger at the time of disease onset. The course of AA is unpredictable and while up to 50% of patients may recover within 1 year even without treatment, most patients will have more than one episode of hair loss (Price 2008). Factors portending a poorer prognosis for regrowth are more extensive hair loss presentations (extensive AA, AT, AU), an ophiasis pattern of hair loss, a long duration of hair loss, a positive family history, the presence of other autoimmune diseases, nail involvement, and young age of first onset (Tosti 2006, Weise 1996). In children, the disease may have a tendency towards worsening with time even if the initial presentation was mild, and the progressively disfiguring nature of the disease can be psychologically devastating. AA is highly associated with numerous psychiatric comorbidities including adjustment disorders, anxiety disorders and depression in both children and adults, and an effective treatment for AT and AU, the more severe forms of the disease, represents a significant unmet medical need (Bilgic 2014, Ruiz -Doblado 2003, Alkhalifah 2010). The clinical developm ent of innovative therapies in AA has lagged far behind other autoimmune conditions and there are currently no evidence- based treatments for AA. A Cochrane database review highlighted that few therapies for AA have been comprehensively evaluated in randomi zed clinical trials and that no treatment has demonstrated significant benefit compared to placebo according to evidence-based assessments (Delamere, 2008). This lack of good evidence -based data remains a challenge for physicians attempting to select efficacious treatments for their patients and, as a result, numerous approaches to treatment exist and are typically based on considerations such as the age of the patient, the extent and/or duration of the disease, patient expectations, cost considerations (both time and financial resources) and physician preferences and experience. Common treatments for the less severe (patchy) form of AA include corticosteroids, either topically applied or injected intralesionally into the alopecic areas, or the induction of an allergic reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent- an approach known as topical immunotherapy - typically with the topical contact sensitizers diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), squaric acid dibutyl ester (SADBE), or treat ment with topical anthralin. While these same treatment options may be utilized for the more severe forms of AA, their use in the more"
19,page_19,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 20 of 90 CONFIDENTAL severe forms of AA is limited not only due to limited efficacy, but also because of the impracticality of using them ove r extensive body surface areas. Additional treatments used for extensive forms of AA (AT, AU) have included systemic steroids (pulsed or chronically administered), immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine or methotrexate, phototherapy with psoralen + UVA (PUVA), narrow -band UVB, photodynamic therapy (PDT), laser therapy (e.g., excimer laser, fractional photothermolysis lasers), prostaglandin analogs, etanercept, bexarotene and others, all with varying degrees of success and each with its inherent risk of adverse effects and unproven efficacy (Alkhalifah 2010, Price 1999, Hordinsky 2015, Strober 2005). Most recently, however, a breakthrough in the understanding of the pathophysiology of AA and several case reports in the literature have suggested that a group of inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway, the Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors, or “jakinibs” may be efficacious in the treatment of AA even in its most severe phenotypes, AT and AU (Jabbari, 2015, Pieri, 2015, Xing 2014). The JAKs are members of a famil y of tyrosine kinases that are involved in cytokine receptor signaling. The JAK family of enzymes (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, Tyk2) plays an essential role in regulating the signaling process of most cytokines in cells by linking the cytokine -induced signaling fro m the cell surface membrane receptors to signal transducers and activators of transcription, or STATs, within the cells. Once these JAK receptors are activated by the binding of a cytokine to the appropriate receptor, they initiate a JAK- STAT signaling pathway which can modify gene expression and modulate important regulatory functions in the cell, including regulating immune and inflammatory responses. JAK1 and JAK3 are constitutively associated with the alpha chain and the common gamma chain (γc), respec tively, of the receptors for interleukin -2 (IL2), interleukin- 4 (IL -4), interleukin- 7 (IL -7) interleukin -9 (IL -9), interleukin-15 (IL-15), and interleukin-21 (IL-21). When these cytokines bind to their respective receptors, JAK1 and JAK3 are activated and initiate a signaling cascade that drives key inflammatory events, including lymphocyte activation and proliferation. The JAK inhibitors can block the cytokine receptor signaling pathways, (in this instance JAK1 and JAK3) blocking JAK- STAT transcription activation, and can therefore modulate inflammatory or immune responses, which can be beneficial in a variety of disease states, particularly, as recently reported, AA (Xing 2014). In that report, pharmacologic inhibition of JAK kinase signaling (JAK- STAT signaling) was reported to promote hair growth in both genetic mouse models of alopecia and in human patients. 1.2. Immunopathology & Pathophysiology of AA Alopecia areata (AA) results from an autoimmune attack on the hair follicles that results in growing anag en-phase terminal hairs being induced to prematurely enter the telogen-phase and then shed. In its most acute state, AA demonstrates a histopathologically characteristic white cell infiltrate - the so called “swarm of bees” - encircling the human hair follicle, though more chronic forms typically demonstrate a sparser infiltrate (Jabbari 2016, Whiting 2003). Though the exact autoantigens expressed in the perifollicular epithelium that allow these specific T -cells to infiltrate the normally immunologically pr ivileged hair follicle have been previously unknown, the T-cells that home to the hair follicle have been demonstrated to consist of both CD4 and CD8 cells. Most recent studies have further characterized a specific subpopulation of activated NKG2D -bearing CD8+ T -cells as being prominent in the peribulbar infiltrate, and it is"
20,page_20,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 21 of 90 CONFIDENTAL now currently felt that these CD8+NKG2D+ effector T -cells preferentially localize to dermal sheath cells aberrantly expressing high levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and NKG2D ligands. Interferons, as key activators of the MHC locus and of the cellular immune response, appear to play a key role in eliminating the immunologic privilege of the hair follicle and in inducing and maintaining the pathologic inflammatory response in AA. This is also seen in the C3H-HeJ mouse model of AA, in which IFN- γ is required for pathogenesis, and in which administration of IFN- γ accelerates disease. (Gilhar 2005, Hirota 2003). AA has been viewed as a Th1-driven disease and, consistent with a pathogenic cellular immune response, elevated Th1 cytokines/ chemokines (IFN-induced chemokines [IP-10/CXCL10]) are seen in the peripheral blood of AA patients and IFN- inducible gene signatures have been described in the skin of AA patients and may correlate with disease activity (Arca 2004, Barahmani 2009, Kuwano 2007). Additionally, transcriptional profiles in human AA patients have shown a Type I IFN response in lesional biopsies and Th1 skewing and elevated IFN response cytokines/chemokines in both the peripheral blood and in reviewed scalp biopsies (Jabbari 2015, Xing 2014, Jabbari 2016). The cellular source of IFN- γ is hypothesized to be the T-cells, as in the AA mouse model IFN -gamma producing CD8+NKG2D+ cells dominate the dermal hair follicle infiltrate, and in human AA, IFN- γ producing cells were identified in 4 of 5 dermal crawl -out assays (Christiano 2016). Additionally, data implicate IL- 15 in driving activation of IFN-producing CD8 T-cells (Xing 2014). Thus, preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine mediated (primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL-15 and IFN gamma) induction of and prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle. Inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate the effects of both IFN- gamma (through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL-15 (through inhibition at bot h JAK1 and JAK 3), and several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JAK1/3 inhibitors to induce hair growth in patients with AA (Kim 2017, Craiglow 2014 and 2017, Gupta 2016, Scheinberg 2016). As ATI-501 is a poten t inhibitor at JAK 1 and JAK 3, it is strongly suggested that ATI-501 may be effective in the treatment of AA. Among patients with AA, patients with higher disease burdens are unlikely to have satisfactory outcomes with current therapies. Aclaris Therapeut ics, Inc. is developing ATI- 501 as a treatment for stable patchy AA, AU or AT. ATI-501 is an oral prodrug that is rapidly converted presystemically to ATI -502, a potent highly selective inhibitor of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Janus kinase 3 (JAK3). This study will evaluate whether or not the orally administered JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor prodrug , ATI -501, will attenuate both IL -15 and IFN- gamma signaling, thereby blocking re-activation of CD8+NKG2D+ memory T-cells, and aborting the cytotoxic T-cell inflammatory r esponse underlying AA. 1.3. Previous Clinical Study Experience with ATI-501 Eight Phase 1 clinical studies were conducted with ATI -501 oral doses ranging from single ascending doses of ATI-501 of 50 mg to 500 mg and multiple ascending doses of 200, 400 mg, 600 mg and 800 mg BID for 14 days. A total of 186 healthy volunteers were exposed to oral"
21,page_21,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 22 of 90 CONFIDENTAL doses of ATI-501. Single and twice -daily doses of ATI-501 were well -tolerated. There were no SAEs reported in the eight completed clinical studies. In study ATI-50001- AUAT -106, the multiple ascending dose study, 54 subjects received doses up to 800 mg BID for 14 days. The most frequently reported treatment related adverse events (TRAE) reported in more than 1 subject were: headache (14.8%), abdominal discomfort (9.3%), decreased appetite (9.3%), dizziness (7.4%), somnolence (7.4%), diarrhea (5.6%), dry skin (5.6%), nausea (5 .6%), constipation (3.7%), dyspepsia (3.7%), feeling hot (3.7%) and paresthesia (3.7%). No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed. There were no clinically significant findings from 12 -lead ECGs . One subject experienced a transient elevation in blood pressure (pre -dose 126/85mmHg, 4 hours post dose 142/104 mm/Hg) which was assessed as clinically significant by the investigator. The subjects blood pressure returned to w ithin normal limits at all other assessed timepoints throughout the study. There were no other clinically significant findings from vital signs assessments. In study , ATI -50001- AUAT -106, ATI -501 was not detected in plasma and there was a dose- related increase in plasma of the active metabolite ATI -502. Systemic levels of ATI-502, following oral doses of ATI-501 in healthy volunteers transiently reduced pSTAT5 activity in ex vivo IL -2 stimulated lymphocytes, indicating inhibition of the JAK signaling pathway. Upon multiple dosing, pSTAT5 activity showed a more sustained inhibition during the dosing period. Non-clinical studies conducted with oral administration of ATI -501 support the oral administration of ATI -501 (ATI-501 Investigator Brochure). 1.4. Study Rationale Preclinical and preliminary clinical information, as discussed above, strongly suggests that the primary pathophysiologic mechanism in AA (including AT and AU) is a cytokine- mediated (primarily through T -lymphocyte induced upregulation of IL-15 and IFN gamma) induction of and prolonged maintenance of the telogen stage of the hair cycle. Inhibitors of the JAK/STAT pathway, particularly JAK1 and JAK3, are known to downregulate the effects of both IFN- gamma (through the inhibition at JAK1), and IL-15 (through inhibition at both JAK1 and JAK 3), and several published case reports have demonstrated the potential for compounds that are JAK1/3 inhibitors to induce hair growth in patients with AA. As ATI-501 is a potent inhibitor at JAK 1 and JAK 3, it is strongly suggested that ATI- 501 may be effective in the treatment of AA. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ATI -501 Oral Suspension, 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg compared to P lacebo Oral Suspension taken with food, twice -daily for 24 weeks. Subjects with hair loss due to AA, AU or AT ranging from 30% to 100% based on the SALT score will be included in this study. In prior published studies, assessment of efficacy of treatment of AA was based on hair regrowth as determined by changes in the SALT score (Olsen 2016). Both the SALT and ALODEX scores will be measured electronically using an iPad. The SALT score is a measurement based on the SALT I diagram, that quantifies the amount of scalp without any hair. The ALODEX score is a measurement of the amount of scalp with hair loss and is based on the SALT II diagram (Olsen, submitted) . The SALT II diagram breaks the scalp"
22,page_22,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 23 of 90 CONFIDENTAL surface area from the SALT I diagram into 1% scalp surface areas and allows the investigator to assign a 10 -point density rating to each area from 0 = no hair loss to 10 = complete baldness. The ALODEX score is a summation of all density ratings in each 1% scalp area. By assessing hair density in each of the 1% scalp areas, the use of the SALT II visual aid allows the following to be tracked: amount of absolute hair loss (ALODEX score), spe cific areas of baldness (all 1% areas are numbered), small changes in density that may otherwise go undetected with original SALT I score, percentage of scalp surface involved with any hair loss and thus needing to be treated topically, new areas of hair loss present since Baseline of any given treatment, and lesional scoring by identifying target areas. Hair loss will be quantified using both the SALT and ALODEX assessments at Baseline and monthly during treatment. The change from Baseline in the SALT and ALODEX scores will be used to determine hair regrowth. In addition to the SALT and ALODEX assessment tools, Aclaris is developing Clinician and Patient Reported outcome tools (ClinRO and PRO) to assess hair regrowth that is clinically meaningful to subjects. These ClinRO and PRO tools will measure the signs, symptoms, and impacts of AA for use as secondary efficacy and exploratory endpoints. Subjects will be enrolled with 30% to 100% hair loss over the entire scalp surface area based on the SALT score at Screening (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2) . Screening (Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2) ALODEX score s will also be obtained but will not be used as an inclusion criterion. The scalp appearance assessments in development (ClinRO and PRO) will assess hai r loss on a scale from “no hair” to a “full head of hair”. A target patch (identified by the subject as their most bothersome area of hair loss) will be identified at Baseline (Visit 2). By identifying a target patch, subjects with less extensive hair lo ss overall can be enrolled using the same rating on the Alopecia Scalp Appearance Assessment of “no hair” or “a little hair” at Baseline (Visit 2). Subjects with patch y AA will have ClinRO and PRO assessments completed for a scalp target patch and for scalp hair loss over the subject’s whole scalp surface area. Because this trial will not be stratified in terms of ethnic background or gender of subjects, there is no consistent measure of hair color, caliber, growth rate or hair density that can be used across such a diverse population of subjects. Each of these parameters is intrinsically determined within a given subject, and in subjects with more severe hair loss, there will be little to no normal hair at the start of the study. Therefore, it will be impossible to establish each subject’s individual Baseline measure of healthy hair in order to monitor restoration of these parameters over the study. Further, it is not possible to compare these parameters across individuals in the study. The ALODEX an d SALT assessments are based on terminal hair growth. Another parameter that will be considered will be the normalization of exclamation point hairs. These two features should be trackable irrespective of the subjects’ intrinsic hair color, caliber or density, and should give a meaningful indicator of response to treatment."

Overall Study Design This Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ATI -501 Oral Suspension in subjects with AA, AU or AT. Subjects will be required to have a clinical diagnosis of stable AA, AU or AT with 30% to 100% total scalp hair loss for a duration of at least 6 months up to and including 12 years (inclusive). Stable AA, AU or AT is defined as no areas of spontaneous terminal scalp hair growth. During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for eligibility into the study. Subjects will receive ATI -501 Oral Suspension, 400 mg, 600 mg, or 800 mg or Plac ebo Oral Suspension twice -daily for up to 24 weeks. Assessment of response to treatment will be performed at Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, and post- treatment Week 28. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated at each study visit by a ssessment of adverse events , clinical laboratory tests, and vital signs, and at select visits, ECGs. Subjects who complete study visits through Visit 9 will have the option to roll over into an open-label study ATI -502- AA-203. Subjects who withdraw conse nt or meet study medication discontinuation criteria (Section 3.4.1.2) on study ATI-501- AUAT -201 will not be eligible for roll-over to study ATI-502- AA-203. Subjects who complete the assessments for Visit 9 and then meet study ATI -502- AA-203 entry criteria and provide written consent will skip post- treatment Visit 10. Subjects who are not eligible for ATI-502- AA-203 or who decline to participate should return for the final Visit 10 assessments. 3.2. Number of Subjects A total of approximately 95 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 25 US sites . 3.3. Treatment Assignment Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to ATI -501 Oral Suspension 400 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg or Placebo Oral Suspension twice -daily for 24 weeks followed by a 4- week post -treatment follow up period. 3.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria Subjects should not modify the study medication dosage or frequency without the investigator’s prior approval. All study medication modifications must be reported on the appropriate eCRF. If study medication intolerance or safety issue occurs, after consulting with the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Medical Monitor (see page 1), the investigator or designee may direct the subject to modify the study medication frequency from twice -daily to once-a-day. If the subject cannot take the study medication twice -daily for more than 4 consecutive days, other dose modifications and continuation in the study must be reviewed with the Medical Monitor."

During treatment, if a subject has one or more of the abnormal laboratory values noted in Table 2, the investigator or designee upon receipt and review of the central laboratory report should instruct the subject to hold study medication dosing. T he investigator or designee should ask the subject about symptoms, concomitant illnesses and medications and re peat the test(s) as soon as possible. The Medical Monitor must be notified of dose interruptions due to SAEs considered related to study medication or laboratory abnormalities noted in Table 2. If the retest confirms the abn ormal laboratory value, then the study medication should continue to be held followed by repeat testing once a week or sooner at the discretio n of the investigator. The subject should be followed until the laboratory abnormality(s) returns to normal or to Baseline values. 3.4.1.2.

Study Medication Administration Study medication will be self -administered by the subject. Study staff should instruct the subject not to take study medication on an empty stomach. Subjects will be instructed to take o ne single -dose bottle of study medication followed by a full glass of water , within approximately 30 minutes after the morning meal and after approximately 8 to 12 hours, to take the second dose within approximately 30 minutes a fter the evening meal as detailed in study medication instructions in Appendix 15. Subjects should not mix/dilute the medication in other liquids, rather they should take the study medication as indicated in the directions provided. The investigational site staff will dispense a sufficient supply of study medication at the visits detailed in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3) and will review the study medication instructions as detailed in Appendix 15. The investigational site staff dispensing and reconciling the study medication should not be involved in the investigator or subject efficacy assessments. Subjects will be given a compliance record to complete. At each study visit , subjects should bring the study medication including used and unused bottles and the completed compliance record. The study staff will review the compliance record, used and unused bottles and the study medication instructions. 5.2. Concomitant Medications Concomitant therapies are any new or existing therapies received from Screening (Visit 1) until discharge from the study. Concomitant therapies include drug (e.g. prescription and over the counter [OTC]), and non- drug (e.g., chiropractic, phys ical therapy, energy -based treatments). Subjects will be allowed to take medications not restricted by the protocol as long as they have been reviewed by the investigator and will not affect efficacy or safety . Vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements are permitted while on study if the subject has been on a stable dose prior to study entry and, in the opinion of the Investigator, will not affect the safety or efficacy of the subject during the study. Topical hair and scalp products (shampoos, conditioners, styling products) should be reviewed by the Investigator and are permitted if, in the Investigator’s opinion, they will not affect the safety or efficacy of the subject during the study. Use of hair dyes is permitted during the study if the subject uses the same hair dye throughout the study. If in the opinion of the Investigator, the hair dye interferes with study assessments the subject may be directed to wait until after the study visit to dye his or her hair. Efforts should be made to keep the hair care regimen the same throughout the duration of the study. Topical therapies such as topical corticosteroids are permitted if they are not applied on or near the scalp and are not used for hair growth in other areas. Inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids are allowed in the study. Prior permitted concomitant medications taken within 30 days of beginning treatment with ATI- 501 Oral Suspension will be documented in the subject’s source document and eCRF. In addition, any new permitted medicat ions administered during protocol treatment and through Week 28 (Visit 10) will be documented in the subject’s source document and eCRF."

Grooming Routine shaving of beard or body hair is allowed during the study as long as the subject refrains from shavi ng for a period sufficient to show hair growth prior to Visits 6, 9, and 10. Shaving of the scalp must conform to the requirements specified in Inclusion Criterion #9. Subjects are allowed to grow their hair longer than the length at baseline visit, as long as the investigator can assess hair loss and regrowth during the study and hair regrowth is pinned out of the way to show the areas with hair loss at baseline for photographs. 5.4. Prohibited Medications Any medication, shampoo or hair product known to af fect hair growth in AA, AU or AT is prohibited throughout the study period. Subjects who are on a chronic stable dose of finasteride for benign prostatic hypertrophy for greater than 1 year are eligible for enrollment in the study as long as they maintain the same stable dose throughout the study. Since subjects with known AGA are excluded from the study, treatment with finasteride for alopecia during the study or within one year prior to study enrollment is prohibited. The following medications and therapies require a specific washout period prior to study entry and are not permitted during the study: • Disease Modifying Anti- Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDS), Biologics or immunosuppressants, including but not limited to : anakinra, adalimumab, azathioprine, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, etanercept, infliximab , methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, ustekinumab within 1 month or 5 half- lives (whichever is greater) of Baseline ( Visit 2 ). • Plaquenil within 2 months of Baseline (Visit 2). • JAK inhibitors (oral or topical) with in 6 months of Baseline (Visit 2). • Intralesional steroids or platelet rich plasma treatment in the scalp within 1 month of Baseline (Visit 2). • Topical treatments on the scalp with anthralin, bimatoprost, corticosteroids, diphencyprone, diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), squaric acid dibutylester (SADBE), minoxidil, pimecrolimus, or tacrolimus within 1 month of Baseline (Visit 2). • Phototherapy (narrow band Ultraviolet B [NB UVB] or broadband therapy ) within 4 weeks of Baseline (Visit 2). Any prohibited medications taken by a subject in violation of the protocol requirements will be documented in the source record and eCRF. Discussion with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor must also take place in order to determine if the subject’s continuation in the study is allowed. 5.5. Vaccine Guidelines Vaccination with live or attenuated components is prohibited during the study and for 6 weeks after the last dose of study medication . Similarly, current routine household contact with children and others vaccinated with live or attenuated vaccine components should be avoided during treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of the study. Some of these vaccines include varicella (“chickenpox”) vaccine, or al polio vaccine, and the inhaled flu vaccine."

Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 40 of 90 CONFIDENTAL Following vaccination with live or attenuated component vaccines, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. General guidelines suggest that exposure should be avoided following vaccination with these vaccines for the stated time period : • Varicella or att enuated typhoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination; • Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination; • Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 days following vaccination; • Inhaled flu vaccine for 1 week following vaccination. 5.6. Treatment Compliance The investigator or designee will be responsible for monitoring subject compliance through questioning the subject, reviewing the subject completed compliance record and documenting missed doses, if any, and visual inspection of the study medication bottles (used and unused). Study staff will counsel the subjects, as required to make sure subjects are compl iant with study medication dosing. 5.7. Randomization and Blinding Prior to the start of the study, Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or a designated third party will generate a list of randomization numbers that shall be transmitted to the assigned clinical packaging organization for study medication labeling. The randomization list will be stored with access limited to designated personnel for study medication labeling. The randomization list will be made available, as appropriate, to unblind the database. Subjec ts will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups in a random manner and at a 1:1:1:1 ratio. At Baseline (Visit 2), an investigational center staff member will assign study medication to eligible subjects by selecting an appropriate Subject Kit as detailed in the Pharmacy Manual . Blinding of study medication is important for validity of this study. This study uses a double- blind design. The study medications are indistinguishable in appearance, as packaged and labeled. 5.7.1. Unblinding the Study Medication The blinding may be broken ONLY in the event of a medical emergency, in which knowledge of the study medication identity is critical to the management of the subject’s course of treatment. Before breaking the blind, the investigator shall determine that th e information is necessary ( i.e., that is, will alter the subject’s immediate course of treatment). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medication -related, the problem may be effectively managed by assuming that the subject is receiving an active study medication without the need for unblinding. If the investigator deems it necessary to break the blind for a study subject, he/she will attempt to contact the Medical Monitor (protocol page 1) to obtain permission. If it is not possible to contact the Medical Monitor beforehand, contact her/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject."

Hair Quality Assessments Hair quality will be assessed by the investigator using the hair pull test including the presence of exclamation point hair s at Baseline and then monthly during the study. For subjects with AU or AT, the hair pull test will not be conducted. 7.3.6.1. Hair Pull Test The hair pull test is performed at the edge of the alopecic (target) patch as follows: • Pinch 25 to 50 hairs between non-gloved thumb and forefinger and exert slow, gentle traction while sliding fingers up. • Resulting extracted hairs should be examined with magnification and counted.  Normal: 1 to 2 hairs dislodged  Abnormal: >2 hairs dislodged  Broken hairs (structural disorder)  Broken- off hair at the borders of an alopecic patch that are easily removable (in alopecia areata) (exclamation point hair) 7.3.7. Severity Alopecia Tool (SALT) Score The SALT score is a measurement of the amount of terminal scalp hair loss. The investigator will assess the SALT score using an iPad provided by Aclaris at screening, Baseline, Day 15 (Visit 3) and at the visits detailed in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ). The SALT score must be determined prior to the ALODEX score. At Baseline (Visit 2), the SALT score must be determined prior to randomization and the score must be within 30% to 100% total scalp hair loss for the subject to receive study treatment. Equipment, supplies, training and the detailed Reference Guide will be provided to the investigational site prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 7.3.8. Alopecia Density and Extent Score (ALOD EX) The ALODEX score is a measurement of the amount of terminal scalp hair loss. The investigator will calculate the ALODEX score using the iPad provided by Aclaris at S creening, Baseline, Day 15 (Visit 3), and at the visits detailed in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ). The ALODEX score must be determined after the SALT score. At Baseline (Visit 2), the ALODEX score must be determined prior to randomization. Equipment, supplies, training and the detailed Reference Guide will be provided to the investigational site prior to the initiation of subject enrollment. 7.3.9. Vellus and Indeterminate Hair Assessment The investigator will assess if vellus and indeterminate hair are present on the scalp by completing the question: Is vellus hair present in the areas of hair loss? Y, N Is indeterminate hair present in the areas of hair loss? Y, N Hair types are characterized by the diameter and lengt h of the hair shafts. Vellus hair is soft, hypopigmented, unmedullated and less than 0.03 mm in diameter and less than 1 cm in length."

Safety Parameters Safety will be assessed throughout the study by the investigator or a designated and approp riately trained staff member . 8.1.1. Demographic/Medical History / Alopecia Areata History During the screening visit, the investigator or designee will interview each subje ct to obtain demographic information including date of birth, sex at birth, Fitzpatrick skin type, race and, if appropriate, ethnicity. The investigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain medical history information related to all medical co nditions, surgeries and disease states that, at screening: are ongoing, require concomitant therapy or are, in the opinion of the investigator, relevant to the subject’s study participation. In addition, the medical history of women who are not of childbearing potential should reflect the reason e.g. post-menopausal for 1 year or greater, bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy. The investigator or designee will also obtain an alopecia history at screening ( Appendix 1). The subject’s alopecia history is captured on a separate source document and eCRF and is not documented as part of the subject’s general medical history. 8.1.2. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured at each visit during the study . The following items will be measured: • Body temperature • Pulse rate • Respiration rate • Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 minutes • Height (at Visit 1 only) • Weight (at Visit 1 only) Any measure that is, in the opinion of the investigator, abnormal AND clinically significant (C S) must be recorded as medical history if found prior to the first study medication administration , or as an AE if found after the first dose of study medication. A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as C S or not clinically significant ( NCS) in the e CRF. A weight >300 lbs. is considered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CS or NC S in the eCRF. 8.1.3. Physical Examination The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination for all body systems at Screening (Visit 1) and end of treatment Week 2 4 (Visit 9). The skin assessment portion of the Physical Examination does not require documentation of alopecia as an abnormality since it is"

In the absence of any other abnormalities, skin should be considered “Normal” for these subjects. 8.1.4. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed by a qualified staff member at Screening (Visit 1), Visit 3, and Visit 9 as detailed in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ). The ECGs must be obtained using a standard 12- lead ECG with a 10mm/mV amplitude, at 25mm/sec and a 5 to 10 second duration. To ensure a steady heart rate the subject must rest quietly in the supine position for at least 5 minutes prior to performing the ECG. A central lab, eResearchTechnology, Inc. (ERT), will provide ECG equipment, supplies and site training. In addition, ERT will process ECGs received by the sites and re port results via a secure study portal. The ECG results will be interpreted by a qualified health professional (evaluator) and the interpretation reported on a separate report which includes a copy of the tracing. The evaluator will interpret the results of every ECG and define the ECG as “normal” or “abnormal”. Variations such as minor ST changes (i.e., <0.5mm depression) and early re- polarization are considered normal. The investigator must review the evaluator’s interpretation of each subject’s scre ening ECG prior to Baseline (Visit 2). The investigator will review the evaluator’s interpretation of all ECG reports in a timely manner and comment on the clinical relevance of any result that is defined by the evaluator as abnormal. Any abnormalities th at are, in the opinion of the investigator, clinically significant, must be reported as medical history if found prior to the start of the first dose of study medication or as an AE if found after the start of the first dose of study medication (see Sectio n 8.2 ). 8.1.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments A qualified staff member will collect non -fasting samples for clinical laboratory analysis at the visits detailed in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ). Samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for handling and shipping instructions. The following tests will be conducted: Chemistry Panel Complete Blood Count Albumin Hematocrit Alkaline phosphatase Hemoglobin Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) Platelet count Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) Red blood cell morphology Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Red blood cell count Bicarbonate White blood cell count Calcium White blood cell differe ntial Chloride % & absolute Creatinine Basophils Glucose Eosinophils Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Lymphocytes"

Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and Triglycerides will be assessed at all visits . The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central labo ratory’s standard reports. The investigator must note NCS or C S to define the clinical relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report. The investigator or subinve stigator must review all the Screening ( Visit 1 ) laboratory test results against the study entry criteria and the Study Medication Interruption Criteria Table 2 for each subject prior to Baseline ( Visit 2 ). Subjects with Screening laboratory values meeting the Study Medication Interruption Criterial found in Table 2 must have repeat laboratory testing performed with results meeting the minimum criteria for resumption in order to initiate treatment at Baseline (Visit 2). The investigator must report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, CS as medical history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins. The investigator must review all laboratory reports in a timely manner. 8.1.6. Pregnancy Testing Subjects who are WOCBP should have a UPT performed early in the screening procedures (following informed consent) which shows negative results in order to avoid the continuation of what would then be unnecessary screening testing. Subjects who are WOCBP must also have a negative serum pregnancy test result from Screening (Visit 1) to continue in the study, and a negative UPT at Baseline (Visit 2) prior to randomization. In addition, the investigator or designee will perform a urine pregnancy test for subjects who are WOCBP at the visits detailed in Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3 ). The UPT kits provided by the Central lab have a minimum sensitivity of 25 -mIU ß -HCG/milliliter (mL) of urine. If the result of any post-"

Samples will be sent to a bioanalytical laboratory for analysis. Refer to the pharmacokinetic laboratory manual for handling and shipping instructions. 8.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Adverse even ts will be monitored throughout the study and reported on the appropriate Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. AE eCRF . 8.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 8.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE) An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existin g medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered casually related to the product. The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or clinically significant a bnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE. Every new episode or clinically significant worsening of a chronic condition (e.g., headaches, seasonal allergies, depression, or hypertension) should be reported as a separate AE, even if the condition is reported in the subject’s medical history. H air growth in unexpected areas, such as facial hair in women, should be reported as an adverse event. Any CS abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment should be reported as medical history, not as an AE. All AEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or within 30 days following the cessation of treatment, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and in the Aclaris’ electronic case report form (eCRF). Changes to a subject’s medical condition that occur between signing an ICF and beginning treatment sh ould be captured in the medical history. 8.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., B aseline, T reatment, Washout, or Follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, that fulfills one or more of the following: • Results in death • It is immediately life -threatening • It requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization"
58,page_58,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 59 of 90 CONFIDENTAL • It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect • It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The term “life threatening” r efers to an event in which the s ubject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or hospita lization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. All SAEs that occur from the time of informed consent until 30 days following the cessation of study medication dosing, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE forms provided b y Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc . 8.2.1.3. Unexpected adverse event An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 8.3. Reporting Adverse Events 8.3.1. Adverse event reporting period The investigator must start reporting non- serious AEs from the time of the subject’s first dose of study medication until 30 days after the last dose of study medication . Reporting for SAEs must start when the subject signs the ICF and continue until 30 days past the subject’s last dose of study medication, whether or not they are related to the study . 8.3.2. Severity The investigator is to define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the most appropriate according to her/his medical judgment. Mild – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity 8.3.3. Relationship to study medication The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and"
59,page_59,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 60 of 90 CONFIDENTAL consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject’s relevant medical history, concomitant therapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by selecting one of the following categories: Related – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. Not Related – There is not a reasonab le causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmoni zation [ICH] E2A). 8.3.4. Procedures for reporting adverse events At each post -enrollment visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs using a non - directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since the previous study visit?” If appropriate, based on the subject’s response to non-directed questioning to elicit AEs, the investigator will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations. Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE eCRF . AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit. AEs that are defined as “Related” to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject’s last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae. 8.3.5. Procedure for reporting a serious adverse event Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related to the study medications, the investigator must: 1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety . 2. Immediately inform the Safety Monitor of the SAE by em ail, ensuring that the subject information is deidentified (only subject initials and subject number) to: ProPharma, Email: clinicalsafety@propharmagroup.com. 3. Print a copy of the email confirmation from ProPharma and place in the study file. 4. Within 24-hours complete, as fully as possible, an AE eCRF and an SAE form; e- mail the forms and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication eCRF , medical history eCRF , laboratory test results) to ProPharma (Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Safety Monitor). 5. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject’s last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the S AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae AND the investigator and A claris Therapeutics, Inc. Safety and Medical Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved."

Comply with the appropri ate regulatory requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions regarding reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC). 8.4. PREGNANCY 8.4.1. Definition of Women of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) WOCBP includes any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥12 months with no menses without an alternative medical cause. WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative UPT at Baseline prior to randomization. 8.4.2. Highly Effective Methods of Birth Control The Investigator or subinvestigator will dis cuss the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy and the importance of maintaining a highly effective method of contraception throughout the study with all WOCBP (for example, those which result in a low failure rate - i.e., less than 1% per year - when used consistently and correctly). All WOCBP must use a highly effective method of birth control during the study and for 30 days after the final dose of study medication in a manner such tha t risk of failure is minimized. Highly effective methods include: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation : o oral o intravaginal o transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation: o oral o injectable o implantable • intrauterine device (IUD) • intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS) • vasectomized partner1 • sexual abstinence2 1Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 2 Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject."
61,page_61,"Protocol: ATI-501-A UAT -201 Aclaris Therapeutics , Inc. Date: 09APR 2019 , Version 5 .0 Page 62 of 90 CONFIDENTAL WOCBP must be on a highly effective method of birth control for the following timeframes prior to study entry: • Implants (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days) • Injec tables (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days) • Patches (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days) • Combined oral contraceptives (on a stable dose for ≥ 30 days) • Intrauterine devices (inserted for ≥30 days) . Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and of the potential risk factors associated with pregnancy while in the study. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion. During the trial, all WOCBP will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study medication administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a pregnancy test are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study medication and must be discharged from the study. If, following study medication administration, it is determined that the subjec t or partner of a male subject may have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including 30 days after study medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, the investigator must report every pregnancy using a pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures described for SAE reporting. Protocol- required procedures for trial discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy ( e.g., x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the investigator must report to Aclar is Therapeutics, Inc.’s Medical Monitor on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of six weeks."

Sample Size and Power Calculations The planned sample size is 95 enrolled subjects with approximately 45 subjects enrolled with AT or AU . The sample size estimate was based on published results from a similar study (Crispin et al. 2016) where 32% of subjects receiving active drug achieved at least a 50% reduction in hair loss (SALT 50) under similar conditions. For the current study, the primary efficacy analysis is mean percent change in hair loss, evaluated using SALT scores. That analysis is expected to have greater statistical sensitivity than the SALT 50 responder analysis, which is also a secondary efficacy analysis in the current study. We assume the pooled results of 600mg and 800mg treatment groups in the current study will achieve the same or higher SALT 50 response rate (32%) as the published results above, and pooled Vehicle plus 400mg treatment groups will not achieve more than a 6% SALT 50 response rate. Based on a compari son of those two pooled groups, the current study is anticipated to have no less than 80% power with a 10% subject dropout rate for the SALT 50 analysis. Because the primary efficacy analysis of mean percent change in hair loss using SALT scores is expected to be more sensitive than the SALT 50 responder analysis, the power for the primary analysis is also expected to be no less than 80%. 9.2. Analysis Populations The Intent to Treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects who are randomized. The Safety population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. The Per -Protocol (PP) population is defined as all subjects who are randomized and do not have any major protocol violations. Major protocol violations are def ined as: • Inclusion or Exclusion criteria not met • Concomitant medications taken during the study that interfere with efficacy • Did not administer at least 75% of study medication • Did not complete Week 24 (Visit 9). 9.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Subject demographic and baseline characteristics , including medical and alopecia history, prior medications and therapies and physical examination findings will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation, standard error, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, subject counts and percentages will be provided. Categories for missing data will be presented, if necessary."

Efficacy Analyses Hair regrowth is determined based on both percent change from baseline (Baseline SALT – Follow- up SALT/Baseline SALT) and absolute change from baseline (Baseline SALT – Follow- up SALT). 9.4.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses The primary efficacy variable will be the percent change from Baseline (Visit 2) in the SALT score at Visit 9 (Week 24). Missing data for the primary endpoint will be imputed using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) methodology. The analysis will be conducted on the percent change from baselin e over time including all visits using a mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM). The adjusted mean (LS Mean) for percent change from baseline in the SALT score at each visit, estimated from the MMRM, with the estimated standard error and 95% confidence interval (CI), will be presented in tabular and graphic format. The difference in the adjusted means between treatment groups and the associated 95% CI of the difference will be provided. No adjustment for multiplicity will be made. The model will include fixed effect terms for treatment, study visit, baseline SALT score group (<50, >=50), and treatment by SALT group interaction. The primary analysis will be based on the Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population. Statistical significance for primary efficacy endpoint will be declared if at least one treatment group comparison at the Week 24 visit has a two-sided p- value l ess than or equal to 0.05. 9.4.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses A secondary sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted using the PP population. This analysis will use the same methodology as described for the primary analysis just applied to the PP population. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the change from Baseline in the ALODEX score, ASAA (C R & SR ), AF HA (CR & SR), PhGIS, SGIS, SGSHQ, AIA, and D LQI as well as the proportion of subjects achieving a ≥ 50% hair growth compared with Bas eline based upon the SALT score and ALODEX score, separately . SGITS responses at Week 12, 24, and 28 will be summarized. Various secondary responder efficacy endpoints will be defined based upon the SALT score, the ALODEX score and the AAA ( Clinician and Subject ) questionnaires. Details of these responder definitions will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Global Impression of Change (Clinician and Subject) at Week 24 (Visit 9) will be used in the psychometric evaluation of the scores from the ASAA (CR and SR), respectively. Non -Scalp Hair Loss Assessment, Vellus and Indeterminate Hair Assessment and Hair Quality Assessment including normalization of exclamation point hairs and hair shedding will be described.

Training For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects. It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordina tors or other applicable personnel attend this visit. During this visit, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the eCRFs. Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appropriate ly trained individual prior to participating in any of the procedures and evaluations in this study. Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Sta ndard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items. Team organization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center. 10.2. Data Col lection The Investigator must maintain required records for all study subjects. Data for this study will be recorded in the subject's source document and on the eCRFs. All data on these eCRFs should be recorded completely and promptly. A copy of the com pleted eCRFs for each subject will be retained by the investigational center. Records of the subject’s participation in this study will be held confidential except as disclosure is required by law. The study doctor, the sponsor, persons working on behalf of the sponsor, and under certain circumstances, the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Institutional Review Board will be able to inspect and copy confidential study- related records that identify subjects by name. Therefore, absolute subject confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. If the results of this study are published or presented at meetings, the subject’s identity will not be revealed. 10.3. Data Management Data- management activities of this study will be subcontracted. Edit checks and revie w processes will be performed by the sub -contractor until all data clarifications are resolved. The data will be exported to be stored in SAS datasets (or equivalent) by the sub- contractor. After all data clarifications are resolved and subject’s evaluabil ity is determined, the database will be locked. 10.4. Study Monitoring Before an investigational site can enter a patient into the study, a representative of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will visit the investigational study site to: • Determine the adequacy of the f acilities • Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or its"

This will be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and the investigator. During the study, a monitor from Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: • Provide information and support to the investigator(s) • Confirm that facilities remain acceptable • Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protoc ol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed • Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (e.g. clinic charts). • Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Ac laris Therapeutics, Inc. • Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 10.5. Source Documentation Investigators must keep accurate separate records (other than the eCRF s) of all subjects' visits that include all pertinent study related information. A statement should be made indicating that the subjects have been enrolled in this clinical study and have provided written informed consent. Any AEs must be completely documented. Source documentation includes results of any diagnostic tests con ducted during the study. 10.6. Inspection of Records Aclaris or designee will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study medication stocks, drug accountability records, subject charts and study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct. 10.7. Retention of Records The Principal Investigator must maintain all documentation relating to the study for a period of 2 years after the last marketing application approval, or if not approved 2 years following the discontinuance of the test article for investigation. If it becomes necessary for Aclaris or the Regulatory Authority to review any docume ntation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit access to such records."

Ethics Review This protocol, informed consent form, any information provided to subjects, subject- recruiting advertisements, and any amendments to these items will receive IRB/EC approval prior to use. The IRB/EC must receive a copy of the Investigator’s Brochure, all protocol amendments, safety reports and other study related information as required by regulation or the IRB/EC procedures. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The rights, safety and well-being of the subjects are the most important considerations in this study and take priority over the inter ests of society and science. This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki, the current ICH E6 GCP guideline, local regulatory requirements and, at US investigational centers, in compliance with the HIPAA. The study will be conducted in compliance with the IRB/EC approved version of the protocol and any applicable amendments. 12.3. Written Informed Consent The Principal Investigator(s) at each center will ensure that the subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Subject s must also be notified that they are free to disco ntinue from the study at any time. The subject should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The subject ’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study procedures. The Principal Investigator(s) must maintain the original, signed Informed Consent Form. A copy of the signed Informed Consent Form must be given to the subject . 12.4. Study Conduct and Protocol Amendments With the exception of eliminating an immediate hazard to a subject, the investigator should not deviate from the protocol or implement any changes without prior written approval from the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.’s representative or designee and prior review and documented approval from the IRB/EC. Changes that involve only logistical or administrative changes are allowed. The investigator should document and explain any deviation from the protocol. A protocol deviation is a non-adherence to protocol -specific study procedures or schedules that does not increase the risk to a study subject and does not affect the scientific integrity of the study. A protocol violation is defined as any divergence from the protocol-specific study procedures or schedules that may results in an increased risk to a study subject or that affect the scientific integrity of the study. All protocol violations must be reviewed by the Medical Monitor and reported to the IRB by the Investigator, as directed by the IRB- specific procedures."
