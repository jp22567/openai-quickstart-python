We hypothesize that intrave nous rVWF given on day 1 of 2 consecutive menstrual cycle s is more effective than oral TA thre e times daily on day s 1-5 of 2 consecutive menstru al cycles in reducing menstrual blood loss and improving quality of life, despite its higher cost and invasive route of administration. A total of 60 women (inflated to 66 for anticipated 10% dropout) with type 1 VWD 18 -45 years o ld will be enrolled 24 weeks each in this 5 -year trial. Objectives: The Primary Objective is to de termine the efficacy of rVWF vs. TA in reducing menorrhagia in women with type 1 VWD. The Secondary Objective is to evaluate safety, tolerability, acceptability of rVWF vs. TA in re ducing menorrhagia in women with type 1 VWD. Endpoint s: The Primary Endpoint is a 40-point reduction in pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) after 2 cycles. The Secondary Endpoints are cycle severity, cycle duration, and quality -of- life by SF -36, Ruta Menorrhagia Severity Scale, CDC -HRQoL -14, CES -D, and satisfaction survey. The cost -effectiveness questionnaire is exploratory. Study Population: Study subjects will be a dult females age 18-45 years of age with type 1 von Willebrand disease, defined by VWF:RCo < 0.50 IU/ ml (historic or current), normal VWF multimers, previous bleeding his tory, who have menorrhagia and a PBAC >100 in at least one of the two preceding menstrual cycles, and cared for at one of the 19 or more U.S. centers (HTCs) participating in this trial. Sixty eligible subjects will be enrolled (inflated to 66 for anticipate d 10% dropout). Phase: This is a phase III prospective, randomized, crossover trial. Description of Sites /Facilities Enrolling Participants : Participating sites include 19 U.S. hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) in Pittsburgh PA, Rochester NY, Syracuse NY, New Brunswick NJ, Washington DC, Chapel Hill NC, Cleveland OH, Miami FL, Atlanta GA, Detroit MI, Columbus OH, Milwaukee WI, Rochester MN, St. Louis MO, Salt Lake City UT, Phoenix AX, San D iego CA, Orange CA, and Seattle WA.

Study Visit 1 is Baseline/Screen; Visit 2 is Pre -Cycle 1; Visit 3 is Pre -Cycle 3; and Visit 4 is Post -Cycle/End. Cycles are consecutive months INTRODUCTION 2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE Ineffective therapies for menorrhagia is the greatest unmet healthcare need in women with bleeding disorders and menorrhagia, and there are few studies to guide future management this is a critical time to initiate a clinical trial of agents to trea t menorrhagia in women with VWD. Given the high frequency of menorrhagia in women with von Willeb rand disease (VWD), the associated morbidity including iron deficiency anemia with its social, cognitive, and mental consequences, and the lack of safe, effective therapies, it is critical to initiate a clinical trial of agents to treat menorrhagia in wome n with VWD. Although intravenous rVWF is more difficult to administer and costs more than oral tranexamic acid, the #1 current recommended non -hormonal treatment for menorrhagia, clinical studies of 101 women with VWD and menorrhagia indicate VWF, includin g both plasma -derived VWF and recombinant VWF, is effective in safely reducing menorrhagia in 95% or more (10, 11). Studies of TA indicate it reduced menorrhagia by 50% in up to 30% of women with bleeding disorders and menorrhagia (27, 41). With the prolon ged half -life of rVWF, we anticipate that a single day of rVWF given day 1 of menstrual bleeding in the menstrual cycle will reduce menorrhagia to a greater degree than TA given on days 1 -5 of the menstrual cycle. Given the gaps and unmet needs in the curr ent care and management of menorrhagia in"
8,page_8,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 6 women with VWD, it is a critical time to initiate a clinical trial to address the needs and improve the care of women with bleeding disorders. We, therefore, propose this Phase III multicenter prospective, randomiz ed, crossover arm trial is to compare recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF, Vonvendi) to tranexamic acid (TA, Lysteda) in reducing the severity of menorrhagia in women with von Willebrand disease. The findings of this study will have potential impact on scientific, economic, and clinical aspect of care of women with VWD and menorrhagia. The findings will also provide data on new therapies for menorrhagia in women with VWD and other bleeding disorders, which, if successful, will improve clinical health ou tcomes and reduce days lost from work, lifestyle disruptions, psychological morbidity, health care cost, and poor quality of life. Further, as VWF is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, determining the lowest effective VWF dose, acceptability of this intravenous therapy in women with VWD population will be critical in assuring no increase in thrombosis and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the goals of the study, i.e. to prevent complications and blood product safety , are consistent with the goals of H ealthy People 2020 (40). 2.2 BACKGROUND Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder resulting from deficient or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF), and characterized by mucosal bleeding in the oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal , and genitourinary tract (1 -3). Among women with VWD, up to 80% have menorrhagia (4, 5) which leads to significant morbidity, iron deficiency anemia, high health cost, and poor quality of life. Yet, the lack of effective therapy for menorrhagia is the gre atest unmet healthcare need in women with VWD (5, 6). Up to 30% avoid DDAVP, hormones, or the recommended non -hormonal agent, tranexamic acid (TA), as they are ineffective or poorly tolerated (7), and few prospective trials are available to guide treatment . Two recent trials of rVWF have been conducted: first, a phase I study to assess safety and pharmacokinetics of rVWF (8) and a Phase III study to assess efficacy in treatment and prevention of bleeding in VWD (9) . In the latter, women with VWD and menorr hagia received rVWF which successfully reduced their menstrual bleeding. In these trials, rVWF was given by intravenous infusion, and safely and effectively reduced bleeding, and was well -tolerated. rVWF is licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in VWD. In a survey of 16 hemophilia treatment centers, VWF concentrate has been used as a third -line treatment for menorrhagia, only after first- and second -line treatment failed: in all 13 subjects rece iving VWF there was reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding (10, 11). In six published studies (9, 12 -16), including two prospective trials, two retrospective trials, and two observational network studies, a total of 455 VWD subjects were treated with plasma -derived (pd) VWF or rVWF concentrate. Of these, one -third or 88 (19.2%) were women with type 1, 2, or 3 VWD and menorrhagia treated with pdVWF at a dose of 36 -50 IU/kg for 1 -6 days of menstrual cycle bleeding (10, 11). In these studies, 95 -100% of these women reported reduction in menorrhagia, with no reported adverse effects. The purpose of this study is to compare whether rVWF is more effective than TA in reducing bleeding in women with menorrhagia. rVWF is invasive, requiring intravenous injection and costs more than oral TA: thus, to justify its use, rVWF should be more effective than TA alone. The use of rVWF in VWD is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for"
9,page_9,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 7 treatment of bleeding, including menorrhagia, in individuals with VWD. The formulation of tranexamic acid (TA, Lysteda®) in this study is in pill form. The pills are taken by mouth, three times daily. This drug and dose are currently licensed by the FDA for treatment of menorrhagia. It is critical and timely to address the probl em of menorrhagia in women with VWD. We have accumulated data in our U34 feasibility study that women with VWD and physicians who care for them are willing to use an intravenous VWF to treat women with menorrhagia unresponsive to first and second line drug s, e.g. standard hormonal and non - hormonal therapy. It is critical to assess response of menorrhagia to rVWF vs. TA, as the findings will impact clinical management and improve health outcomes for women with VWD. Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the single most common congenital bleeding disorder, occurring in 1 -3% of the population (1), and is characterized by deficiency or defect in von Willebrand factor (VWF), a glycoprotein that promotes platelet adhesion to vessel wall after vessel injury, which is crucial for platelet plug formation, or primary hemostasis, and serves as a carrier protein for factor VIII (2). The VWF gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 12 and is encode d by an 8.7 kb VWFmRNA expressed by vascular endothelial cells and bone marrow megakaryocytes (3). Typical bleeding symptoms include mucosal bleeding in the oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract (1 -3). Among women with VWD, the most comm on symptom is heavy menstrual bleeding, or menorrhagia, occurring in more as many as 80% (3 -5). Menorrhagia is associated with significant morbidity, including iron deficiency anemia up to two -thirds, early hysterectomy, and reduced quality of life (4 -5, 17-19). Among women with menorrhagia, the prevalence of VWD is 5 -20%, with overall prevalence of 13% (4 -5, 20). These figures may underestimate the true prevalence of menorrhagia, as it may not be recognized as symptom of a coagulation disorder or not rea dily diagnosed, as the extragenic influences of blood group, exogenous estrogens, and stress, may increase VWF and lead to apparently normal VWF studies (2 -3). Menorrhagia is defined as menstrual bleeding exceeding 80 cc/month, a level at which progressive iron loss and iron deficiency anemia occur (19). The health burden of menorrhagia is high, with excess days lost from work, lifestyle disruptions, psychologic morbidity, poor quality of life, and increased health care costs (17 -18). It has been estimated that 5 -10% of those in reproductive age seek medical attention (21), of whom 50% undergo surgical procedure (22). Only recently has consideration of underlying disorders of hemostasis been considered important in assessment of the woman with menorrhagia (5 ), and as a result women presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding are screened for bleeding disorders and other pathology prior to the procedure (23), resulting in a significant reduction from the nearly 50% of women undergoing hysterectomies for menorrhag ia in the 1990s (17). The “gold standard” for measuring menstrual blood loss by alkaline haematin spectrophotometry in collected pads and tampons, but as this is impractical, menstrual history is used in general practice (6). The volume of menorrhagia can be quantitated, however, by the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) (24). The PBAC is a chart which depicts the degree of pads or tampon saturation during a cycle, which when summed for weighted scores for light, moderate, or severe saturation, determ ines a PBAC score for each cycle (24). PBAC has shown good correlation with menstrual blood loss (25): a PBAC score of >100 strong correlates with menstrual blood loss >80 cc, r=0.85 (24), with 86% sensitivity and 89% specificity (24), and, thus, is consid ered a quantitative marker of menorrhagia (25). PBAC may be used not only as a"
10,page_10,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 8 tool to diagnose menorrhagia, but also as a monitor of therapeutic response after intervention (26, 27). A logistic regression model demonstrated that > 80 cc menstrual blood lo ss is predicted by three variables, including the presence of clots >1 inch in diameter, low serum ferritin, and hourly pad/tampon change (23). Other nonspecific predictors of menorrhagia include i) bleeding severity score (3, 28, 29), ii) presence of floo ding, iii) cycle duration >7 days, iv) anemia requiring treatment, v) family history of a bleeding disorder, and vi) excess bleeding with dental or surgical procedure, miscarriage or delivery (30). The latter four predictors, when coupled to PBAC >100, inc rease the sensitivity of PBAC to 95% (30). Finally, although the severity of nonspecific bleeding in VWD is measured by BSS, and BSS correlates with VWF:RCo level (3, 28, 29), neither PBAC nor menorrhagia severity appear to correlate with VWF levels (26, 2 7). The lack of effective treatment for menorrhagia is a major unmet health need among women with bleeding disorders (5, 6), and as such constitutes a major public health problem (5, 17, 23). While 80% respond to DDAVP (desmopressin) (3, 31, 32), the first -line treatment for type 1 VWD, only 31% use it to treat menorrhagia (7), as intravenous infusion is inconvenient and the effect is short -lived, with depletion of endothelial VWF stores after three days (31). Response rates with intranasal DDAVP (Stimate®) are lower (32 -35), related to its less potent effect on VWF release (31). Although hormonal therapy, specifically combined oral contraceptives (OC) are effective in 70% (36), their use is limited by headaches and hypertension (32, 36), and only 35% of wo men with bleeding disorders use these OC to treat menorrhagia (7). The levonorgestrel intra -uterine system (Mirena), which releases hormone into the endometrial cavity where it is absorbed has antifbrinolytic effect, reducing blood loss (37), but its use i s limited by weight gain and depression in 20% (37). A recent prospective trial demonstrated the antifibrinolytic agent, tranexamic acid (Cyclokapron®, TA), was effective in reducing menstrual blood loss by PBAC score in up to 50%, although nausea was a co mmon adverse event (27). TA is now the recommended non -hormonal agent of choice for menorrhagia (27, 38). A new recombinant VWF, rVWF (Vonvendi), licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of bleeding in von Willebrand disease, is a p ure VWF protein with intact VWF subunits, produced in the absence of ADAMTS -13, the VWF cleaving protein, with a high ratio of high molecular weight and ultra large HMW multimers. This accounts for its increased potency over plasma -derived VWF (Humate P) ( 39), which is the current standard VWF concentrate. It is manufactured with no animal or human components. In a phase 1 trial rVWF was safe and well tolerated in those with type 3 VWD (8). In a recently completed phase 3 VWF efficacy and safety trial (9), rVWF was effective in treatment of 192 bleeds in 22 subjects with a response of excellent or good in 100%. There was bleed resolution in 81% of bleeds with a single dose, median 40 - 50 IU/kg, with the remainder resolving after a 2nd dose. rVWF was well tole rated with no thrombosis, allergic reaction or antibodies to rVWF. Given the importance of clinical coagulation evaluation in women with menorrhagia (17, 22, 38), the high proportion of women with menorrhagia who have an underlying bleeding disorders (4 -7), and the identified limitations of current therapies for women with bleeding disorders who have menorrhagia, there is consensus that better treatment approaches are needed to improve health outcomes and quality of life for women with VWD (3, 5, 38). As in effective treatment remains the greatest unmet healthcare need among women with bleeding disorders (5, 38), which affects quality of care and cost of care, it is a critical time to initiate a study to compare safety and efficacy of rVWF (8, 9) vs. TA (27), the current non -"
11,page_11,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 9 hormonal agent of choice for menorrhagia in women with VWD and menorrhagia. This is consistent with the Healthy People 2020 goal of promoting healthy outcomes, reducing morbidity, and improving quality of life, with safe and effective ther apies for those affected by bleeding disorders (40). The purpose of the proposed Phase III trial will be to compare rVWF vs. TA to reduce menorrhagia in women with type 1 VWD. This trial will be an outpatient 24 -week study conducted in 60 subjects (inflate d to 66 for anticipated 10% dropout) from 19+ HTCs (2 -5 subjects locally). IRB protocols will be prepared and submitted at each of the study sites. Sites will receive study forms and assessment tools to complete and upload into a web - based data base mainta ined by the University of Pittsburgh Center for Research in Healthcare Data Center (CRHC DC). For this trial, the Center for Clinical Trials and Data Coordination (CCDC), which is part of the CRHC DC, will serve as the Data Coordinating Center (DCC). A man ual of operations will provide standardized operating procedures, including enrollment, randomization, data forms, data and specimen collection, shipping, and data and safety monitoring reports. Pictorial bleeding assessment charts (PBAC) will be completed by study subjects (primary endpoint) and patient diaries will establish subject acceptance and adherence to the two intervention arms. Other data collected (secondary endpoints) will include cycle duration, cycle severity, quality of life questionnaires, a satisfaction survey, and a cost - effectiveness questionnaire . Based on our survey and literature review indicating VWF is safe and effective in reducing VWD -related menorrhagia, we hypothesize that intravenous recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) on day 1 of the menstrual cycle is more effective than oral tranexamic acid (TA) three time daily on day 1 -5 of the menstrual cycle, in reducing menstrual blood loss and improving quality of life, despite its higher cost and more invasive route of administrat ion. Bleeding severity by PBAC collected by each subject will be the primary endpoint. 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT 2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS Risk to Subjects There are risks associated with the study drug and having blood drawn. rVWF and TA will be administered during four consecutive menstrual cycles on day 1 -5 of bleeding . All subjects will be asked to report any safety problems or side effects associated with administration of study drugs. Risk of Blood Drawing There may be discomfort with drawing blood, which is common, occurring in up to 25%, or 25 in 100 people: this may include pain, lightheadedness, fainting, bruising, or bleeding or infection in the tissue around the vein. This may be alleviated or reduced by applying pressure to the blood draw site for 5 minutes, and assuming a recumbent position, i.e. lying on your back with your head flat and knees bent, if lightheaded."
12,page_12,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 10 Risk of Allergic or Anaphylactic Reaction Allergic -type reactions are rarely reported for rVWF, although were more commonly reported at higher dose (e.g. 75 mcg/kg, or 3 -fold higher than used in this study), and thus, the risk is expected to be uncomm on, occurring in < 0.001% or less than 1 in 100,000 people. Allergic reactions for TA are expected to be rare in this study, occurring in <.001%, or less than 1 in 100,000 people. Allergic reactions could include chills, fever, nausea and vomiting, or rare ly may include, in decreasing order of severity, death, anaphylaxis (life -threatening difficulty breathing), low blood pressure, heart beat irregularity, increase in body fluids, paresthesias (numbness or prickling sensation), urticaria (hives), chest tigh tness, rash, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling), fever, and/or chills. Should these symptoms occur, benadryl, a medication which reduces inflammation, may be given, with close monitoring of these symptoms. Benadryl may cause drowsiness, dizziness or low blood pressure. Subjects will be monitored for these symptoms. No one with a history of allergy (hypersensitivity), an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis associated with either recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF , Vonvendi® ) or tranexamic acid (TA, Lyste da®) will be enrolled. Subjects will be monitored closely for early symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity reactions, including hives, generalized urticaria, angioedema, chest tightness, dyspnea, wheezing, faintness, hypotension, tachycardia, and anaphylax is. Any subject who develops signs or symptoms of an allergic type reaction or anaphylaxis during administration of either study drug will immediately have that study drug stopped and appropriate medical care initiated . Risk of Thromboembolism/ Thrombogenicity Although rVWF and TA may increase coagulation factor levels, they are rarely, if ever, associated with the development of thromboembolic complications. There is the unlikely possibility, < 0.001%, or less than 1 per 100,000 people, that either drug could cause a clot in the vein (thrombosis) with swelling or pain; or a clot in the lung (pulmonary embolus) with dyspnea or h emoptysis. The use of oral contraceptives with TA may increase risk of venous thromboembolism, and thus will not be allowed during study. This risk will be very carefully monitored clinically. Should these symptoms occur measures considered standard of care would be implemented to prevent clots: these include either compression stockings, which are support -like stockings, and/or sequential compression devices (SCDs). SCDs are blanket -like Velcro - devices which are placed on the legs to promote blood flow and prevent clots from forming in the leg veins. Should a clot occur, treatment would primarily consist of stopping the study treatment and/or removing the line in which it was given, if that is the source of the clot, as soon as possible. Should a bleeding e pisode occur during the study period, the subjec t will be treated with DDAVP or other hemostatic agent prescribed by her physician. Risk of Bleeding Events Bleeding symptoms may occur in VWD unrelated to this study, usually with trauma, but sometimes spontaneously, without cause. Although unlikely, should a subject have any bleeding during the study, she may take her usual standard treatment, DDAVP or VWF concentrate, whichever is usually used. Risk of Pregnancy There are potential risks with pregnancy. rVWF has not been studied in pregnant women. Thus, it is recommended that pregnancy should be avoided in subjects on this study. Avoiding sexual activity is the"
13,page_13,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 11 only certain method to prevent pregnancy: however, if a subject chooses to be sexually active, she must agree to use an appropriate double barrier method of birth control, such as female use of a diaphragm, non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD), sponge and spermicide, or a prescribed birth control implant, in addition to the male use of a condom. Double barrier contraception must be used for at least one week prior to the start of the research study and continue for at least two weeks following the last study visit. If a subject chooses to be sexually active during this study, she must accept the risk that pregnancy could still result, exposing her to potential loss of pregnancy as well as other unknown effects on the developing fetus. Birth Control Statement If a subject becomes aware that that she is pregnant or becomes pregnant during the course of this research study, she must contact the principal investigator and physician immediately. The effects of rVWF on the fetus (unborn child) are not fully known. It is therefore important that a subject does not become pregnant during this research study. Hormones or a birth control implant will not be allowed during this study because of thrombosis risk. The double barrier contraception must be used for at least one week prior to the start of the research study and continue for at l east two weeks following the last study visit. Risk of Inadvertent Disclosure Study participation and related data will be protected to maintain confidentiality. There is a possibility that the subject’s personal information or genetic material could bec ome generally known. This information could impact future insurability, employability, or reproduction plans, or have a negative impact on family relationships, and/or result in paternity suits or stigmatization. In order to reduce risks of disclosure or b reach of confidentiality, the research related documents, blood samples and clinical information stored in subject research files will be assigned an alphanumeric (letters and numbers) identifier (that do not contain personal identifiers). For this study, a linkage key for linking this number and the subject’s name will be kept at each site under lock and key by the PI and his/her research staff. Breach of Confidentiality There is also a potential for possible risk of breach of confidentiality of collecte d information. To minimize this risk, study participation and related information will be protected to maintain confidentiality. Blood samples and clinical history will be assigned an alphanumeric identifier and the key for linking this number with subject identity will be kept at each site under lock and key by the PI and his/her research staff. The de -identified information in this study will be placed into a secure, web - based data base at University of Pittsburgh Center for Research in Health Care Dat a Center (CRHC DC). If the investigator publishes research information, subject names will not be identified."
14,page_14,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 12 2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENE FITS Potential Benefits The subjects will be under close supervision during the study period. After administration of rVWF or TA it is anticipated menstrual bleeding frequency will be decreased from the untreated state. For women with menorrhagia, it is already established rVWF and TA may reduce menstrual bleeding, but whether one agent is more effective or better tolerated than the other is not known. 2.3.3 ASSESSMENT OF POTENT IAL RISKS AND BENEFITS Every day c linicians encounter women with von Willebrand disease where a decision to treat menorrhagia must be made. However, clinicians do not know what to do because 1) randomized trials and observational studies have shown that non -hormonal therapies including the anti -fibrinolytic agent TA, and the hemostatic agents, VWF concentrate, are effective in reducing menorrhagia, but side effects, pill burden, and requirement for intravenous infusion have limited their use; 2) pathophysiological arguments can be made for using either of these agents; 3) observational studies indic ate that although they are safe and reduce blood loss, these agents are in some only somewhat effective and there is concern about thrombosis risk when these agents are used in combination with hormonal therapy; and guidelines provide conflicting advice. T his has led to practice variation and confusion in the clinical community with no clear guidance on safe, optimal treatment for menorrhagia. Based on these findings and existing data there clearly is equipoise. For all these reasons, a high quality randomi zed trial to guide treatment is urgently needed to answer this clinically relevant question. It has been already established that rVWF and TA each effectively and safely reduce menstrual bleeding, but whether one agent is more effective or better tolerate d than the other is not known. The known risks of these agents include, rarely, thrombosis and allergic reaction. The risks/ benefit ratio indicates the value of the information to be gained outweighs the potential risks of participation in the trial as 1) risks associated with rVWF and TA are low, importantly thrombosis risk is <0.4% with VWF , based o n data from the literature ; 2) individuals with cardiac disease, hypertension, MI, stroke, thrombosis, or seizure are excluded from the trial ; and 3) precauti ons are in place to protect against potential risks, e.g. avoiding hormonal therapy or hormonal implants beginning 3 months before and during the trial ; and avoiding pregnancy by requiring pregnancy tests on day 1 of each cycle before study drug can be tak en. Thus, t he risk/ benefit ratio of participating in the trial outweighs the risk of gained outweighs the potential risks of participation in the trial."
15,page_15,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 13 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS OBJECTIVES ENDPOINTS JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINT S Primary The Primary Objective is to determine the efficacy of rVWF vs. TA in reducing menorrhagia in women with type 1 VWD . The Primary Endpoint is a 40 - point reduction in PBAC after two cycles. In a trial of TA 40% of women had a 50 -point reduction in PBAC after 2 cycles, from a baseline PBAC score >100. As rVWF is i .v. and costs more than TA, we estimated rVWF would need to improve PBAC 40 points more than TA to be adopted in to practice. Secondary The Secondary Objective is to evaluate safety, tolerability, acceptability of rVWF vs. TA in reducing menorrhagia in women with type 1 VWD. The Secondary Endpoints are cycle severity, cyc le duration, and QoL by SF -36, Ruta Menorrhagia Severity Scale, CDC-HRQoL -14, C ES-D, and satis faction survey . Cycle severity and duration add descriptive detail to PBAC. Quality -of-life measu res were used in past s tudies . The satisfaction survey assesses intravenous rVWF experience. Tertiary/ Exploratory An Exploratory Objective is to determine cost -effectiven ess by comparing events prevented and cost differences after rVWF vs. after TA . The Exploratory Endpoint is cost-effectiveness determined by intervention -specific SF -36 utility values, and by events prevented, e.g. days missed at work/school, iron infusion, RBC transfusion, ED/ hospitalization. As rVWF cost is hig her than TA, intervention and event costs will be estimated after each study drug , using CMMS and HCUP data, but may be underpowered by small sa mple size and short follow -up. STUDY DESIGN 4.1 OVERALL DESIGN • Hypothesis. We hypothesize that intravenous rVWF give on day 1 of menses will be superior to oral TA given on day 1 -5 of menses, during each of two consecutive menstrual cycles, in reducing menorrhagia in women with type 1 von Willebrand disease. • Phase . This is a Phase III trial. • Trial Design . This is a Phase III prospective, randomized, crossover trial. • Methods to minimize bias. Subjects will have access to VNA, clinic, or infusion center if needed to infuse rVWF, and a second “rescue” dose of rVWF will be allowed, as per current practice for any bleed. There will be no discrimination by race nor ethnicity. If a woman has iron de ficiency, she will be treated; if she has hypothyroidism, she will be referred for treatment. All study supplies, including study drug, diaries, tampons, and pads, will be provided at no cost."
16,page_16,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 14 • Dose escalation or dose -ranging . No dose escalation is planned during this trial. • Number of study groups/arms and study intervention duration. There are two groups to be compared, Group 1, who will be randomized to take Arm A first, then Arm B; and Group 2, who will be randomized to take Arm B first, then Arm A. The study intervention duration is 2 consecutive menstrual cycles each for each agent. For rVWF, this will be day 1 of menstrual bleeding for 2 consecutive cycles; and for TA this will be day 1 -5 of menstrual bleeding for 2 consec utive cycles. The order is randomized. • Single site or multi -site. This is a multi -site trial, with 19 U.S. hemophilia treatment centers. • Study intervention (s). Subjects randomized to Group I will receive Arm A rVWF 40 IU/kg intravenously (IV) infusion on day 1 of each of two menstrual cycles, Cycles 1 and 2. They will then be crossed over to Arm B , TA 650 mg 2 tablets orally (po) three times daily on days 1 -5 of each of two menstrual cycles, Cycles 3 and 4. Sub jects randomized to Group II will receive Arm B , TA 650 mg 2 tablets orally (po) three times daily on days 1 -5, for each of two menstrual cycles, Cycles 1 and 2. They will then be crossed over to Arm A , rVWF 40 IU/kg intravenously (IV) infusion on day 1 on each of two menstrual cycles, Cycles 3 and 4. • Interim Analysis. No interim analysis is planned. • Stratification . No stratification is planned. • Sub-studies. No sub -studies are planned in this protocol. 4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN As von Willebrand disease is a rare, orphan disease, we determined that a randomized, cross -over trial design would feasible for this trial, and would provide adequate statistical power and allow each woman to serve as her own control. There was consensus by our Steering Committee that the design was feasible, including the dose of 40 IU/kg. A survey of MDs at the 19 participating HTCs indicated agreement on our approach to compare rVWF with TA, and with use a “rescue” dose of rVWF on day 2 of the cycle, if menorrhagia was unresponsive. A survey of women with VWD indicated the trial design was acceptable, including use of an intravenous drug. Finally, the HTC MDs estimated based on their current population well known to them, that they would have at least 75 subjects available over the next 4 years for enrollment, sufficient to achieve N=66 subjects (N=60 subjects, with up to 10%, N=6, for dropouts) f or the trial. 4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE Intravenous rVWF is FDA -approved to treat and prevent bleeds in VWD, including menorrhagia. Limited data summarized in a recent review (11) indicate the median dose used in women treated with VWF (pdVWF, plasma -derived; or rVWF, recombinant VWF) was 43 IU/ kg. In consultation with our Steering Committee after review of the literature indicating excellent/good efficacy with rVWF for this indication, with <0.4% thrombosis risk , there was consensus to study a dose of 40 IU/kg. TA is specifically approved for this indication at a dose of 1300 mg (2 tables each of 650 mg) three times daily for day 1 -5 of menstrual bleeding."

Subjects approached for participation in this study will have type 1 VWD and be contacted during routine clinic visits to determine their interest in participating in the study. There will be no cold -calling. The Site PI will determine the patient’s interest in study participation, and, if the patient is interested, the study will be discussed in further detail and the informed consent reviewed. Subjects will be encouraged to take time to decide on participation, and ask questions. If subjects decide to take a consen t form home for further viewing, d iscussion will include the purpose, safety issues, and risks and benefits of the study. All questions will be answered prior to and obtaining informed consent. No experimental procedures or interventions will occur until after informed consent is obtained . The investigator’s certification statement will be signed at the time consent is obtained. If any new information occurs during the conduct of the study, subjects who have been consented will be informed and will be re -consented with this information at the next visit. A de -identified prescreening/ screening log will be kept, and all reasons for exclusion documented in study source documents and screening log. Subjects who read the consent form are free to refuse enrollment, and participants will be free to withdraw at any time. If a subject wishes to withdraw, she may do so by addressing a letter to the principal investigator. Any data collected prior to the time of withdrawal will continue to be used, but no additional information will be collected. Proc essed blood sample results will continue to be used for the research study; however, remaining samples will be destroyed or used as indicated by subject’s letter. The reason (e.g. AE, lost to follow -up, etc.) and date of withdrawal for all subjects withdra wn from this study will be recorded. Subject information obtained by electronic data capture will be stored and managed on the CRHC DC website. The NIH and IRB may inspect the records of this study. Every effort will be made to keep the subject’s personal medical data confidential. Subject eligibility for the study will be determined prior to randomization and within 7 days of the first dose of rVWF or TA. Subjects will sign informed consent. Subject screening and enrollment will be conducted by the local I nvestigator, in communication with the CRHC DC web -based data entry system. Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study after all assessments have been completed during the Screening period and just prior to Day 1 of study. No subject may begin trea tment prior to enrollment and assignment of a unique subject identification number. Any subject identification numbers that are assigned will not be reused even if the subject does not receive treatment. Retention: Retention is a critical issue for clini cal trials in rare diseases: to mitigate against concern, blood draw is limited to the screening visit, and there are only 4 study visits which will be scheduled after menstrual cycles at a time convenient for the subject. Study drugs will be provided at n o cost, and assessed"

In addition, screening and managing iron deficiency and hypothyroidism will contribute to the health of these women. Finally, subjects will receive compensation for participation in this study , to help defray the cost of meals, travel, and time lost from work . The trial will enroll 60 women (inflated to 66 for anticipated 10% dropout), 18 -45 years of age, recruited during HTC clinic from the 19 U.S. participating HTCs, at a rate of 1 or more pe r HTC per year during the trial. There are no non -U.S. sites. There will be no discrimination b ased on race or ethnicity. Children and males will be excluded as they have no menstrual cycles. STUDY INTERVENTION 6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION 6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION Drug Information: Recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF) . Recombinant rVWF (vonicog alfa, Vonvendi) is approved by the FDA for treatment or prevention of bleeds, including menorrhagia, in VWD. rVWF is produced by DNA techno logy. It is synthesized by a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that co -expresses both VWF and FVIII genes (39). This is the first VWF manufactured and formulated in the absence of animal or other human plasma proteins, thus elimi nating the theoretical the risk of transmissible agents and other blood -borne pathogens. It has been established that the ultra large and high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) of VWF are essential for platelet plug formation (42). Unlike plasma -derived (pd) VWF concentrates which lack ULM due to in vivo proteolytic cleavage by the plasma VWF -cleaving protein, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), rVWF has no exposure to ADAMTS13 during the production process and thus contains intact HMWM and ULM (39). The presence of ULM and the higher purity are associated with greater specific activity of rVWF, measured by VWF ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) relative to VWF antigen (VWF:Ag). The pharmacokineti cs of rVWF in patients with type 3 VWF were evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial, which showed a longer terminal half -life for rVWF compared to pdVWF and stabilization of endogenous FVIII:C (8). ULMs present in rVWF underwent rapid proteolysis by endogeno us ADAMTS13 and no thrombotic events were observed. A subsequent phase III trial recently completed (9) demonstrated that rVWF is safe and hemostatically effective in severe type 1, 2, and 3 VWD patients for treatment of bleeds, including menorrhagia. Ther e was a total of 192 bleeds in 22 subjects, with 96.9% rating bleed control excellent or good, according to a 4 -point scale (4=none to 1=excellent). A single infusion was effective in 81.8% of bleeds. In addition, rVWF stabilized endogenous FVIII, and rVWF half- life was 21.9 hours, and factor VIII activity increase rapidly, achieving hemostatic levels within 6 hours of dosing. rVWF was well tolerated. There were serious adverse events in two subjects: chest discomfort and increased heart rate, not associate d with any cardiac symptoms, and there were no thrombotic or severe allergic events, or antibodies to VWF or FVIII (9). Drug Information: Tranexamic Acid (TA) . Tranexamic acid (TA, Lysteda®) is currently approved by the FDA for treatment of menorrhagia (43). rVWF is currently approved by the FDA and will be supplied for use in"

Both drugs will be distributed by the NIH -contracted pharmac y and shipped to HTCs participating in this study as randomization is assigned to enrolled subjects. TA is FDA approved and has been used for years with a long safety profile in subjects with bleeding disorders. rVWF is approved by the FDA for treatment of bleeding, including menorrhagia, in VWD. TA will be provided as two 650 mg tablets for a dose of 1300 mg three times daily for the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding. Administration of Study Drugs . Once a subject is identified as eligible for the study a nd assigned the unique subject number by the CRHC DC Web -Based Data System, the individual preparing the rVWF and TA will first carefully review the accession number on each drug container or vial, for agreement with the accession number assigned to each i ndividual study subject. rVWF will be available for intravenous administration in single -use vials containing approximately 650 or 1300 IU per vial, as a sterile, lyophilized powder. The 650 IU /vial is reconstituted with a 5 -ml vial of sterile water for in jection, USP; the 1300 IU/vial is reconstituted with a 10 -ml vial of sterile water for injection. The resulting solutions for the individual 650 IU/vial and 1300 IU/vial have a pH of 7.3. A two -way needle will allow transfer of the diluent into the lyophil ized powder for reconstitution and slow infusion over 5 -10 minutes. Storage of rVWF post - reconstitution should be limited to 3 hours at 5ºC. TA will be available for oral administration at a dose of two 650 mg tablets per dose . Details of the storage, lot number, stability, production and expiration dates for each drug, rVWF and TA, will be supplied by the contracted pharmacy, Biologics . Drug Records for Study Drugs . This study site will maintain accurate records, demonstrating dates and amount of study t reatment received, to whom dispensed (subject -by-subject accounting), and accounts of any study treatment accidentally or deliberately destroyed. Biologics will contract and coordinate the process of shipping rVWF and TA to eac h HTC. It is estimated that Biologics will make shipments of rVWF and TA to HTCs every 4 weeks. All pill containers and vials, both used and unused, must be saved for study treatment accountability. At the end of the study, reconciliation must be made by HTCs between the amount of stu dy treatment supplied, and dispensed. Unused study drugs will be destroyed by study sites . A written explanation will be provided for any discrepancies. Unused study drug will be destroyed locally at the HTCs . There are no site monitoring visits planned at this time . 6.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTR ATION Route of Administration of Study Drugs . rVWF dosing will be by study subjects (or VNA or HTC nurse) by standard intravenous technique, over 5 -10 minutes or less, using a 5 -10 cc syringe for injection into a vein. TA dosing will be by study subjects by oral self -administration. All drugs by study Group and Arm, rVWF or TA, will be taken at the same time e ach day, preferably beginning at 8 am in the morning. Dosing of Study Drugs . rVWF will be given at 40 IU/kg by intravenous infusion over 5 -10 minutes by standard intravenous technique into a vein on day 1 of menstrual bleeding or TA will be given as two 6 50 mg tablets (1300 mg) orally three times daily on the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding during each of 2 consecutive cycles in up to 60 women (inflated to 66 for anticipate d 10% dropout). with VWD. All enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of two treatment arms and followed for up to 24 weeks. Follow -up visits will occur at week 16 (post cycle 2) and 24 (post cycle 4, end -of-study). All study visit timelines will add +/ - one day to allow for weekends. Subjects randomized to rVWF will be trained in intravenous technique by study nurses, or can set up home visiting nurse for home self -injection. For bleeding not relieved after one dose, an additional dose may be given on the following day by HTC MD discretion."

HTCs will be responsible for immediately opening the shipment of rVWF and TA, upon receipt and removing temperature recording devices from the shipment. The temperature information will be recorded as requested on the shipping form provided by each distribution center. HTCs will also visually inspect the vi als to ensure no damage to bottles or vials occurred during shipment and physically count the number of bottles and vials received. This information will be recorded on the forms provided in the shipment by the distribution centers. If there are any discr epancies, the distribution centers will be notified immediately and further action taken at that time. HTC sites will store packaged, labeled packaged study drugs at 2 -8˚C until distributed to study subject at study visits. rVWF is stable ref rigerated at 2°C to 8°C in the original box and must be protected from extreme exposure to light: it is stable typically up to 2 years , per the label . Once reconstituted, if not used, it may be stored at room temperature not to exceed 27 °C (81 °C), for up to 3 hours. TA is stable at room temperature, 25°C, for up to 2 or more years."
22,page_22,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 20 6.2.4 PREPARATION Preparation of Study Drugs . rVWF is a lyophilized powder that must be reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (diluent), by two -way needle , inverting diluent over the vial of powder. Once transfer is complete, the contents of the vial are gently swirled to completely dissolve the powder. It must not be shaken. Once completely dissolved, the contents of the vial are drawn up into a syringe, after which it is infused intr avenously at a rate of up to 4 ml per minute. TA requires no preparation. 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Randomization of Study Drug s. Following confirmation of the subject’s eligibility along with the subject identification numbe r, the study randomization will be assigned, and an accession number linked with the randomization schema in the database and used for all subsequent study drug allocation. Randomization could occur within 72 hours of screening. Study drugs rVWF and TA wil l be supplied and shipped by Biolo gics to participating HTCs. Biologics will prepare study kits for each subject based on randomization assignment, linked through the CRHC DC web -based data system and shipped to participating HTCs for each study subject, where kits will be stored at 2 -8˚C until distribution to study subjects. Pending HTC receipt of study drug kit shipment, the 24 -week trial will begin with the first menstrual cycle following randomization. If the subject has a bleed requiring hemostatic ag ent treatment after screening or for other reason , which delays the start of study for greater or equal to 6 months, the screening tests must be repeated and a re -verification of eligibility must also take place. Subjects will take the assigned study drug for the first day (rVWF) or the first 5 days (TA) of menstrual bleeding during each of the next 4 consecutive menstrual cycles, with the first assigned study drug for the first 2 menstrual cycles, Cycles 1 and 2, followed by crossover to the alternative st udy drug for the next 2 menstrual cycles, Cycles 3 and 4 .

Subjects will be enrolled on the trial based on the investigator verification of eligibility, unbiased by race or ethnicity, and recognizing that drug and study arm assignment will be performed by the DCC randomization schema. See Demographic Chart below. Blinding. Not applicable. 6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE Compliance. Compliance with study drug will be assessed by patient diary and drug log maintained by study subjects during trial and reviewed by study nurses after each of 2 menstrual cycles on rVWF and on TA, during visits at the HTC, and also by the electronic databa se will also maintain track of drug adherence, including missed doses. 6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY Concomitant Medications. Medications taken during the trial will be obtained by medical history, including any hemostatic therapy and any other bleeds which may occur during the trial . Bleeds at other mucosal sites including epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding, which may occur but are unexpected in those with type 1 VWD, will be recorded on the diary and concomitant medication form. For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the Patient Diary are concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medi cations and supplements . 6.5.1 RESCUE MEDICINE Rescue Dose of Study Drug . As is standard in clinical practice for any bleed, subjects on this trial will be allowed to receive a second “rescue” dose of rVWF for menorrhagia on day 2 of either or both of two cycles for which they are randomized to rVWF, for inadequately controlled menstrual bleeding. The rescue dose will be given in the same dosage as the rVWF dose given on day 1 of the two cycles for which they are randomized to rVWF. They will record this i n their patient diary and report it to the study nurse during follow -up visits. STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL 7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTI ON Discontinuation/withdrawal . All subjects who discontinue study drug will remain on study for follow - up, especially for safety and efficacy study endpoints. Reasonable efforts will be made to undertake protocol -specified procedures to capture adverse events (AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and"
24,page_24,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 22 unanticipated problems (UPs). The date and specific underlying reason for each discontinuation or withdrawal will be captured by a separate case report form. Considerations for Stopping the Trial. It is possible that the test statistic will cross the monitori ng boundary. Statistical interim monitoring results should be taken as one component to the decision as to whether or not to stop a trial. To stop the trial for efficacy, results should be definitive enough to be able to change clinical practice. The DSMB will use the monitoring information to determine its recommendation to NHLBI. The DSMB can recommend that the trial should continue as proposed, that the protocol should be modified based on the results seen in one treatment comparison or in some well - defined subgroup of patients, or that the trial should be terminated early. The final decision to stop trial rests with the NHLBI. If recommendation is to stop the trial, the trial principal investigators shall be consulted before a final decision is made. We will allow the trial to run to completion if the intervention appears at least as effective as standard TA therapy. We propose halting the trial if a safety event reaches any stopping rules : (i) uncontrolled menstrual bleeding; (ii) thrombosis; or (iii) or grade 2 -5 allergic reactions. Please see section 9.4.4. The DSMB will review each event to determine if the trial should be halted. Statistical interim monitoring results should be taken as one component to the decision as to whether or not to stop a tri al. To stop the trial for efficacy, results should be definitive enough to be able to change clinical practice. The DSMB will use the monitoring information to determine its recommendation to NHLBI. The DSMB can recommend that the trial should continue as proposed, that the protocol should be modified based on the results seen in one treatment comparison or in some well -defined subgroup of patients, or that the trial should be terminated early. The final decision to stop trial rests with the NHLBI. If recom mendation is to stop the trial, the trial principal investigators shall be consulted before a final decision is made. Suspension and Stopping Rules According to the protocol Safety Stopping Rules, the trial will be terminated if an event(s) reach any stopp ing rules. A terminated trial means no further subjects are enrolled or treated. If an event(s) trigger any suspension rules, the study will put on hold until the DSMC and Medical Monitor evaluate the event and make a final recommendation. A suspended tria l means no further subjects are enrolled, but already enrolled subjects will be treated. In addition, all subjects who develop inhibitors, no matter the treatment they receive, will be monitored. 7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY Discontinuation/ Withdrawal. Study subjects are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participa nt from the study for the following reasons : • Pregnancy • Significant study drug non-compliance"
25,page_25,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 23 • If continued participation in the trial, e.g. because of any clinical adverse event , laboratory abnormality, or other me dical condition or situation would not be in the best interest of the subject • If the subject meets an exclusion criterio n (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation , e.g. elevated TSH indicating hypothyroidism • If the subject is unable to receive study drug for the prescribed duration, and/or complete it. The date and specific reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be rec orded on a separate Case Report Form . Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced. Subject s who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the stud y may also be replaced. It is ant icipated that up to 10% (6) subjects will discontinue or drop out of the trial; thus, 66 subjects will be enrolled to assure 60 subjects complete it. 7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW -UP Lost to Follow -up. Study subjects will be followed for a total of 24 weeks during the trial. Validity of the study is at risk when subjects are lost to follow -up, as information for endpoint documentation and evaluation is then lost. A study subject will be consid ered lost to follow -up if she fails to return for a scheduled visit and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff . The following actions must be taken if a participan t fails to return for a required study visit: • The site will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 4 weeks and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the as signed visit schedule and ascertain if she wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator will make every effort to reg ain contact with the subject, including up to 3 telephone calls and, if ne cessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing addr ess or local equivalent methods . These contact attempts will be documented in the subject’s study file. • Should the subject continue to be unreachable, she will be considered to have withd rawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES 8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS • This section includes a list and description of the efficacy assessments to be conducted on the trial. • PBAC Score . The PBAC will be scored for the 2 previous menstrual cycles and as the primary efficacy outcome of the trial for each cycle on the trial. PBAC at screening will be scored by the subject to determine eligibility, which per definitio n of menorrhagia, requires the PBAC score be"
26,page_26,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 24 >100 for at least one of two previous menstrual cycles. If the PBAC is not above 100 in past two cycles, this constitutes exclusion from participation. PBAC for each cycle, including Cycle 1 and 2 on study drug (either rVWF or TA) will be compar ed to PBAC for cycles 3 and 4 on study drug (either TA or rVWF). • Cycle Severity Rating (CSR) and Cycle Length (CL) . The cycle severity (CS) and cycle duration (CSL) will be rated by numeric scale 0 -3, and recorded in diaries. This will rate the severity of each cycle by a single score: ratings inclu de: 0=mild bleeding much less than usually experience d; 1=moderate bleeding l ess than usually experience d; 2=moderately severe bleeding but not as bad as the worst menstrual bleeding experienced; and 3=severe b leeding, as bad as the worst menstrual bleeding experienced. Cycle length (CL) will be in days of tampon/pad use on PBAC. These measures will provide more subjective ratings than PBAC, and as such, will provide distinct data separate from the primary endpo int. • Quality -of-Life Questionnaires. The impact of the two study interventions on quality of life will be determined by SF -36, Ruta Menorrhagia Severity Score, CD C-HRQoL -14, and CES -D, measured at baseline, and after the first two cycles (Visit 3), and aft er the second two cycles (Visit 4). The Short -Form -36 (SF -36) is a 36 -item general health survey in eight areas of physical and mental health (67, 68), which has been validated in women of reproductive age and strongly associated with VWD phenotype: lower SF-36 scores correlate with higher bleeding scores (69). The Ruta Menorrhagia Severity Scale is a 15 -item instrument that measures the physical, psychological and social effects of menorrhagia (70), and is validated for menorrhagia: higher scores correlate with reduced PBAC (13). The CDC Health -Related Quality of Life ( HRQ oL-14) is a 14 -item instrument that assesses “healthy days” including the number of physically and mentally unhealthy days in the past 30 days, and has been standardized for women of reproductive age (71). The Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression (CES -D) Scale is a 20 - item screen for depression that identifies depression symptoms over a range of ages and demographic groups (72). It is expected that QoL score by these 4 scales wi ll improve with study drugs and correlate with the reduction in menorrhagia by PBAC score. • Satisfaction Survey. A Satisfaction Survey will be assessed after two cycles of rVWF in which subjects will a) rate treatment with rVWF as compared with their usual treatment of heavy menses; b) rate how difficult or problematic the use of rVWF was; and c) indicate if rVWF will be considered for use in future menstrual cycles. It is anticipated that if rVWF results in no better improvement than TA, satisfaction will be lower, and the use of rVWF may not be justified. • Cost -Effectiveness Questionnaire. Given rWF burden (IV route, cost), we will collect cost - effective ness data (i.e. days lost from work/school, and need for iron infusion, RBC transfusion, or ER or hospit al care ) and compare events prevented and cost savings after 2 cycles on each treatment. Intervention and event costs will be estimated using data for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMMS) and Healthcare Cost Utilization Project (HCUP) (73). The effectiveness term in the analyses will be intervention -specific SF -36 QoL utility values (74). Data will also be compared by general estimating equations (75), which may be underpowered by the small sample size and short trial follow -up (76), and thus, will be an exploratory endpoint. Please refer to MOP for detailed description of study procedures."

Baseline laboratory studies will be drawn at screening, including Blood Counts : hemogl obin, platelets; Iron Tests : iron, TIBC, ferritin; Thyroid Test : TSH; and Von Willebrand Tests (VWF :RCo (activity), VWF:Ag, VIII:C, multimers , and VWF genotyp e). Before initiating treatment, subjects will be trained by the HTC nurse on 1) reading urine pregnancy tests and 2) completion of the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC), cycle severity score (CSR), and cycle length (CL); and 3) completion of patient diary. The Blood Counts, Iron Tests, and Thyroid Test will be performed by Quest laboratories. Any subject who has hypothyroidism, defined by an elevated TSH ; or who has iron deficiency as defined by low serum ferritin, if untreated, are ineligible. If the MD initiates iron therapy in a patient with low serum ferritin, she is eligible to participate on the trial . The VWF Assays will be performed at the Universi ty of North Carolina FOBRL laboratories, Chapel Hill NC, and the VWF genotype will be p erformed by Functional Bioscience, Madison WI . These laboratories are in compliance with and have on record updated Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amend ments (CLIA) cer tificates. The Table below lists for each of the specific laboratory assays, the estimated volume and type of specimen needed for each test, conditions for specimen preparation, shipping, and the laboratory receiving the sample and performing the assay . • Urine Pregnancy Test. A urine HCG pregnancy test will be performed by each subject at baseline and at the onset of menstrual bleeding in each of 4 cycles during the trial. Study drugs may be used only after a negative urine pregnancy test. Nurses will trai n subjects in how to administer and read the test. If the test is positive, subjects may not take study drugs, and must notify their HTC and physician and nurse immediately. • Brief Medical History, Vital Signs, and Physical Examination: To establish baselin e status, a brief medical history, physical exam, and vital signs will be obtained. The medical history will include all medical diagnoses, surgeries, current medications, concomitant medications, and any allergies. Vital signs will include temperature, pu lse, respirations, blood pressure, height, and weight. The physical exam will include targeted HEENT, chest, abdomen, extremities, neurologic, and skin assessment. Subsequent visits will assess interval change by interi m history and vital signs . • Patient Diary and Drug Log. The Patient Diary will capture information collected by the study subject, including the PBAC score, cycle severity (CS), cycle duration (CSL), other bleeds and use of “rescue” dose of rVWF. The drug log will keep track of dose and freq uency of study drugs taken, any missed doses, date and reason for missed doses, and adherence to study drug. • Assessment of Adverse E vents . The p rovisions for follow -up of ongoing AEs/SAE s will include monitoring all subjects for allergic reactions, thrombosis, or uncontrolled bleeding. Any adverse events will be monitored by the HTC physician until resolution of each AE or SAE. The degree of relatedness to study drugs will be determined , duration of adverse event, any medicati on given to treat the subject, and time to resolution of the event . • Availability of Lab Results to Subjects . The results of Blood Counts, Iron tests, and Thyroid Tests will be made available to study subjects, and will establish eligibility. The results of the VWF assays"
28,page_28,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 26 and multimers, and VWF genotype will be used for research purposes only, to compare with PBAC scores by study arm. As previously noted, a subject’s medical chart or results of diagnostic tests performed as part of individual regular medical care may be used for screening or as a part of data collection. Therefore, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules, other relevant federal or state laws, and local institutional requirements will be followed, as applicable. Information regarding past VWD diagnosis, and PBAC score from past menstrual cycles will be reviewed to help determine eligibility. 8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENTS (AE) An Adverse event (AE) is defined as an untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom , or disease, temporally associated with a person’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to a person’s participation in the research (21 CFR 312.32 (a)) ]. 8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS (SA E) A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: • results in death; • is life -threa tening i.e. places a subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; The latter is not regarded as an SAE if: (i) The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12 hours; OR (ii) The admission is pre -planned, i.e. scheduled surgery arranged prior to study; OR (iii) The admission is not associated with an AE (e.g. social hospitalization for respite care) NB: An invasive p rocedure during any hospitalization may be reported as an SAE Lab Assay Tests Volume/Type Tube Preparation/Shipping/ Laboratory Blood Counts Hemoglo bin, platelets One 4.0 ml EDTA purple top No preparation for EDTA tube.

The severity of the adverse event refers to the intensity of an event and is categorized as: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated, Moderate ; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living, Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening ; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living, Life-threatening consequences ; urgent intervention indicated, Death related to AE. As an alternative, standard grading may be used, e.g. CTCAE, grade 1 to grade 5. If used, a “translation” between the CTCAE system and the standard grading above will be provided. 8.3.3.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y INTERVENTION Relationship. Relatedness refers to the extent to which an adverse event is considered to be related to the intervention or study procedures. An adverse event is considered related if there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the procedure . Note that the term “ suspected ” is also means possibly, probably or definitely related to the intervention or study procedures. The following definitions apply to relatedness: 1. Unrelated • Adverse event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., underlying d isease, environment) 2. Unlikely (adverse event must meet 2 of the following): • Does not have temporal relationship to intervention • Could readily have been produced by the participant’s clinical state • Could have been due to environmental or other interventions • Does not follow known pattern of response to intervention • Does not reappear or worsen with reintroduction of intervention 3. Possible (adverse event must meet 2 of the following):"
30,page_30,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 28 • Has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention • Could not readily have been produced by the participant’s clinical state • Could not readily have been due to environmental or other interventions • Follows a known pattern of response to intervention 4. Probable (adverse event must meet 3 of the following): • Has a reasonable temporal r elationship to intervention • Could not readily have been produced by the participant’s clinical state or have been due to environmental or other interventions • Follows a known pattern of response to intervention • Disappears or decreases with reduction in dose or cessation of intervention 5. Definite (adverse event must meet all 4 of the following): • Has a reasonable temporal relationship to intervention • Could not readily have been produced by the participant’s clinical state or have been due to environmental or ot her interventions • Follows a known pattern of response to intervention • Disappears or decreases with reduction in dose or cessation of intervention and recurs with re-exposure 8.3.3.3 EXPECTEDNESS Expectedness. An unexpected event is one that has not been documented previously as an established adverse reaction to the study intervention and that is not recognized as part of the natural progression of the disease. A particular event may also be considered unexpected if it has a higher severity grade than wha t has been documented or identified previously. Action : Any action taken while on study drug to resolve the AE is to be documented as follows: • Drug withdrawn • Drug interrupted • Dose not changed • Dose increased • Not applicable Outcome : The outcome of th e AE is to be documented as follows: • Not recovered /resolved • Recovered/resolved • Recovered with sequelae • Recovering/resolving • Fatal • Unknown"

The clini cal site staff will report all SAEs on the trial data collection forms. Expected serious adverse events are listed in the manual of operations; these events are recorded on the in -hospital and the 30 -day follow -up data collection forms. Site personnel are required to report and document all unexpected SAEs and UPs to the DCC. The DCC will send unexpected SAEs (as reported by the site) to the study Medical Monitor for final assessment of severity, relatedness, and expectedness. The Medical Monitor will remai n masked to the transfusion strategy while evaluating the SAE. 8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Reporting Procedures. All reported SAEs and unanticipated problems will be included in systematic reporting to the DSMB on a semi -annual basis. This includes adverse events and problems previously transmitted through expedited reporting. The following three classes of events will be reported to the NHLBI, the DSMB and the local IRB in an expedited manner: 1) Fatal or life threatening unexpected suspected SAE, 2) Non -fatal, non -life threatening unexpected suspected SAE, and 3) Unanticipated problem. Fatalities related to blood transfusions must be reported to the FDA within 7 days according to guidance: (http://www.fda.gov/ BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ Guida nces/Blood/ucm074947.htm ). If a particular SAE is reported with abnormally high frequency durin g the trial, this will be submitted to the Medical Monitor at NHLBI for review. Site personnel will complete and submit an SAE form to the DCC within 24 hours of learning of the event whenever the event is both serious and unexpected. In cases where the ev ent is not serious but places the patient at greater risk of physical, psychological, economic, or social harm, and is both unexpected and related to the study, the site s will notify the DCC within 14 days of learning of the event. SAE forms will be forwa rded along with relevant patient history data to the Medical Monitor for review. The study Medical Monitor will assess severity, relatedness, and expectedness of the event within 48 hours. DCC Reporting for Study Sites. Following the Medical Monitor’s f eedback, the DCC will complete an SAE report for adverse events categorized as serious, unexpected and related and submit the SAE within 72 hours of learning of the event to the NHLBI Project Officer and to the DSMB Executive Secretary. The DCC will also s end a final (or updated) report by 7 days of learning of the event. A report will also be sent for unanticipated problems. The DCC will send the reports to the NHLBI DSMB Executive Secretary and the NHLBI Medical Monitor for review. All reporting from the time that the Site learns about the event until it is reported to the NHLBI, DSMB, FDA and IRBs will follow the NHLBI DSMB established timelines as specified in ( https ://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/funding/human -subjects/adverse -event ) and shown above. Upon receipt of an expedited report, the DSMB chair will decide whether the event should be discussed at the next scheduled DSMB meeting or discussed as soon as possible at an ad -hoc meeting. Reporting of Local IRB Actions. All adverse events experienced by study subjects from the time of dosing until 30 days after administration is to be recorded on the CRF, regardless of the severity of the"
32,page_32,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 30 event or its relationship to study treatment. The serious AE reporting procedures are based on the “Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events” (CTCAE) v 4.03, June 14, 2010 (50). Subjects will report any AE or SAE to the HTC co -investigator or n ursing coordinator. All AEs, regardless of severity, will be followed up by HTC Investigator until satisfactory resolution. All subjects experiencing AEs using investigational product, will be monitored until symptoms subside and any abnormal laboratory va lues have returned to baseline, or until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until death, in which case a full pathologist's report will be supplied, if possible. Withdrawal from the clinical study and therapeutic measures shal l be at the discretion of the investigator. IRB actions regarding the trial will be communicated to the NHLBI Project Officer and NHLBI Executive Secretary in an expedited fashion. If the IRB or ethics board at any site, CCC or DCC takes action regarding t he trial (e.g., the IRB places a hold on the trial or suspends the trial), the site will report this to the CCC within 24 hours of the action. The Site will submit written documentation from the IRB, an explanation of the circumstances, and a plan of actio n to the CCC within 72 hours. The CCC will promptly communicate this information to the DCC and the NHLBI project officer and DSMB Executive Secretary. Adverse Event Reporting Period. All randomized patients will be followed for 24 weeks. Reporting of AEs will cease at the conclusion of the trial. 8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING See Table . 8.3.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS Reporting of adverse events to study subjects will follow Informed Consent guidelines, to assure subjects are aware of risks and benefits, and any event that might change the balance of risks and benefits. 8.3.8 EVENTS OF SPECIAL IN TEREST Not applicable. 8.3.9 REPORTING OF PREGNAN CY Study subject will perform a urine pregnancy test on the first day of menstrual bleeding for each of 4 cycles on study. If the test is positive, no study drug may be taken, and the result of the pregnancy test must be reported immediately to the physician. 8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTI CIPATED PROBLEMS (UP )"
33,page_33,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 31 An Unanticipated Problem (UP) is defined as any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, taking protocol research procedures and participation population characteristics into consideration. • Related or possibly related to a person’s participation in the research. • Places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. 8.4.2 UNANTICIPATED PROBL EM REPORTING See Table.

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES"
34,page_34,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 32 There will be a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), completed prior to database lock and unblinding of the study data. Please r efer to the SAP for additional information. The primary endpoint is the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score, a validated measure of menstrual blood loss . PBAC scores from all four periods of the crossover trial (AABB/BBAA) will be utilized in statistical analyses . The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in PBAC score improvement from baseline between intravenous rVWF and oral TA treatments. Our alternative hypothesis is that rVWF will be superior, producing a greater improvement in PBAC score compared to treatment by oral TA. Specifically, we hypothesize that intrave nous rVWF will improve PBAC score by at least 40 points more than TA. The secondary endpoints include frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, by Patient Diary, Drug Logs, Cycle Severity Score (CSR), Cycle Length (CL), Quality -of-Life (QoL) forms, including SF-36, Ruta, CDC -HRQoL -14, and CES -D; and satisfaction as measured by survey s. Additionally, response to treatment will be compared with VWF assays and VWF genotype. Our secondary hypotheses will evaluate the safety, tolerability and acceptability of rVWF versus TA as measured by outcomes such as frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, CSR, CL, QoL questionnaire s and satisfaction surveys. We hypothesize that rVWF will be as safe, tolerable and acceptable as TA in the reduction of menorrhagia. Additionally, we hypothesize that VWF assays and VWF genotype will significantly predict response to study treatment. 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Sample Size and Statistical Power : We propose a phase III multicenter, prospective, randomized crossover trial to compare IV rVWF vs. po TA in reducing menorrhagia in type 1 VWD. We powered our trial based on the primary endpoint of a 40 -point greater reduction in PBAC when treated with rVWF compared to TA. Assuming intent -to-treat (ITT) analyses, a two -tailed alternative hypothesis with type I error rate of 0.0 5, a 4 -period 2 -group (AABB/BBAA) crossover design, an estimated betw een-subject standard deviation of 63 points and an estimated within -subject standard deviation of 100 points, a total of N=60 patients will provide 84% power to detect a difference in improvement of 40 points or more between rVWF and TA. The sample size w as inflated to N=66 to account for an expected dropout rate of 10% or less. Refer to SAP for more details. Reviewers of the NHLBI 2009 State of the Science (SoS) Hemostasis and Thrombosis panel considered the continuous outcome a limitation and suggested using percent reduction as a more clinically meaningful endpoint. A disadvantage of this approach is that it results in a higher sample size, and, although a dichotomous outcome is clinically relevant, the sample size is too high to achieve in this rare di sease. The difference of 40 points used in our sample size determination was deemed clinically meaningful and feasible, based on six trials in which 95% or more of women receiving rVWF had >50% reduction in PBAC (10, 11), and the belief that smaller effects between groups might not chang e clinical practice or patient behavior, e.g. adopting IV dosing or higher cost treatment."
35,page_35,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 33 9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES The full analysis set will be based on an intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis, which will comprise all participants who have been randomized to either of the two crossover sequences (AABB/BBAA), regardless of length of follow -up or actual intervention received. 9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH Descriptive statistics will be presented as means a nd standard deviations for continuous variables and sample proportions for categorical variables. All descriptive statistics will be accompanied by 95% confidence intervals. For inferential tests, a two -tailed p -value<0.05 (type I error rate of 0.05) wil l determine statistical significance; the confidence level for confidence intervals will be set at 95%. Covariates and potential remedies to violations of assumptions underlying statistical procedures are specified in the SAP. 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIM ARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S) The primary endpoint is the continuous score on the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC ), a validated measure of menstrual blood loss described in sections above . The primary endpoint, PBAC score, will be compared between rVWF an d TA using a linear mixed model (LMM) fit via restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) to account for repeated measures (65). The distribution of the outcome will be checked for departures from the assumptions of linear mixed modeling, such as norma lity, and a transformation will be employed as necessary. Treatment and menstrual cycle will be in cluded as fixed effects in the model. Though we expect no crossover effect, we will assess this by testing whether a treatment -by-cycle interaction term is s ignificant. If the interaction is not significant, we will assume no carryover effect and remove the interaction term from the model. Baseline PBAC score will be included as a covariate. The intercept will be allowed to vary randomly to account for subje ct-level variability of the outcome at baseline. The Kenward -Roger method for calculating degrees of freedom will be used to improve small -sample performance (65). The linear mixed model will allow for unbiased estimates of treatment effects and the utiliz ation of all data under the intention to treat (ITT) principle and the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). This approach will provide least -squares estimates of the mean reductions in bleeding score on each treatment and allow for statistical comparison of the difference between them. Additional details may be found in the SAP. As a preventive measure, we will make every attempt to document all reasons for missing data. In addition, baseline characteristics will be compared between participant s who do and do not withdraw from the study as a way to assess the impact of missing information and attrition. For missing data from lost or incomplete diaries, HTC nurses will obtain data retrospectively at study visits 1 -2 months later, for"
36,page_36,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 34 which recal l is excellent. We will investigate the reasons for intermittently missing data (misses an assessment but comes back) and dropouts, and use the likelihood -based procedure if ""missing at random"" (MAR) is confirmed. If the missing -ness is found to be non -ignorable (missing not at random), we will consider joint or shared parameter models. 9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY ENDPOINT(S) The secondary endpoints will include continuous and categorical measures described in sections above, such as : a) frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, recorded by patient diary; b) cycle severity rating (CSR); c) cycle length (CL); and d) quality of life questionnaires and satisfaction survey. In addition, response to study treatment will be compared wit h VWF assays and VWF genotype. Continuous secondary outcomes , including cycle severity, quality of life, and coagulation measures, will be analyzed with multivariable linear mixed models fit via maximum likelihood using the same approach as for the primary outcome. The same fixed and random effects will be included in secondary outcome models. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), including the same fixed and random terms as the primary outcome model, will be used to analyze categorical se condary outcomes. Least - squares estimates of treatment effects will be obtained to determine if significant differences in outcomes exist between rVWF and TA. 9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES Safety Analyses. Safety e ndpoints , including bleeding severity (CSR), cycle length (CL), and frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue dose, are secondary endpoints, and will be analyzed as described above . AEs will be coded by “Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ” (CTCAE) v 4.03, June 14, 2010 (50) , calculated (e.g., each AE will be counted once only for a given participant ), presented (e.g., severity, frequency, and relationship of AEs to study intervention will be presented by System Organ Class ( SOC) and preferred term groupi ngs) and will include for each AE the start date, stop date, severity, relationship, expectedness, outcome, and duration will be analyzed by descriptive statistics, by study subject and study arm, as described above . Safety Stopp ing Events, below, enumerate specific Adverse events leadi ng to premature discontinuation from the study include: The Safety Stopping Events include: 1. Uncontrolled Menstrual Bleeding Stopping Rules : The DSMB will define stopping of the trial after individ ual evaluation of uncontrolled menstrual bleeding . Suspension Rules : A subject develops uncontrolled menstrual bleeding despite or in association with the administration of rVWF or TA, defined as >2 gm% fall in hemoglobin from baseline, and/or requirement for RBC transfusion and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation . 2.

A ll descriptive statistics will be accompanied by 95% confidence intervals. Baseline comparisons will be performed between the two sequences of treatments (AABB versus BBAA) using two -sample t -tests for interval data , chi -squared tests for categorical variables , or their nonparametric counterparts . 9.4.6 PLANNED INTERIM ANAL YSES Not applicable. 9.4.7 SUB -GROUP ANALYSES Not applicable. 9.4.8 TABULATION OF INDIVI DUAL PARTICIPANT DATA Not applicable. 9.4.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES"
38,page_38,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 36 Exploratory Analysis: This study will have one exploratory analysis, a cost-effectiveness analysis. In this analysis, the primary cost outcome will be menorrhagia treatment costs from the health care sector perspective, i.e., health system costs for implementing each prophylactic treatment and other direct costs associated wi th menorrhagia care, including medical/surgical costs (all primary, secondary, and tertiary care costs) associated with menorrhagia treatment. We will determine 1) the incremental cost to the health system of implementing the menorrhagia prevention interve ntions, including medication and infusion costs; and 2) all other menorrhagia care costs not related to the interventions (i.e., all outpatient visits and hospitalizations). The analysis will use costs in 2017 US dollars. In addition, as a secondary cost outcome , we will determine costs from a societal perspective, which will include the health care sector costs above plus indirect costs resulting from days lost from work or school. We will collect data pertinent to costs (costs of TA, rVWF, iron infusion , and RBC transfusion; ER/hospital care episodes; days lost from work/school). Intervention and event costs for each intervention will be estimated using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), and Bureau of Labor Statistics databases. Medication costs will be estimated using average wholesale prices. The primary effectiveness term will be quality adjusted life years, the product of the quality of life utility value of a health state and the time sp ent in that state. Utilities measure preferences for health states and range from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Utilities can be derived from a variety of quality of life measures, or measured directly by questionnaires or other techniques. In our analy sis, intervention - specific utilities will be derived from SF -36 scores using a validated algorithm. We will calculate 95% CIs around cost and effectiveness estimates and conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of our assumptions. We will as sess intervention program value using incremental cost, incremental effectiveness, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. In the primary analysis , differences in healthcare sector costs and effectiveness between interventions will be compared via incremental cost -effectiveness ratios, yielding incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained when comparing one intervention to the othe r. Secondary analyses will similarly compare societal perspective costs and effectiveness between interventions. In this analysis, work/school absence cost will be calculated by multiplying days absent by the US average daily wages for nonfarm production w orkers, using US Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The robustness of cost -effectiveness analysis results will be tested using 1 -way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. In 1 -way sensitivity analyses, all parameter values will be ind ividually varied to test their effect on cost -effectiveness results. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, all model parameters will be simultaneously varied over distributions 5000 times, with results summarized using a cost-effectiveness acceptabili ty curve, which shows the likelihood that interventions are favored over a range of quality adjusted life year dollar value (or acceptability) thresholds, and depict the probability that one strategy is less costly and more effective than the other (i.e., “dominant”). In the US, there is no established cost -effectiveness acceptability criterion; $50,000 -$150,000 per quality adjusted life year gained is a commonly cited range for justifiable costs based on actual US healthcare spending."

An external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) consisting of members appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) will monitor the trial, advise the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Program Officer and provide input to the Steering Committee. The DSMB will be composed of nationally recognized e xperts in hematology , women’s health, or in clinical trials. The DSMB will review the study protocol and provide NHLBI with recommendations. Recruitment will be initiated after the NHBLI receives the DSMB recommendation and approves the study protocol. Throughout the course of the trial, the DSMB will review recruitment, retention, data completeness, protocol deviations, adverse events (AEs), severe adverse events (SAEs) and unexpected problems (UPs) on a semi -annual basis and will provide written recommendations to NHLBI. Local Data Safety Monitoring Committee. The local Data Safety Monitoring Committee for this study will include the local PI and Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) PI, Dr. Ragni, and the nurse coordinator(s), who will meet at least bi -weekly and be responsible f or ongoing monitoring all recruitment, data collection and subject confidentiality procedures at this site. Subjects will be closely monitored by the PI, research and clinical staff to ensure subject safety and to ensure that procedures are in place to mai ntain privacy and confidentiality, progress of study, integrity of the data, procedure reviews and for discussion of pertinent scientific literature or events which could affect the benefit to risk ratio. All serious and unexpected adverse events and/or ma jor breaches of confidentiality will be reported to the sponsor and to the IRB according to regulations outlined in the IRB Reference Manual for the Use of Human Subjects . All AE’s, SAE’s generated from the HTCs will be sent following reporting guidelines to the DCC who will forward to the NIH (see table 9.4.3) . A report summarizing the above local and central DSMP activities will be submitted to the IRB at the time of annual renewal. 10.1.6 CLINICAL MONITORING Adverse Event Monitoring. Adverse events will be monitored in four distinct ways: 1) the DSMB will review all reported adverse events and monitor the incidence rates on a semi -annual basis, 2) the expedited review of unexpected SAEs related to the protocol and unanticipated proble ms (UP), 3) all study outcomes will be evaluated by assigned treatment group on semi -annual basis, and 4) the formal statistical interim monitoring of the efficacy of the primary outcome by assigned treatment group on an annual basis. If unexpected safety concerns arise from the trial data or from external research or literature, then safety data reporting will be expanded and examined on an ad -hoc basis. The Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will work with the NIH an d with the DSMB to ensure that the board members have sufficient information to comprehensively monitor patient safety throughout the trial. The DSMB may advise early termination of the trial for safety reasons, efficacy of the primary outcome or other mod ifications to the protocol."

The activation of the site will be formalized by the DCC issuance of a site activ ation letter sent to the CCC and site Principal Investigators. o Remote audit of informed consents ▪ The DCC monitor will review the informed consent (IC) document for 100% of subjects enrolled in the study. ▪ In the event of amendments during the course of the trial, all subject re -consent will also undergo the 100% consent audit. ▪ Study coordinators will upload the IC via the study web portal. ▪ A narrative note describing the informed consent process is required for any research study that involves the evaluatio n of a research intervention (FDA 21 CFR 312.62). This nar rative document will undergo DC C audit concurrent with IC review. o This audit process is described in detail in the CCDC CMP. Remote audit of study files ▪ 100% of the study files for the first 1 -2 subj ects enrolled at each study center will be audited at the time of randomization and at study completion. ▪ At a minimum , the following data will be monitored: • Eligibility, Inclusion/exclusion criteria • Source documentation to support diagnosis, inclusion/exc lusion criteria • Verification protocolized study procedures are completed in keeping with study directives. • Review of drug accountability and concomitant medications • 100% review of reported SAE • Confirmation of PI review and electronic signature on all requ ired eCRF forms. • Review of system content to identify errors, omissions, discrepancies • Review of study team compliance with DCC-directed action items ▪ The process of study subject file audit involves provision of de -identified hard copy upload into the CCDC audit portal. These procedures are described in the CMP training. ▪ eMRF review - A review of the eMRF will accompany the audit of the 1-2 study subject s at the completion of their study participation to ensure the validity of all regulatory and essential documents. ▪ Audit findings summary report • The DCC monitor will document the audit findings in a summary report within 14 days of the au dit and disseminate the report to the CCC and site PI."
46,page_46,"The VWDMin Trial Version v1.0 Protocol PRO15070638 March 19, 2018 44 All identified action items must be completed within 30 days of the audit report submission date. o For-Cause Remote Audits • Remote au dits will be conducted if the DCC identifies multiple discrepancies in data entry, delayed response to DCC requested action items, high rate of protocol deviations or site findings that are inconsistent when compared to the performance of other study sites. The Site PI will be contacted by phone to discuss the concerns and email notification of the date of the for -cause remote audit will be circulated. o Remote Close -out visit • Close -out visits may be conducted at study completion or earlier in the case of study termination by the IRB, Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) or FDA. • A final closeout audit of the eMRF will take place to ensure all regulatory and essential documents are incorporated as expected. During the course of the study, data checks are completed to ensure no missing data is present. At clo se out, an audit of all subject data fields will be reviewed, any outstanding data will be identified and requests to complete missing data will be sent to the study team to rectify. • Notification of remote audit findings The Principal Investigators from the CCC and the audit ed clinical site will be provided copies of monitoring reports within 14 business days of the remote visit(s). Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP). The CMP describes the responsibilities of the study team with regard to provision of essential documentation, the process employed by the DCC to conduct the monitoring, the frequency with which the monitoring will be completed , the monitoring to be performed, and the process whereby monitoring reports are dissem inated to investigators. 10.1.7 QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Each clinical site will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data and biological specimen collection, documentation and completion. An individualized quality management plan will be developed to describe a site’s quality management. Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anoma lies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution. Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated and biological specimens are collected, docu mented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), and applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)."

With the consultation of the DCC, the PI and coordinator will develop an operations manual to standardize all proced ures and staff training in areas such as patient recruitment, measurement, assessment, and data entry, management, and security. The DCC coordinator will conduct the initial web -based system training sessions for study team s via online teleconferences . Onl ine access to video training that supports the initial training will be available during the course of the trial. All subsequent training sessions for new study personnel or retraining related to the web -based system or study procedures will be the respons ibility of the CCC national coordinator. The DCC will provided consultant support of the CCC coordinator to guide new training sessions and for those study teams that exhibit a need for additional education. The DCC will create an electronic System for Data Management (eSYSDM), based on detailed study protocols and requirements that includes an electronic case report form and a tracking system, with the capability to incorporate EHR. The eSYSDM is developed using .N ET 2.0 to create the interface and SQL for the database. The DCC will work closely with investigative team and other study personnel to ensure that protocols are being followed, data integrity and confidentiality are maintained, and that the data contains a minimum amount of missing data. All study files residing in designated network folders will be backed -up daily and archived weekly. The weekly archived files are maintained for 1 year until the data are erased. All study subjects will be assigned unique study identifiers that will appear on all data collection instruments, electronic media, documents, and files used in the statistical analysis and manuscript preparation. Only authorized team members will have access to personal information needed for tra cking and informed consent. Other data quality assurance measures will include detailed documentation of computer operations and data editing procedures and regular meetings with project staff to review any changes in procedure. The DCC also has specific d ata quality measures that will be implemented. These include data verification, built in data validation mechanisms such as logic and out of range data checks, and repeated evaluation of the data collection and entry process. 10.1.8.2 STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION All records must be maintained for at least seven years. Permission from the Coordinating Center is required prior to record destruction ."

Adult females age 18 - 45 years of age with type 1 von Willebrand disease, defined by VWF:RCo <0.50 IU/ml (historic or current), normal VWF multimers, previous bleeding history, and who have menorrhagia and a PBAC >100 in at least one of the two preceding menstrual cycles, and cared for at one of the 19 or more participating centers participating in this trial will be eligible for study. It is estimated that up to 60 eligible subjects (inflated to 66 to anticipate dropout). w ill be enrolled (Table 1). Children will be excluded as most have not reached menarche, and the safety of rVWF in children has not been established in children. We shall attempt to recruit subjects in respective proportion to these demographics. All subjec ts will be screened prior to enrollment for history and laboratory data confirming a VWD diagnosis. Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects at the screening visit. Once eligibility is confirmed, visit 1 will be defined as start of enrol lment. It is estimated that the HCWP site will screen and enroll 2 -5 subjects locally, and up to 60 (inflated to 66 to anticipate dropout) nationally. The requirement for PBAC >100 based in at least one of the two preceding menstrual cycles will also serve as baseline menstrual severity for comparison with study drugs. Inclusion of Children. As this study concerns menstrual cycle bleeding, only adult women, 18 -45 years of age will be included. Children are excluded from participation as most have not reac hed menarche, and the safety of rVWF in children has not been established. 10.2.3 QUALIFICATIONS Qualifications of Investigators.

You are being asked to participate in a research study that compares the use of recombinant von Willebrand factor (rVWF) and tranexamic acid (TA, Lysteda ®) in women with von Willebrand Disease (VWD) who have heavy monthly periods. von Willebrand disease is a common genetic trait passed on in families (called inherited) bleeding disorder (or bleeding disease) that occurs in 3% of the population. It is caus ed by deficient or defective von Willebrand factor (VWF). Most people with VWD are treated with DDAVP (desmopressin), which is a protein given by vein or as an intranasal spray to treat bleeding symptoms. The problem is that some patients do not respond t o DDAVP, or the response may be limited. This is because after three days, the stores of VWF become low (or depleted). Tranexamic acid is another treatment for menorrhagia, but it is less effective than DDAVP. Thus better treatments are needed for individ uals with VWD. In two clinical trials, rVWF has been shown to be safe and effective in treating and preventing bleeds in patients with VWD. Among women with menorrhagia in those trials, it also reduce menstrual bleeding. The purpose of this study is to compare how well recombinant VWF (rVWF) alone versus TA alone reduces bleeding in women with heavy monthly periods. rVWF is licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of bleeding , including menorrhagia (heavy m onthly periods), in people with von W illebrand disease (VWD). In the studies above, rVWF was given by intravenous (in a vein) infusion, reduced bleeding, and was safe and well -tolerated. In a survey of 16 hemophilia treatment centers, VWF concentrate has been used for menorrhagia only after first and second line treatment fail: in all 13 subjects receiving VWF there was reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding. In six published studies of rVWF or plasma -derived (pd) VWF concentrate, including two prospective , two retrospective and two observational studies of 455 VWD subjects, a total of 88 women received VWF 36 -50 IU/kg for 1 -6 days with reduction in menstrual bleeding in all women, and no adverse effects. Tranexamic acid (Lysteda®) in this study is taken as a pill by mouth three times daily. It is licensed by the FDA for the treatment of menorrhagia."

You are being asked to participate in this study because you are a woman 18 to 45 years of age with type 1 VWD and you have heavy periods. You cannot participate if you are pregnant or lactating or if you are not willing to use a “double -barrier” method of contraception during the study. You must also be willing to avoid aspirin and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, e.g. ibuprofen, during study. This site is one of up to 19+ sites in the United States and hopes to screen <enter number> subjects in order to enroll a total of <enter number> subjects (60 total subjects for the entire study). Your partici pation will last approximately 24 weeks (6 months). The projected duration of the study at all sites is expected to be around 5 years. What procedures will be performed for research purposes? If you decide to participate in this study, you will sign a c onsent form. This is a 24 -week outpatient study that involves 4 visits. An appendix chart is located at the end of this consent form which outlines all visits. There are 3 parts to the study: pre -treatment, treatment, and post - treatment study (described in detail below and in an appendix chart located end of this consent form). The study involves two treatment arms, Arms A and B, in which you will receive two drugs, one given by intravenous injection and one given orally. This study is called a “prospective randomized, crossover study” which means you will receive both treatment arms, but neither you nor your study doctor (or staff) will choose the order of the treatment arms. If you agree to participate, you will be randomized (toss of coin) to be in Grou p I or Group II for the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding in your next four consecutive menstrual cycles. If you are in Group 1 , you will receive Arm A for menstrual bleeding in cycles 1 and 2, followed by Arm B for menstrual bleeding in cycles 3 and 4. If you are in Group II , you will receive Arm B for menstrual bleeding in cycles 1 and 2, followed by Arm A for menstrual bleeding in cycles 3 and 4 (See Table below). Group Cycles 1, 2 Cycles 3, 4 Group I Arm A : rVWF 40 IU/kg day 1 Arm B : TA 1300 mg po tid days 1 -5 Group II Arm B : TA 1300 mg po tid days 1 -5 Arm A : rVWF 40 IU/kg day 1 rVWF is von Willebrand factor concentrate; TA is tranexamic acid; tid is three times daily. If you are in Group I , you will receive Arm A first: rVWF 40 IU/kg by intravenous injection on day 1 of menstrual bleeding in each of your next two menstrual cycles, “cycles 1 and 2.” Then, you will crossover (switch) to receive Arm B: TA by mouth (2 pills which equal 1,300 mg) three times daily (tid) on days 1 -5 during the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding in each of your next two menstrual cycles “cycles 3 and 4.” If you are in Group II , you will receive Arm B first: TA by mouth (2 pills which equal 1,300 mg) three times daily (tid) on days 1 -5 during the fir st 5 days of menstrual bleeding in each of your next two menstrual cycles “cycles 1 and 2.” Then you will crossover (switch) to receive Arm A: rVWF 40 IU/kg by intravenous injection on day 1 of menstrual bleeding in each of your next two menstrual cycles, “cycles 3 and 4.” Before you start the study drugs, you will have a brief medical history and physical exam and blood tests to check for thyroid function and iron deficiency. The <insert study site name> nurses will also train you to give the rVWF infusio n, but if you prefer a visiting nurse (VNA) to give rVWF in your home, that can be arranged. During your next 4 monthly menstrual cycles"
59,page_59,"Page 3 of 13 University Of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board Approval Date: «Approval Date» Renewal Date: «Renewal Date» IRB #: «IRBNo» (periods) you will receive rVWF alone for two cycles AND TA alone for two cycles, the order of which will be decided by the toss of a coin (randomization). These drugs can be taken in your home, or you can come into the center for the rVWF infusion. There will be a total of 4 visits for outpatient monitoring by the <insert study site name> . The drugs used in this study will be supplied by an NIH -contracted pharmacy, and shipped to the <insert study site name> . Your study drugs will be provided in a special kit for each cycle , which will be reviewed by the study nurse so you are completely familiar with the contents and ho w and when to take the study drug each cycle. The nurse will also provide you with a supply of tampons and pads, which you will use exclusively (no other tampons or pads will be permitted) during the study.

Blood Sample Storage Your samples will be labeled with code numbers, and information linking the code numbers to your identity will be kept in a separate, locked file at the <insert your hemophilia center name.> . Your Von Willebrand Test blood samples will be stored indefinit ely at the Francis Owen Blood Research Laboratory, University of North Carolina, and under the control of Dr. Nichols and Dr. Ragni. Dr. Nichols is engaged in Von Willebrand Disease research. There is no plan for the samples to undergo other tests or be g iven to other investigators. If such a plan were considered, you would be required to sign a separate consent. Tell us if you do not want your sample to be stored, and your sample will be destroyed after the clotting studies are performed. What are the possible risks, side effects, and discomforts of this research study? As with any investigational study, there may be adverse events or side effects that are currently unknown and it is possible that certain of these unknown risks could be permanent, serio us, or life-threatening. There may be risks and discomforts associated with these products and study treatment that are not yet known at this time. Should you encounter any side effects you think might be related to this study or the drugs, you should cont act <Insert pertinent MD name> immediately. Risk of Blood Drawing There may be discomfort with drawing blood, which is common, and may include pain, lightheadedness bruising, or bleeding or infection in the tissue around the vein. This may be alleviate d or reduced by applying pressure to the blood draw site for 5 minutes, and assuming a recumbent position, i.e. lying on your back with your head flat and knees bent, if lightheaded. The risk of repeated blood draws is anemia, or a low blood count, but th is will be carefully monitored. Injections may rarely, cause pain, soreness, redness, warmth, itching, numbness, tenderness, swelling, skin changes (discoloration, breakdown, or thickening), or swelling or lymph nodes near the injection site. Risk of I nadvertent Disclosure There is a possibility that if the result of the research studies involving your medical record or genetic material were to become generally known, this information could impact future insurability, employability, or reproduction plan s, or have a negative impact on family relationships, and/or result in paternity suits or stigmatization (identifying as unusual, different). Risk of Allergic Reaction"
63,page_63,"Page 7 of 13 University Of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board Approval Date: «Approval Date» Renewal Date: «Renewal Date» IRB #: «IRBNo» An allergic reaction to study treatment with rVWF may rarely occur, in less than 0.001% or 1 in 100,000 people, and could cause in decreasing order of severity : death, anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening reaction causing difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and irregularity of the heartbeat, hypervolemia (overabundance of body fluid ), paresthesias (prickling sensation), urticaria (hives) generalized or localized to the injection site, chest tightness, rash, pruritus (itching), and/or edema (swelling), fever, and chills. The dose chosen for the study, 40 IU/kg, appears to be safe and well tolerated in clinical trials. An allergic reaction to treatment with TA is rare. Symptoms may include chills, fever, nausea and vomiting, or rarely may include in decreasing order of severity : death, anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening reaction c ausing difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, heart irregularity, increase in body fluids, paresthesias (numbness or pricking sensation), urticaria (hives, chest tightness, rash, pruritus (itching), edema (swelling), fever, and/or chills. Should this oc cur, Benadryl , a medication which reduces inflammation, may be given, with close monitoring of these symptoms. Benadryl may cause drowsiness, dizziness or low blood pressure. You will be monitored for these symptoms while receiving drugs. No one with a kno wn allergy to either rVWF or TA will be enrolled in this study. Risk of Thromboembolism Although rVWF and TA increase blood protein levels, there is the rare possibility that rVWF or TA could cause a clot in the vein (thrombosis) with swelling, pain, or a clot in the lung (pulmonary embolus) with shortness of breath or coughing up blood. This risk will be very carefully monitored clinically. The use of oral contraceptives with TA may increase risk of venous thromboembolism, and thus will not be allowed during study. Should these symptoms occur; measures considered standard of care would be implemented to prevent clots: these include either compression stockings, which are support -like stockings, and/or sequential compression devices (SCDs). SCDs are blanket -like Velcro -devices which are placed on the legs to promote blood flow and prevent c lots from forming in the leg veins. Treatment, should a clot occur, would primarily consist of stopping the study product as soon as possible. If needed, the risks and benefits of anticoagulation will be considered. Risk of Bleeding Events Bleeding sy mptoms may occur in VWD unrelated to this study, usually with trauma, but sometimes spontaneously, without cause. Although unlikely, if you have bleeding, or if you have menstrual bleeding not controlled after five days with study drugs, standard treatmen t, DDAVP or factor concentrate whichever you usually use, will be given. Risk of Pregnancy rVWF has not been studied in pregnant women. Thus, it is recommended that pregnancy should be avoided in subjects on this study. Avoiding sexual activity is the only certain method to prevent pregnancy. However, if you choose to be sexually active, you must agree to use an appropriate double barrier method of birth control, such as female use of a diaphragm, non -hormonal intrauterine device ( IUD), sponge and spe rmicide , in addition to the male use of a condom. The double barrier contraception must be used for at least one week prior to the start of the research study and continue for at least two weeks following the last study visit. If you choose to be sexually active during this study, you must accept the risk that pregnancy could still result, exposing you and your sexual partner to potential loss of pregnancy as well as other unknown effects on the developing fetus. Birth Control Statement If you become aware that you are pregnant or become pregnant during the course of this research study, you must contact the principal investigator and physician immediately. The effects of rVWF on"
64,page_64,"Page 8 of 13 University Of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board Approval Date: «Approval Date» Renewal Date: «Renewal Date» IRB #: «IRBNo» the fetus (unborn child) are not fully known. It is theref ore important that you do not become pregnant during this research study. You should not use hormones or a birth control implant during this study because of thrombosis (clot) risk. Double barrier contraception must be used for at least one week prior to the start of the research study and continue for at least two weeks following the last study visit. Breach of confidentiality There is also a potential for possible risk of breach of confidentiality of collected information. To minimize this risk, your s tudy participation and related information will be protected to maintain confidentiality. Your blood samples and clinical history will be assigned an alphanumeric identifier and the key for linking this number with your identity will be kept at <insert hem ophilia center name> under lock and key by <insert MD name here> and his/her research staff. The de - identified information in this study will be placed into a secure, web -based data base at University of Pittsburgh Center for Research in Health Care Data C enter (CRHC DC) . If the investigator publishes research information, your name will not be identified. A description of this clinical trial will be available on http://www.clinicaltrials.gov , as required by US Law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at any time. What are the possible benefits from taking part in this study? It is possible tha t rVWF and/or TA will reduce your heavy menstrual bleeding. However, there is no guarantee that you will receive such a benefit. If the information gathered from the use of rVWF and/or TA during menstrual periods, including reducing bleeding and increasing Von Willebrand tests (VWF and related factors), then this may provide important information for the future use of rVWF and/or TA for bleeding in individuals with VWD, when standard therapy is inadequate. What treatments or procedures are available if I decide not to take part in this research study? If you choose not to participate in this study, you understand that you will receive the usual medical care appropriate for your condition. You will receive DDAVP or available VWF clotting factor if you were to have bleeding or surgery or procedures. TA (Lysteda®) is commonly prescribed for women without VWD for menorrhagia. If I agree to take part in this research study, will I be told of any new risks that may be found during the course of the study? If new information becomes available during your participation in this study that may influence your willingness to participate, your doctor will communicate this to you promptly. Will my insurance provider or I be charged for the costs of any procedures performed as part of this research study? All procedures associated with this study are for research , including laboratory tests, out -patient hospitalization, study drugs, drug injections, and blood sampling. Neither you nor your insurer will b e billed for any research -only services. The study drugs have been provided by pharmaceuticals that manufacture the drugs and their distribution will be covered by a grant from the National Institutes of Health to the University of Pittsburgh and Dr . Ragni . You will be responsible for any routine medical care not part of this experimental study, should such costs arise. The cost of DDAVP or clotting factor, should they be needed, is considered standard of care, and you or your third-party payer will be resp onsible for associated costs. You will be responsible for any applicable co -pays, coinsurances and deductibles."

70,page_70,"VWDMin SAP February 9 , 2018 Statistical Analysis Plan Study Design & Objectives. This a phase III multicenter, prospective, randomized crossover trial that will allocate 60 female patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD) to either an AABB or BBAA sequence of two treatments to reduce menorrhagia :  Intravenous Vovendi (rVWF) given on day 1 of menses  Oral tranexamic acid (TA) given on days 1 -5 of menses All participants will receive one treatment for two mens trual cycles followed by the other treatment for two menstrual cycles. Our primary hypothesis is that intravenous rVWF will produce a greater reduction in menorrhagia, as measured by the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score, compared to treatmen t by oral TA. Specifically, we hypothesize that intravenous rVWF will improve PBAC score by at least 40 points more than TA. Our secondary hypotheses will evaluate the safety, tolerability and acceptability of rVWF versus TA as measured by frequency of me norrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, cycle severity rating (CSR), cycle length (CL), quality of life questionnaires and satisfaction surveys. We hypothesize that rVWF will be as safe, tolerable and acceptable as TA in the reduction of menorrhag ia. Additionally, we hypothesize that VWF assays and VWF genotype will predict response to study treatment as measured by PBAC score. Sample Size Calculation. We powered our trial based on the primary endpoint of a 40 -point greater reduction in PBAC when treated with rVWF compared to TA. As rVWF is a greater burden (IV route, cost), rVWF should improve PBAC by 40 points more than TA, a difference the Steering Committee considered cl inically significant and sufficient to change practice. In a trial of TA 40% of women had a 50 -point reduction in PBAC after 2 cycles, from a baseline PBAC score >100 (1). As rVWF is given intravenously and costs more than TA, the current non - hormonal trea tment of choice for menorrhagia, rVWF would need to improve PBAC by 40 points more than TA to be adopted in practice . Thus, a 40 -point difference was determined to be the minimal clinically important difference. Based on data from Byrams on a similar tr ial in women (2), the between -subject standard deviation was estimated to be 63 points . We conservatively estimated a within -subject standard deviation of 100 points. Assuming intent -to-treat (ITT) analyses, a two -tailed alternative hypothesis with type I error rate of 0.05 , and a 4 -period 2 -group (AABB/BBAA) crossover design, a total of N=60 patients will provide 84% power to detect a difference in improvement of 40 points or more between rVWF and TA. Given an expected dropout rate of 10% or less , where dropout is defined as no follow -up visits after randomization , the sample size was inflated to N=66. NCSS/PASS version 12 software and a repeated measures linear model were used to determine sample size for a superiority parallel arm trial. Interim & F inal Analyses. This study will not have any planned interim analyses . The final analyses will be conducted once study follow -up is complete, after all data is cleaned, and once the study database is locked. Individual Participant Data . Individual participant data will not be presented or tabulated ."
71,page_71,"Hypotheses. Our primary hypothesis is that intravenous rVWF can produce an improvement of ≥40 points more in the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC) score than the improvement produced b y oral TA. Our secondary hypotheses will evaluate the safety, tolerability and acceptability of rVWF versus TA as measured by frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, cycle severity rating (CSR), cycle length (CL), quality of life questionnaires and satisfaction surveys. Analysis Sets. The full analysis set will be based on an intention -to-treat (ITT) analysis, which will comprise all participants who have been randomized to either of the two crossover sequences (AABB/BBAA) , regard less of length of follow -up or actual intervention received. Study Outcomes. The primary outcome is the score on the pictorial blood assessment chart (PBAC), a valid measure of menstrual blood loss . Secondary outcomes include frequency of menorrhagia unresponsive to study drugs or rescue, cycle severity rating (CSR), cycle length (CL), quality of life measures such as SF -36, RUTA, CDCHRQoL -14, and CESD, and satisfaction as measured by survey. Handling of Missing Values. As a preventive measure, we will make every attempt to document all reasons for missing data. In addition, baseline characteristics will be compared between participants who do and do not withdraw from the study as a way to assess the impact of missing in formation and attrition. For missing data from lost or incomplete diaries, HTC nurses will obtain data retrospectively at study visits 1 -2 months later, for which recall is excellent (3). We will investigate the reasons for intermittently missing data ( misses an assessment but comes back) and dropouts, and use likelihood -based procedure if ""missing at random"" (MAR) is confirmed . If the missingness is found to be nonignorable (missing not at random (MNAR)), we will consider joint or shared parameter model s. Statistical Analyses. Baseline characteristics including demographics and laboratory measurements will be presented as mean s and standard deviations for continuous variables and sample proportions for categorical variables. All descriptive statistics w ill be accompanied by 95% confidence intervals. Baseline comparisons between the two sequences of treatments (AABB versus BBAA) will be performed using two-sample t-tests for continuous variables, chi - squared tests for categorical variables, or th eir nonparametric counterparts. The distribution of continuous outcomes will be investigated, and transformations to produce normally distributed values (such as natural log) will be employed if the data are skewed. Assessment of a potential carryover effect: Though evidence suggests that there is no carryover effect from one menstru al cycle to the next when treatments are given for only 1 -5 days per cycle, we will test for evidence of a carryover effec t in the analysis of each outcome. For each outcome, t reatment (rVWF, TA) and period (1-4) will be included as categorical fixed effects , and an interaction between treatment and period will be included . An F -test will be conducted to determine if the interaction term is statistically significant. If the interaction between treatment and period is not significant, then we will remove the interaction from the model and assume that there is no statistically significant carryover effect. Primary Outcome : The primary endpoint, PBAC score, will be compared between rVWF and TA using a linear mixed model (LMM) fit via restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) (4). The natural logarithm of PBAC score will be used as the response variable in the model , as"
72,page_72,"the distribution of PBAC scores is skewed to the right. Treatment and period will be treated as fixed effects . The chronic conditions of VWD are stable, and t he treatments to be tested have only temporary effects. Though evidence suggests that there is no carryover effect from one cycle to the next when treatments are given for only 1 -5 days per cycle, we will assess for a carryover effect by including a treat ment by period interaction term in the model . If the interaction is not significant, we will assume no carryover effect in statistical analyses and remove the effect from the model . Baseline PBAC score will be treated as a covariate to enhance statistical power and guard against bias due to inadvertent imbalance in baseline scores. The intercept will be allowed to vary randomly to account for subject -level variability of the outcome at baseline . The Kenward -Roger method for calculating degrees of freedom wi ll be used to improve small -sample performance ( 4). The linear mixed model will allow for unbiased estimates of treatment effects and the utilization of all data under the assumption that data are missing at random (MAR). Least -squares estimates of treatment effect s will be obtained on the transformed scale and back -transform ed to prov ide estimated differences by percent change on the original PBAC scale . Secondary Outcomes : Continuous secondary outcomes, including cycle severity, quality of life, and coagu lation measures, will be analyzed with multivariable linear mixed models fit via maximum likelihood using the same approach as for the primary outcome. Multivariable generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), including the same fixed and random terms as the primary outcome model, will be used to analyze categorical secondary outcomes. Least -squares estimates of treatment effects will be obtained to determine if significant differences in outcomes exist between rVWF and TA. Subgroup and Exploratory Analyses : This study will not have any planned subgroup or exploratory analyses. REFERENCES: 1.
