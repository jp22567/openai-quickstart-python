Hidradenitis suppurativa is an inflammatory, debilitating skin disease with a characteristic clinical presentation of recurrent or chronic painful or suppurating lesions that most commonly present in the axilla, inguinal, and anogenital regions.1,2 The estimated prevalence of HS varies between < 1% and 4%.3- 7 Important differential diagnoses of HS are furuncles, carbuncles, abs cesses, cutaneous Crohn's disease, and acne.8 It is a difficult to diagnose condition, and therefore, there is a significant delay (7.2 years on average) in establishing the diagnosis of HS after its initial presentation.9 Hidradenitis suppurativa lesions (i.e., nodules, abscesses, and sinuses) are characterized by painful lesions located in the intertriginous areas, which can be malodorous and have purulent discharge. This constellation resu lts in substantial disability and social stigma of the patients and a profound impact on the quality of life.10 Depression, anxiety, and an increased suicide risk may be seen in patients with HS, as well as an adverse influen ce on a patient's sexual health.11-15 Patients may have several comorbidities, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn's disease, and polycystic ovary disease.2,16 Patients with HS have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and all-cause mortality, and their risk of CV- associated death was shown to be higher than in psoriasis patients.17 Available treatment options for patients with HS include medical treatments such as topical non- antibiotics (e.g., exfoliants and peels), topical antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin), systemic antibiotics (e.g., clindamycin, tetracycline, rifampicin), anti -inflammatory therapies (e.g., cort icosteroids, dapsone, ciclosporin A), hormones (e.g., antiandrogens and estrogens), retinoids (e.g., isotretinoin, acitretin), biologics (e.g., adalimumab, infliximab), analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs, opioids), and surgical treatments (e.g., deroofing, excision, laser).18 However, most of those treatments have not been adequately studied in patients with HS or do not appear to be very effective through the course of the disease. The only approved treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS is adalimumab (Hum ira®), a TNF-αinhibitor that demonstrated in 2 Phase 3, multicenter, double -blind, placebo controlled studies (PIONEER I and PIONEER II) its safe and efficacious use in this patient population. The primary endpoint in these studies was the Hidradenitis S uppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR), which is defined as at least a 50% reduction in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule (AN) count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula count relative to Baseline. At Week 12, HiSCR was achieved by 41.8% (PIONEER I) and 58.9% (PIONEER II) of subjects treated with adalimumab, respectively, in comparison to 26% (PIONEER I) and 27.6% (PIONEER II) of subjects treated with placebo.19 In the context of this single HS -approved treatment option, there is still a high unmet need for new safe and efficacious HS therapies. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a disease of unknown etiology characterized by a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with subsequent sebaceous gland loss.20 Itis hypothesized that this process may be the result Page 8 of 111"

Macrophages that infiltrate the papillary and reticular dermis of HS lesions showed the expression of high amounts of IL -23 compared to skin of patients who do not have HS.25 In accordance with the high expression of IL -23 and its important role in the deve lopment of Th17 cells, IL -17-producing T helper cells were found to distinctly infiltrate lesional dermis, suggesting that the IL -23/Th17 pathway is involved in HS.25 In a small uncontrolled, open -label, investigator- initiated study using standard weight -based psoriasis dosing of ustekinumab (Stelara®), a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that inhibits the p40 subunit of both the IL-12 and IL -23 receptor, 82% of the enrolled patients had moderate to marked improvements of the modified Sartorius score (a clinical scoring system for HS) at Week 40.26 In a small, 28 -week open -label, investigator- initiated pilot study investigating 300mg of secukinumab, a mAb that inhibits IL -17A, 78% of patients achieved HiSCR and a 40% decrease in mean Sarto rius score at Week 24.27 These results suggest that a targeted inhibition of IL -23 mediated inflammation with risankizumab may improve the signs and symptoms of the patients with HS. Risankiz umab is a humanized mAb of the IgG1 subclass directed towards IL 23p19. The antibody (Ab) has been engineered to reduce Fcγ receptor and complement binding and potential charge heterogeneity. Risankizumab binds with high affinity to human IL -23 and is cu rrently being developed for the treatment of psoriasis (Phase 3 studies concluded and under registration review), Crohn's disease (in Phase 3 studies), psoriatic arthritis (in Phase 3 studies), ulcerative colitis (in Phase 2/3 studies), and atopic dermatit is (in a Phase 2 study). Risankizumab may also address the current needs for subjects with HS. Clinical Hypothesis Risankizumab will provide superior efficacy compared to placebo and will be well tolerated in subjects with HS. 2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjec ts This study is required to learn more about the potential treatment effect of risankizumab in HS. As with many immune modulating agents, risankizumab may impair immune function, resulting in a risk of infection. This will be monitored by collection of a ll adverse events (AEs) during the treatment and observation periods. In addition, subjects with active systemic infection or clinically important infection will not be included in the study. Subjects with a positive QuantiFERON® -TB (or interferon gamma release assay [IGRA] equivalent)/tuberculosis (TB) skin test result for TB must fulfill entry criteria as specified in Section 5.1of this protocol. IL -23 inhibition is not known to increase the risk of TB infection or impair the response to TB infection in animal models.28,29 Subjects with positive QuantiFERON -TB testing (or IGRA Page 9 of 111"

Published literature indicates that inhibition of IL -23 is unlikely to increase the risk for cancer. Expression of IL -23 is increased in human tumors.30-32 Moreover , preclinical data have demonstrated a beneficial effect of IL -23 p19 inhibition in animal models, both for pre -existing and tumor -induction models. However, while there is not enough clinical information at this time to rule out a risk of cancer with risankizumab, this risk is considered small. Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) events, including myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti -IL-12/23 agents, such as ustekinumab, have not been observed in longer term studies. While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC), which will adjudicate all observed cardio -and cerebro -vascul ar events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.3). Local reactions to subcutaneously -administered biologic therapies are usually limited to redness, swelling, or induration at the injection site. Manifestations of systemic hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis, pruritus, hypotension, and respiratory distress. Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions are readi ly detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment. Subjects will be closely monitored during study drug administration. An independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate observed systemic hypersensit ivity and anaphylactic events. The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.4). In conclusion, the benefit -risk profile of risankizumab is considered appropriate for this stage of clinical development.33 Based on data from the integrated safety analyses, risankizumab is safe and we ll- tolerated and demonstrates a favorable benefit -risk profile. For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current risankizumab Investigator's Brochure (IB). In view of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit -risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapies on COVID -19 is being evaluated based on real world and clinical trial data. At this time, the effects of risankizumab on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined. 3STUDY OBJ ECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS 3.1 Objectives The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of risankizumab 180 mg and 360 mg versus placebo for the treatment of signs and symptoms of moderate to severe HS in adult subjects diagnosed for at l east one year before the Baseline visit.

The duration of the study will be up to 85 weeks and will include an approximately 35 -day screening period followed by 2 treatment periods. In Period A, subject s who meet the study's eligibility criteria (Section 5.1) will be randomized at the Baseline visit , in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg via a subcutaneous (SC) injection, or matching placebo up to Week 16. Study drug administration for Period A will occur at visits Weeks 0 (Baseline), 1, 2, 4, and 12. The final efficacy evaluation of Period A will be at Week 16. In Peri od B, subjects who were initially randomized to placebo will then receive blinded risankizumab 360 mg at Weeks 16, 17, and 18, while subjects who were initially randomized to risankizumab will receive blinded matching placebo at the same time points to kee p the treatment of Period A blinded. Starting at Week 20, all subjects will receive open -label risankizumab 360 mg every eight weeks (q8w), at Weeks 20, 28, 36, 44, 52, and 60. The final efficacy evaluation of Period B will take place at Week 68. A follow up call will be conducted approximately 20 weeks after last dose of study drug. A schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1. Further details regarding study procedures are located in the Operations Manual. Page 13 of 111"

Study Schematic PBO = placebo; RZB = risankizumab; W = week This study plans to enroll approximately 220 subjects from approximately 60 sites in the US, EU, Canada, Japan, and Australia, although the number, allocation, and location of sites may vary depending on operational aspects of the study. Once a sufficient number of subjects to fulfill the enrollment target have entered the screening process, no fu rther subjects will be screened. Once 220 subjects have been randomized, subjects who have started screening but have not yet been randomized will be allowed to enroll in the study if eligible. The stu dy team will remain blinded until the Week 16 Primary Analysis. In addition, the study will have an external independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) to review unblinded safety data (Section 6.2). Independent committees to assess cardio -and cerebro -vascular events (Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee [CAC]) and suspected anaphylactic reactions (Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee [AAC]) will also be formed (Section 6).

Appropriateness of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with HS. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Suitability of Subject Population Adult subjects with moderate to severe HS (defined as a total AN count of ≥ 5 at Baseline, presence o f HS lesions in at least 2 distinct anatomic areas, and draining fistula count of ≤ 20 at Baseline) for at least 1 year prior to Baseline, as determined by the investigator are eligible for this study. The criteria relating to safety have been selected to allow subjects to be safely enrolled and treated with risankizumab based on the current knowledge of this drug. The study population selected reflects a standard population for moderate to severe HS studies with new treatment intervention. Selection of D oses in the Study Hidradenitis suppurativa is considered a high inflammatory disease with deep -seated lesions and an abundance of innate and adaptive immune cells. Two doses of risankizumab (180 mg and 360 mg) were selected for evaluation in this study. A 180 mg SC dose administered q8w has maintained efficacy in the Phase 2 Crohn's disease study and is likely to be efficacious in subjects with HS. The additional higher dose of 360 mg SC is also being tested as the high- maintenance dose level in the Phase 3 Crohn's disease studies based on the preliminary exposure -response analyses of the Phase 2 Crohn's disease study, indicating greater efficacy at a higher dose above 180 mg. Evaluating both doses in this study is expected to provide dose/exposure -respo nse data and to allow for evaluation if an efficacy plateau can be achieved at 360 mg dose level. Both doses are within the range of doses safely administered in previous risankizumab clinical studies. 5STUDY ACTIVITIES 5.1 Eligibility Criteria Subjects must m eet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.

An intervention can occur at a maximum on 2 different lesions at the same visit or on the same lesion at 2 different study visits. The same lesion cannot be treated 2 times at the same visit. Allstudy visit evaluation s have to occur before interventions are performed. If incision and draining is performed, antiseptic creams/liquids are allowed to be administered on the specific lesions upon which an intervention had been performed for as many days as considered medica lly necessary by the investigator. When counting the total lesions in each body region, the site will be required to count any lesion that undergoes an intervention as permanently present from the date of the intervention, regardless of the outcome of the intervention performed. 5.5 Withdrawal of Subjects and Discontinuation of Study A subject may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study drug and/or study at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, the following: Clinically significant abn ormal laboratory result(s) or AE(s) that preclude continuation of the study medication, as determined by the Investigator and the TA MD (as applicable). The Investigator believes withdrawal from the study is in the best interest of the subject. The subject requests withdrawal from the study. Eligibility criteria violation(s) are noted after the subject started study drug, if continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by the AbbVie TA MD, after consultation with the Investigator. Introduction of prohibited medications and continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by the AbbVie TA MD. Subject develops active TB at any time during the study. Subject becomes pregnant while participating in the study. Subject is diagnosed with a malignancy. Exception: Localized NMSC or carcinoma in -situ of the cervix, where discontinuation is at the discretion of the Investigator. Subject is significantly noncompliant with study procedures, which would put the subject at risk for continued participation in the study . Subject requires > 2 protocol- allowed HS interventions. Post -Baseline occurrence of one or more of the following hepatic test abnormalities (confirmed on a second separate sample at least 48 hours a part): ALT or AST > 8 × ULN; ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks; ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and Total Bilirubin > 2 × ULN or international normalized ratio [INR] >1.5; ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper qu adrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).

AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the investigator. COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modification During the COVID 19 pandemic, it has been necessary to employ mitigation strategies to enable the investigator to ensure subject safety and continuity of care. Acceptable mitigation strategies are identified and included in the Operations Manual in Appendix F . The investigator should contact the sponsor medical contact before discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason other than ""planned per protocol,"" to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for details on how to handle stu dy activities/procedures. Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID- 19 Infection For subjects with documented COVID -19, the timing of next administration of study drug or possibility of premature discontinuation from study drug should be disc ussed with the AbbVie Medical Contact. Follow subsequent protocol Section 5.6for subjects who discontinued study drug. 5.6 Follow -Up for Subject Withdr awal from Study To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks. In addition, if subject is willing and has not withdrawn consent, a 20 -week follow -up phone call after the last dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment -emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved. In the event a subject withdraws consent from the clinical study, biomarker research will continue unless the subject explicitly requests analysis to be stopped. When A bbVie is informed that samples are withdrawn from research, samples will not be analyzed, and the samples will be destroyed. A subject may withdraw consent for optional biomarker research at any time and remain in the clinical study. Data generated from optional biomarker research, before subject withdrawal of consent, will remain part of the study results. Page 24 of 111"

Identity of Investigational Product Study Drug Dosage Form FormulationRoute of Administration Manufacturer Risankizumab (ABBV -066) Solution for injection in pre-filled syringe (PFS)90 mg/mL SC injection Boehringer - Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG Placebo for risankizumab (ABBV -066)Solution for injection in PFSN/A SC injection Boehringer - Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co. KG N/A = not applicable; PFS = pre -filled syringe; SC = subcutaneous Through Week 12 of Period A, study site staff will administer study drug subcutaneously as follows: Risankizumab 180 mg (2 ×90 mg PFS and 2 × placebo PFS) Risankizumab 360 mg (4 × 90 mg PFS), or Matching placebo (4 × placebo PFS). At Wee ks 16, 17, and 18 in Period B, subjects who were originally randomized to receive risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg in Period A will receive placebo. Subjects who were originally randomized to receive placebo will receive risankizumab 360 mg. Beginning with W eek 20 in Period B, study site staff will administer open- label risankizumab 360 mg subcutaneously as described above q8w until the end of the study. Risankizumab and matching placebo will be packaged in quantities sufficient to accommodate study design. Each kit will be labeled per local requirements, and this label must remain affixed to the kit. Upon receipt, study drug should be kept in the original packaging in a secured limited access storage area according to the recommended storage conditions on t he medication label. No extemporaneous dose preparation is required. Each kit will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via interactive response technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at t he subject's corresponding study visit. AbbVie will not supply drug other than risankizumab and matching placebo, and study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study. AbbVie -provided study drug should not be substituted or alternately sourced u nless otherwise directed by AbbVie. Page 25 of 111"

For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial screening visit should be used. Subjects may only be rescreened one time. The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by the statistics department at AbbVie. Subjects who meet the study's eligibility criteria will be initially randomized to receive either risankizumab 180 mg or 360 mg as an SC injection or matching placebo up to Week 16 in a 1:1:1 ratio . Subjects who have been treated with anti -TNF therapy and had inadequate response to this therapy (TNF -IR) will be eligible. Subjects will be randomized by their anti -TNF use (yes or no) prior to Baseline. TNF-naïve (no) subjects will be further stratified by the worst Hurley stage across all affected anato mic regions. Therefore, there will be 4 strata in total: Prior exposure to anti -TNF (yes) Prior exposure to anti -TNF (no) with the worst Hurley Stage as I Prior exposure to anti -TNF (no) with the worst Hurley Stage as II Prior exposure to anti -TNF (no) wi th the worst Hurley Stage as III All AbbVie personnel with direct oversight of the conduct and management of the study (with the exception of AbbVie Drug Supply Management Team) will remain blinded until the Primary Analysis at Week 16 is available. The investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's initial treatment throughout the study. To maintain the blind, the risankizumab kits and placebo kits provided for the study will be identical in appearance. The IR T will provide access to unblinded subject treatment information in the case of a medical emergency. 5.9 Protocol Deviations The investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding proto col deviations. Protocol deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified , including those that may be due to the COVID -19 pandemic ), the investigator is responsible for notifying IEC/IRB, regulatory authorities (as applicable), and AbbVie. 6SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Complaints and Adverse Events Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or Page 26 of 111"

Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to AbbVie. Product Com plaint A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s). For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues. Product complaints concerning the investig ational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie within 24hours of the study site's knowledge of the event. Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion. Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Seri ous Adverse Events An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from ""special situations ""as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, dr ug misuse or drug withdrawal, all which must be reported whether associated with an adverse event or not. Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. La boratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be an AE only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol -specific criteria, and/or the investigator considers it to be an AE. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study wi ll not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre- existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study ( e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria , it is to be reported to AbbVie clinical pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.3 of the Operations Manual for reporting details and contact information): Page 27 of 111"

Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or a dmission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Impo rtant Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life - threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/in capacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 20 weeks (140 days) after discontinuation of study drug administration wi ll be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. In addition, SAEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the study -specific informed consent. AbbVie will be responsible for Suspec ted Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medicinal Product in accordance with global and local requirements. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indica te a trend or risk to subjects. Page 28 of 111"

The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug: Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. Pregnancy While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24hours after the site becomes aware of the pregnancy. Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued (Section 5.5). If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject, information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected. The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirt h, or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event. 6.2 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An external IDMC will review unblinded safety data on a cohort level, at approximat e 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study. A separate IDMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the IDMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Unblinded adjudicated cardio -cerebrovascular events will be presented to the IDMC for review on a periodic basis. Communications from the IDMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subje ct treatment assignments.

In addition, the site may be con tacted for additional source documentation for relevant events. 6.4 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee While no concerns with systemic hypersensitivity have been identified with the use of risankizumab, the sponsor has established the AAC to adjudicate events of anaphylaxis based on pre -specified definitions . This independent, external committee will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The event terms to be adjudicated and the adjudication process are detailed in the AAC Charter. A supplemental Hypersensitivity Reactions Signs and Symptoms eCRF will be used to collect information pertinent to the events ( Table 2). In addition, the site may be contacted for additional source documentation for relevant events. If a suspected systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs at the investigative site, subjects should be tested for tryptase and histamine levels. In addition to testing tryptase and histamine levels, pharmacokinetic ( PK)and ADA/NAb samples will also be collected. If a systemic hypersensitivity reaction such as anaphylaxis is suspected while the subject is not at the investigative site, every eff ort should be made to obtain tryptase and histamine levels from the treating facility to help better characterize the diagnosis. 7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans The Primary Analysis will be conducted afte r all continuing subjects complete Week 16 and all data pertaining to Period A are cleaned. This will be the only and final analysis for efficacy in Period A. Study sites and subjects will remain blinded to their initial treatment assignment for the dura tion of the entire study. The statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the SAP, which will be finalized prior to the start of the study. All statistical tests, between each risankizumab dose and placebo, will be performed at a two -sided alpha level of 0.025. The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). Page 31 of 111"

Subjects who are randomized to placebo in Period A and do not continue into Period B will be excluded from the analysis in Period B. In order to evaluate the impact of major protocol deviations on the primary efficacy endpoint, a dditional sensitivity analyses may be performed on a per -protocol population, which excludes subjects with major protocol deviations that potentially affect the primary efficacy endpoint. If it is decided that this analysis should be performed, the criter ia for exclusion of subjects from the per -protocol population will be fully defined in the classification plan, and the exclusion of subjects from the per -protocol population will be finalized before blind break and before the database lock for the primary analysis. The following populations will be used for the safety analysis: The Safety Population in Period A (Safety_A) is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least one dose of study drug in Period A. The Safety Population in Period B (Safety_B) is defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug in Period B. The all risankizumab treated (ALL_RZB) Population is defined as subjects who received at least one dose of risankizumab in the study. This population will be used to provide a comprehensive summary of safety. 7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy Analysis of all efficacy endpoints in Period A will be conducted on the ITT Population, based on treatment as randomized for Period A. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed in the per-protocol population, if defined. Comparison of the primary endpoint will be made between each risankizumab dose and placebo using the Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for stratification factors. Non -respo nder imputation (NRI) will be the primary approach to handle missing values. To account for impact of COVID -19 pandemic, the NRI will be adjusted to NRI -C, Non -Responder Imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID -19. The overall type -I error rate will be strongly controlled using a graphical multiple testing procedure. The primary and ranked secondary endpoints will be first tested in the ranked order specified in Section 3 between each risankizumab dose and placebo, with a 2 -sided significance level of 0.025. Continued testing will follow a pre -specified α transfer path which includes downstream transfer along the endpoint sequence. More details of the graphical procedure will be specified in the SAP. Details on the primary and other efficacy analyses will be provided in the SAP. Page 32 of 111"
