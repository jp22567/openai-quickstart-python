The study includes 6 parts. Parts A, B, and C will be conducted in healthy subjects. Parts D, E, and F will be conducted in subjects with CF. Part F is an optional part of the study that may be conducted at the sponsor’s discretion . Parts A, B, and C (Healthy Subjects) Parts A, B, and C are randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, single - and multiple-dose parts in healthy subjects of this first -in-human study of VX -445. Part A also includes an evaluation of the effect of food on VX -445 PK and an evaluation of absolute BA. Part C doses VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. Approximately 8 subjects in each cohort of Part A (except Cohort A7) and Part B will be randomized 3:1 to receive VX -445 or placebo. Cohort A7 will enroll approximately 8 subjects who will receive open -label VX-445 to evaluate the food effect on the tablet and the absolute BA. The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety, tolerability, and available PK data from preceding cohort(s). In Parts A and B, 6 dose escalation cohorts are planned, although fewer than 6 or up to 2 additional cohorts each may be enrolled in each part, based on data from previous c ohorts. In Part C, 2 cohorts are planned, while fewer or up to 2 additional cohorts each may be enrolled based on data from previous cohorts. Part A includes Cohorts A1 through A6, which are single -dose escalation cohorts, and Cohort A7, a single cohort evaluating the food effect and absolute BA."
7,page_7,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 8 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Cohorts A1 through A6 : VX-445 or placebo will be administered in the morning of Day 1. Dosing will be staggered in Cohort A1 so that 2 subjects are dosed (1 with VX-445 and 1 with placebo) at least 24 hours befor e the remaining 6 subjects. Dosing may be staggered in subsequent cohorts if deemed necessary based on review of emerging safety data. The planned doses for Cohorts A1 through A6 are 20 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg, 480 mg, and 800 mg. Doses may be modified u pward or downward based on emerging data. Cohort A7 has an open -label, single sequence design in which subjects will receive a single dose of VX -445 on up to 3 dosing occasions with at least 6 -day washouts between dosing occasions. VX -445 doses include 2 single oral doses of tablet (dose to be determined [TBD], pending PK data from previous Part A cohorts, but will not exceed the highest dose that was safe and well tolerated) and a single IV dose (the planned dose is 20 mg, which may be adjusted pending da ta from previous Part A cohorts, but will not be predicted to exceed the highest exposure that was safe and well tolerated). If the IV formulation or the data supporting the use of the IV formulation are not available, then the third dosing period, in whic h subjects receive the IV dose, will not be conducted. Part B may be initiated while Part A is ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. The total daily dose in the starting cohort (Cohort B1) will be at least 1 dose level below the highes t Part A dose for which safety, tolerability, and PK results are available and that is safe and well tolerated. Part C may be initiated while Parts A and B are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. The VX-445 starting dose (Cohort C1) will be at least 1 dose level below the highest Part B dose for which safety and tolerability results are available and supportive. The dosage of TEZ/IVA in the TC will be TEZ 100 mg once per day (qd)/IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h). Dosing will be stagge red in Cohort C1, with 2 subjects dosed (1 with VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA and 1 with triple placebo) at least 24 hours before the remaining 6 subjects. Staggering at higher doses may be conducted if deemed necessary based on review of emerging safety data. Parts D, E, and F (Subjects With CF) Part D, which is comprised of Parts D1 and D2, is randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled , and evaluates VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part E is randomized, double -blind, TEZ/IVA -controlled , and evaluates VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF (F/F genotype). Part F, an optional part of the study which will be conducted at the sponsor’s discretion , is randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, and evaluates VX -445 in TC with TEZ and VX-561 in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part D may be initiated while Parts A, B, and C are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. After all Part D1 subjects complete the Day 15 Visit, a blinded review of all availabl e safety and PK data will be conducted by the Vertex study team and lead investiga tor(s). Dosing in Parts D2, E, and F will start after this review, if supported by safety and PK data. VX-445 will be dosed qd. Part D1 has 1 VX -445 dose level (mid: 100 mg qd). Part D2 has 3 VX-445 dose levels (low: 50 mg qd; mid: 100 mg qd; high: 200 mg qd). The TC -high dose of VX-445 in Part D2 does not exceed the highest dose that was safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects dosed with TC in Part C. Parts E and F will use the highest dose used in Part D2 (200 mg qd). Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 in Parts D2, E, and F. Randomization will not be stratified in Part D1 because of the small number of subjects in that Part"

At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 32,000 in the EU).3 Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan diseas e.4,5 CF is caused by reduced quantity and/or function of the CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and water absorption, and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancrea s, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.2,6,7 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality.8 More effective treatments are needed for CF. More than 2000 mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified.9 Most of these mutations are not associated with CF disease or are very rare. Currently, the CFTR2 database contains information on only 322 of these identified mutations, with sufficient evidence to define 281 mutations as disease-causing.10 The most common disease-causing CFTR mutation, F508del-CFTR , accounts for 70% of the identified alleles in patients with CF; nearly half of all people with CF are homozygous for F508del. Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required to ameliorate lung disease in patients with CF. The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products that were developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex) and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco®) and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. Tezacaftor (TEZ; VX-661), like LUM, is a first-generation CFTR corrector that improves the processing and trafficking of the F508del-CFTR protein, resulting in an increase in the quantity of F508del-C FTR protein at the cell surface. IVA increases the open-channel probability of the F508del-CFTR protein that has been delivered to the cell surface by TEZ, thereby enhancing total chloride transport. The combined effect of TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at the cell surface. VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, VX-445 improves the processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR, thereby increasing the quantity of functional F508del-CFTR protein at the cell surface. 11 The effect of VX-445 was additive to the effect of TEZ. The CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface by VX-445 alone or in combination with TEZ"
39,page_39,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 40 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VX-445/TEZ) was potentiated by IVA.11 In human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells studied in vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual combinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual (VX-445, TE Z, and IVA) regimens.11 VX-561 (also known as CTP-656 or C-10355) is a deuterated isotope of IVA with a specific pattern of 9 substituted deuteriums. I n vitro data indicate similar potency of VX-561 in HBE cells relative to IVA. Safety ph armacology and nonclinical toxicology studies of VX-561 demonstrate a similar safety profile relative to IVA. Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy subjects have shown that VX-561 had a reduced rate of clearance, increased exposure, greater plasma levels at 24 hours, and a longer half-lif e compared to IVA, thereby supporting once daily dosing.12 5.2 Rationale for the Present Study Results from nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicology studies of VX-445 alone and in combination with TEZ/IVA, and the unmet medical need for new treatments for CF, support the clinical development of VX-445 for the treatment of CF. This is the first clinical study of VX-445 and is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of VX-445 as monotherapy and in TC with TEZ/IVA in healthy subjects (Parts A, B, and C), as well as the safety and eff icacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who have F/MF ( F508del/minimal function) or F/F genotypes (Parts D and E, respectively). Additionally, the safety and efficac y of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 will be evaluated in subjects with F/MF genotypes in Part F, if the sponsor chooses to conduct this optional part of the study. 6 STUDY OBJECTIVES 6.1 Primary Objectives Part A: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single ascending doses of VX-445 in healthy subjects Part B: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses of VX-445 administered in healthy subjects Part C: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and IVA for 14 days in healthy subjects Parts D and E  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and IVA in subjects with CF  To evaluate the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and IVA in subjects with CF Part F  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and VX-561 (deuterated IVA) in subjects with CF  To evaluate the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and VX-561 in subjects with CF"

Approximately 224 subjects will be enrolled: 120 healthy subjects (Parts A, B, and C) and 104 subjects with CF (Parts D, E, and F). Part F is an optional part of the study, which will be conducted a t the sponsor’s discretion. No subject will be allowed to randomize to more than 1 dose cohort. 9.1.1 Parts A, B, and C P arts A, B, and C are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-dose parts in healthy subjects of this first- in-human study of VX-445. Part A also includes an evaluation of the effect of food on VX-445 PK a nd an evaluation of absolute BA. Part C doses VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA. There is no pre-specified ratio of males to females, but reasonable effort will be made to enroll females of non-childbearing potential in all dosing cohorts. Parts A, B, and C (Healthy Subjects) A schematic of the study design for Parts A, B, and C is shown in Table 9-1. Number of Cohorts In Parts A and B, 6 dose escalation cohorts are planned, although fewer than 6 or up to 2 additional cohorts may be enrolled in each part, based on data from previous cohorts. The additional cohorts will follow the corresponding schedule of assessments. In Part C, 2 cohorts are planned, while fewer or up to 2 additional cohorts each ma y be enrolled based on data from previous cohorts. The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety, tolerability, and available PK data from preceding cohort(s). Refer to Section 9.7.1 for dose escalation criteria and S ection 9.8.1 for stopping criteria. Staggering of Dosing In Cohort A1 (f irst single dose cohort) and in Cohort C1 (first TC cohort), dosing will be staggered so that 2 subjects are dosed (Cohort A1: 1 with VX-445 and 1 with placebo; Cohort C1: 1 with TC and 1 with triple placebo) at least 24 hours before the remaining 6 subjects in each cohort. Doses may be staggered in othe r cohorts if deemed necessary based on review of emerging safety data."

Planned Dosage (qd or q12h, 14 days) Cohort C1 TBD Cohort C2 TBD CRU: clinical research unit; IV: intravenous; IVA: ivacaftor; PK: pharmacokinetic; q12h: every 12 hours; qd: once daily; TBD: to be determined; TC: triple combination (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) ; TEZ: tezacaftor Note: Dose escalation criteria are described in Section 9.7.1, and dose escalation will be stopped when the predefined stopping cri teria is met (see Section 9.8.1). a The Washout Period is a minimum of 6 days and may be increased as needed based on emerging data from earlier co horts (Cohorts A1 through A6). Subjects in Cohort A7 will receive a single dose of VX -445 on up to 3 dosing occasions. VX -445 doses include 2 single oral doses of tablet (dose TBD, pending PK data from previous Part A cohorts, but will not exceed the highe st dose that was safe and well tolerated) and a single IV dose (the planned dose is 20 mg, but may be adjusted pending data from previous Part A cohorts; however, the final selected dose will not be predicted to exceed the highest exposure that was safe an d well tolerated). If the IV formulation or the data supporting the use of the IV formulation are not available, then the third dosing period, in which subjects receive the IV dose, will not be conducted. If the IV dose is not administered, subjects will be discharged from the CRU on Day 13 after completing all study visit assessments and will return for a Safety Follow -up Visit ( Table 3-3). b The dosage of TEZ/IVA will be TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h which will be administered as TEZ 100-mg/IVA 150-mg FDC in the morning and IVA 150 mg in the evening. 9.1.1.1 Screening (Parts A, B, and C) Screening Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-1. Screening will occur within 28 days before administration of study drug. If the time between screening and dosing exceeds 28 days as a r esult of unexpected operational delays (e.g., delayed drug shipment), then subjects do not require rescreening if the Day - 1 laboratory results meet the eligibility criteria. Subjects will be instructed on the study restrictions ( Section 9.4.1)."

No subject will be a llowed to participate in more than 1 dose cohort or in more than 1 study part. Subjects who do not meet the eligibility criteria may not be rescreened with the following excepti ons, all of which require principal investigator approval:  Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but had an intercurrent illness (e.g., upper respiratory infection with fever) in the 14 days before the first study drug dose that was properly evaluated and which re solved fully  Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but were not able to obtain required documentation within the allotted screening window  Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but transiently (for personal reasons) are unable to commit to all study procedures  Subjects who met all eligibility criteria but are not randomized for administrative reasons (e.g., study drug is not available at the study site)  Subjects who were screened under a prior version of the protocol and did not meet any exclusion criterion, with the exception of a criterion that was updated in a subsequent version of the protocol Repetition of any screening assessment that did not meet eligibility criteria is not permitted, unless there is clear evidence of a damaged sample, laboratory error, or equipment malfunction. In all cases, the principal investigator must authorize retesting. The medical monitor must be notified of any decisions made regarding rescreening or retesting. 9.1.1.2 Treatment Period (Parts A, B, and C) Subjects will be admitted on Day -1 and will remain in the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for the duration of the Treatment Period. Treatment Period assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 through A6), Table 3-3 (Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C). The treatment periods will be conducted as described in Section 9.1. Dosing details are given in Section 9.6.1. If a subject has any clinically significant, study-rela ted abnormalities at the conclusion of a scheduled inpatient portion of the study, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the subject will be asked to remain in the CRU until such abnormalities resolve. If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the CRU, the medical monitor (or authorized designee) will be notified, and the investigator will make every effort to arrange follow-up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the abnormalities. 9.1.1.3 Follow-up (Parts A, B, and C) Subjects will have a Safety Follow-up Visit 7 to 10 days after the last study drug dose. Safety Follow-up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 through A6), Table 3-3 (Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C)."

Safety Follow-up Visit assessments are listed in Table 3-2 (Cohorts A1 through A6), Table 3-3 (Cohort A7), Table 3-4 (Part B), and Table 3-5 (Part C). 9.1.2 Parts D, E, and F Part D, which is comprised of Parts D1 and D2, is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part E is randomiz ed, double-blind, TEZ/IVA-controlled and evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF ( F/F genotype). Part F is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and evaluates VX-445 in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 in subjects with CF (F/MF genotypes). Part F is an optional part of the study, which will be conducted at the sponsor’s discretion. All parts are multicenter and designe d to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC. Approximately 104 subjects with CF will be enrolled. Part D may be initiated while Parts A, B, and C are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. Enrollment of Parts D1 and D2 will be sequential, while enrollment of Parts E and F will be in parallel with Part D2. After all P art D1 subjects complete the Day 15 Visit, a blinded review of all available safety and PK da ta will be conducted by the Vertex study team and lead investigator(s). Dosing in Parts D2, E, and F will start after t his review, if supported by safety and PK data. Part E subjects who are participating in Study VX11-661-110 (Study 661-110), an open-label study of TEZ/IVA combination therapy, will not need to washout TEZ/IVA treatment; these subjec ts will transition directly from their prior treatment to the TEZ/IVA Run-in Period providing that they meet all eligibility criteria. These subjects can have screening assessments for this study done while they are continuing to participate in Study 661-110. Key study elements are summarized in Table 9-2.

Subjects will receive TEZ 100 mg qd/IVA 150 mg q12h during the Run-in Period. The first dose of TEZ /IVA will be administered at the Day -28 Visit. The last dose of TEZ/IVA within the Run-in Pe riod will be administered on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit). Study eligibility for Part E subjects will be confirmed before the first dose of TEZ/IVA in the Run-in Period (on the Day -28 Visit). Subjects who prematurely discontinue TEZ/IVA during the Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Period 1), unless they rescreen and complete a 4-week Run-in Period (Section 9.1.2.1.2). Study visits during the Run-in Period will occur as shown in Table 3-7. 9.1.2.4 Treatment Period (Parts D, E, and F) To be eligible to continue into the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease and have remained on stable CF medication regimen during the 28 days before the Day 1 Visit AND must not have had an acute non-CF illness within 14 days before the Da y 1 Visit. The VX-445 treatment duration is 4 weeks. The Trea tment Period duration is approximately 5 weeks for Parts D1 and D2 (Period 1 + Period 2), 4 weeks for Part E (Period 1), and 4 weeks for Part F (Period 1). All study periods will be conducted as des cribed in S ection 9.1. Study drug administration details are provided in Section 9.6.2. 9.1.2.5 Washout Period (Part E) The W ashout Period of Part E will last approximately 4 weeks and is designed to evaluate the effect on PD and efficacy endpoints as subjects step down from TC to TEZ/I VA. Subjects will receive TEZ 100 mg qd/ IVA 150 mg q12h during the Washout Period. 9.1.2.6 Follow-up (Parts D, E, and F) There will be a Safety Follow-up Visit occurring approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and fo r subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing. A subject who was enrolled in Study 661-110 and then enrolled in Part E of this study can re-enroll in Study 661-110 after completing the Washout Period of this study. If the subject completes the Day 57 Visit of this study and then re-enters St udy 661-110, the subject will not have a Safety Follow-up Visit in this study. 9.1.2.7 Early Termination of Treatment (Parts D, E, and F) If a subject prematurely discontinues treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to terminate study drug treatment.

If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or lat er following the last dose of study drug, the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent. 9.1.2.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee (Parts D, E, and F) This study will be monitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct reviews of safety data from all parts of the study. The IDMC Charter, which will be finalized before the first subject is screened, will include procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, triggers for meetings, and plans for data to be reviewed. The IDMC Chair will review available safe ty and PK data from Parts A, B, and C of the study prior to commencement of dosing in Part D1 to determine if it is appropriate to proceed with the study. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups A randomization list for each part will be produced by Vertex Biostatistics or a qualified randomization vendor. The Vertex study biostatistician will review and approve the dummy randomization list. The final randomization list will be reviewed and approved by a designated unblinded biostatistician who is not a member of the study execution team (SET). Only subjects who have completed screening assessments and are eligible for participation in the study will be randomized to receive active study drug or placebo. Randomized subjects will be assigned a unique subject number. For Parts A, B, and C, a list identifying subjects by their subject number will be maintained in the study file at the CRU. For Parts D, E, and F, an interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. 9.3 Rationale for S tudy Des ign and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design 9.3.1.1 Parts A, B, and C Parts A (except Cohort A7) and B have a parallel- group, dose-escalation design, with each subj ect participating in only 1 cohort to avoid PK and/or PD carryover effects. VX-445 is being developed in TC with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF, and subjects with CF will be dosed with the TC in Parts D and E of this study (see Section 9.3.1.2 ). Part C of this study is included to e valuate the safet y, tolerability, and PK of the TC in healthy subjects befor e subjects with CF are dosed with the TC. Parts A (except Cohort A7), B, and C will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled in order to avoid bias in the collection a nd evaluation of safety and tolerability data during study conduct. Placebo was chosen as the control treatment to assess whether any observed effects are treatment-related or simply related to the study conditions."
57,page_57,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 58 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Staggered Dosing in Cohorts A1 and C1 In Cohorts A1 and C1, after the first 2 subjec ts are dosed (1 active, 1 placebo), there will be at least a 24-hour observation period before the re maining subjects in Cohorts A1 and C1 are dosed. Staggered dosing will be used in Cohort A1 bec ause this is the first time VX-445 will be administered to humans. In addition, staggere d dosing is proposed for Part C as it is the first time VX-445 will be administered in TC with TEZ/IVA in humans. Staggered dosing for Part B is not considered necessary beca use the total daily dose in the first cohort (Cohort B1) will be at least 1 dose level below the highest Part A dose for which safety, tolerability and PK results are available and that is safe and well tolera ted. Therefore, the relative risk to subjects dosed in Cohort B1 is considered to be less than that of subjects in Cohorts A1 and C1. Cohort A7 Cohort A7 will not be initiated until all data r equir ed to support administration of the VX-445 tablet and IV formulations are available. Subj ects in Cohort A7 will receive up to 3 single doses of VX-445: 2 single oral doses of tablet (dose to be de termined [TBD] pending PK data from previous Part A cohorts, but not to exceed the highest dos e that was safe and well tolerated) and a single IV dose (the planned dose is 20 mg, but ma y be adjusted pending data from previous Part A cohorts; however, the final selected dose will not be predicted to exceed the highest exposure that was safe and well tolerated). Each dosing occasion will be separated by at least 6 days. Based on nonclinical data, the interval between dosing occasions is considered adequate to minimize any potential for carryover. However, the washout interval of 6 days may be increased if needed based on emerg ing PK data from earlier Part A cohorts. 9.3.1.2 Parts D, E, and F This is the first time that VX-445 will be administered to subjects with CF. The TC regimen of VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be evaluated in Parts D and E because in vitro, the TC has shown high levels of efficacy and has shown to provide a gr eater increase in chloride transport than any of the dual combinations or individual compounds .11 The safety of VX-445 monotherapy will be evaluated in Parts A and B in healthy subjects, and the safety of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA will be evaluated in Part C in healthy subj ects. A Phase 3 program for TEZ/IVA is ongoing. Parts D and E are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA and to establish proof-of-concept in 2 populations of subjects defined by CFTR genotype (F/MF and F/F). Additionally, Part F will evaluate the safety and efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and VX-561 (a deuterated form of IVA) in subjects with F/MF genotypes, if conducted at the sponsor’s discretion. Efficacy has not be en demonstrated for a corrector, potentiator, or any corrector/potentiator combination in subjects with F/MF genotypes. A Phase 3 study of TEZ/IVA in subjects with F/MF genotypes (Study VX 14-661-107) was terminated following a planned interim futility analysis which showed that the combina tion of TEZ/IVA did not result in a pre-specified improvement in lung function. Because there is no effective treatment for this population, placebo is the control in Parts D1, D2, and F. A potential for benefit was demonstrated for TEZ/IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype in Study VX11-661-10117, and a Phase 3 study of TEZ/IVA in subjects with the F/F genotype (Study VX14-661-106) demonstrated a cli nically meaningful benefit across multiple endpoints.18 Therefore, TEZ/IVA is the active control in Part E."

59,page_59,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 60 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Part B VX-445 Starting Dose and Dose Escalation The starting dose in Part B will be selected based on safety, tolerability, and PK data in Part A. The total daily dose in C ohort B1 will be at least 1 dose level below the highest Part A dose for which safety, tolera bility, and PK results are available and that is safe and well tolerated. Initiation of successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety and PK data as described in Section 9.7.1.2 . Part C VX-445 Starting Dose and Dose Escalation Part C may be initiated while Parts A and B are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. The starting dose (Cohort C1) will be at least 1 dose level below the highest Part B dose for which safety and tole rability results are available and supportive. Dosing will be staggered in Cohort C1, with 2 subjects dosed (1 with VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA and 1 with triple placebo) at least 24 hours before the remaining 6 subjects. Staggering at higher doses may be conducted if deemed necessar y based on review of emerging safety data. Parts B and C Treat ment Duration The duration of dosing in Part B (10 days) and Part C (14 days) is a standard duration for multiple-dosing in first -in-human studie s and is of sufficient length for an early assessment of safety and tolerability and for assessment of steady-state PK. TEZ and IVA Doses (Part C) The doses of TEZ and I VA are the same as those being evaluated in Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA combination therapy ( TEZ: 100 mg qd; IVA: 150 mg q12h). These doses of TEZ and IVA are appropriate for evaluatio n in the TC based on in vitro experiments with VX-445 that evaluated similar levels of TEZ and IVA exposure after correction for protein-binding. Administration of VX-445 with Food Doses of VX-445 will be administered under fed conditions in all cohorts except Cohort A7, which includes a dosing period whe re VX-445 is also administered under fasting conditions to evaluate the food effect. Only a mild food effect is predicted for VX-445 oral absorption. However, given the ultimate intent to administer VX-445 in combination with TEZ/IVA, which are administered with fat-containing food, this early assessment of safety and PK will be conducted under fed conditions. 9.3.2.2 Parts D, E, and F VX-445 Dosage VX-445 will be given qd. Part D may be initiated while Parts A, B, and C are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. Single doses of VX -445 up to 360 mg were safe and well tolerated in Part A, and multiple doses of VX-445 up to 340 mg qd fo r 10 days were safe and well tolerated in Part B. In Part C, multiple doses of VX -445 up to 280 mg qd in TC with TEZ 100 mg qd and IVA 150 mg q12h were safe and well tolerated after 14 days of dosing. Part D1 will evaluate 1 dose level (mid-dose: 100 mg qd) of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA to assess safety, tolerabil ity, and PK in a smaller subset of subjects before enrolling a larger number"
60,page_60,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 61 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated of subjects and evaluating a higher VX-445 dose. The mid-dose of VX-445 100 mg qd was selected to ensure a sufficient safety marg in relative to nonclinical data and the clinical experience in Parts A, B, and C in healthy subjects, and is at least 1 dose level below the highest Part C dose for which safety and tolerability results are available and supportive. Part D2 will evaluate 3 dose levels of VX-445 (low: 50 mg qd; mid: 100 mg qd; and high: 200 mg qd) in TC with TEZ/IVA. The TC-high dose of VX-445 does not exceed the highest dose shown to be safe and well tolerated in Parts A, B, and C. The dose levels evaluated in Part D2 will be expected to provide clinical benefit (based on in vitro data) and will be selected to provide a range of exposure for exposure-response analyses of safety and efficacy. The highest TC dose of 200 mg qd VX-445 used in Part D2 will also be used in Parts E and F. Dose- and exposure-response information obtained for the TC in Part D (subjects with F/MF genotypes) is expected to be applica ble to other populations with an F508del mutation, including F/F, based on similar potency of the TC in HBE cells that have 1 copy or 2 copies of F508del.11 TEZ Dosage In all study parts, the TEZ dosage will be 100 mg qd, which is the same dose being evaluated in Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA. IVA Dosage In Parts D and E, the IVA dosage will be 150 mg q12h. This dosage is being used in Phase 3 studies of TEZ/IVA and is also the approved IVA monotherapy dosage for patients aged 12 years and older. VX-561 Dosage A VX-561 dose of 150 mg qd was selected for e valuation in Part F based on preliminary PK results from a relative bioavailability stud y (Stud y VX16-770-018) evaluating the 50-mg table t formulation of VX-561. 150-mg qd is predicted to result in similar PK parameters as IVA when administered alone at a dose of 150 mg q12h, inc luding AUC 0-24h and Ctrough. The VX-561 dose selection accounts for differences in the PK profile relative to IVA. VX-561 has been dosed up to 225 mg qd for 7 days in a Phase 1 study. Treatment Duration The 4-week treatment duration for the TC is based on previous experience with CF correctors and potentiators in clinical studies of subjects with CF. In previous studies of TEZ and IVA, PD effects were observed within 4 weeks of treatment. In Study VX06-770-101, treatment with IVA for 4 weeks resulted in statistically significant within-group changes from baseline in ppFEV 1 as well as a trend toward clinically meaningful improvements in the respiratory domain of the CFQ-R; differences in biomarkers of CFTR activity (sweat chloride) between IVA and placebo groups were also demonstrated. Furthermore, in Study VX11-661-101 dose-dependent improvements in lung function were observed for TEZ/IVA after 4 weeks of treatment, with the 2 highest dose groups showing statistically significant improvement in lung function versus placebo.17 In both studies, improvements in sweat chloride and ppFEV 1 were observed during the first week of dosing, with most of the effect observed within 14 days. Given the increased in vitro response of the TC relative to TEZ/IVA, it is expected that the 4-week treatment duration"
61,page_61,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 62 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated of VX-445 will be sufficient to observe differences between treatment arms with respect to efficacy and PD endpoints. Administration of VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 With Food Oral doses of V X-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 will be administered under fed conditions. This is consistent with how VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 were administered in nonclinical studies, including the GLP toxicity studies. Only a mild food effect is pre dicted for VX-445 oral absorption. 9.3.3 Study Population (Parts D, E, and F) The study will include subjects with F/MF and F/F genotypes. The inclusion of subjects with F/MF and F/F genotypes is based on in vitro data that indicate the potential for significant improvements in chloride transport for CF patients with 1 or 2 copies of F508del in response to treatment with TC.11 Subjects homozygous and heterozygous for F508del will be evaluated in different parts of the study because of the potential for differences in the magnitude of treatment response across the 2 genotype categories, and also because of the differences in current standard of care (See Section 9.3.1.2 ). 9.3.4 Study Assessments 9.3.4 .1 Parts A, B, and C The majority of safety and PK assessments are standard parameters for Phase 1 clinical studies. Rationales for other safety, PK, and PD assessments ar e listed below: 4β-hydroxycholesterol (Part B) 4β-hydroxycholesterol is an endogenous marker for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity.20 Evaluation of 4β-hydroxycholesterol is increasingly being used to assess potential clinical CYP3A induction. In Part B, comparison of 4β-hydroxycholesterol on Day 10 (predose) relative to baseline (Day 1 predose) will be used to evaluate potential induction of CYP3A by VX-445. Based on in vitro data, VX-445 is not expected to be an inducer of CYP3A.11 Spirometry (Parts B and C) Transient declines in lung function have been observed at initiation of treatment with another CFTR corrector that is not included in the current study (LUM).21 Although nonclinical toxicity results do not indicate a risk of lung function decline for VX-445, lung function, as assessed by spirometry, will be included in Parts B and C as a precautionary safety measure."

TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 are metabolized extensively via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. VX-445 has a low potential to be an inhibitor or inducer of CYP enzymes based on in vitro data but is meta bolized by CYP3A4/5. Therefore, use of moderate and strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, which ha ve the potential to alter the exposure of VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 will be prohibited. VX-445 is a potential inhibitor of the hepatic transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1). Therefore, sensitive substrates of OATP1B1, such as HMG- Co- A Reductase Inhibitors (“statins”) are prohibited during treatment. Commercially available CFTR modulators are also prohibited.

The starting daily dose (Cohort B1) will be at l east 1 dose level below the highest Part A dose for which safety, tolerability, and PK results ar e available and that is safe and well tolerated. The decision to initiate successive cohorts and dose selection will be based on safety, tolerability, and available PK data through Day 10 from previous cohorts. Doses may be adjusted upward or downward based on safety, tolerability, a nd PK data from preceding dose group(s). The highest daily dose of VX-445 in Part B will not exceed the highest Part A dose for which safety and tolerability results are supportive. Stopping criteria a re presented in Section 9.8.1. 9.7.1.3 Part C Part C may be initiated while Parts A and B are ongoing after review of safety, tolerability, and PK data. The starting dose (Cohort C1) will be at least 1 dose level below the highest Part B dose for which safety and tolerability results are available and supportive. The highest dose of VX-445 in Part C will not exceed the highest Part B dose for which safety and tolerability results are available and supportive. 9.7.2 Parts D, E, and F If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing ( Section 9.1.2.7). No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. 9.8 Stopping Criteria 9.8.1 Parts A, B, and C Dose escalation will be stopped if the mean AUC 0-∞ (single-dose escalation) or AUC 0-24h (multiple-dose escalation) of the next dose is predicted to exceed an AUC of 290 μg·h/mL or the Cmax is predicted to exceed 19.5 μg/mL (NOAEL exposure at the 50 mg/kg/day dose in male rats in the 28-day GLP toxicity study). An individual subj ect will discontinue study drug dosing if the subject has a serious adverse event (SAE) or an AE that jeopardizes the subject’s safety. The investigator must immediately notify the Vertex medical monitor if either an SAE or a severe (or greater) AE occurs that is considered related or possibly related to study drug. All SAEs, regardless of the presumed relationship to study drug, must also be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours (Section 13.1.2.3)."

Occurrence of such events will trigger an internal safety review, including discussion between the investigator and medical monitor. The study may be restarted if the sponsor and the investigator decide that this is appropriate. 9.8.2 Parts D, E, and F Subjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, or total bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as c linically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing), and the medical monitor must be notified, if any of the following criteria are met:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice  Indirect bilirubin >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for total bilirubin minus ULN for direct bilirubin) A thorough inv estigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued , if either of the following criteria is met:  Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, or alcohol inge stion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved  Subsequent indirect bilirubin values confirm the initial value as >2 × ULN (defined as ULN for tot al bilirubin minus ULN for direct bilirubin), in association with decreased haptoglobin If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation and/or increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases or bilirubin return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Approval of the medical monitor is required befo re resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase or bilirubin eleva tion interruption threshold recurs during the Treatment Period"

All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases and/or bilirubin should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety reasons, behavior, noncompliance with study drug dosing or study procedures, ineligibility, or administrative reasons. Whenever possible, subjects who have been withdrawn from study drug treatment will continue on study; however, Vertex retains the right to remove a subject from the study. In Parts D, E, and F, subjects who have been randomized and whose screening CFTR genotype does not confirm study e ligibility must be discontinued from the study, even if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report was used to establish eligibility. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational products (Parts D, E, and F), request that the subject return for a Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see S ection 9.1.1.3 for Parts A, B, and C and Section 9.1.2.7 for Parts D, E, and F), and follow up with the subje ct regarding any unresolved AEs. If the subject withdraws consent for the study, no fur ther evaluations will be performed and no additional data will be collected. Vertex may retain and continue to use the study data and samples collected. The study data and the samples may be used for the development of the study compound, other drugs, or diagnostics, in publications and pr esentations, or for education purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples. Any information that already has been obtained from the samples will continue to be used. Stopping criteria are presented in Section 9.8. 9.10 Replacement of Subje cts Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of study drug (Day 1 for Parts A, B, C, D, and F; Day -28 for Part E) may be replaced. Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn for nonsafety reasons during the study drug treatment periods may be replaced at Vertex's discretion."

The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject's treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urge nt clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject's study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. In case of emergency, the investigator will have the final decision and unilateral right for unblinding. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center ( ) will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. If a subject's treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject's study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. Unblindin g of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Vertex GPS or Designee for SAEs or Safety Concerns Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time."

In Parts D, E, and F, for purposes of study conduct, the central laboratory must be used for all laboratory tests with the exceptions not ed above. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of a n AE on the local laboratory value. 11.7.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits (Section 3). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom-directed vital sign assessments can be performed at t he discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider. A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head/neck/thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. Parts D, E, and F only: The abbreviated PE will include an assessment of the following body systems: EENT, cardiovascular system, respiratory system, skin, and abdomen. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse rate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest in the seated position."
84,page_84,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 85 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 11.7.4 Pulse Oximetry (Parts D, E, and F) Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be measured after at least a 5-minute rest (seated) and before study drug dosing. At visits when study drug is taken at the site, pulse oximetry will be collected before the morning dose. This is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. 11.7.5 Electrocardiograms 11.7.5.1 Safety ECGs Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 3). Additional standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed at any other time if cli nically indicated. The subject will be instructed to rest in the seated or supine position for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG performed. The ECG traces will be manually read at the study site, as shown in Section 3. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investi gator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through the Safety Follow-up Visit will be recorded as AEs. Study sites should use QTcF unless they receive approval in adva nce from the medical monitor to use QTcB. To ensure safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. I f either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 m sec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in a separate document (ECG Manual). 11.7.5.2 Continuous ECGs for Cardiodynamic Assessment (Part A, With the Exception of Cohort A7) In Part A, continuous ECGs will be obtained per Table 3-2 using a continuous 12-lead digital recor der. The continuous 12-lead digital ECG da ta will be stored onto Secure Digital memory cards. ECGs to be used in the analyses will be selected by predetermined time points as defined in Table 3-2 and will be read centrally. At each protocol-specified time point, 10 ECG replicates will be extracted from a 5-minute “ECG window” (typically , the last 5 minutes of the 15-minute period when the subject i s maintained in a supine or semi-recumbent quiet position). The following principles will be followed in the laboratory:  ECG analysts are blinded to the subject, visit, and treatment allocation.  Baseline and on-treatment ECGs for a particular subject will be over-read on the same lead and will be analyzed by the same reader.  The primary analysis lead is lead II. If lead II is not analyzable, then the primary lead of analysis will be changed to another lead for the entire subject data set."
85,page_85,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 86 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated The ECG data collected by continuous monitoring may or may not be analyzed, or the analysis may be restricted initially to 1 or more cohorts. The decision to analyze the ECG data will be based on future development decisions for VX-445. If it is determined that the continuous ECG data will be ana lyzed, a separate analysis plan will be created for the evaluation of the ECG data, including the Cardiodynamic ECG Assessment and Concentration-QTc Analysis. 11.7.6 Spirometry (Parts B, C, D, E, and F) Spirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines .14 11.7.7 Contraception and Pregnancy The effects of VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. VX-445, TEZ, IVA, and VX-561 did not show genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo (r odent micronucleus) studies.11, 12, 17, 27 Reproductive studies of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown teratogenicity in rats and rabbits.11, 17, 27 11.7.7.1 Contraception Contraception requirement for the couple is waived for the following:  True abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must be practiced from the Screening Visit through 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  If the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the first dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).  If the female is of non-childbearing potential. To be considered of non-childbearing potential, the female must meet at least 1 of the following criteria: • Postmenopausal: Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months and a serum FSH level within the laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females. • Documented hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy. Note: All other females (including females with tubal ligations and females who do not have a documented bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) will be considered to be of childbearing potential.  Same sex relationships"

Yes Oral, implanted, injected, or vaginal hormonal contraceptives, if successfully used for at least 60 days before the first dose of study drug. Yes a A female condom cannot b e used with a male condom due to risk of tearing. Additional notes:  Male subjects must not donate sperm during the period starting from the first dose of study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  Female subjects should not nurse a child during the period starting from the first dose of study drug until 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  For male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential, the couple must not plan to become pregnant during the study or within 90 days after the last study drug dose. 11.7.7.2 P regnancy Subjects will be counseled to inform the investigator of any pregnancy that occurs during study treatment and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. If a female subje ct or the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during study participation, other than a female partner as the result of artificial insemination using sperm banked by the male subject before the first dose of study drug, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site's knowledge of the subject's (or partner's) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy, and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is"

Safety statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for this study, and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before clinical database lock. Final analyses will take place after all subjects have completed the study, all data have been entered in the clinical study database, and the database has been locked. 12.1 Sample Size and Power 12.1.1 Parts A, B, and C No formal sample size calculations have been performed. The number of subjects participating in each cohort is common in early clinical pharmacology studies and is considered sufficient to achieve the objectives of the study. 12.1.2 Parts D, E, and F 12.1.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objectives of Parts D, E, and F are the evaluation of safety and tolerability, and efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA (Parts D and E) and in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 (Part F) in subjects with CF. The sample size calculations described below are deemed adequate to evaluate the primary objectives, based on clinical and statistical considerations. Safety and Tolerability The primary safety endpoint is the incidence of AEs. Approximately 104 subjects with CF will be enrolled in the study with approximately 81 subjects receiving VX-445 in TC with either TEZ/IVA or TE Z/VX-561. The sample size for each treatment group will provide sufficient data for a descriptive analysis of AEs. Efficacy The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 through Day 29 in Parts D, E, and F . A sample size of 18 subjects per treatment group provides at least 90% power to detect a mea n change of 7 percentage points. 12.1.2.2 Secondary Objectives A secondary objective of Parts D, E, and F is the evaluation of the PD effect of VX-445 in TC with TEZ/IVA (P arts D and E) and in TC with TEZ/ VX-561 (Part F) in subjects with CF. The absolute change from baseline through Day 29 in sweat chloride is a secondary endpoint used to evaluate the PD objective of the study. In Part D, a test for a decreasing dose-response trend between placebo and the TC dose groups will be performed using a multiple comparisons procedure (MCP). The procedure consists of testing the null hypothesis of the lack of a decreasing dose-response trend versus a decreasing trend using the 1-sided maximum t-statistic that controls the type I error at alpha = 5%. The procedure requires a family of candidate"

The Safety Set will be used for a ll safety analyses, unless otherwise specified. Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. If a subject received at least 1 dose of a higher dose TC treatment, the subject will be analyzed in the higher dose TC treatment group. For the purpose of analysis, the priority order of increasing study drug treatment will be defined as placebo, TC- low, TC-mid, and TC-high. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, standard error (SE), median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, minimum and maximum values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, median, SD, and SE will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or Inter national System [SI]) will be converted with the appropriate precision. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place. The baseline value, unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1 of Treatment Period for Parts A, B, and C or Day 1 of Period 1 for Parts D, E, and F). For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., Day 1, as described above). Absolute chan ge from baseline will be calculated as postbaseline value – baseline value. Relative ch ange from baseline will be calculated as (postbaseline value – baseline value)/baseline value. Parts D, E, and F Only The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period will include the time from the first dose in Period 1 to the Safety Follow-up Visit or 28 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not complete the Sa fety Follow-up Visit.

All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing. 12.3.3 Efficacy Analysis (Parts D, E, and F Only) 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Variables The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change from baseline for ppFEV 1 through Day 29 in Parts D, E, a nd F. The analysis will be performed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with change from baseline as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment- by-visit interaction as fixed effects, subject as random effect, and the continuous baseline ppFEV 1 as a covariate. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated usi ng the Kenward-Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model t he within-subject errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used. Conditional on observed data and covariates, missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be assumed to be missing at random. Adjusted mea ns and 95% confidence intervals of the average treatment effects through Day 29, as applicable, w ith 2-sided P values, will be estimated within MMRM using LSMeans via PROC MIXED in SAS, for a ll within-group and between-group comparisons in both parts. Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data due to treatment or study discontinuation will be described in the SAP.

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1. 2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself w ill be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal stud y assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following:  Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study"
99,page_99,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 100 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinica l status indicates a life-threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time ICF is signed until the following time points:  For subjects who do not enroll: until time of screen failure (e.g., screen failure, withdrawal of consent)  For enrolled subjects who have a Safety Follow-up Visit: through the Safety Follow-up Visit  For enrolled subjects in Parts A, B, and C who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, 10 days after the last dose of study drug  For enrolled subjects in Parts D, E, and F who do not have a Safety Follow-up Visit, the earliest of o 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or o the ETT Visit, if that visit is 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug (see Section 9.1.2.7) All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject's source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  Description of the event  Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  Severity  Causal relationship to study drug(s)  Action taken  Outcome  Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity 13.1.1.4.1 Parts A, B, and C The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials,"

The severity of an AE that does not appear in this scale will be determined a ccording to the de finitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.4.2 Parts D, E, and F The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_a pplications/ctc.htm (Accessed August 2015). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” The severity of an AE that does not appe ar in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Caus ality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administr ation of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease . Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject's medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3."
101,page_101,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 102 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed bef ore the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/Resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not Recovered/Not Resolved (Continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, hospitalization, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization"
102,page_102,"Protocol VX16- 445-001, Version 7.0 Page 103 of 114 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions)  Congenital anomaly or birth defect  Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (e. g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergenc y room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred be fore the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indica te an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through the Safety Follow-up Visit, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the p resumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via:"
