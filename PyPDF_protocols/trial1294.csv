Objectives Primary Object ive To evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) , com pared to placebo, in subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis during the 16- week Placebo - controlled Phase. Secondary Object ives To evaluate the safet y and tolerabili ty of apremilast 30 mg BID, compared with placebo, in subjects wi th mild to m oderate pl aque psori asis To evaluate the effect of apremilast 30 mg BID compared with placebo on itch over the whole body caused by plaque psori asis To evaluate the effe ct of apremilast 30 mg BID compared with placebo on Health -related Qualit y of Life (HRQoL) Study Design This is a Phase 3, mult icenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of apremilast (CC -10004) in subject swith mild to m oderate plaque psori asis. Approximately 574 subjects will be enro lled and rando mized 1:1 to receive either apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for the first 16 weeks. Subjects will be rando mized based on a permuted block rando mizati on using a centralized Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomization to apremilast arm or placebo arm will be stratified by baseline static Physician Glo bal Assessment (sPGA )score (mild [2] or moderate [3]). Approximately 30% of subjects rando mize d will have a baseline sPGA score of mild (2) and approximately 70% of subjects will have a baseline sPGA score of moderate (3). Subjects rando mized to the apremilast 30 mg BID treatment group will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twice daily for th e first 16 weeks Subjects rando mized to the placebo treatment group will receive placebo tablets (identical in appearance to apremilast 30 mg tablets) orally twice daily for the first 16 weeks All subjects will receive apremilast 30 mg tablets orally twicedaily after the Week 16 Visit through the end of the Apremilast Extension Phase of the study"

The calculat ion is based on a chi -square test assuming 15% response rate for placebo and adjust ing for a 20% dropout rate . For the Pl acebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the analyses for efficacy endpo ints will be based on t he intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion, defined as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical co mpar isons will be made between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statist ical tests will be at the two -sided 0.05 significance l evel and the corresponding p -values and 95% confidence intervals (CI s) will be reported. The treatment difference for the primary endpo int will be co mpared between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo using a Cochran Mantel –Haenszel (CMH) test adj usting for the stratificat ion factor. The t wo-sided p -values from the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proporti on using the wei ghted average of the treatment differences across the stratificat ion factor with the CMH weig hts, along with the associated two -sided 9 5% CIs using a normal approximat ion to the weighted average will be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using mult iple imputation (MI) as the primary method, wi th sensi tivity analysis using the non -responder imputation (NRI) method and the tipping po int analysis . The continuous endpo ints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect m odel for repeated m easures (MMRM) as the primary method. The MMRM model will use the change fro m baseline as the response variable and include treatment group, visit time, treatment - by-timeinteracti on, and stratificat ion factor as fixed effects, and the baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covari ance matrix will be used to model the correlation amo ng repeated measurements. The Kenward -Roger adj ustment will be used with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to make proper statist ical inference. Wit hin-group l east-squares (LS) means and the associated standard errors ( SEs)and two -sided 95% CIs, treatment differences in LS means and the associated two - sided 95% CIs and two -sided p -values will be derived from the MMRM model. A sensit ivity analysis will be conducted using the analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) model wit h treatment and stratification factor as the fixed effects, the baseline value as the covariate and the LOCF method to impu te the missing data. The other binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint using the CMH test. To control the overall t ype I error rate, a fixed -sequence testing procedure will be used to test the primary and secondary endpoints in a predefined order. The test will be performed in sequence andsignificance of all preceding endpo ints is required in order to proceed to the next one. The proposed sequence of testing for the primary and secondary efficacy endpo ints is listed below. Propo rtion of subjects wi th sPGA score of clear (0) or almo st clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline at Week 16 Proporti on of subject s who improved ≥ 75% in BSA fro m baseline Change fr om baseline in affected BSA at Week 16 Change from baseline in total PASI score at Week 16"

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Disease Background Psori asis is a chronic, immune -mediated di sorder. Pl aque psori asis, the m ost comm on form of psori asis, i s typically characterized by raised, demarcated er ythematous plaques covered by a silvery scale (Lebwohl, 2003a ). Psoriasis affects 2- 3% of the populat ion, wi th approximately 80% of patients experiencing mild to moderate disease ( Menter, 2009 ). Psoriasis is associated with a range of co morbidities thathave been demonstrated in subjects regardless of psoriat ic disease severi ty (Ahleho ff, 2011 , 2013 ). Treatment guidelines categorize therapy by extent of psori atic dise ase based on the am ount of affected body surface area (BSA). Limited invo lvement or mild disease, defined as 0 -3% BSA (National Psori asis Foundati on [NPF]) or ≤5% (American Academy of Dermatology [AAD ], [Menter, 2008 ]) can be treated wi th topical therapies. However, treatm ent sati sfact ion rem ains low in pat ient using topical therapies co mpared to systemic or phototherapy ( Cranenburgh, 2013). In a recently published co mpar ison of co mbinat ion calcipotri ene and betam ethasone (Enstilar®) with the individual com ponent therapi es in a 4 -week treatment period, about half o f the subjects in this treatment group did not achieve a meaningful reduct ion of their plaque psori asis, and even higher numbers o f subjects failed to achieve response wit h calcipotriene or betam ethasone treatm ent al one (Stein Gold, 2016 ). Addit ionally, topi cal therapies may not be adequate for subjects with less than 5% BSA affected with psoriasis in vul nerable areas such as the face, genitals, hands and feet, scalp, or intertriginous areas (Menter, 2011). Treatment of nail psori asiswith topical therapies also posesa clinical challenge and m ay not be adequate for subject wit h significant skin and nail disease (Crowl ey, 2015; Pasch , 2016). Extensive disease or moderate to severe disease, established by h ealth authori ties as BSA ≥ 10%, Psori asis Area Severit y Index (PASI) ≥12 and static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3 (moderate or greater) can be treated with systemic therapies, but bio logics and oral therapi es such as methotrexate may be limi ted by safet y concerns and the need for careful laboratory monitoring. Consequent ly, subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis, represent an underserved popul ation. There remains an unmet medical need for an effect ive, convenient treatment of mild to moderate psori asis that i s well tolerated com pared to the currently available treatment options (Armstrong, 2013 ). 1.2. Compound Background Apremilast (CC -10004) i s a specific phosphodiesterase ty pe 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under development for use in the treatment of inflammatory condi tions. The PDE4 i s one of the m ajor phosphodiesteras es expressed in leukocy tes. PDE4 inhibit ion by apremilast elevates cy clic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels in immune cells, which in turn down -regul ates the inflammatory response by reducing the expressio n of pro-inflammatory mediators such as tum or necrosing factor (TNF) -α, interleukin (IL) -23, IL -17, and other inflammatory cytokines, and increasing the production of ant i-inflammatory mediators. In com pleted Phase 3 studi es in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and active psori atic art hritis, treatment with apremilast was associated with statist ically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in mult iple efficacy measures. On the basis of these studies,"

Apremilast remains under further clinical development for the treatm ent of inflammatory / autoimmune disorders including Behçet’s disease, and ulcerat ive colit is. Further studies within the approved indicat ions of plaque psori asis and psori atic arthrit is are also ongoing. Please refer to the current Invest igator’s Bro chure (IB) for detailed information concerning the available pharmaco logy, toxi cology, drug m etabo lism, clinical studies, and adverse event (AE) profile of the invest igational product (IP). 1.3. Rationale 1.3.1. Study Rationale and Purpose Treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis can be challenging, and patient satisfaction and compliance wi th current treatm ent m odali ties are often l ow, parti cularly with topical therapies (Cranenburgh, 2013; Duffin, 2014 ). Low satisfact ion with treat ment options can lead to poor adherence and suboptimal response. There rem ains an unmet m edical need for an effective, convenient treatment of mild to moderate psori asis that i s well tolerated com pared to the current ly available treatment options ( Armstrong, 2013) . Currently approved topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues may be limited by short treatment durations, poor treatment compliance and significant adverse effects such as tachy phylaxis, skin atrophy , striae, te langiectasia, and hypothalamic -pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppressio n (Chan, 2009; Kragballe, 2013 ). Other topical therapies, such as coal tar and anthralin preparat ions have cosmet ically unappealing formulat ions, foul odor, limited efficacy, and potenti al carcinogenic risk ( Chan, 2009 ). Systemic therapies including convent ional therapi es such as m ethotrexate, retinoi ds and cyclo sporine or the bio logics, have been approved for moderate to severe p laque psoriasis, and are associated with dose limit ing effects such as hepatotoxicit y, teratogeni city, nephrotoxici ty and increased ri sk of malignancy or severe infect ion. In addit ion, careful laboratory monitoring for infect ions, reactivation o f latent tuberculosis, hypersensit ivity reacti ons and m alignancies ( Menter, 2009; Nast, 2012 ) may be requi red wi th these agents. Apremilast (APR, OTEZLA®) is a drug that is taken orally (by mouth [PO]). Apremilast inhibits the enzyme PDE 4, whi ch is a cAMP- specific PDE and the dominant PDE in inflammatory cells. By inhibit ing PDE4, apremilast elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which in turn modulates a network of pro -and ant i-inflammatory mediators and reduces the inflammatory response. The proposed Phase 3 study is intended to assess the safet y and efficacy of apremilast 30 mg twice daily (BID) in the treatm ent of subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis who are not adequately controlled by topi cal therapies. 1.3.2. Rationale for the S tudy Design Study CC-10004- PSOR -012 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 4 trial, in which the efficacy and safet y of apremilast was evaluated in 221 subjects with moderate plaque psori asis defined as BSA of 5 -10% and sPGA of 3 (moderat e). In addit ion, eligible subjects had"

Su bjects were treated with APR 30 BID or placebo for 16 weeks during the Placebo -controlled Phase. At the end of the Placebo -controlled Phase at Week 16, subjects entered the Apremilast Extension Phase and receiv ed APR 30 BID up to study Week 5 2. Analyses o f the proporti on of subjects who achieved an sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almo st clear) wi th at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at Week 16, demonstrated statist ically significant benefit wit h APR 30 BID compared to placebo in the treatment of subj ects wi th plaque psori asis of moderate severi ty. These results from the CC-10004- PSOR -12 study are consistent with results fro m the pivotal Phase 3 studi es CC-10004- PSOR -008 and CC-10004- PSOR 009, which were conducted in subjects with moderate to severe p soriasis. This study will direct ly invest igate the safet y and efficacy of apremilast 30 m g BID, com pared with placebo, in the treatm ent of subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis . While PASI -75 has been the standard primary efficacy endpoint to mea sure disease severit y in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (BSA ≥10%), the utilit y of PASI is limited by its decreased sensit ivity in moderate di sease (BSA < 10%) where the general degree of improvement is underest imated ( Spuls, 2010; Menter, 2008 ). The PASI scoring system co mbines the severit y of the psori atic lesion and BSA invo lvement into a single score of 0 -72. Assessment of PASI includes the scoring of affected skin based on categories of involved BSA, with the lowest score covering a BSA of < 10%. As the extent of the psoriat ic lesion decreases, the score is increasingly dependent on plaque severit y. Consequent ly, in subjects wi th a baseline BSA o f <10%, the PASI score can no longer acco unt for changes in affected skin surface area, but only plaque severi ty. The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects with an sPGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost cl ear) at Week 16 with at least a 2 -point reduction fro m baseline . The sPGA is a 5-point scale ranging fro m 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severit y of the 3 primary signs of the di sease: ery thema, scaling and plaque elevation (Feldman, 2005 ). This assessment has been used routi nely in pivotal studies evaluating response to invest igational psori asis therapi esand has been used in all clinical psoriasis trials with apremilast. In the proposed study populati on of subjects wi th a baseline of sPGA of mild ( 2)or moderate ( 3), in whom topicals are inadequate, inappropriate or contraindicated, Celgene believes that achieving an sPGA score of clear (0) or almo st clear (1) with at l east a 2 -point at Week 16 will represent a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with limit ed treatment options. Secondary endpoints of response will include ,at Week 16, proportion of subjects who improved ≥ 75% in BSA, change fro m baseline in affected BSA, PASI score, proporti on of subjects who achieved BSA ≤ 3%, proporti on of subjects wi th ≥4-point red uction (improvement) in the whole body itch numeric rating scale ( NRS )score am ong subjects wi th baseline whol e body itch NRS ≥ 4, proportion of subjects with Scalp Physician Global Assessment ( ScPGA )score of clear (0) or almo st clear (1) and wi th at least a 2-point reduction among subjects with baseline ScPGA score ≥ 2, and Dermatology Life Quali ty Index (DLQI )total score. Eligib le subjects will be rando mized 1 :1 to receive ei ther apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo . Randomization w ill be stratified by baseline s PGA score (mild [2] or moderate [3]) to ensure balance between treatment arms with respe ct to baseline severit y ofpsori asis. Approximately"

Rationale for Dose, S chedule and Regimen Selection In addit ion to subgroup analysis o f Phase 3 pivotal studies of CC-10004- PSOR -008 and CC- 10004- PSOR -009, Study CC-10004 -PSOR -012, a rando mized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 4 study ,demonstrated that apremilast 30 mg BID provided a treatment benefit in subjects with moderate pl aque psori asis. This study will directly invest igate the safet y and efficacy of this dosing regimen in the treatment of subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. 1.3.4. Rationale for Choice of Comparator Compounds A rando mized, double -blind placebo -controlled design was chosen in order to measure the absolute treatment effect of apremilast 30 mg BID in mild to moderate plaque psoriasis . The placebo -controlled design also minimizes subject and invest igator bias in evaluat ing the efficacy and safet y of apremilast in the selected patient populat ion (Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Guidance for Industry E10 [FDA, 2016] )."

When conduct ing the efficacy assessments, the investigator must complete these assessments i n the fo llowing order: 1) sPGA; 2) BSA; 3) PASI ; 4) ScPGA . 6.4. Efficacy Assessment s The fo llowing assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Table of Events, Table 3 static Physician Global Assessment The sPGA is the assessment b y the Investi gator of the overall disease severit y at the time of evaluat ion. The sPGA is a 5- point scale ranging fro m 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severit y of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and pl aque elevat ion. When making the assessment of overall severit y, the Invest igator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesio ns for severit y, ie, the severit y of each sign i s averaged a cross all areas of invo lvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severit ies across disease signs, the sign that is the predominant feature of the disease should be used to help determine the sPGA score. See ( Append ix B)grading criteria . Body Surface Area The BSA is a measurement of involved skin over the who le body. The overall BSA affected by psori asis is est imated based on the palm area of the subject’s hand. The surface area of the who le body is made up of approximately 100 palms or “handprints” (each ent ire palmar surface or “handprint” equates to approximately 1% of total body surface area). Psoriasis Area and Severity Index The PASI will be determined for all subjects throughout the study . The PASI calculation is described in Appendix C . The PASI is a measure of psoriat ic disease severit y taking into account qualitat ive lesion characteri stics (ery thema, thi ckness, and scaling) and degree of skin surface area involvement on defined an atomical regi ons. The PASI is a validated instrument that has beco me standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. Psori asis Area Severit y Index scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflect ing greater disease severit y (Fredriksson, 1978 ). Ery them a, thi ckness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on 4 anatomic regions o f the body : head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of invo lvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no invo lvement) to 6 (90% to 100% involvement). The total qualitative score (sum of ery thema, thi ckness, and scaling scores) is mult iplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region and then"

These values for each anatomic region are summed to yield the PASI score. Scalp Physician Global Assessment The ScPGA is a measurement of overall scalp invo lvement by the Invest igator at the time of evaluat ion. The ScPGA is a 5 -point scale ranging fro m 0 (clear) to 4 (severe), incorporating an assessment of the severit y of the three primary signs of the disease: erythema, scaling and plaque elevat ion. When making the assessment of overall scalp severit y, the Investigator should factor in areas that have already been cleared (ie, have scores of 0) and not just evaluate remaining lesio ns for severit y, ie, the severit y of each sign is averaged across all areas of invo lvement, including cleared lesions. In the event of different severit ies across signs of psoriasis, the sign that is the predominant feature of psoriasis should be used to help determine the ScPGA score. See Appendix Dfor grading criteria. Nail Assessments/Nail Psoriasis Severity Index The number of fingers wit h psoriasis nail invo lvement will be counted. The NAPSI will assess one target thumb nail or fingernail represent ing the worst nail psoriasis involvement at b aseline. See Appendix Efor grading criteria. 6.5. Safety Assessments Contraception Education The ri sks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time. Results of animal and in vitro studies can be found in the current IB. All FCBP must use one of the approved contraceptive options as described in Secti on4.2while on IP and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the IP. The female subject’s chosen form of contraception must be effect ive by the time the female subject is ra ndomized into the study (for example, hormonal contraception should be init iated at least 28 day s bef ore randomizat ion). At screening and at baseline, and at any time during the study when a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or abilit y to becom e pregnant changes, the Invest igator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy . Serum and Urine Pregnancy Tests for Females of Childbearing Potential A serum pregnancy test with a sensit ivity of ≤ 25 mIU/mL will be required for FCBP subjects at screening and at the Early Terminat ion Visit or Vi sit 10. In addi tion, a local urine pregnancy test kit will be provided b y the central laboratory and will be perform ed at the si te on all FCBP subjects at the Baseline Visit, prior to dosing , and at Vi sits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 . An unscheduled serum pregnancy test shoul d be perform ed if the FCBP subject has missed a menstrual periodor has a posi tive urine dipstick test ."

Height will be measured and recorded at Screening; weight will also be measured and recorded at screening and then as indicated in Table 3. Body massindex (BMI) will be calculated at Screening. Complete Physical Examination A co mplete physical examinat ion includes evaluations of skin, nasal cavit ies, eyes, ears, lymph nodes, and respiratory , cardi ovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, and musculos keletal systems. The com plete physical examinat ion is done at screening and at the Early Terminat ion or Last Treatment Visit (Visit 10). Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The C -SSRS (Posner , 2007) is a scale tha t captures the occurrence, severi t y,and frequency ofsuicide- relate d ideations and behavio rs during the assessment period (Appendix F ). The C-SSRS mustbeadministered byappropr iately trained si te personnel. The C -SSRS will be co mpleted at all study visits. At Vi sit 1 (Screening) the C-SSRS will be co mpleted for the subject ’s lifetime history o f suicidal ideation and behavior. At all other visits the C -SSRS will be completed for ideat ion and behavior since th e previous visit. Psychiatric Evaluation Apremilast prescriber informat ion (eg, Summary of Product Characterist ics, Package Insert) includes a warning regarding depressio n and sui cidal thoughts. Pati ents wi th chronic diseases may be prone to depression. The risks and benefits of starting or continuing treatment with apremilast should be carefully assessed if pat ients report previous or exist ing psychiatric symptoms or if conco mitant treatm ent wi th other medicinal products likely to cause psy chiatri c event s is intended. At any time during the study , subjects who have suicidal thoughts or behavior should be evaluated. If the psychiatrist deems the subject not to be a risk for suicide, the subject may remain in the study , but if a ri sk of suicide is confirme d, the subject m ust be discont inued fro m the study .If the subject is discont inued during the treatment phase of the study , the subject should return for the Observat ional Follow-up Visit. A copy of the psychiatri c evaluat ion report must be in the subject ’s source docum entati on, especially if the subject is confirmed not to be at risk for suicide and is cont inuing in the study. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Clinical laboratory evaluat ions will be performed by a central laboratory and as indicated in Table 3.

Dipst ick urinalysis will be performed by the central laboratory; microscopic urinalysis (epithelial cells, RBC, WBC, and casts) will be performed only if the dipst ick urinalysis is abnormal. Fasting is not required. However, if significant elevat ion of serum lip id(s) is observed, a fast ing retest shoul d be requested to determine whether or not elevation was caused by eating. Psoriasis Flare Assessments Psori asis flare represents an aty pical or unusual worsening of disease during treatm ent (Carey, 2006 ). It is defined as a sudden intensificat ion of psori asis requi ring medical intervent ion or a diagnosis of new generalized ery throdermic, inflammatory , or pustul ar psori asis.

Subject Reported Outcomes or Health -related Quality of Life Assessment 6.8.1. Whole Body Itch Numeric Rating Scale Assessment Prior to any other procedures or assessments being performed during the treatment period, the subject will be asked to assess who le body itch and select a number on a scale of 0-10, where “0” represents no itch, and “10” represents the worst imaginable itch. The number selected by the subject will be recorded in the database. See Appendix G . The Who le Body Itch NRS scale has been validated among patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, and a 4 -point change from baseline was shown to be optimal for dem onstrating a l evel of clinically meaningful improvement in i tch severi ty (Kimball , 2016) . 6.8.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI was developed as a simple, compact, and practical questionnaire for use in a dermatology clinical setting to assess limitat ions related to the impact of skin disease (Finlay, 1994). The i nstrument contains 10 items de aling wit h the subject’s skin. Wit h the except ion of Item Number 7, the subject responds on a four- point scale, ranging from “Very Much” to “Not at All.” Item Number 7 is a mult i-part item, the first part of which ascertains whether the subject’s skin pr evented them from working or studying (Yes or No), and if “No,” then the subject is asked how much of a problem the skin has been at work or study over the past week, with response alternat ives being “A lot,” “A little,” or “Not at all.” The DLQI Total s core has a possible range fro m 0 to 30, with 30 corresponding to the worst health -related quali ty of life, and 0 corresponding to the best score. The developers suggest that the DLQI can be grouped into six subscales: symptoms and feelings; daily activities; leisure; work/school; personal relat ionships; and treatment. Scores for four of the subscales (symptoms and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, and personal relat ionships) range fro m 0 to 6; scores for two of the subscales (work/school and treatment) range fro m 0 to 3. Higher scores correspond to poorer healt h-related qualit y of life. See Appendix H."

Treatment Administration and Schedule Invest igational product will be taken orally twice daily, approximately 12 hours apart, without restri ction of food or drink. To mit igate potential gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, dose titration will be implemented in this study . During Week 0(Days 1 to 7) and Week 16 (when placebo subjects are switched to receive apremilast 30 mg BID), subjects will be dispensed blister cards with 10, 20, and 30 mg apremilast tablets or ident ically appearing placebo tablets for the dose titration. At all other vi sits where IP is dispensed, apremilast will be provided in blister cards as 10, 20, and 30 mg tablets or ident ically appearing placebo tablets. The treatment schema for dose ti tration at baseline and Week 16 is show n in Table 4and Table 5. Blister card configur ations are pi ctured in Appendix I, Appendix J, and Appendix K. 7.3. Overdose Overdose, as defined for this protocol, applies to protocol -requi red dosing of the invest igational product(s) only . Ther efore, f or a drug to be subject to the overdose definit ion it must be both required and an investigational drug. In thi s study the only required and investi gational drug i s apremilast and the control arm drug (ie, placebo), hence the overdose definit ion will apply to only apremilast (or m atching pl acebo). Other required or optional non -IP intended for prophylaxis of certain side effects areexcluded from this definit ion. Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as i ngest ion of 4 or more 30 mg apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 -hour peri od whether by accident or intentionally . On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as dosing more than 4 times during any 24 -hour peri od. 7.4. Method of Treatment Assignment At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet entry criteria will be rando mized using a permuted b lock rando mizat ion in paralle l 1:1 to receive eit her apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo, using a centralized Interactive Response Techno logy (IRT). Designated research personnel at the investigat ional sites will be assigned password protected, coded ident ificat ion numbers, which gives them authorizat ion to enter the IRT to randomize subjects. The system will present a menu o f quest ions by which th e research center personnel will ident ify the subject and confirm eligibilit y. When all quest ions have been answered and the subject deem ed eligible, the IRT will assign a randomizat ion identificat ion number. Confirmation o f the randomization will be sen t to the invest igational site, Celgene, and/or its representative. The confirmat ion reports should be maintained as source documents. During the study visits, the pharmacy or authorized study personnel at the invest igational site will dispense coded IP ki ts in accordance with the rando mizat ion number assigned by the IRT. 7.5. Packaging and Labeling The l abel(s) for IP will include S ponsor nam e, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IP name, dosage form and strength (where applicable), amount of IP per container, lot number, expiry date (where applicable), medicat ion identificat ion/kit number, dosing instructi ons, storage condit ions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory statem ents as"

The Invest igator(s) or Pharmacist(s) will verify the accuracy of the informat ion on the form, sign and date i t, retain a copy in the study file, and return a copy to Cel gene. At the study site, all IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized access. The IP shoul d be stored as directed on the package label. Celgene (or de signee) will review wit h the Invest igator and relevant site personnel the process for invest igational product return, disposal, and/or destruction including responsibilit ies for the site versus Celgene (or designee). 7.7. Investigational Product Compliance Study personnel will review the instructions printed on the package with the study subjects pri or to dispensing the IP. Investigational product will be dispensed as noted in the Table of Events, Table 3. The subjects will be instructed to return the IP containers, including any unused medicat ion, to the study site at each visi t for tabl et counts and reconciliat ion. Subjects will be asked whether they have taken thei r IP as instructed at each study visit. Any problems wi th IP compliance will be reviewed wi th the subject. If a subject misses 4 or more consecut ive days of dosing, Celgene should be contacted to decide whether dosing should resume or whether the subject should be terminated from the Treatment Phase of the study , and enter into the Observational Fo llow -up Phase. Gross compliance problems (eg, missing 4 or more consecutive days o f dosing or taking less than 75% or more than 120% of the doses bet ween study visits) are protocol deviat ions and shoul d be discussed wit h Celgene. Overall co mpliance wi th the study treatm ent regimen is defined as taking between 75% and 120% of the expected doses during a subject’s participat ion while in the treatment ph ases (Pl acebo -controlled Phase and Apremilast Extension Phases) of the study ."

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 9.1. Overview This is a Phase 3, mult icenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind study of the efficacy and safety of apremilast (CC -10004) in subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Treatment assignment will be stratified by baseline sPGA score [mild (2), or moderate (3)]. Approximately 30% of subjects randomized will have baseline sPGA score of mild (2) and approximately 70% of subjects will have a baseline sPGA score of moderate (3). The obj ective o f the stati stical analysis will be to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of apremilast 30 m g BID versus placebo for 16 weeks, and to evaluate the effects of apremilast 30 mg BID as a treatment for up to 32 weeks in subjects with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. After all subjects have co mpleted the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the primary analysis will be performed. At the study com pletion, ie, when all subjects have also completed the Apremilast Extension Phase (Weeks 16 to 32) and the Observat ional Follow-up Phase, the final analysis will be performed. To maintain the blind at the si te and subject level, the individual subject treatment assignments will not be revealed to the invest igators until after the final database lock fo llowing the study com pletion. 9.2. Study Population Definitions The intent -to-treat (ITT) popul ation will consist of all subjects who are randomized. Subjects will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized. The safet y popul ation will consist of all subjects who are randomized and receive at least one dose of IP (IP). Subjects will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the IP they actually receive. The per protocol (PP) populat ion will consist of all subjects included in the ITT populat ion who receive at least one dose of IP (IP), have both baseline and at least on e post -treatment sPGA evaluat ion, and have no important protocol deviat ions which may affect analyses in the Placebo - controlled Phase 9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations The sample size est imation is based on the results of the Phase 3 and 4 studies wit h apremilast. With a total of approximately 574 subjects and a rando mizat ion rati o of 1:1, the study will rando mize approximately 287 subjects to apremilast 30 mg BID and 287 subjects to placebo. This sample size will provide more than 90% power to detect a 15% difference between the two treatm ent groups for the primary endpo int at a two -sided significance level o f 0.05. The calculat ion is based on a chi -square test assuming 15% response rate for placebo and adjust ing for a 20% dropout rate . 9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics Subject’s age, height, weight, and baseline characterist ics will be summarized using descript ive statist ics, while sex, race and other categorica l variables will be provided using frequency"

Medical history data will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term. 9.5. Subject Disposition Subject dispo sition (analysis population allocat ion, entered, di scont inued, along wit h primary reason for discont inuat ion) will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions and percent for the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) and the Apremilast Extensio n Phase (We eks 16 to 32) . A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided. Protocol deviat ions will be summarized using frequency distribut ions. 9.6. Efficacy Analysis 9.6.1. Efficacy Evaluation for the Placebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) For the Pl acebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16), the analyses for efficacy endpo ints will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) populat ion, defined as all subjects who are randomized . Statistical co mpar isons will be made between apremilast 30 mg BID and placebo. All statist ical tests will be at the two -sided 0.05 significance level and the corresponding p -values and 95% confidence intervals (CI s) will be reported. 9.6.1.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint is the proportions of subjects who achieving sPGA response at Week 16 (defined as sPGA score of clear [0] or almost clear [1] and with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at Week 16). It will be analyzed using the ITT populat ion. A sensit ivity analysis will be perform ed using the PP populat ion. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using the Cochran –Mantel –Haenszel (CMH ) test adjusting for the stratificat ion factor at randomizat ion. The two -sided p -values fro m the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighted aver age of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated two -sided 95% CIs using a normal approximat ion to the weighted average will be provided. Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the mult iple imputati on (MI) m ethod (SAS Institute Inc. , 2011 )based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the primary method. Sensit ivity analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the non -responder imputation (NRI) m ethod and the tipping po int analysis . Details o f the NRI method and th e tipping point analysis will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). For the mult iple imputation method, the SAS procedure MI will be used to impute missing sPGA scores at the scheduled analysis visits in the Pl acebo -controlled Phase (Weeks 0 to 16) to create M=50complete data sets. The missing data patterns will be checked at the scheduled analysis visits, ie, Baseline (Week 0), and Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. If there are non -monotone missing patterns, two steps will be used to complete the im putati on process. In the first step, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method will be used with a single chain to impute missing scores by treatment and stratification fac tor to create M= 50imputed data sets with mo notone missing patterns. In case there are convergence issues, a simple model will be used to impute the missing scores by treatm ent, wi th further simplificat ion by dropping both"

The seed will be set to 17813721. The imputed scores will be rounded to the nearest integer. The minimum and the maximum values for imputation will be 0 and 4, which correspond to the lowest and the highest sPGA scores. In the second step, the predict ive mean matching method will be used to impute th e rem aining missing scores for the 50data sets with monotone missing patterns. The imputation procedure will use monotone statement to create one complete data set for each of the monotone data set from the first step, and the variables will include treat ment arm, stratificat ion factor, and sPGA scores at scheduled analysis visit s from baseline to Week 16. The seed will be set to 55218163. After the completion o f imputation, sPGA response at Week 16 will be derived based on both observed and imputed scores . The same CMH meth od will be used to analyze the 50complete data sets and the SAS procedure MIANALYZE will be used to combine the results for the statist ical inferences. 9.6.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed bas ed on the ITT popula tion. The two -sided p-values and two -sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported for treatment difference between apremilast and placebo arms. Mult iplicity adjust ment will be specified in the next section. The continuous endpo ints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect m odel for repeated m easures (MMRM) as the primary method. The MMRM model will use the change fro m baseline as the response variable and include treatment group, visit time, treatment -by-time interacti on, and stratificat ion factor as fixed effects, and the baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covari ance matrix will be used to model the correlation amo ng repeated measurements. The Kenward -Roger adj ustment will be used with restricted maximum likelihood (REM L) to make proper statist ical inference. Wit hin-group l east-squares (LS) me ans and the associ ated standard errors (SEs) and two -sided 95% CIs, treatment differences in LS means and the associated two - sided 95% CIs and two -sided p -values will be derived fro m the MMRM m odel. A sensi tivity analysis will be conducted using the analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) model wit h treatment and stratification factor as the fixed effects, the baseline value as the covariate and the LOCF method to impute the missing data. The binary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint using the CMH test adjusting for the stratificat ion factor at randomizat ion. The two -sided p -values fro m the CMH test, the adjusted treatment difference in proportion using the weighte d average of the treatment differences across the strata with the CMH weights, along with the associated two -sided 95% CIs using a normal approximat ion to the weighted average will be provided . Missing values at Week 16 will be imputed using the mult iple i mputati on (MI) m ethod (SAS Institute Inc. , 2011) based on similar subjects who remained in the study as the primary method. Sensi tivity analysis will be conducted to account for missing data using the last observat ion carri ed forward (LOCF) m ethod and the non -responder imputation (NRI) method. 9.6.1.3. Multiplicity Adjustment The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be hierarchically ranked for testing in order to con trol the overall t ype I error rate in claiming statist ical si gnificance at the two -sided 0.05"

Specifically , for the primary efficacy endpoint (sPGA response at Week 16), if the two -sided p -value fro m the com parison between apremilast arm and placebo arm is below 0.05, the outcome will be consider ed stati stically significant and apremilast will be declared effect ive. For any secondary endpo int, statist ical significan ce will be claimed only if its two - sided p -value is below 0.05 and tests for the primary endpo int and all previous secondary endpo intsare si gnificant at the two -sided 0.05 level. The proposed test sequence for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints is listed as the following: Proporti on of subjects wi th sPGA score of clear (0) or almo st clear (1) and with at least a 2 -point reduct ion from baseline at Week 16 Proporti on of subjects who improved ≥ 75% in BSA fro m baseline Change from baseline in affected BSA at Week 16 Change from baseline in total PASI score at Week 16 In subjects with BSA > 3% at baseline , proporti on of subjects who achieved BSA ≤ 3% at Week 16 In subjects with who le body Itch NRS score ≥ 4 at baseline , proporti on of subjects with ≥ 4- point reduction (improvement) from baseline in the whole body itch NRS score at Week 16 In subjects with S cPGA score ≥ 2 at baseline, proporti on of subjects wi th ScPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2 -point reduction from baseline at Week 16 Change from baseline in DLQI total score at Week 16 9.6.1.4.

ADVERSE EVENTS 10.1. Monitoring, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study . It m ay be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury , or any concomi tant impai rment of the sub ject’s healt h, including laboratory test val ues (as specified by the cri teria in Secti on 10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any worsening (ie, any clinic ally significant adverse change in the frequency or intensi ty of a pre - exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndro me should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptom s of the di agnosis or syndrome. Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an investi gational product shoul d be reported as an AE. Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 7.3for the definit ion of overdose.) Any sequela of an accidental or intent ional overdose of an investigational product which meets the definit ion of an adver se event, should be reported as an AE on the CRF. If the sequela o f an overdose meets serious cri teria, then i t must be m arked as serious on the CRF. The overdose itself should not be reported as an AE. In the event of overdose, the subject should be monit ored as appropri ate and should receive supportive measures as necessary . There is no known specific ant idote for apremilast overdose. Actual treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience o f the treating p hysician. All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study . Assessments may include monitoring of any or all o f the following param eters: the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical, radi ological or surgical findings, physical examin ation findings, or findings from other tests and/or procedures. All AEs will be recorded by the Investi gator f rom the time the subject signs informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of IP as well as t hose SAEs made known to the I nvest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. A ll adverse events (serious/non - serious) will be recorded on the CRF and in the subject’s source documents. All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safet y within 24 hours of the Invest igator ’s knowledge o f the event by recording on the CRF and transmitting the data electronically. In the event the CRF is not available for transmission, a paper SAE Report Form will be sent direct ly to Celgene Drug Safety. The event must also be reported on t he CRF once available. 10.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events A qualified Invest igator will evaluate all AEs as to: 10.2.1. Seriousness An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that: Results in death;"

Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immed iately life - threatening or result in death, hospitalizat ion, or disabilit y, but may jeopardi ze the subject or requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised i n deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizatio ns for: astandard procedure for protocol therapy administration. However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of th erapy administrati on will be reported as an SAE. routine treatm ent or m onitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deteri oration in condit ion. the administration o f blood or pl atelet transfusio n as routine treatment of studied indicat ion. However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE. aprocedure for protocol/disease -related invest igations (eg, surgery , scans, endoscopy , sampling for laboratory tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospitalizat ion or prolonged hospitalizat ion for a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable SAE. hospitalizati on or prol ongati on of hospi talizati on for technical , practical , or s ocial reasons, in absence of an AE. aprocedure that is planned (ie, planned prior to start of treatment on study); must be docum ented in the source document and the CRF.

Severity/Intensity For allAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severity / intensi ty of the event. Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only Intervention not indicated Activities of daily life (ADLs) minimally or not affected No or minimal intervention/therapy may be required Moderate Symptom(s) cause moderate discomfort Local or noninvasive intervention indicated More than minimal interference w ith ADLs but able to carry out daily social and functional activities. Drug therapy may be required Severe (could be non -serious or serious) Symptoms causing severe discomfort/pain Symptoms requiring medical/surgical attention/intervention Interference w ith ADLs including inability to perform daily social and functional activities (eg, absenteeism and/or bed rest) Drug therapy is required The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or se vere myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterio n is notthe same as “serious” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associ ated wi th event s that pose a threat to a subject’s life or funct ioning. Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory reporting obligat ions."

Causality The Investigator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f the IP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the AEto IP administration is unlikely or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic intervent ions, or underlying condit ions provide a sufficien t explanati on for the observed event. Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibilit y’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and the AE. Causalit y shoul dbe assessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available inform ation. Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes available. If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary o r addi tional IP that has not been manufactured or provided by Celgene, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event. 10.2.4. Duration For each AE , the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the event. 10.2.5. Action Taken The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of each AE , as applicable (eg, discontinuat ion, interruption, or dose modificat ion, as appropriate) and report if conco mitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 10.2.6. Outcome The Investigator will report t he outcome of the event for each AE . All SAEs that have not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE ). 10.3.

Regardless of severit y grade, only laboratory abnorm alitiesthat fulfill a seri ousness cri terion need to be document ed as a SAE . If a laboratory abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded as the AE on the CRF. If the abnormalit y was not a part o f a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormalit y shoul d be recorded as the AE. If possible, the laboratory abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an abnorm al laboratory resul t (eg, record thrombocy topeni a rather than d ecreased platelets). 10.4. Pregnancy All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in a female subject of childbearing potenti al are immediately reportable events . Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated βhCG or posi tive pregnancy test i n a female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP , or wi thin 28 days of the subject ’s last dose of IP , are consi dered immediately reportable events. Invest igational product is to be discont inued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portio n of the IP to the Invest igator . The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or positive pregnancy test m ust be reported to Cel gene Drug Safet y immediately by email, phone or facsimile, or other ap propri ate m ethod, using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved equivalent form. The Investigator will fo llow the female subject un til co mpletion of the pregnancy and must notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately about the outcom e of the pregnancy (either norm al or abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy Fo llow-up Report Form or approved equivalent form. If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Invest igator shoul d report the abnorm al outcom e as an AE. If the abnorma l outcom e meets any of the seri ous criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report Form or approved equivalent form . All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of birth should be reported, without regard to causalit y, as SAEs. In addit ion, any infant death after 28 day s that the Invest igator suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be repor ted to Celgene Drug Safet y by facsimile, or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form . 10.5.

Serious adverse events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured within the CRF but will not be transmitted electronically to Celgene Drug Safety. Where required by local legislat ion, the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant initial and fo llow-up informati on about the event. The Investigator must keep copies of all SAE source documents and all correspondence with the IRB/EC. 10.5.1. Safety Queries Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be generated from Celgene Drug Safet y to the site via the CRF . 10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Cel gene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to apremilast based on the Invest igator Brochure.

Note: Theback-up 24 -hour gl obal emergency contact call center shoul d only be used if y ou are not able to reach the Clinical Research Physician(s) or Medical Monitor or designee for emergency calls . 12.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products The blind mu st not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opinio n of the Invest igator, it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. If it is medically imperative to know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be temporarily discont inued if, in the opinio n of the Invest igator, con tinuing IP can negat ively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment. The decisio n to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibilit y of the treating physician, which will not be delayed or refused by the S ponsor. However, the Invest igator may contact the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind to discuss unblinding, mainly in the interest of the subject. The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance wit h the protocol. The Invest igator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the reason for breaking the blind, which should be clearly documented by the Invest igator in the subject’s source documentation. Emergency unblinding shoul d only be perf ormed by the Invest igator through the IRT by using an emergency unblinding personal ident ification number (PIN), and the Investigator should call IRT for unblended dose informat ion."

The study will receive approval from an IRB/EC pri or to commencement. The Invest igator will conduct all a spects of this study in accordance with applicable nat ional, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authori ties. 13.2. Investigator Responsibilities Invest igator responsibilit ies are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulat ions. Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Invest igators who in turn will select their staff. The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting wit h the study are adequately informed about the protocol , amendments, study treatm ents, as well as study -related duti es and funct ions, including obligat ions of confident iality of Celgene informat ion. The Invest igator should maintain a list of Sub -invest igators and other appropriately qualified persons to w hom he or she has delegated si gnificant study -related duti es. The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent form (ICF) and are screened for entry into the study . Subjects who fail screening m ust have the reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents. The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow dire ct access to subject records (e g, medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study -related charts) for source data verification. The Invest igator must ensure timely and accurate complet ion of CRFs and queries. The informat ion contained in the protocol and amendments (with the except ion of the inform ation provi ded by Celgene on public registry websi tes) i s considered Celgene confident ial inform ation. Only information that i s previ ously discl osed by Celgene on a public registry website may be freely disclosed by the Invest igator or its in stitution, or as outlined in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

Subject Information and Info rmed Consent The Investigator must obtain informed consent of a subject and/or a subject’s legal representative prior to any study related procedures. Docum entati on that inform ed consent occurred prior to the study subject’s entry into the study and of the informed consent process should be recorded in the study subject’s source documents including the date. The original ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consent ing the study subject prior to the study subject’s entry into the stud y, must be m aintained in the Invest igator’s study files and a copy given to the study subject. In addi tion, if a protocol is amended and i t impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised. Study subjects participat ing in the study when the am ended protocol is implemented must be re - consented with the revised versio n of the ICF. The revised ICF signed and dated by the study subject and by the person consent ing the study subject m ust be m aintained in the Invest igator’s study files a nd a copy given to the study subject. 13.4. Confidentiality Celgene affi rms the subject's ri ght to protection against invasio n of privacy and to be in compliance wi th ICH and other l ocal regul ations (whichever i s most stringent). Celgene requires the Invest igato r to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives fro m regul atory authori ties, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.

QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE All aspects of the study will be carefully mo nitored by Celgene or i ts authori zed representative for com pliance wi th applicable government regulatio ns wit h respect to current GCP and SOPs . 15.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring pro cedures are performed before, during and after the study . All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Invest igator and the staff at a study initiation visit and/or at an Invest igators’ Meeting. Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a Celgene rep resentati ve will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Invest igator. Monitoring will include on -site visi ts with the Investi gator and his/her staff as well as any appropri ate communicat ions by mail, email, fax, or telephone. During mo nitoring visits, the facilit ies, investigat ional product storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study docum entati on will be inspected/reviewed by the Cel gene representati ve in accordance wit h the Study Moni toring Pl an. Accuracy will be checked by performing source data verificat ion that i s a di rect com parison of the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation. Any result ing discrepancies will b e reviewed wi th the Investi gator and/or his/her staff. Any necessary correcti ons will be made direct ly to the CRFs or via queries by the Invest igator and/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusio n/exclus ion criteria and docum entati on of SAEs and their proper recording be verified. Addit ional monitoring act ivities may be outlined in a study -specific m onitoring pl an. 15.2.

Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt. Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from t he behavior or circumstances. For example, a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferre d (e.g. gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred. Have you made a suicide attempt? Have you done anything to harm yourself? Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died? What did you do? Did you______ as a way to end your l ife? Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____? Were you trying to end your life when you _____? Or did you think it was possible you could have died from_____? Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY intention of killing yourself ( like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, or get something else to happen)?

Yes No □ □ Total # of Attempts ______ YesNo □ □ Interrupted Attempt: When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance) from starting the potentially self -injurious act (if not for that, actual attempt would have occurred). Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting. Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather than an interrupted attempt. Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger. Once they pull the trigger, ev en if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed and taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck but has not yet started to hang -is stopped from doing so.
