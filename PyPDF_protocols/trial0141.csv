6,page_6,"Alliance A221502 7 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 1.0. BACKGROUND 1.1 Study Rationale Definitive assessment of the efficacy of preoperative Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) can only be addressed through a randomized, controlled clinical trial. Performing this protocol with a multicenter design ensures that the results are not unique to a narrow population or center. We plan to o btain definitive evidence for the effectiveness of a short preoperative PR protocol on the recovery from a curat ive surgical resection in patients with non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 1.2 Significance and Innovation of this Study Of all cancers in men and women, lung cancer is the number one killer in the United S tates. With 80% of those cases comprised of NSCLC, complete surgical resection is currently the only curative treatment. However, many patients with resectable lung cancer have COPD, which increases their risk of postoperative complications and their likel ihood of being considered “inoperable.” It is estimated that 80% of patients with lung cancer have COPD, and about one-fourth have severe COPD 1. While the presence of moderate or severe COPD may not absolutely contraindicate surgery, the increased morbidit y and mortality associated with lung cancer treatment highlights the need for new preoperative interventions to improve clinical outcomes. There is no intervention that can decrease the morbidity of lung cancer resection in patients emotionally frail or with poor lung function 2, 3. Modifying the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications is not simple in patients with severe or clinically significant COPD. While comprehensive pharmacologic treatment is warranted, no evidence suggests that any pharmacol ogic intervention reduces perioperative risk. Pre-operative PR is one of the few proposed interventions in the literature that has been suggested to reduce the risk of post - operative complications . The role of smoking cessation as a pre- operative interven tion is not clear . Psychological distress is very prevalent in COPD and adds more risk to having a post -operative complication. Pulmonary Rehabilitation and stress reduction have been recommended in the last decade to decrease operative risk. PR as a preoperative intervention has been repeatedly recommended in patients with poor lung function undergoing lung cancer resection, 2, 4-8 but existing protocols are not suitable for the preoperative setting and do not fit into the limited window of time availab le between diagnosis and surgical resection of lung cancer. Furthermore, despite recommendations, no randomized or large clinical series have been published to date, testing the effect of the current protocols of PR on post -operative outcome or recovery from surgery. The size of all reports (<25 patients) from centers that have large surgical volumes, and the lack of any randomized studies, have prompted questions regarding the feasibility of standard PR as a preoperative intervention 9,10. Our preliminary work, based on NCI K23CA106544, developed and pilot tested a short PR that was feasible and likely very effective on postoperative outcomes and has become the foundation of this proposal. Our preliminary work also pointed out the clinical limitations of a lengthy 4 - week preoperative PR (standard protocol) as patients and providers do not want to postpone the surgery. Reports over the past decade have consistently shown that quality of life is an independent predictor of overall survival for patients with lung cancer, independent of performance status and other potentially surrogate biomarkers 11-13. In our preliminary work, we defined a feasible protocol of preoperative PR that enhanced the current methods of PR with new components that include: mindfulness during movements to promote patient’s self -efficacy and emotional balance, inspiratory muscle training and slow"
7,page_7,"Alliance A221502 8 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 breathing awareness (mindfulness of the breath through pursed lips breathing). Mindfulness has well known stress reduction properties and impr oves quality of life. Self -efficacy or the confidence in one’s ability to perform a specific behavior or task is critical to a patient’s ability to manage the physical and psychological challenges of cancer treatment. In addition, inspiratory muscle traini ng and slow breathing awareness, not routinely used in PR, have been associated with better post -operative outcomes for thoracic surgery. This innovative preoperative intervention, supported by our preliminary results, may decrease operative morbidity and improve recovery following curative lung cancer resection. The present research team includes Dr. Sloan and colleagues who have repeatedly demonstrated over the past fifteen years a relationship particularly for patients with lung cancer between quality of life and other treatment outcomes including survival 14-16. Furthermore, specifically among patients with advanced lung cancer, a palliative care program that included a behavioral intervention was demonstrated to improve quality of life and survival among NSCLC patients2. Studies showed that a consistent proportion of patients undergoing lung resection exhibit an important postoperative worsening in their QOL and physical activit y 17-19 especially in the first 3 to 6 months after surgery20 and no study to d ate prospectively assessed the trajectory of quality of life or physical activity after lung resection. The latter is particularly relevant in patients with COPD and resectable lung cancer that carries poorer survival and quality of life compared to non-COPD patients. This randomized clinical trial, first of its kind, will likely reveal the benefit of behavioral interventions for patients with lung cancer and COPD facing surgical resection. This could dramatically change how behavioral interventions are u sed in oncology. 1.3 Study Overview This is a study funded by the National Institute of Health. Prospectively, 194 patients will be randomized to either ten sessions of preoperative PR vs . standard care at a number of healthcare centers throughout the Uni ted States. The rationale for the need of this research is the lack of any well proven risk -reducing intervention that may decrease the morbidity of lung cancer resection in patients with COPD or that may improve their quality of life trajectory, a meanin gful outcome in the overall disease progression. The proposed intervention is unique as it combines exercise and behavioral interventions that were pilot tested in a randomized single-blinded controlled design in the proposed population and proved feasible and potentially effective. The aim is to test the effect of the proposed rehabilitation on length of stay, pulmonary complications and quality of life trajectory. 2.0 O BJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective 2.1.1 To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on the length of hospital stay in patients that undergo a lung cancer resection and have COPD compared to a matched control group. Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly reduce the le ngth of hospital stay. 2.2 Secondary objective s 2.2.1 To prospectively determine the effect of 10 sessions of customized preoperative PR on the number of postoperative complications in patients that undergo a lung cancer resection and have COPD compared to a matched control group."

Hypothesis: Ten sessions of customized preoperative PR will significantly and meaningfully (more than the minimal clinically important difference) impro ve quality of life after surgery compared to a control group. 3.0 P ATIENT SELECTION For questions regarding eligibility criteria, see the Study Resources page. Please note that the Study Chair cannot grant waivers to eligibility requirements. 3.1 On-Study Guidelines This clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if patients appropriate for this trial are enrolled. All relevant medical and other considerations should be taken into account when deciding whether this protocol is appropriate for a particular patient. Physicians should consider the risks and benefits of any therapy, and therefore only enroll patients for whom this treatment is appropriate. Physicians should recognize that the following may render the patient inappropriate for this protocol: • Psychiatric illness which would prevent the patient from giving informed consent. 3.2 Eligibility Criteria Use the spaces provided to confirm a patient’s eligibility by indicating Yes or No as appropriate.

The PR will consist of 10 sessions with the interventionist lasting less than 2 hours each. Patients will receive a Participant Manual demonstrating and explaining the rehabilitation process. Patients will also receive a log for recording their efforts and notes for every day until the day of surgery. We will consider 6 sessions as the minimum to be deemed a complete intervention (for analysis purposes). The patients should not be asked to come only 6 times to the clinic. In case of missing sessions, the patient should be encouraged to do the sessions at home, however, they will not be counted as intervention sessions. Using the video recording during Pulmonary Rehabilitation sessions: A video recording of the intervention from start to finish will be provided to all patients in the intervention arm. The recording will be an mp3 file that can be played from any device (e.g., phone, computer). Alternatively a CD that has the breathing practice may be used. Patients may keep the DVD/CD. The DVD should be used during the intervention with the participant. The patient and interventionist should both follow the video. This ensures that the same intervention is being delivered. The video recording should be played in all 10 sessions at the registering site. Following the video recording will add uniformity to the intervention across sites. The interventionist can stop the video recording any time during the session to give instructions or answer questions. Modifications may be made if needed. For e xample, if the patient has shoulder injury and cannot lift arms over head, then the exercise may be modified to accommodate the patient. PR sessions will include the following components: The patient will document in a log that they completed each component of the rehabilitati on. The patients will be asked to return the log to the registering site at the end of their last PR session. 7.1.1 Breathing Awareness (in clinic) : Before and after each session, the patient will do a 3 - minute mindful breathing awareness exercise guided by an audio recording provided either as a CD or mp3 file. We provided also an ultra -short 10 Breath Practice that can be used during the day and at times when there are worsening symptoms (i.e. pain after surgery). 7.1.2 Upper and lower extremity exercise (in clinic) : Strength and stretching exercises (goal of at least 20 minutes per session), treadmill or hallway walking (preferred) with a goal of total 24 minutes per session (not less than 18 minutes). The sites and patients will be provided a DVD that demonstrates the rehabilitation session from start to finish."
17,page_17,"Alliance A221502 18 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 It is acknowledged that it could be “boring to have a recording” or follow a movie every time but that will provide consistency of the intervention across sites. Patients are expected to engage in walking once daily and complete the IMT routine and upper extremity exercises. 7.1.3 I nstructions for Inspiratory Muscle T raining (IMT) performed using the PFlex valve (Philips Healthcare Andover, MA) (in clinic): Patients will be instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully for 2 seconds and exhale normally. Repeat for one minute and rest for 30 seconds for a total of 10 complete cycles (training plus resting time) . Patients are asked to adjust their trainer (there is a selector wit h different levels of effort) to a level of p erceived exertion of “Somewhat Hard to Hard” (11- 13 on the 6- 20 BORG scale) when they breathe through the device. When patient s note perceived exertion less than “Somewhat Hard”, the next IMT setting is increased to achieve the desired effort. The rationale to include routine use of inspiratory muscle training, not recommended as a routine in the current PR guidelines, is based primarily on a recent large randomized study which showed decreased postoperative comp lications. 20-22 The table below lists the exercises that are part of the PR sessions. Exercise Time Description Breathing Awareness 3 Minutes 3 minute breathing practice at start of session Upper Extremity 20 Minutes Neck, Shoulder, Arm Movements Lower Extremity 18-24 Minutes Goal is 4 s ix Minute Walks, but not less than 3 P-Flex 15 Minutes 10 one minute repetitions with 30 second breaks in -between Breathing Awareness 10 Breaths 10 Breath practice at end of session 7.1.4 Practice at home : One-on-one revision of the IMT technique will be completed every session in the lab , and patients will be asked to do 10 repetitions of IMT twice a day when not in the lab , which includes the weekend . Twice a day training is the minimum required. Upper and lower extremity training : Once a day training of one set of ten repetitions of upper extremity exercises, and two 6 minute walks in a safe place in the home is the minimum required. This is a critical step in the process. Patients will be encouraged to practice every day and record their practice into a log that will be reviewed by the interventionist every session. 7.1.5 Goal setting The patients are encouraged to set goals, a post -operative goal and post hospital discharge goal. The patients do not re cord the goals. Post-operative goals will be to do at least one six minute walk, one upper arm series every day while still in the hospital. Patients will also be asked to set a goal to practice the breathing awareness, ten breaths , at least two times a day, particular ly when in pain or stressed. Post hospital discharge goals the same as post -operative goals. 7.2 Control Group Procedure s Patients randomized to the control arm will receive a pedometer to monitor their daily steps and a pamphlet with exercises plus the standard course of care for patients undergoing lung resection"

The local institutional coordinator (not the rehabilitation interventionist) will go over the use of the pedom eter and the exercise materials with the patient. The patients will be asked to keep a log of their pre- operative steps and mail the log to the registering site. The pedometers will be provided to the site prior to enrollment. 8.0 A DVERSE EVENTS We do not anticipate any adverse events related to participation in this study. PR has no reported risks based on 3000 patients with severe COPD in the National Emphysema treatment trial that underwent exercise training in more intensity compare d to the one planned in this study.23 9.0 M EASURES 9.1 Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ): A 20- question inventory assessing the areas of dyspnea, fatigue, emotion, and feelings of mastery. The fatigue, emotion, and mastery subscales ask the patient to rate how often in the last two weeks they have been afflicted with a particular feeling or experience on a scale of 1 to 7, with higher ratings indicating less symptom impairment. The dyspnea subscale gives an additional option of indicating that a particular activity has not been done . 24-27 The CRQ takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. 9.2 MRC: Medical Research Council Dyspnea Score (MRC): A 5 statement questionnaire where the patient selects the answer that most closely describes the level of physical activity that precipitates their shortness of breath. The highest selected statement (more severe) is the score. The MRC Dyspnea Scale takes less than 5 minutes to complete. 9.3 Linear Analog Self- Assessment (LASA): A 5 question inventory measuring well -being on a scale of 1 (as bad as it can be) to 10 (as good as it can be). The LASA takes less than 5 minutes to complete. 10.0 E ND OF INTERVENTION 10.1 Duration of Treatment Patients in the intervention group will be scheduled for 10 sessions of mindful rehabilitation. Six sessions is the minimum requirement. Patients will be followed until 6 months following surgery. 10.2 Managing ineligibl e patients and registered patients who never receive protocol intervention Definition of ineligible patient : A study participant who is registered to the trial but does not meet all of the eligibility criteria is deemed to be ineligible. Follow -up for in eligible patients who continue with protocol treatment Patients who are deemed ineligible after registering may continue protocol intervention, provided the treating physician, study chair, and executive officer agree there are no safety concerns if the patient continues protocol intervention . All scans, tests, and data submission are to continue as if the patient were eligible. Notification of the local IRB may be necessary per local IRB policies."
19,page_19,"Alliance A221502 20 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 Follow -up for ineligible patients who discontinue protocol treatment For patients who are deemed ineligible after registering to the trial, who start treatment, but then discontinue study treatment, the same data submission requirements are to be followed as for those patients who are eligible and who discontinue study treatment. Follow -up for patients who are registered, but who never start study treatment If surgery is cancelled after registration, the participant will be considered a screen failure. For all study participants who are registered to the trial but who never receive study intervention (regardless of eligibility), baseline and off -treatment notice data submission is required. See the Data Submission Schedule accompanying the All Forms Packet. 11.0 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 11.1 Study Overview Prospec tively, 19 4 patients will be randomized to either ten sessions of preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation vs. standard care at a number of h ealthcare centers throughout the United States. 11.2 Sample Size, Accrual Time, and Study Duration 11.2.1 Sample Size A total of 194 patients (97 in each group) will be accrued to this study. This sample size includes a 10% adjustment to account for attrition and will provide at least 80% power for testing each aim of the study. Based on estimates from the pilot study, this sample size will provide 80% power to detect a 25% differ ence in complication rates, a 3 -day dif ference in chest tube days, 3 day difference in length of stay, and a half standard deviation difference in QOL endpoints. 11.2.2 Accrual Rate and Accrual Duration This study will be open for 36 months. We e xpect to close the study to accrual at month 30 to allow time for statistical analysis and publication. About 7 patients a month need to be recruited to meet the 30 month proposed time line. 11.2.3 Primary Endpoint Completion Date for ClinicalTrials.gov Reporting For purposes of ClinicalTrials.gov reporting, the Primary Endpoint Completion Date (PECD) for this study is the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 6 months. 11.3 Statistical Design and Analysis for the Primary Endpoint 11.3.1 Primary Endpoint End point that will address AIM 1: hospital length of stay. The coordinator at each site will be responsible for sending complete de -identified hospital records from each patient to Dr. Benzo’s staff, where a nurse blinded to the study arm will abstract the main outcome (lengt h of stay and postoperative complications). See Section 6.3. The primary endpoint will be assessed at Dr. Benzo’s office (Mayo Clinic) with the complete admission hospital records in order to extract the length of stay. The records will be mailed from the sites to in a pre-stamped envelope. See Section 6.3. 11.3.2 Analysis Plan"
20,page_20,"Alliance A221502 21 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 Differences in length of stay between arms will be tested using a two-sample, two -sided t - test. Wilcoxon nonparametric testing will be used for analyzing continuous outcomes that are skewed and not approximately normally distributed. Fisher’s exact tests will be used to test for differences in categorical variables between arms. All tests will be two -sided with a 0.05 significance level. Linear models will be created t o test the effects of treatment after adjusting for the baseline characteristics of age, gender, and lung function. 11.4 Supplementary Analysis Plans 11.4.1 Secondary Endpoints End points that will a ddress AIM 2 (baseline and at 3 and 6 months after hospi tal discharge): Post-Operative Pulmonary Complications: The following events will be considered post- operative pulmonary complications: pneumonia (new infiltrate + either fever (>38.5 C) and white cell count >11,000 or fever and purulent secretions), seve re atelectasis (requiring bronchoscopy), prolonged chest tubes (>6 days), and respiratory failure (intubation or prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hours). These outcomes will be obtained by chart review by a nurse trained in the abstraction of the des ired outcomes from the medical records and blinded to treatment assignment. Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) (four domains: dyspnea, fatigue, emotional function and mastery). This instrument will be the primary tool to assess QoL given that it was specifically designed for COPD. Specifically, the CRQ represent s one of the most well - known, widely- applied, and psychometrically -sound patient reported outcomes for use in clinical trials involving patients with COPD. The CRQ has been validated and ha s demonstrated a reliable quality of life measures for patients with chronic airflow limitations . .A 0.5 point will be considered significant and was considered in the sample size calculation as that difference as is the well -established MCID (minimally cl inically important difference) for the instrument. Analysis for the QOL outcomes will be identical to that for the primary endpoint. We include the scores from the dyspnea questionnaire under the generic umbrella term as a domain of QOL. LASA (single -item numerical analogue quality of life Questionnaire) individual QOL domain scores. All of these questionnaires have been validated previously for lung cancer patient populations and for assessment of patient -reported outcomes in similar trials. LASA items have been validated as general measures of global QOL dimensional constructs in numerous settings and have been constructed and validated at Mayo Clinic for use in cancer patients. These single- item assessments have become the most used assessment s in all NCI- sponsored cancer control studies.28 11.4.2 Secondary Analysis Longitudinal analysis for the relationship between QOL and the intervention will be handled by repeated measures analysis of variance modeling and multiple regressions. Finally, a logistic regression model will be used to identify which variables are most closely associated with the dependent variable of patients who experience either clinically significant deficits in QOL (one regression model). The modeling processes will include the afor ementioned covariates to control for spurious correlations."

The Alliance is made up of cancer doctors, health professionals, and laboratory researchers, whose goal is to develop better treatments for cancer, to prevent cancer, to reduce side effects from cancer, and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients. What is the usual approach to preparing for lung cancer surgery? You are being asked to take part in this study because you have or are suspected of having non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and your doctor is recommending surgery. Lung cancer surgery for people with COPD can cause complications such as pneumonia and prolonged hospital stays. Asking patients to quit smoking is the usual approach to prepare patients for lung cancer surgery. What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study? If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example: • You may choose to not do anything prior to surgery • You may choose to take part in a different study, if one is available Why is this study being done? You will have surgery to remove your lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to test whether a breathing exercise program before lung resection is helpful on the recovery from surgery in patients with NSCLC and COPD. The effects of the pulmonary rehabilitation will be compared to usual approach. There will be about 194 people taking part in this study."
25,page_25,"Alliance A221502 26 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 What are the study groups? This study has two study groups. • Group 1 will participate in ten pulmonary rehabilitation sessions at the clinic with additional exercises to be done at home. • Group 2 will receive a pedometer and exercise routine to use at home along with usual care A computer will by chance assign you to treatment groups in the study. This is called randomization. This is done by chance because no one knows if one study group is better or worse than the others. Before Surgery: Group 1: If you are in this group, you will receive ten sessions of pulmonary rehabilitation in clinic lasting a little less than two hours per session. You will be asked to complete a log of your activities during the pulmonary rehabilitation. Pulmonary rehabilitation will include the following components: • Upper and lower extremity (arms and legs) exercises • Inspiratory muscle training , which is breathing through a device to strengthen the breathing muscles • Slow breathing training using a CD or mp3 file You will also be asked to complete 3 brief questionnaires related to your health. The questionnaires should take about 20 minutes to complete. If you experience any emotional discomfort when completing the questionnaires, you may choose not to complete them. You should tell your doctor if you are having any physical or psychological symptoms such as extreme sadness or physical pain related to your treatment. Group 2: If you are in this group, you will be asked to complete brief questionnaires related to your health. The questionnaires take about 20 minutes to complete. You will also receive a pedometer to track your steps and a booklet demonst rating exercises for people who have undergone a lung surgery. You will be asked to com plete a log of your activities during the two weeks prior to your surgery."
26,page_26,"Alliance A221502 27 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 After Surgery: Group 1 and Group 2 : You will be asked to complete brief questionnaires related to your physical activity and health after surgery, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The questionnaires take about 20 minutes to complete. Another way to find out what will happen to you during this study is to read the chart below. Start reading at the left side and read across to the right, following the lines and arrows. Pulmo nary Rehabilitation : 10 sessions in the clinic over two weeks You agree to take part in the study Complete questionnaires after 3 and 6 months Randomize Surgery Usual care plus pedometer/exercise routine How long will I be in this study? You will participate either in the pulmonary rehabilitation or usual care for two weeks before your surgery. After your surgery, you will participate in this study for about 6 months. What possible risks can I expect from taking part in this study? If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that: • You may lose time at work or home and spend more time in the hospital or doctor’s office than usual • You may be asked sensitive or private questions which you normally do not discuss. You may choose not to answer any questions that make you feel uncomfortable. Here are important points about side effects: • The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side effects. • Some side effects may g o away soon, some may last a long time, or some may never go away. Tell the study doctor if you notice or feel anything different so they can see if you are having a side effect. The study doctor may be able to treat some side effects. • While unlikely, you may experience muscle or joint pain due to increased exercise. • There is the risk of developing cardiac ischemia (chest pain) due to not enough oxygen going to the heart during exercise. What possible benefits can I expect from taking part in this stud y? This study may not make your health better. By educating you on healthy behavior and promoting a more active lifestyle, the study team hopes you will see improvement in your health no matter the group to which are assigned. This study will help researchers learn things that will help people in the future."
27,page_27,"Alliance A221502 28 NCI Version Date 7/28/2017 Update #3 Can I stop taking part in this study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. If you decide to stop for any reason, it is important to let the study doctor know as soon as possible so you can stop safely. If you stop, you can decide whether or not to let the study doctor continue to provide your medical information to the organization running the study. The study doctor will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study. The study doctor may take you out of the study: • If your health changes and the study is no longer in your best interest • If new information becomes available • If you do not follow the study rules • If the study is stopped by the sponsor, IRB or FDA. What are my rights in this study? Taking part in this study is your choice. No matter what decision you make, and even if your decision changes, there will be no penalty to you. You will not lose medical care or any legal rights.
