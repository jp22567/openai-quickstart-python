Pharmacokinetic Endpoint: The pharmacokinetics of the alpha -dihydrotetrabenazine (α -HTBZ) and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (β-HTBZ) metabolites of TEV- 50717 will be explored based on sparse sampling (2 samples) at week 8. General Study Design :This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 8 -week treatment study in which patients with tics associated with TS will be invited to participate. Patients will be randomized to low- dose TEV -50717, high- dose TEV -50717, or placebo (1:1:1). The target dose for each patient receiving TEV -50717 will be based on the group to which they are randomized, body weight at baseline, and cy tochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if th ey are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genot ype at baseline . CYP2D6 status will be used by Interactive Response Technology ( IRT)for randomization into the study . Prescreening perio d (up to 3 months before baseline): For patients who require discontinuation of certain prohibited concomitant medications 3 months before baseline (depot neuroleptics, botulinum toxin, or tetrabenazine), informed consent/ assent , depending on the child’s a ge, as appropriate, should be obtained prior to discontinuing the prohibited medication. Screening period (up to 31 days): After informed consent/ assent, depending on the child’s age, as appropriate , is obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and ps ychiatric standpoint will undergo a screening evaluation, including medical history , phy sical and neurological examination, laboratory testing, and 12-lead ECG, along with rating scales to assess s everit y, frequency , and impairment of tics and comorbid TS sy mptoms and behavioral status. The Mini International Neurops ychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid), is a short questionnaire (largel y yes/no questions) to screen for clinically significant underly ing ps ychiatric illness that may affect the subject’s eligibility . The assessment will focus on detecting major depression, mania/h ypomania, obsessive/compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, attention deficit hy peractivity and conduct disorders, and ps ychotic disorders. At the discretion of the investigator, the screening visit may be divided into 2 visits to reduce the burden on patients. If the screening visit is divided into 2 visits, the blood sample should be obtained during the first of the 2 visits. Patients will return to the clinic on day 1 for baseline procedures and to re- confirm eligibility .Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the status of the patient regarding eligibility for the study . (Not e: Details of rescreening must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and/or Clinical Surveillance and Training [CST] team.) YGTSS Rater Certification: All investigators and sub-investigators who will be administering the YGTSS from screening th rough the end of study visit must undergo and pass a Rater Certification Program which will be provided separatel y from this protocol. Every effort must be made to ensure that the same certified rater administers the YGTSS to a specific patient at all visits, especially at the baseline and week 8/ early termination visits. However, if due to"
14,page_14,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 14unforeseen circumstances the same rater is absolutely unavailable to complete a visit rating, the YGTSS can be administered only by another certified individual from that study site. Treatment period (8 weeks): Patients who continue to remain eligible for participation in the study will be randomized at the baseline visit (day 1) and will receive blinded IMP to begin that same day (day 1)with food . Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empt y stomach. Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact regularl y with the clinical research staff, either b y telephone contact or clinic visit to assure adherence with study procedures a nd to evaluate safet y and efficacy. To this end, clinic visits will be performed at weeks 2, 4, and 8 after baseline, in order to evaluate safet y; assess tic severity with the YGTSS, TS-CGI, TS-PGII, and the C&A- GTS -QOL ; and perform safet y rating scales to augment adverse event reporting, concomitant medication usage, clinical laboratory examination, and 12 -lead ECGs. Telephone contacts will occur at the end of weeks 1, 3, 6 , and 7. As this is a fixed- dose study , patients will undergo dose escalation (ie, forced titration) to their target dose over the first 4 weeks of treatment. If a patient experiences depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxiety, akathisia, p arkinsonism, orsomnolence , or any other adverse event that interfere swith daily activity , or any adverse event that is related to IMP, a single dose reduction is permitted. The investigator must discuss any further dose adjustments (eg, holding the dose or doses) with the medical monitor. In case of such an adverse event, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . If a determination is made that a dose reduction or suspension is required, the medical monitor must be contacted. All available information, including the patient and caregive r/adult reports of adverse events, the clinical assessment of safety by the investigator, and information from rating scales should be incorporated in the decision. This reduced dose will become the patient’s dose for the remainder of the stud y. Patients w ill return to the clinic at week 8 for the final on- treatment assessment of safet y and efficacy . At this visit, patients will undergo a complete evaluation, including performance of all efficacy measures, including assessment of tic severity with the YGTSS ; and complete safety testing, including ph ysical and neurological examination, safet y laboratory testing, 12 -lead ECG, and all rating scales. In addition, patients will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling at week 8, at which time 2 pharmacokinetic specimens will be obtained 2 to 3 hours apart. Prior to the clinic visit on week 8, patients will be reminded to record in their diary the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose of study medication before the week 8 visit. The site will docume nt the date and time of the sample collection. Follow -up: All patients will discontinue IMPat the week 8 visit and will return 1 week later for evaluation of safet y and tic reduction (week 9). Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin par ticipation in an open -label safet y extension study of TEV -50717 (Study TV50717- CNS -30047). For this study , the follow-up period is defined as 1 week of washout for patients who will participate in the open -label safet y extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047 and 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP (1week after the end of the washout period) for patients who will not roll over into the open -label safety extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047. Patients not participating in the open -label safety extension study for TEV -50717 will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 1 week after the end of the treatment period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP)."

Patients who will not participate in the extension study may begin/resume tic therap y medication after the first week of the washout period. Brief S ummar y of Study D esign for the Trial R egistry(s): Standard placebo -controlled, double -blind study design (TEV -50717 [low dose and high dose] vs.placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio) was chosen to determine whether IMP treatment results in a statistically significant effect on the tics in patients with TS. Method of Randomiza tion and Blinding: Patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with TEV -50717 (low dose, high dose) or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio using an IRT based on their baseline weight and CYP impairment status. The patients will be stratified into2 age groups (6-to 11 -years and 12- to 16 -years).The sponsor will monitor enrollment in age strata to ensure there is adequate representation in each stratum. Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the stud y. In ad dition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the I RT vendor and the bioanal ytical sample analysis vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP identity until the database has been locked for anal ysis and the t reatment assignments are revealed. However, if a prioritized sample anal ysis is needed, bioanaly tical personnel may be unblinded. After unblinding of this study , the study site may remain blinded to patient treatment assignments until completion of the safety extension S tudy TV50717 -CNS -30047.

Patient has a positive urine drug screen test result or is unable to refrain from substance abuse throughout the study . Statistical Considerations Sample Size Rationale: It is estimated that approximately 50 patients per arm will enable a power of at least 90% to detect a beneficial standardized effect of 68% or more when the TEV -50717 arm is compared to placebo (difference of 6. 5 in the change from baseline to week 8 in TTS, assuming a standard deviation of 9.5 in each arm) in a 2- sided t ype I error rate of 5% after accounting for potential dropouts. Analysis of Primary Endpoint : The primary efficacy endp oint for this study is the change in the TTS of the YGTSS from baseline to week 8 between high-dose TEV -50717 -treated and placebo- treated patients. The primary anal ysis will be a mixed -model repeated -measures model with the change in the TTS as the depende nt variable. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, week (3 levels: weeks 2, 4, and 8), and the treatment group- by-week interaction. The baseline TTS , region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 y ears, 12 to 16 years)will be included as covariates. The unstructured covariance matrix for repeated observations within patients will be used. The least squares means of the change in TTS from baseline at week 8 will be compared between the high -dose treatment arm and the pla cebo arm using a 2 -sided test at the alpha =0.05 level of significance. In addition, actual values and changes in the TTS from baseline to each visit will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints : Ahierarchical (fix ed-sequence) testing approach will be used for the anal ysis of the key secondary endpoints. I f an endpoint isnot statistically significant, confirmatory hypothesis testing will not be carried out on the remaining h ypotheses, and remaining h ypotheses will beconsidered exploratory rather than confirmatory . The following analy ses of key secondary endpoints will be conducted:"
20,page_20,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 201.The change from baseline to week 8 in TS -CGI will be analy zed using a similar model as the primary analy sis; however, instead of change in YGTSS TTS as the dependent variable and baseline YGTSS TTS as a covariate, the corresponding TS -CGI values will be used. The comparison between high-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 2.Using the same model as for the primary anal ysis, the comparison between the change in the TTS of the YGTSS from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 3.Using the same model as described in endpoint #1 above for TS -CGI, the comparison between the change in the TS -CGI values from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 4.The change from baseline to week 8 in TS -PGII will be anal yzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel row mean scor e test with modified ridit scoring controlling for age group . The comparison between high- dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 5.Using the same model as described in endpoint #4 above for TS -PGII, the comparison between the change in the TS -PGII values from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 6.The change from baseline to week 8 in C&A -GTS -QOL ADL subscale will be anal yzed using a similar model as the primary analy sis; however, instead of change in YGTSS TTS as the depend ent variable and baseline YGTSS TTS as a covariate, the corresponding C&A-GTS -QOL ADL subscale values will be used. The comparison between high- dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 7.Using the same model as described in endpoint #6 above for C&A -GTS -QOL ADL subscale , the comparison between the change in the C&A -GTS -QOL ADL subscale scores from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested.

21,page_21,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 21 Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity: The hierarchical testing method will be used to maintain the experiment- wise ty pe I error of 5% level for the primary and key secondary analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint will first be tested at the 5% t ype I error level. If the p-value of the primary analy sis is ≤0.05, the secondary hypotheses will be tested in the order listed for the anal ysis of key secondary endpoints until either an anal ysis produces a p- value >0.05 or all anal yses result in a p- value ≤0.05. Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Endpoint: Samples collected for pharmacokinetic analysis will be quantified for α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolite plasma concentrations and will be pooled with previous data and analy zed using population pharmacokinetic techniques. Anal ysis methods will be detailed in a s eparate population pharmacokinetic analysis plan. Exploratory pharmacokinetic /pharmacody namic (PD) anal ysis may be performed on PD/safet y endpoints. Safety Analyses: All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. E ach patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or sy stem organ class category for the anal yses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events, adverse events determined b y the investigator to be related to study treatment, serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the study . Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented. Observed v alues and changes from baseline in laboratory results and vital signs will be summarized descriptively. Observed values in ECG parameters will be summarized, and counts and percentages of abnormal findings will be presented. In addition, the number and pe rcentage of patients with on-treatment QTcF values >450, >480, or >500 msec and change from baseline >30 or >60 msec will be presented. The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. Concomitant med ications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with IMP."

Introduction Tourette s yndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by multiple motor and phonic tics that frequently co -occurs with a variety of behavioral and ps ychiatric problems (Jankovic 2001, Jankovic and Kurlan 2011). Studies have suggested that the prevalence estimates of TS among children vary widel y from 0.4% to 5% in community samples (Bitsko et al 2014). Tics are classified as either simple or complex ; simple motor tics include eye blinks, shoulder shrugs, whi le simple vocal tics include grunting, coughing, and sniffing. Complex motor tics include touching/tapping and walking in patterns, while complex vocal tics include echolalia (repeating another’s speech) and coprolalia (shouting obscenities or profanities) (Jankovic 2001, Shaw and Coffey 2014 ). TS was thought to be a ps ychogenic disorder until improvement with neuroleptics was first observed in the 1960s, leading to the theory of central dopaminerg ic hyperactivity as a possible mechanism of tics associated with TS. When the symptoms impair function, most phy sicians utilize alpha adrenergic drugs (guanfacine and clonidine), ty pical neuroleptics (haloperidol, pimozide, and fluphenazine), or aty pical neuroleptics (olanzapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole) to control tics ( Gilbert and Jankovic 2014 , Wijemanne et al 2014 ). In the United States of America (USA), haloperidol and pimozide are approved for the treatment of tics associated with TS, while aripiprazole carries a broader indication of “for the treatment of TS”. Neuroleptics have the potential for serious adverse effects, including tardive dyskinesia (TD), which ty pically manifests as an irreversible orofacial stereot ypy, and other forms of hyperkinetic movement disorder ( Waln and Jankovic 2013 ). Up to 25% of adults chronically treated with dopamine receptor antagonists (neuroleptics; including the so- called “ atypical” neuroleptics, such as aripiprazole) eventually develop TD ( Jankovic 1995 , Pasricha et al 2006 , Peña et al 2011 ). Although elderl y individuals, especially women, are particularl y susceptible to developing TD, this iatrogenic condition may also rarel y occur in children ( Mejia and Jankovic 2010). Tetrabenazine, which depletes dopamine pres ynaptically, has been shown to be effectiv e in treating the tics associated with TS ( Jain et al 2006, Jankovic 2015 , Jankovic and Beach 1997, Kenney et al 2007, Paleacu et al 2004 , Porta et al 2008 ), but has not been documented to cause TD in clinical use. While generally effective in reducing the tics of TS, tetrabenazine is associated with frequent adverse events, inclu ding somnolence, nausea, depression, insomnia, and parkinsonism, that may limit its utility . Moreover, tetrabenazine is an immediate -release formulation with the following limitations: (1) adverse events of tetrabenazine, such as somnolence, akathisia, and anxiety , are often associated with peak concentration after dosing; (2) the active metabolites have short half-lives, with the attendant requirement to dose the immediate -release formulation frequentl y; and (3) the active metabolites alpha- dihydrotetraben azine (α -HTBZ) and beta-dihydrotetrabenazine (β -HTBZ) are either primarily (α) or exclusively (β) metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Poly morphisms in the CYP2D6 gene necessitate genoty ping to prevent poor metabolizers from experiencing significan tly greater exposure to the active drug moiety than extensive metabolizers ( Mehanna et al 2013 ). To address the limitations of commercial tetrabenazine ( XENAZINE®), Auspex, a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc, developed deu tetrabenazine (referred to"

TEV -50717 has been shown to reduce plasma fluctuation and dosing frequency and thus has the potential to improve overall tolerability as compared to that of tetrabenazine. Data in patients receiving TEV -50717 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD) demonstrate a favorable safet y profile with low rates of neurops ychiatric adverse event s. In TS patients with troublesome motor and phonic tics, preliminary efficacy and safet y data for TEV -50717 have been generated in an open -label, Phase 1b pilot study (Study SD-809-C- 17). Results of this study are summarized in Section 1.3.2.2 and support further development of TEV -50717 for treatment of tics associated with TS. TEV -50717 was approved for the treatment of chorea asso ciated with HD and for the treatment of TD on 03 April 2017 and 30 August 2017, respectivel y. The purpose of the study is to determine whether TEV -50717 is effective in the treatment of tics associated with TS in male and female patients between 6 and 16 years of age . 1.2. Name and Description of Investi gational Product TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine), the investigational medicinal product (IMP), is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor with the chemical name (RR, SS) -1,3,4,6,7,11b- hexahy dro-9, 10- di(methoxy -d3)-3-(2-methy lpropy l)-2H-benzo[a]quinolizin -2-one. TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 40 -count tablets per dose strength per blister pack . 1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetic s, and toxicology studiesand clinical studies are provided in the following sections . More detailed information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). 1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies The key nonclinical study findings are provided below, with details available in the IB. 1.3.1.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology TEV -50717 is a selectively deuterium -substituted VMAT2 inhibitor structurally related to tetrabenazine. The metabolites formed from TEV -50717 (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) are potent inhibitors of VMAT2 binding, with K ivalues of 3.8 and 22 nM, respectively, that are similar to previously reported values of their corresponding non -deuterated forms ( Scherman et al 1988 ). Off-target binding occurs ata similar extent with deuterated and non -deuterated α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine in male rats at doses resulting in similar sy stemic exposure to the t est articles (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) produced similar, expected, exaggerated central nervous s ystem pharmacological effects. In particular, the adverse event of cataleps y, a known response in rats to drugs which reduce central nervous s ystem dopamine concentra tions (Fuenmay or and Vogt 1979), was similar in magnitude after TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine administration."
37,page_37,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 371.3.1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism In human liver S9, the metabolite profile of TEV -50717 overlapped wi th that of tetrabenazine. Ina clinical comparative human [14C]-absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and mass -balance study , the approximately 22metabolites of TEV -50717 were also metabolites of tetrabenazine. Thus, previous clinical experi ence with tetrabenazine provides predictive information about the safety of TEV -50717 and its metabolites. Tetrabenazine, α -HTBZ, and β -HTBZ, and b y extension, their deuterated forms, do not inhibit or induce cy tochrome P450 ( CYP) isoenzy mes at clinically relevant concentrations ( XENAZINE Prescribing Information 2015 ). M1, a minor metabolite that may circulate in greater concentrations as a metabolite of TEV -50717 as compared to tetrabenazine, is neither an inhibitor of major CYP isozy mes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes. M4, a major metabolite of tetrabenazine and TEV -50717 is neither an inhibitor of major CYP isozy mes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes. 1.3.1.3. Toxicology General and Reproductive Adult Toxic ology : Oral administration of TEV -50717 in rats reduced body weight gain, increased mammary hyperplasia, and produced estrous cyclechanges, all of which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar s ystemic exposures to test articles and met abolites. Mammary and estrus effects are likely consequences of reduced central dopamine and subsequent increased prolactin, consistent with information in the XENAZINE (tetrabenazine) label. Oral administration of TEV -50717 in pregnant rats did not produc e test article -related embry ofetal toxicities, even at doses that led to reduced body weight gain in dams. Oral administration of metabolite M1 to pregnant rats from gestational day s6 to 17 produced no test article -related maternal or fetal toxicities. Genetic Toxicology : TEV -50717 and its α-HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites were negative in invitro studies for mutagenicity (bacterial reverse mutation, or the Ames test) and for chromosomal structural aberrations in human peripheral blood ly mphocy tes. Oral doses of TEV -50717 were negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone marrow of treated mice. Juvenile Toxicology : The effects of TEV -50717 on juvenile development was assessed in male and female rats with oral dosing from weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21) to PND 71, similar to human dosing from Year 2 through earl y adolescence and overlapping with TEV -50717 oral dosing in a general adult toxicology study . The effects of M1 was assessed in male and female juvenile rats from PND 25 to PND 70 with a recovery phas e and postdosing reproductive assessment. TEV -50717 produced no test -article -related effects on learning and memory functions, on histopathology assessments, on reproductive capacity (male and female fertility , estrus cy clicit y), or on intrauterine surviv al of embry os from matings during recovery from test article administration. Adversely reduced body weight gain and adverse clinical observation of tremors and in- cage h yperactivity were all noted in previous studies with adult rats; these effects have not predicted adult clinical intolerance to TEV -50717. The highest dose level of M1 (50 mg/kg/day ) produced no test article -related toxicities (clinical observations, changes in body weight gain, clinical pathology , histopathology , ophthalmology, and performa nce in learning and memory tests)."
38,page_38,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 38The NOAEL (no- observed -adverse- effect level) for toxicities in juvenile rats is lower than that in adults; however, the total (α+β) -HTBZ exposure multiples or safety margins comparing rat to humans at the adult and juvenile age categories are similar. The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by 2 factors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article administration in the juvenile rat toxicol ogy study. Second, the clinical significance of tremors and reduced bod y weight gain in rats dosed with TEV -50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients. While hy poactivity in rats has the potent ial to relate to clinical observations of somnolence, this adverse effect is controlled with dose reduction. In clinical comparison, the adverse event profile of tetrabenazine in adult patients is qualitatively similar to patients from approximately 22 mon ths to 18 y ears of age (Jainet al 2006 , Kenney et al 2007, Porta et al 2008 ). 1.3.2. Clinical Studies The clinical development plan for TEV -50717 to date includes: 1 completed Phase 3pivotal study for the treatment of chorea associated with HD 1completed Phase 3 long -term safety study in patients with HD 2completed Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studiesin patients with TD 1 completed Phase 1b study in patients with TS Further details may be found in the IB. 1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies Seven Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in healthy adult subjects. I n addition, sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was included in the Phase 3 studies with HD and TD patie nts where a population pharmacokinetic analyses including these data have been performed to extensively evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic- pharmacod ynamic relationship of TEV -50717. A summary of the clinical pharmacology findings is pro vided in the IB. Pharmacometric anal yses of the active metabolites of TEV -50717 based on the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology in healthy adult volunteers were performed to support dose selection and pharmacokinetic characterization in a pediatric population. Subsequently , a further pharmacometric anal ysis of active metabolites following administration of TEV -50717 to adolescent TS patients with tics (Study SD- 809-C- 17) was recently completed. The results of these anal yses are described in Section 1.3.2.3."

Pharmacometrics Analysis of TEV -50717 Active Metabolites to Support Dose Selection and Pharmacokinetic Characterization in a Pediatric Population Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the TEV -50717 acti ve metabolites -HTBZ and β-HTBZ has been performed throughout the clinical development program. Based on robust pharmacokinetic sampling data obtained in healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 program, a structural population pharmacokinetic model was develope d to guide dose selection for HD patients with chorea (SD -809- CLN - 076) and subsequently optimized to better describe the absorption/bioconversion profile of -HTBZ and β -HTBZ ( Study SD-809- CLN - 077)."

General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 8 -week treatment study in which patients with tics associated with TS will be invited to participate. Pati ents will be randomized to low -dose TEV -50717, high- dose TEV -50717, or placebo (1:1:1). The target dose for each patient receiving TEV- 50717 will be based on the group to which they are randomized, body weight at baseline, and cy tochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genotype at baseline, which will be used only by IRT for randomization into the study . Prescreening period (up to 3 months before baseline): For patients who require discontinuation of certain prohibited concomitant medications 3 months before baseline ( depot neuroleptics, botulinum toxin, or tetrabenazine ), informed consent /assent , depending on the child’s age, as appropriate, should be obtained prior to discontinuing the prohibited medication. Screening period (up to 31 day s): After informed consent/ assent, depending on the child’s age, as appropriate , is obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and ps ychiatric standpoint will undergo a screening evaluation, including medical history , phy sical and neurological examination, laboratory testing, and 12-lead ECG, along with rating scales to assess s everit y, frequency , and impairment of tics and comorbid TS sy mptoms and behavioral status. The Mini International Neurops ychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents, or MI NI Kid, is a short questionnaire (largel y yes/no questions) to screen for clinic ally significant underlying ps ychiatric illness that may affect the subject’s eligibility . The assessment will focus on detecting major depression, mania/h ypomania, obsessive/compulsive disorder, alcohol and substance abuse, attention deficit hy peractivity and conduct disorders, and ps ychotic disorders. At the discretion of the investigator, the screening visit may be divided into 2 visits to reduce the burden on patients. If the screening visit is divided into 2 visits, the blood sample should be obtained during the first of the 2 visits. Patients will return to the clinic on day 1 for baseline procedures and to re- confirm eligibility .Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the status of the patient regarding eligibility for the study . (Note: Details of rescreening must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and/or Clinical Surveillance and Training [CST] team.) Treatment period (8 weeks): Patients who continue to remain eligible for participation in the study will be randomized at the baseline visit (day 1) and will receive blinded IMP to begin that same day (day 1). Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact regularly with the cli nical research staff, either b y telephone contact or clinic visit to assure adherence with study procedures and to evaluate safet y and efficacy. To this end, clinic visits will be performed at weeks 2, 4, and 8 after baseline to evaluate safety ; assess tic severit y with the YGTSS, TS -CGI, TS-PGII, and the C&A- GTS -QOL ; and perform safety rating scales to augment adverse event reporting, concomitant medication usage, clinical laboratory examination, and 12 -lead ECGs. Telephone contacts will occur at the end of weeks 1, 3, 6 , and 7 ."
45,page_45,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 45As this is a fixed- dose study , patients will undergo dose escalation (ie, forced titration) to their target dose over the first 4weeks of treatment. If a patient experiences depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxiety, akat hisia, parkinsonism, orsomnolence , or any other adverse event that interfere swith daily activity , or any adverse event that is related to IMP, a single dose reduction is permitted. The investigator must discuss any further dose adjustments (eg, holding the dose or doses) with the medical monitor. In case of such an adverse event, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . If it is determined that a dose reduction or suspension is required, the medical monitor must be contacted. All available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse events, the clinical assessment of safet y by the investigator, and information from rating scales should be incorporated in the decision. This reduced dose will become the patient’s dose for the remainder of the study . Patients will return to the clinic at week 8 for the final on- treatment assessment of safet y and efficacy . At this v isit, patients will undergo a complete evaluation, including performance of all efficacy measures ( including assessment of tic severity with the YGTSS ),and complete safet y testing ( including phy sical and neurological examination, safet y laboratory testing , 12-lead ECG, and all rating scales ). In addition, patients will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling at week 8, at which time 2 pharmacokinetic specimens will be obtained 2 to 3 hours apart. Prior to the clinic visit on week 8, patients will be reminded to r ecord in their diary the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose of study medication before the week 8 visit. The site will document the date and time of the sample collection. Follow -up: All patients will discontinue IMPat the week 8 visit and will return 1 week later for evaluation of safet y and tic reduction (week 9). Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin participation in an open -label safet y extension Study TEV -50717 (Study TV50717- CNS -30047). For this study , the follow- up period is defined as 1 week of washout for patients who will participate in the open -label safety extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047 and 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP (1week after the end of the washout period) for patients who will not roll over into the open -label safety extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047. Patients not participating in the open -label safety extension study for TEV -50717 will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 1 week after the end of the treatment pe riod (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). The end of stud y is defined as the date of the week 10 telephone contact with the last participant. Prohibited drugs will remain the same during the washout period for patients who will participate in the open- label extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047. Patients who will not participate in the extension study may begin/resume tic therap y medication after the first week of the washout period. The study duration will be approximately 17 months from January 2018. The study schema tic diagram is presented in Figure 1."

Planned Number of Patients and Countries The number of evaluable patients is planned to be 150. Details on sample size are given in Section 9. The study is planned to be conducted in approximately 10 countries in approximately 55 investigational centers. The study is expected to start in January 2018 and last for approximately 17 months. 3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population Standard placebo -controlled, double -blind study design (TEV -50717 [low dose and high dose] vs placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio) was chosen to determine whether IMP treatment results in a statistically significant effect on tics inpatients with TS. Thepopulation to be studied includes children and adolescents, 6 through 16 y ears of age. Per eligibility criteria, the participants’ tics need to be troublesome and cause distress or impairment based on the assessment of the patient, parent/guardian, and investigator. Based on these criteria, this is a study population in need of treatment . 3.4. Drug Administration IMP will be administered as follows: IMP should be swallowed whole and taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empt y stomach . Dosing will be based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at the baseline visit, as shown in Table 1. The total daily dose, as provided in Table 1, is divided into a twice -daily administration. Two tablets will be taken twice daily starting at day1 per Table 1. Daily doses will be administered twice daily , approximately 8 to 10 hours apart during the day . Depending on the dose and arm assigned, TEV- 50717 tablets and/or placebo tablets will be taken to maintain the blind. A minimum of 6 hours should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose, and it is within 6 hours of their next dose, the missed dose should be skipped. After week 1, dose escalations may not occur more frequently than once every 5days. The dose of IMP will be escalated weekl y during the escalation period, according to Table 1. In the case of an adverse event, t he investigator is permitted to perform a single dose reduction of 6 mg. The investigator must discuss any further dose adjustments (eg, holding the dose or doses) with the medical monitor. During the titration period, the dose of the IMP will be adjusted weekl y according to Table 1.Investigators will be blinded to CYP status, with a dose cap for poor metabolizers prespecified by the IRT. IMP will be packaged in blister packs and provided for patients to take at home (see Section 5.1)."

Investigational Medicinal Products Used in the Study IMP is defined as the test I MPs, reference IMPs, and matching placebo IMP s to the respective test and reference IMPs . 5.1.1. Test Investigational Medicinal Product The investigational product is a matrix formulation and is designed as a tablet to be administered with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach . The IMPis coated with a white poly mer coating to aid in swallowing. TEV -50717 tablets have been manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. TEV -50717 tablets will be supplied as 6 -, 9-, 12 -, 15- , and 18- mg tablets and will be packa ged in blister packs and labeled according to applicable regulatory guidelines. Each b lister pack (40-count tablets per dose strength per b lister pack ) will contain a sufficient supply of drug until the next specified visit/telephone contact, plus overage to account for potential delay s in study visits. Additional details may be found in the IB for TEV -50717. 5.1.1.1. Starting Dose and D ose Levels Two active -dose levels were selected for this study. The target population, children 6 to 16 years of age , inclusive, w ill vary considerabl y in bod y weight. There will also be vary ing impairment of the drug metabolizing enzy me CYP2D6, whether from use of certain concomitant medications that inhibit the enzy me or genetic predisposition to poor metabolism of CYP2D6 substrate s. 5.1.1.2. Dose Modification and Dose Stratification As this is a fixed dose study , patients will undergo dose escalation (ie, forced titration) to their target dose over the first 4 weeks of treatment (seeSection 3.4and Table 1). If a patient experiences depression, suicidal ideation or behavior, anxie ty, akathisia, parkinsonism, or somnolence , or an y other adverse event that interfere s with dail y activity , or any adverse event that is related to IMP, a single dose reduction is permitted . The investigator must discuss any further dose adjustments (eg, holding the dose or doses) with the medical monitor. In case of such an adverse event, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . If a determination is ma de that a dose reduction or suspension is required, the medical monitor must be contacted. All available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse events, the clinical assessment of safety by the investigator, and information from rating scales should be incorporated in the decision. This reduced dose will become the patient’s dose for the remainder of the stud y. 5.1.2. Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product Placebo tablets match TEV- 50717 tablets. The packaging will be the same as described for TEV -50717 above."

Preparation , Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for IMPs 5.2.1. Storage and Security The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained for all IMPs received and an y discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the IMPs. The IMP (TEV -50717 and the placebo) should be stored protected from light, at a controlled room temperature, 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) ; however, storage between 15°C and 20°C (59°F and 68°F ) is acceptable if there is no alternative . The IMP should be stored in a dry, securel y locked, substantially constructed cabinet or enclosure with access limited to authorized staff. Diversion is considered to have occurred when the legal supply chain of prescription analgesic medicinal products is broken, and medicinal products are transferred from a licit to an illicit channel of distribution or use. 5.2.2. Labeling Supplies of I MPs will be labeled according to the current International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice and will include any locall y required statements. I f necessary , labels will be translated into the local language. 5.2.3. Account ability Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, return instructions, and any applicable forms. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs and other study materials from the sponsor are c orrectly received, recorded, handled, and stored safely and properl y in accordance with the local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive IMPs, and only authorized staff at the investigational center may supply or administer IMPs. All I MPs must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the invest igator and authorized staff at the investigational center. The investigator (or designee) will instruct the patient to store the IMP according to the instructions on the label, if applicable; or will give instructions in an appropriate form. The investigat or, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for IMP accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP a nd other study materials received, used, retained, returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for any discrepancies. Empty , partially used, and unused blister packs IMP will be disposed of , as agreed with the sponsor /development partner ."
62,page_62,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 625.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Product s 5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product As body weight and CYP2D6 impairment are known predictors for exposure to the acti ve circulating metabolites of TEV-50717, the “high” and “low” doses will represent a target exposure (area under the plasma concentration -time curve [ AUC ], maximum observed concentration ( Cmax) rather than a fixed milligram amount of drug. The high dose targets a mean (CV%) AUC of approximately 1500 ng ▪hr/mL (60%) and a mean (CV%) C maxof approximately 100 ng/mL (39%). These targets were chosen as they represent exposure in another population (HD patients) receiving up to 48 mg/day that was associated with robust efficacy and favorable tolerability . The low dose group targets a mean (CV%) AUC of approximately 1000 ng▪hr/mL (60%) and a C maxof approximately 80 ng/mL (39%). Based on Phase 3 studies in both HD and TDpatients, exposures associated with an AUC of approximately 1000 ng▪hr/mL are still anticipated to be efficacious. 5.3.2. Justification for Use of Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product A standard placebo -controlled, double -blind study desig n (TEV -50717 [low dose and high dose] vs placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio) was chosen to determine whether IMP treatment results in a statistically significant effect on the tics of patients with TS. As TS is not a progressive neurological disorder, and available treatments are for s ymptomatic control, the use of placebo is justified in a short -term study where safet y is carefully monitored. Moreover, a placebo control is ideal for characterizing the e fficacy and safet y of an experimental agent in a new stud y population . 5.4. Treatment after the End of the Study Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin participation in an open -label safet y extension study of TEV -50717 (Study TV50717- CNS -30047). Patients not participating in the open -label safet y extension study for TEV -50717 will have a follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 1 week after the end of the treatment period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). 5.5. Restrictions Medications prohibited before and/or during the study are described in Section 5.6. While patients receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine, fluox etine, and bupropion at baseline may be enrolled into this study , the removal of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors during treatment is discouraged as this would have an effect on exposure to active circulating drug. If the removal of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is re quired from a clinical perspective, the medical monitor should be contacted so an appropriate change in IMP can be made. The addition of a strong CYP inhibitor is prohibited. The use of quinidine and terbinafine are prohibited (see Appendix H, Table 11). Restrictions in regard to sexual activity and required laboratory values are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria."
63,page_63,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 63As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, reserpine), pa tients should be advised that the concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with TEV -50717 may have additive effects and cause or worsen somnolence. Given the age of the study population, the use of alcohol during this study is prohibited. Patien ts should be advised not to drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until they understand how TEV -50717 affects them. Use of illicit drugs is prohibited from the time of signing of the informed consent /assent form and throughout study participation. Patients may not donate blood from the time of informed consent/assent , while taking the IMP, and for 14 day s after the last dose. 5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication or Therapy Any prior or concomitant medication a patient has had within 3 months before IMP administration and up to the end of stud y, including follow -up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, dose, and start and end dates of the administered medication will be recorded. The sponsor will encode all medication according to the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary (WHO Drug). At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients whether they have taken an y medications (other than IMP), including over -the-counter medications, vitamins , or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the study to notify the investigator if any new medication is prescribed, including over -the-counter medications. An y prescribed medi cation should be reviewed with the investigator. Indication, dosage, and start and end dates should be entered on the CRF. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y) a medication th at is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor. Allowed strong CYP inhibitors at baseline are shown in Appendix H,Table 8. Addition of a strong CYP inhibitor is prohibited. Prohibited antipsy chotic d rugs are listed inAppendix H,Table 9.Prohibited medications that are associated with QTc prolongation are listed in Appendix H,Table 10. Concomitant medication and treatment will be monitored throughout the study . 5.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance until completion of the IMP administration according to the protocol or discontinuation from IMP. A check of compliance with IMP intake will be performed during each visit after the IMP has been dispensed; and IMP accountability records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn from the study .The IEC/IRB should be notified as required b y national and local regulations. Exposure to I MP will be assessed as required."

Temporary Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product Dose Reduction If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is attributed to IMP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse events and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safet y and efficacy by the investigator, and information from rating scales. In the case of an adverse event, the investigator is permitted to perform a single dose reduction of 6 mg. The investigator must discuss any further dose adjustments (eg, holding the dose or doses) with the medical monitor. If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose Suspension Suspension of study medication for up to 1 week, if warranted for patient safet y, is allowed. If the patient restarts stud y medication within 7 day s of suspension, the full dose of TEV-50717 may be resumed without titration. Suspensions of study medication for adverse events must be reviewed with the medical monitor before therapy is restarted .If a subject’s serum potassium or magnesium were tested and found to be below the lower limit of normal and clinically significantl y, the laboratory test s hould be repeated at least once. If the abnormality in the repeated laboratory test is consistent with the prior lab oratory test, the IMP must be suspended. The Medical Monitor must be contacted to determine the appropriate investigation and treatment. TEV -50717 may only be restarted once serum potassium or magnesium have normalized. The reason for a dose reduction or suspension must be clearly documented. If a dose reduction or suspension occurs before a scheduled clinic visit, the clinic visit will be postponed so that efficacy evaluations can be performed at least 5 days after the change . The patients who restart IMP treatment will follow the visit schedule as outlined in Table 2. Patients who withdraw from the study will proceed as described in Section 4.3. 5.9. Randomization and Blinding This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 8 -week -treatment study in which patients with tics associated with TS will be invited to participa te. Patients will be randomized to either TEV -50717 ( low-dose,high-dose)or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT) based on their baseline weight and CYP impairment status. The patients will be stratified into 2 age groups (6 to 11 years and 12to16years). Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study . Patients will be centrally randomly assigned to the treatment groups by means of a computer -generated randomization list after confirmation of all eligibility criteria. The creation of the randomization list will be under the responsibility and oversight of Syneos Health ."
65,page_65,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 65In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with exception of the I RT vendor and the bioanal ytical sample anal ysis vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP identity until the database is locked for anal ysis and t he treatm ent assignment revealed. After unblinding of this study , the study site may remain blinded to patient treatment assignments until completion of the safet y extension Study TV50717- CNS -30047. The randomization list and treatment will be assigned to the rele vant treatment groups through a qualified service provider (ie, via IRT ). The generation of the medication list and management of the IRT s ystem will be done by a qualified service provider under the oversight of Nuvelution TS Pharma , INC (referred to here after as Nuvelution TS Pharma) . The staff member at the investigational center who will dispense the IMPwill not know the treatment given to each patient. 5.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding Patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment wi th TEV -50717 (low dose, high dose) or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio using an IRT based on their baseline weight and CYP impairment status. The patients will be stratified into 2age groups (6- to 11 -years and 12- to 16 - years). The sponsor will monitor enrollment in age strata to ensure there is adequate representation in each stratum. Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study . In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the I RT vendor and the bioanal ytical sample analy sis vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP identity until the database has been locked for anal ysis and the treatment assignments are revealed. However, if a prioritized sample analysis is needed, bioanaly tical personnel may be unblinded. 5.10.1. Maintenance of Randomization Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location within Sy neos Health. At the time of anal ysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Sy neos Health statisti cian assigned to the study will make a request to unblind, and will receive the unblinded codes and unblinded I MP assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant Standard Operating Procedure. 5.10.2. Blinding and Unblinding Blinded pharmacokinetic da ta may be assessed during the stud y. For patients who have pharmacokinetic sample bioanaly sis or data analysis conducted, the individuals responsible for sample bioanal ysis and other responsible personnel will know who received active IMP and who received placebo during the study (of those patients only ). Personnel responsible for bioanal ysis will be provided with the randomization code to facilitate the anal ysis. However, the personnel responsible for bioanaly sis and pharmacokinetic data anal ysis will not have access to clinical safet y and efficacy data, and will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not identify individual patients (ie, a dumm y patient identifier will be linked to the concentration data of an individual patien t). For information about personnel who may be aware of IMP assignments, see Section 5.9. These individuals will not be involved in the conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any adverse events."

Individual randomization codes, indicating the IMP assignment for each randomized pat ient, will be available to the investigator(s) or pharmacist(s) at the investigational center via the Randomization and Trial Supply Management ( RTSM ), both via telephone and internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event before breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards and the patient’s IMP assignment should not be given. Breaking of the randomization code can alway s be performed by the investigational center without prior appro val b y the sponsor. When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the stud y and the event will be recorded on the CRF. However, if a patient is unblinded by mistake, the investigator should discuss with the medical monitor whether or not the p atient should be withdrawn. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented in the investigator’s stud y files and in the patient’s source documentation. Assignment of IMP should not be recorded in an y study documents or sou rce document. In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4 ), Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance ( GPSP )may independentl y request that the blind code be broken (on a case-by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The report will be provided in an unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct of the stud y and anal ysis and reporting of the data. 5.10.3. Data Monitoring Committee During the conduct of this study , an IDMC will review accumulating safet y and efficacy data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the study patients and study conduct issues. The i DMC will be composed of independent physicians with expertise in the relevant therapeutic field and o ther relevant expert s, such as a statistician. The i DMC will receive safet y data periodicall y,which will be presented by masked treatment groups. They will have the right to recommend modification of the study for safet y reasons. iDMC sessions can be ope n or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor may be present, and information is provided and discussed in a blinded fashion. During closed sessions, the only participants are members of the iDMC and the designated unblinded statisticia n (if approved to be present). If there is a request to unblind any individual treatment assignment, a written request from the IDMC (as a committee), signed b y the IDMC chairperson, should be made to the unblinded statistician. The appropriate medical an d operational personnel will be notified but will not receive the unblinded treatment information. An y use of unblinded treatment assignments should be clearly documented and reported to the sponsor at study termination. The IDMC chairperson will communica te with Nuvelution TS Pharma in regard to issues resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study . Nuvelution TS Pharma and Sy neos Health will work closel y with the committee to provide the necessary data for review."

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY Site-administered efficacy scales include YGTSS and , and self -administered efficacy scales include TS-PGII , , and C&A -GTS -QOL . 6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification The primary efficacy measure is the TTS of YGTSS. The YGTSS is administered at screening; baseline; and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9 : Complete assessme nt (Checklist and Severit y Ratings) at screening, baseline, and weeks 4and 8 Severity Rati ngs assessment only at weeks 2 and 9 Input from caregiver/adult is required for all subjects irrespective of age The choice of YGTSS (specificall y the TTS) as a primary efficacy measure is supported by its wide use in clinical practice for the evaluation of sy mptoms associated with TS and its successful use in the Phase 1b Study SD- 809 -C-17 (Section 1.3.2.2). The YGTSS rating scale is a semi -structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency , intensity , complexity , and in terference of motor and phonic tics ( Leckman et al 1989 ). The items pertaining to the tic ratings are scored on 2 subscales: Motor Tics and Vocal Tics. Behaviors are rated on a 6 -point scale. The scale has a look- back period of 1 week. Additionally , the scale assesses the severit y of tics, which includes overall impairment of the patient, and combines motor and visual tic information into a TTS score. A GSS can then be determined by combining the patient’s severit y rating with the TTS. A reference sample is provided in Appendix I. 6.2. Key Secondary Efficacy and Exploratory Measures 6.2.1. Tourette Syndrome –Clinical Global Impression The TS- CGI is administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9. The TS -CGI scale is a 7-point L ikert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the patient’s quality of life. The TS -CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal), 2 (borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme). A reference sample is provided in Appendix N. 6.2.2. Tourette Syndrome -Patient Global Impression of Impact The TS -PGIIis administered at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9. Input from the caregiver/adult ispermitted . The TS -PGIIis a single -item questionnaire that asks the patient to assess the irdegree of impact due to current tics. The TS -PGII uses a 5 -point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall response to therap y. In general, patient- rated global measures of change"

A reference sample is provided in Appendix O. 6.2.3. 6.2.4. Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome – Quality of Life Scale The C&A -GTS -QOL is administered at baseline, week 4, and week 8. Children 13 y ears of age and under may be intervi ewed separately or jointly with the caregive r/adult as appropriate or defined b y the scale . For children over 13 years of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The C&A -GTS -QOL is a 27 -item questionnaire specific to TS patients that asks the patient to assess the extent to which their quality of life is impacted by their s ymptoms. The C&A -GTS - QOL contains 6subscales ( cognitive, coprophenomena, ps ychological, ph ysical, obsessive - compulsive, and ADL ) and uses a 5- point L ikert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Patients will also be asked how satisfied they feel overall with their life at that moment by using a VAS scale between 0 and 100 (Su et al 2017 ). A reference sample is provided in Appendix Q. 6.2.5. 6.2.6."

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study personnel by evaluating: reported adverse event s,clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, phy sical examination findings (including body weight and height measurements), use of concomitant medication s, neurological examination, C -SSRS, and CDI -2. 7.1. Adverse Events 7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can, therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy , or significant worsening of the disease under study ,or of an y concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the IMP, TEV -50717. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse events . Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency ) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre- existing that is intermittently symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during this study should be recorded as an adverse event.) drug interactions event s occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout period of this study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious advers e event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or are considered by the investigator to be clinically signif icant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiv ing study treatment are not considered adverse events .)"
72,page_72,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 727.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events Forrecording of adverse event, the study period is defined for each patient as the time period from signature of the informed consent /assent form t o the end of the follow- up period. For this study , there will be 1 week of washout for patients who will participate in the open- label safet y extension Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 and 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP for patients who will not roll over into t he open -label safet y extension S tudy TV50717- CNS -30047. For subjects who experience an adverse event or serious adverse event after signing a prescreening ICF for Study TV50717 -CNS -30060, the event will be documented in the subject source documents and Ele ctronic Data Capture (EDC) sy stems. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed in addition, and the serious adverse event must be reported immediatel y to the sponsor (Section 7.1.5.3.1 ). If the subject attends the screening visit, the adverse event or serious adverse event identified during the prescreening period will be considered medical h istory . For data entry purposes in EDC, the stop date for the prescreening adverse event or serious adverse event will be the date of the screening visit, and the start date for the associated medical histo ry will be the date of the screening visit. All adverse events that occur d uring the defined study period must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship to the IMP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed and the se rious adverse event must be reported immediately (Section 7.1.5.3.1 ).The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events after the defined period. Serious adverse event s occurring to a patient after the treatment of that patient ha s ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1 . At eac h contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as “Have y ou had any unusual sy mptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe .”All reported or observed signs and sy mptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible . When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be recorded collectively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the serious adverse e vent form. The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved , stabilized ,or returned to baseline ;or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional ; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made. The onset and end dates, duration (in ca se of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF . The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and stu dy procedures, and the severit y and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below. Further details are given in the safet y monitoring plan."

Severity of an Adverse Event The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following: Mild: No limitation of usual activities Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities 7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows: Table 5: The Relationship of an Adverse Event to the IMP Term Definition Clarification No reasonable possibility (not related)This category applies to adverse events that, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administrati on of the IMP. It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is re-administered . Reasonable possibility (related)This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the administration of IMP cannot be ruled out with certainty .The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply: It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. It cannot be reasonab ly explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors ,or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions w hen an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of the IMP, yet a nIMP relationship clearly exists. It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events An additional blood sample for the measurement of IMP concentration should be collected, if possible, from each patient experiencing a serious adverse event leading to discontinuation of IMP at an y time during the study . If study center personnel are unable to obtain a blood sample in a timely fashion, this should be disc ussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the sample still needs to be obtained."
74,page_74,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 74For recording of serious adverse event, the stud y period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the informed consent /assent form to the end of the follow -up period as defined in Section 7.1.2 . Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow -up period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures desc ribed in Section 7.1.5.3.1 . 7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: results in death is life-threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the ev ent Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient andcaregiver/adult signed the informed consent /assent form will not be considered serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the pre -existing condition during the patient’s participation in this study results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) is a congenital anomal y/birth defect an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergi c bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical e vent All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as all of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event: alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) or aspartate aminotransferas e (AST )increase of >3xthe upper limit of normal (ULN) total bilirubin increase of >2x ULN absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substan tialincrease ofalkaline phosphatase [ALP]) An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event."

Expectedness A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safet y information (RSI ) by its specificity , severit y, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the IB. A serious adverse event that is not included in the l isting of adverse r eactions in the RSI by its specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpect ed adverse event. For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the SUSAR applies. 7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study , regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported by the investigator according to the instructions provided on the serious adverse event form . The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively monitor patient s for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the last administration of I MP of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them . The serious adverse e vent fo rm should be sent to the LSO or designee (a CRO in a country without a sponsor L SO)(contact information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section) ; the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s GPSP . The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completel y: study number investigator and investigational center identification patient number onset date and detailed description of adverse event investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility ) Additional information includes: age and sex of patient date of first dose of IMP date and amount of last administered dose of IMP action taken outcome, i f known"

Additional information (f ollow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded b y the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report. Forall countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/ Extensible Markup Language (XML) file to the L SO/CRO for submission to the competent authorities, IEC/IRBs ,and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ens ure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. Blinding will be maintained for all study personnel . Therefore, in case of a SUSAR, only the LSO/CRO will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report. Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event , the process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.2). 7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility If a serious unexpected ad verse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of TEV -50717and the appropriate competent authorities (and I EC/IRB, as appropriate). In addition to notify ing the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate) , other action may be required, including the following : altering existing research by modify ing the protocol discontinuing or suspending the stud y"

Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest No protocol -defined adverse events of special interest were iden tified for this study . 7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from study treatment at an y time at the discr etion of the investigator. If a post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or change from baseline >60 msec is found, the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice and compare the average of the 2 pre-treatment QTcF values (baseline and screening) to the average of the 3 post -baseline QTcF values. The IMP must be stopped for an y confirmed post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline >60 msec. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event , both the adverse event s page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. In addition, a blood sample should be obtained for the measurement of IMP concentrations, if possible. The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of an y patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse event (s). Additional reports must be provided when requested. If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that include adverse event s,the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that, in the opinion of the investigator, is not severe enough to warrant disc ontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event . 7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Bec ause of an Adverse Event If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or treatment has been administered (or bo th), the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must contact the ph ysician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study . 7.2. Psychometric Rating Scales Site-administered safet y scales include the M INI Kid and C -SSRS, and self- administered safet y scales include CDI-2."

Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents Select MINI Kid modules are administered at screening onl y. Children 13 years of age and under may be interviewed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or de fined b y the scale. For children over 13 y ears of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The MINI Kid is a short question naire to be administered b y a trained clinician. The MINI Kid assesses s ymptoms of psy chiatric disorders as outlined in the I nternational Classificat ion of Diseases -10 and the DSM -V™in children 6 to 17 y ears of age b y self -report. For children under 13years old, the patient may be interviewed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined b y the scale, and the caregiver/adult is encouraged to participate when needed. The MINI Kid version 6 is composed of 24 modules overall, and questions are largel y yes-or- no questions. The current study will focus on 8 modules: Major Depressive Episode (Module A), (Hy po) Manic Episode (Module D), OCD (Module J), Alcohol Dependence/Abuse (Module L), Substance Dependence/Abuse (Non- alcohol; Module M), ADHD (Module O), Conduct Disorder (Module P), and Psy chotic Disorders and Mood Disorders with Psy chotic Features (Module R). A reference sample is provided in Appendix I. 7.2.2. Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C-SSRS children’s baseline/screening scale assesses past and current suicidal ideation and behaviors to determine suicide risk and is administered at screening. C -SSRS children’s SL V scale is administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 , and 9. Children 13 y ears of age and under may be interviewed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined b y the scale .For children over 13 y ears of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The C -SSRS is an interview by trained study personnel. Suicidal ideation Patients with a positive C -SSRS suicidal ideation score on either items 1 or 2 or a change on the CDI -2 Parent or Self -Report Profiles consistent with increasing depressive s ymptoms must be 1) discussed with the medical monitor, 2) re- evaluated within 2 to 3 days in a clinic visit, and 3 ) treated according to the investigator’s medical judgment. Consultation with a child and adolescent ps ychiatrist or licensed child/adolescent mental health provider is advised, followed b y close ongoing monitoring. If patients endorse or report a C- SSRS s uicidal ideation level of 3, 4, or 5, subjects will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator and referred for ps ychiatric evaluation. The medical monitor will be immediately consulted. If it is determined by the investigator, after consultation w ith the medical monitor and the consulting psychiatrist, that exposure to the IMP may have contributed to this change in C -SSRS and/or increased depressive sy mptoms, IMP will be immediately discontinued and the patient terminated from the study . In cases w here it is determined that I MP did not contribute to changes in depression or suicidalit y, the investigator will consult with"
79,page_79,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 79the medical monitor, the consulting ps ychiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study . Suicidal behavior Actual attempt: If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is an actual attempt as assessed in the C-SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator, referred for psychiatric evaluation, and terminated from the stud y. Interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or Preparatory Acts or Behavior: If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is interrupted, aborted, or preparatory as assessed in the C -SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator and ref erred for ps ychiatric evaluation. In cases where it is determined in the psychiatric evaluation that I MP did not contribute to changes in suicidal behavior, the investigator will consult with the medical monitor, the consulting ps ychiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study . A reference sample is provided in Appendix K. 7.2.3. Children’s Depression Inventory , Secon d Edition The CDI-2 (Parent and S elf-report P rofiles )is administered at screening; baseline; and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9. As the CDI -2 is designed for children 7 to 17 y ears of age, children 6 years of age at baseline will not complete the s elf-report versio n; the caregiver/adult will complete the parent version. The CDI -2 Self -report is a 28 -item self -report questionnaire assessing depressive sy mptoms in children 7 to 17 y ears of age with basic reading and comprehension skills. In the CDI -2, children are asked to choose 1 of 3 statements that most closely aligns with their feelings in the previous 2weeks. The questionnaire covers both the major and minor sy mptoms of depression as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition ,Text Revision ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). The C DI-2 Parent is a 17 -item questionnaire administered to parents to assess depression- related behaviors observed in their children. In the CDI-2 Parent, parents are asked to rate their child’s behaviors in the past 2 weeks on a 4 -point Likert scale from “not at all” to “much or most of the time”. The questionnaire allows for the division of depressive s ymptoms into functional problems and emotional problems ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). A reference sample is provided in Appendix J. 7.3. Pregnancy Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP. All pregnancies of female patient sparticipating in the study that occur during the study , or within 14 days after the end of the study , are to be reported immediatel y to the individual identified in the Clinical Study Personnel C ontact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the sponsor ( LSO/CRO ) with the completed pregnancy form. The"
80,page_80,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 80process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.1.5.3 ). The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between screening and baseline, provided no IMP was given. All female patient s who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous , elective, or voluntary abortion). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. An y complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be report ed as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. If the pregnancy in the female patient participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event . For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse event . For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form; do not report as an adverse event . 7.4. Medication Error and Special Situation sRelated to the Investigational Medicinal Product s Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol (Appendix C), or as a deviation, in the patients source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a result . The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations: 1.Medication error :Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient ,or consumer. 2.Overdose :Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommende d dose according to the authoriz ed product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied. Any dose of IMP (whether the test IMP or placebo ), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 3.Misuse :Situations where the IMPis intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the author ized product information. 4.Abuse :Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects. 5.Off-label use :Situations where a nIMP is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordanc e with the authoriz ed product information."
81,page_81,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 816.Occupational exposure :Exposure to a nIMP, as a result of one’s professional or non- professional occupation. 7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions which occur in infants following exposure to a medicinal prod uct from breast milk. 7.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically signif icant abnormal and clinically signif icant The clinical significance of the laboratory value will be evaluated by the criteria described in the laboratory manual and by the judgement of the investigator. A laboratory test result that is judged b y the investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded both on the source documentation andthe CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 .An event may include a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by repeat ed testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary or permanent withdrawal ofIMP, or further diagnostic work-up. (Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events.)."

The UDS detect sthe presence of drugs prohibited according to the laboratory manual .If a given parameter cannot be tested using urine, an alternative matrix (eg, serum) may be considered acceptable. The sponsor’s medical expert must be made aware in advance of, and provide approval for, drug screen parameters to which this will apply . A positive result for an y of the above drugs or their metabo lites, without medical explanation, will preclude the patient from enroll ment or continued participation in the study . 7.5.2.3. Cytochrome P450 2D6 Genotyping One 3-mL sample for CYP2D6 genot yping will be collected from all patients in the study at screening. Sample testing results will not be provided to the study team until the study is unblinded. This assessment potentially includes the association anal ysis of the variation in CYP2D6 gene with clinical treatment responses to the IMP(eg, efficacy , pharmacokinetic , tolerability , and safet y features or disease susceptibility and severity features). 7.6.

If a post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or change from baseline >60 msec is found, the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice and compare the average of the 2pre-treatment QTcF values (baseline and screening) to the average of the 3 post -baseline QTcF values. The IM P must be stopped for any confirmed post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline >60 msec. 7.9. Assessment of Suicidality TEV -50717 is considered to be central nervous sy stem (CNS) -active. In addition, there have been some reports of suicidal ideation or behavior as reported in the product label when it has been given to some patients with certain conditions. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical study . Some CNS -active IMPs may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior when given to some patients with certain conditions. Although this I MP or other simil ar medicinal products in this class have not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to this study population, the sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinic al study . The study population being administered TEV -50717 should be monitored appropriatel y and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing TEV -50717 in part icipants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior ; detailed recommendations are provided in Section 7.2.2 . Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior andtreatment -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed during the study using the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale described in Section 7.2.2 . Depression and Suicidality as an Adverse Event Families and caregivers of subjects will be instructed to monitor patients for an y changes in or new onset of depressive symptoms; unusual changes in mood, cognition, or behavior; or onset of and/or changes in suicidal ideation or behavior, and to report such s ymptoms immediately to the study investigator. Telephone contacts and clinic visits also allow opportunities for investigators to assess adverse events."
85,page_85,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment Study TV50717- CNS -30060 85If a relevant change in status is identified, patients will be seen immediately for an unscheduled visit by the study investigator and discussed with the medical monitor. The patient will be referred for further ps ychiatric evaluation if t here is any suspected suicidal ideation with any level of intent, suicidal behavior, or clinical findings suggesting that the patient may be dangerous to self or others, and/or experiencing depression. The investigator will record these symptoms as an adve rse event of depression and/or suicidality . If it is determined by the investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor and the consulting psy chiatrist, that exposure to the I MP may have contributed to the adverse event of depression or suicidalit y, IMP will be immediately discontinued and the patient will be terminated from the study . Follow up with a pediatric ps ychiatrist or licensed child and adolescent mental hea lth clinician will be arranged. In cases where it is determined that I MP did not c ontribute to the adverse event of depression or suicidality , the investigator will consult with the medical monitor and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study . A reference sample is provided in Appendix K. 7.10. Neurological Examinations Neurological examination, including mental status, cranial nerves, motor system (strength, tone, and posture), coordination, gait and balance, tendon reflexes, and sensation, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 2. Any neurological examination finding that is judged b y the investigator as a potentially clinicall y significant change (worsening) compared with the screening value will be considered an adverse event , recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 . 7.11. Concomitant Medication or Treatment Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the study to notif y the investigator if an y new medication is prescribed/administered, including over -the-counter medications. Any prescribed/administered medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in Appendix H, Table 7. The tables for allowed and prohibited medications are not comprehensive and may not include all possible concomitant medications. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor , or if there are an y questions regarding an y medication not listed in Appendix H. Prohibited me dications that are associated with QTc prolongation are listed in Appendix H, Table 10,while prohibited antipsy chotic drugs are listed in Appendix H, Table 9."

Pharmacok inetic Assessment Blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of plasma concentrations of TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine), α -HTBZ, β -HTBZ, and other metabolites, as required. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will be performed at the week 8 visit. Two samples will be collected. The first sample will be collected upon arrival at the clinic. The second sample will be collected 2 to 3 hours after the first pharmacokinetic sample collection. The time between sampl es should be maximized in order to provide the most useful information. Patients with early morning visits (ie, within 2 hours of their scheduled AM dosing) should take their dose in the clinic after the first pharmacokinetic sample is collected. Patients will be provided with a diary to provide critical information on dosing at baseline, week 2, week 4, and at unscheduled visits . The date and time of the last dose of study medication before the week 8 visit should be recorded in the diary by the patient or caregiver/adult. The site will document the date and time of the sample collection. Prior to the clinic visit at week 8, patients will be reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose in their diary . Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected via venipuncture for plasma concentration measurements of TEV -50717 and metabolites or other anal ytes. The dates and times of IMP administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF. An exploratory anal ysis of the pharmacokinetics of active metabolites on the pharmacod ynamics or safet y endpoints may be performed . Additional details regarding sampling and handling as well as sh ipment and anal ysis of samples will be provided in the laboratory manual. 8.2. Pharmacodynamics Assessment Exposure -response (eg, pharmacod ynamic [PD] and/or safet y endpoints) may be assessed if the appropriate data are available. 8.3. Pharmacogenetics 8.3.1. CYP2D6 Genoty ping /Pharmacogenetics At the screening visit, a blood sample ( 3mL) will be obtained for anal ysis of CYP2D6 genot ype.

After finalization of the statistical analy sis plan, an y additional analy ses or changes to analy ses that may be required will be fully disclosed in the CSR. 9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations It is estimated that approximately 50 patients per arm will enable a power of at least 90% to detect a beneficial standardized effect of 68% or more when the TEV -50717 arm is compared to placebo (difference of 6.5in the change from baseli ne to week 8 in TTS, assuming a standard deviation of 9.5 in each arm) in a 2-sided t ype I error rate of 5% after accounting for potential dropouts. 9.2. Analysis Sets 9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set The intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis set will include all randomiz ed patients, regardless of whether or not a patient took an y IMP. In this population, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were randomized, regardless of which treatment they actuall y received. 9.2.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) anal ysis set is a subset of the ITT anal ysis set including only patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP and who have both a baseline and at least 1postbaseline YGTSS assessment.

The unstructured covariance matrix for repeated observations within patients will be used. The least squares means of the change in TTS from baseline at week 8 will be compared betwee n the high- dose treatment arm and the placebo arm using a 2 -sided test at the alpha =0.05 level of significance. In addition, actual values and changes in the TTS from baseline to each visit will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 9.5.5.2. Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity analy ses for missing data andthe statistical model will be provided in the statisitical analysis plan. 9.5.5.3. Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses A hierarchical (fixed-sequence) testing approach will be used for the anal ysis of the key secondary endpoints. If an endpoint is not statistically significant, confirmatory hypothesis testing will not be not carried out on the remaining hy potheses, and remaining h ypotheses will be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory . The following anal yses of key secondary endpoints will be conducted : 1.The change from baseline to week 8 in TS -CGI will be analy zed using a similar model as the primary analy sis; however, instead of change in YGTSS TTS as the dependent variable and baseline YGTSS TTS as a covariate, the corresponding TS -CGI values will be used. The comparison between high-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 2.Using the same model as for the primary anal ysis, the comparison between the change in the TTS of the YGTSS from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 3.Using the same model as described in endpoint #1 above for TS -CGI, the comparison between the change in the TS -CGI values from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 4.The change from baseline to week 8 in TS -PGII will be anal yzed using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel -row mean score test with modified ridit scoring controlling for age group. The comparison between high- dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 5.Using the same model as described in endpoint #4 above for TS-PGII , the comparison between the change in the TS -PGII values from baseline to week 8 for low-dose TEV -50717 and placebo will be tested. 6.The change from baseline to week 8 in the C&A-GTS -QOL ADL subscale will be analyzed using a similar model as the primary analy sis; however, instead of change in YGTSS TTS as the dependent variable and baseline YGTSS TTS as a covariate, the"

Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity The hierarchical testing method will be used to maintain the experiment -wise ty pe I error of 5% level for the primary and key secondary analy ses. The primary efficacy endpoint will first be tested at the 5% t ype I error level. If the p -value of the primary anal ysis is ≤0.05, the secondary hypotheses will be tested in the order listed for the anal ysis of key secondary endpoints until either an anal ysis produces a p-value >0.05 or all anal yses result in a p- value ≤0.05. 9.7. Safety Analysis Safety endpoints for this study are as follows: adverse events and concomitant medications: from the signing of the informed consent /assent form through follow -up, inclusive of all visits and telephone contacts physical examination: screening and week 8 neurological examination: screening and week 8 vital signs: screening; baseline; and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9 Note: orthostatic blood pressure a nd pulse at baseline and weeks 4 and 8 children’s C -SSRS baseline/Screening scale: screening since Last Visit scale: baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9 CDI-2 (Parent and Self- report Profiles ): screening ; baseline; and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 9 12-Lead ECG: scre ening, baseline, and weeks 4 and8 clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry , hematology , and urinaly sis): screening and week 8 pregnancy testing: screening, baseline, and week 8 drug screen: screening and week 8 Safety anal yses willbe performed on the safety analy sis set (Section 9.2.3 ). 9.7.1. Safety Analysis All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class category for the analyses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events, adverse events determined b y the investigator to be related to study treatment, serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the stud y. Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented. Observed value s and changes from baseline in laboratory results and vital signs will be summarized descriptively. Observed values in ECG parameters will be summarized, and counts and percentages of abnormal findings will be presented. In addition, the number and percen tage of patients with"

The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by therapeutic class using descriptive statistics. Concomitant medica tions will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with IMP. Observed values in the C -SSRS and observed values and changes from baseline in the CDI -2 (Parent and Self -report Profiles ) will be presented by treatment group for all patients . 9.8. Tolerability Analysis Tolerability was not specifically defined. 9.9. Pharmacok inetic Analysis Blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of plasma concentrations of TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine), α -HTBZ, β -HTBZ, and other metabolites, as required. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics will be performed at the week 8 visit. Two samples will be collected. The first sample will be collected upon arrival at the clinic. The second sample will be collected within 2 to 3 hours after the first pharmacokinetic sample collection. The time between samples should be maximized in order to provide the most useful information. Patients with early morning visits (ie, within 2 hours of their scheduled AM dosing) should take their dose in the clinic after the first pharmacokinetic sample is collected. Patients will be provided with a diary to provide critical information on dosing at baseline, week 2, week 4, and at unscheduled visits . The date and time of the last dose of study medication before the week 8 visit should be recorded in the diary by the patient or caregiver/adult . The site will document the date and time of the sample collection. Prior to the clinic visit on week 8, patients will be reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose in their diary . Plasma samples for both α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolite concentrations will be pooled with previous data and analyzed using population pharmacok inetics techniques. The population pharmacokinetics analysis will result in a final structural model that best describes the data. A covariate assessment will evaluate the relationship between potential covariates (ie ,body weight, age, height, etc .) and c oncentrations of α- HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites. The final population pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be included in a separate report. 9.10. Planned Interim Analysis There will be no formal interim anal ysis. 9.11. Reporting Deviations from the Statistical Plan Deviations from the statistical plan, along with the reasons for the deviations, will be described in protocol amendments, the statistical analy sis plan, the CSR, or any combination of these, as appropriate , and in accordance with applicable national, local ,and regional requirements and regulations ."

The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by 2 fa ctors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article administration in the juvenile rat toxicology study. Second, the clinical significance of tremors and reduced body weight gain in rats dosed with TEV-50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients. While hypoactivity in rats has the potential to relate to clinical observations of somnolence, this adverse effect is controlled with dose reduction. In clinical comparison, the adverse event profile of tetrabenazine in adult patients is qualitatively similar to patients from approximately 22 months to 18 years of age (Jainet al 2006, Kenney et al 2007, Porta et al 2008 ).The NOAEL (no-observed -adverse -effect level) for toxicities in juvenile rats is lower than that in adults; however, the total (α+β) -HTBZ exposure multiples or safety margins comparing rat to humans at the adult and juvenile age categories are similar. The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by 2 factors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article administration in the juvenile rat toxicology study. Second, the clinical significance of tremors and reduced body weight gain in rats dosed with TEV - 50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients.

The principal investigator at each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. Protocol Deviations Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical, or mental integrit y of the patients in the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol deviations may include non -adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to IMP administration; use of prohibited medications. Protocol deviatio nswill be identified and recorded b y investigational center personnel in the CRF. All protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/I RB, as required. When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to withdraw the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study . Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol violation. I f such patient has already completed the study or has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. Information to Study Personnel The investigator is responsible for giving information abou t the study to all personnel members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must ensure that all stud y pers onnel are qualified b y education, experience, and training to perform their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s responsi bilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary . The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol."

PRODUCT COMPLAINTS Clinical Product Complaints A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical quality or characteristics of clinical IMP supplies or clinical device supplies used in a clinical research stud y sponsored by Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited to: suspected contamination questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) defective components missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center with more or less than the designated number of units inside) incorrect packaging, or incorrect or mis sing labeling/labels unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint by completing the p roduct complaint form provided by Teva and emailing it to within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints involving a nIMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply ) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 1.Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide the following information, as available: investigational center number and principal investigator n ame name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint clinical protocol number patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable product name and strength for open -label studies patient number, b lister pa ck, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label studies product available for return Yes/No product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No"
241,page_241,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 241description or nature of complaint associated serious adverse event Yes/No clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No date and name of person receiving the complaint Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delay ed even if not all the required information can be obtained immediately . Known information must be reported immediately . The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to obtain an y outstanding information. 2.Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s) The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. If it is determined that the investigational center must return all I MP, the sponsor will provide the information needed to handle the return. The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinic al supplies will be maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient. 3.Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2 and Section 7.1.5.3 , respectivel y). 4.Documenting a Product Complaint The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, and an y actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient. Once the complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigationa l centers using the product. Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be detected, documented, and reported b y the investigator throughout the study."

DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORD KEEPING Direct Access to Sourc e Data and Documents All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directly on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sp onsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directl y to the CRF. If data are processed from other institutions or by other means (eg, clinical laboratory or central image center) the results will be sent to the in vestigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). The medical experts, study mon itors, auditors, IEC/I RB, and inspectors from competent authority (or their agents) will be given direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality is maintained in accordance with national and local requirements. The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a at all times. The investigator must maintain a confidential pa tient identification list that allows the unambiguous identification of each patient. Data Collection Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study . The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data manage ment s ystem (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in 21CFR Part11(USA) and documents of other concerned competent authorities . Before using the CDMS, it will be fully validated and all users will receive training on the s ystem and study- specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual sy stem access rights. Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent/assent . Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central image center, electronic patient- reported outcome [ePRO] tablet), these data will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization pe rforming data management). All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may not be recorded directl y on the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directl y to the CRF. For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent /assent will be entered in the CRF."
243,page_243,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 243Data Quality C ontrol Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality , completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality control, will comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken regarding data management and data quality control, will be described in a data management plan. CRFs received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the presence of mandatory values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy . Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried. Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. The sy stem requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates, and times of modifications, an d authorized electronic approvals of the changes. At the conclusion of the study , the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further additions or corrections. Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured a nd confirmed as accurate. Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents Sponsor Responsibilities The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. I nvestigational center -specific CRFs will be provided to the respective investigational centers for ar chiving. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, not es, reports, and data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country , state/province, or nationa l and local laws, including, but not limited to : full case histories signed informed consent /assent forms patient identification lists case report forms for each patient on a per -visit basis data from other sources (eg, central laboratory , bioanal ytical la boratory , central image center) safet y reports financial disclosure reports/forms reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the I MPs copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IEC/I RB, and an y competent authority"
244,page_244,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 03 Study TV50717- CNS -30060 244The investigator will retain all reco rds related to the study and any additional records required, as indicated b y the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, until the CRO or sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destro yed. If, after 25 years from study completion, or earlier in the case of the investigational center closing or going out of business, the investigator reasonabl y determines that study record retention has become undul y burdensome, and sponsor has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may submit a written request to sponsor at least 60 days before any planned disposition of study records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements for appropriate archival or disposition, including requiring that the investigator deliver such records to the sponsor. The investigator shall notify the sponsor of any accidental loss or destruction of study records."
