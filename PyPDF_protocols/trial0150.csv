8,page_8,"Allian ce A221701 9 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 1.0 BACKGROUND 1.1 Introduction Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) result in stomatitis, which can significantly impair quality of life in cancer patients. Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR ) inhibitor that is used (sometimes in combination with other drugs) to treat a variety of cancers including metastatic breast cancer. In the BOLERO -2 study, there was a 59% rate of stomatitis and a 30% rate of grade 2 or 3 stomatitis with everolimus and e xemestane therapy in breast cancer patients.1 In a meta -analysis of BOLERO -2, RECORD -2 (for renal cell carcinoma), RADIANT -2 (for carcinoid), RADIANT -3 (for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors), and EXIST -1 and 2 (for tuberous sclerosis complex), the rate of everolimus -induced stomatitis was also 67%, and the rate of grade 3 or 4 stomatitis was 9%2. It was noted that 89% of these events occurred within 8 weeks of starting everolimus. 1.1.1 Topical corticosteroids appear to treat benign aphthous ulcers For pa tients with recurrent aphthous ulcers, topical steroids appear to reduce pain and promote healing.3,4 Oral steroid paste, ointment, or solution has been found to be effective against the symptoms of this condition, which mimics drug -induced stomatitis. In patients with Behcet’s syndrome, who are prone to oral ulcers, a randomized trial of triamcinolone vs. phenytoin syrup revealed substantially more improvement in ulcer symptoms in those who received triamcinolone.5 In some severe cases of aphthous ulcers that are refractory to topical treatments, systemic steroids have been beneficial.6,7 The proposed mechanism by which corticosteroids are thought to decrease mucosal ulcer pain is via decreased production of lymphocytes and other cytokines involved in the inflammatory response.8 1.1.2 Topical corticosteroids appear to treat and/or prevent everolimus -induced stomatitis -early reports The underlying pathogenesis of stomatitis due to TKIs appears to be inflammatory, like aphthous ulcers. In 2011, a report was publis hed regarding 17 patien ts with m TOR inhibitor -associated stomatitis (mIAS) who were treated with a topical corticosteroid, including topical oral dexamethasone solution; this was put in the oral cavity and then expectorated. Over 85% of these patients appeared to improve with th is therapy.9 In another trial involving 15 women, 7 of whom (47%) had developed greater than or equal to grade 2 stomatitis, their ulcers, treated with topical dexamethasone, all appeared to resolve over a median of 2 weeks.10 In addition, an early report suggested that patients treated with a prophyla ctic hydrocortisone, tetracycline, nystatin, and diphenhydramine mouthwash prevented mIAS in patients who were receiving everolimus.11 1.2 Larger phase II trials of corticosteroids for prevention of everolimus -associated stomatitis In the SWISH study, an alcohol -free, dexamethasone -based mouthwash was investigated as a means to prevent stomatitis in patients with advanced breast cancer receiving eve rolimus and exemestane.12 Patients receiving 10 mg of everolimus in combination with exemestane started an alcohol -free dexamethasone solution simultaneously. Patients were asked to swish, hold for 2 minutes, then spit out 10 ml of a 0.5 mg/ 5 ml dexamethas one solution. In this study, the 8 weeks incidence of CTCAE grade 1 stomatitis was 19% and grade 2 stomatitis was only 2%, resulting in an overall stomatitis incidence rate at 8 weeks of only 21% (n=18, 95% CI 13.06 - 31.39), significantly lower than that se en in BOLERO -2 historical controls (p<0.001). In SWISH, 95% of patients used dexamethasone mouthwash 3 -4 times/day (median 3.95 [range 1.9-4]), and more than 70% remained on all 3 drugs for at least 8 weeks. The median dose intensities of everolimus and ex emestane were 10 mg and 25 mg, respectively. SWISH did not"
9,page_9,"Allian ce A221701 10 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 evaluate the frequency of mouthwash use, or if delayed start of dexamethasone at the time of development of stomatitis would be as effective as use in the preventive setting. At the San Antonio Br east Cancer Symposium in 2016, a separate prospective phase 2 randomized trial of 2 steroid -based mouth rinses as oral prophylaxis for patients receiving 10 mg of everolimus combined with exemestane was presented.13 These two rinses included the following: 1) 320 ml diphenhydramine, 2g tetracycline, 80mg hydrocortisone, 40mg Nystatin, and water; or 2) prednisolone 15mg/ml and 1.8% alcohol. Four times a day, participants were instructed to swish and spit one of these two solutions, and the incidence of stoma titis and all grade related adverse events appeared to be relatively low in both arms of the study (29% and 27.5% in arms 1 and 2, respectively over twelve weeks). The incidence of grade 2 adverse events was 12% and 8% in arms 1 and 2, respectively. While a variety of topical steroids have shown promise in treatment of recurrent aphthous ulcers, we have selected dexamethasone solution as the intervention to be tested in this trial (as opposed to another corticosteroid medication) because of the strong data from the previous SWISH single -arm study showing excellent tolerability and encouragingly low rates of stomatitis incidence (only 2% ≥grade 2) in patients receiving exemestane, everolimus, and dexamethasone swish and spit. 1.3 Rationale for a randomized p hase III trial The results of these two phase II trials assessing prevention of mIAS with oral corticosteroid medications are quite impressive. They strongly suggest that this therapy is helpful for preventing mIAS. It has been recommended that this appro ach be utilized in clinical practice, and many physicians have been using this approach. This sets the stage for a definitive randomized phase 3, placebo controlled clinical trial to address whether a steroid mouthwash will prevent mIAS. An early change from placebo to a corticosteroid medication is incorporated in this protocol so that patients that develop mIAS are treated early with dexamethasone, expecting that this will provide benefit and prevent patients from developing the severe mIAS that was see n in the BOLERO -2 trial. 1.4 Study design We have proposed, as is illustrated in the study schema, to conduct a placebo -controlled trial investigating a dexamethasone preparation for prevention of stomatitis. To address the potential concern that we are h olding back medication that looks quite effective for prevention of everolimus -induced stomatitis, we will allow a patient to start getting a corticosteroid preparation at the initiation of any pain associated with mouth sores. Thus, this protocol is desig ned to test 1) a prevention approach versus 2) an early treatment intervention approach. Instead of having the patient have to come back into the clinic and get such a preparation, we have opted to provide a prescription for all patients who can then quic kly get this filled and start on dexamethasone treatment should mouth sores develop. If and when the patient decides to switch to prescription dexamethasone, he/she will be asked to notify a protocol nurse and/or clinician. Weekly phone calls from a study nurse will also collect information about whether the prescription was filled. If the corticosteroid preparation is helpful for preventing the stomatitis, then we would expect the placebo a rm patients to be more likely to fill the corticosteroid prescription and to do that earlier in the course, compared with patients who were actually receiving the corticosteroid preparation initially . Whether a patient chooses to go to prescription dexame thasone, and when that happens, will be prominent study endpoints. The primary reason that a phase III trial is needed is that there really is equipoise as to which of our 2 proposed study arms is best. While some might say that the phase II study data"
10,page_10,"Allian ce A221701 11 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 convincingly show that the use of a corticosteroid QID is beneficial in patients starting everolimus (which is hard to argue, compared to not ever using a corticosteroid), there may be an advantage for the initial placebo arm (understanding that a patient wou ld be instructed to start prescription dexamethasone if they developed any painful mouth sores), in that about a third of patients will likely be spared the hassle and expense and potential toxicities (e.g. thrush) of using a corticosteroid mouthwash, beca use about a third of patients did not experience any mIAS in the BOLERO trial. It might well be that starting use of dexamethasone at the beginning of any mouth pain will effectively prevent the development of moderate to severe pain. The need to compare a prevention versus treatment strategy is highlighted in the excellent editorial by Spring and Bardia.14 These authors state, “Because the development of everolimus -induced oral mucositis is usually preceded by a prodrome, treatment with steroid rinses at t he earliest indication of stomatitis, rather than attempts at prevention, could be an alternative approach for some patients ”. 1.5 Potential study populations We initially considered only studying patients receiving everolimus in combination with endocri ne therapy, to mimic the two large phase II trials described above. However, hearing from practicing clinicians that they frequently use everolimus in clinical practice for a more diverse group of patients with a variety of conditions (such as renal cell a nd islet cell cancer), and that these patients have similar mIAS problems, we opted to be more inclusive in this clinical trial and include any cancer patient being treated with everolimus (10 mg/day). This makes sense as it is the everolimus that causes m IAS, not the antiestrogen therapies. 1.6 Methods and Assessment Procedures We plan to collect all of the data elements from the SWISH trial (CTCAE delineation of mucositis , pain, normalcy of diet scale), obtained in the same manner, in addition to other data elements. The endpoint that was developed and used d e novo in the SWISH trial used composite criteria, with a clarification that a grade 2 or higher designation needed to be confirmed by 1) an oral pain score of greater than 8/10 on 1 occasion o r 7/10 for 2 days, or 2) that patients could only eat soft chewable foods (or less, like liquids alone) as determined by a Normalcy of Diet Scale score less than or equal to 50/100. With this rule, a patient with classic CTCAE determination of grade 2 stomatitis could have been downgraded to grade 1 stomatitis if they did not meet the pain or diet criteria to keep them at grade 2 stomatitis (noting that this only happened for 2 patients in the SWISH trial —unpublished data provided to us). This composite c linician - determined measurement is not well validated psychometrically by itself, or by adding the 2 criteria noted above, so this will be a secondary endpoint for our trial. For our primary endpoint, we will use a numerical analog scale of patient -report ed mouth pain. We have validated these numerical analog scales for symptom collection in numerous trials.15 PRO measures are believed to be more accurate than clinicians’ CTCAE reporting for many toxicities.16,17 For example, in a prospective study including lung cancer patients, PRO measurements of to xicities better reflected patients’ underlying state and functional status than clinicians’ evaluations.18 As in multiple previous Alliance trials,19,20,21 patient questionnaires will be utilized to obtain outcome data. Daily data collection by patient questi onnaires will allow us to more accurately see daily changes on the days before and after patient actually took prescription dexamethasone (which they would have started because they developed mouth pain); we m ight not be able to collect data at that exact time, if we used the SWISH measurement method."
11,page_11,"Allian ce A221701 12 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 Further supporting the use of a PRO measure of mouth sore related pain is that the SWISH definition of grade 2 or 3 mucositis is primarily based on pain, as is illustrated in the table below (thus the mouth pa in that patients developed would have been the predominant factor to determine their score). Grade: 1 2 3 4 5 Mucositis oral Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated Moderate pain or ulcer that does not interfere with oral intake; modified diet indicated Severe pain; interfering with oral intake Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Death Thus, we propose to use the PRO pain score as our primary measurement tool, while using the SWISH trial method as a secondary endpoint for both concurrent validation of the SWISH approach and comparison of the two results. These patient -reported study data will be collected by daily patient logs and a more extensive survey weekly. There will also be weekly nurse phone calls (Appendix VI ). The daily logs will collect a numerical analog mouth pain score, as shown in the Appendix II. Once a week, patients will also be asked to respond to a sing le-item overall quality of life (QOL) linear analogue self - assessment ( Appendix II I), as well as two NCI -developed PRO -CTCAE items regarding mouth sores , two regarding insomnia, and two regarding f atigue (as sho wn in Appendix IV ).21,22,23, 24 A mouthwa sh use questionnaire ( Appendix V) will also be included in the weekly survey. Patients will be strongly encouraged during each weekly nurse phone call ( Appendix V I) to immediately report back by phone if they fill the prescription for dexamethasone mouthwash in between the routine weekly calls. Weekly nurse phone calls will also be used to rem ind the patients to: • Fill out the daily mouth pain form (Appendix II ) • Fill out the weekly PRO -CTCAE items 21,22,23,24 (Appe ndix IV ), • and mouthwash use questi onnaire (as sho wn in Appendix V ). The nurses will also collect information on (Appendix VI ): • Everolimus dose (and reasons for any dose reductions) • Study mouthwash use frequency • Whether and when the patient obtained the prescription mouthwash • CTCAEs; and • Normalcy of Diet Scale data There are data to support the utility and validity of the above measures. The numerical ana log mouth pain scale ( Appendix II ) was used effectively to assess patient -reported mouth pain in the SWISH stud y.2 The single -item ov erall QOL assessment ( Appendix III ) is a simple linear analogue scale that has been successfully used i n multiple trials including patients with advanced cancer ,25,26,27,2 8and is routinely included in most Alliance trials. The three 2 -item PRO - CTCAE assessments ( Appe ndix IV ) were recently developed and validated for use in cooperative group clinical trials.21,22,23 PRO -CTCAE is a library of questions asking patients about specific symptomatic adverse events associated with cancer therapy. They are meant to be used in combination with clinician -determined CTCAE, so both PRO -CTCAE and CTCAE"

All topical (not inges ted) topical anesthetics are allowed. Examples of such medicines include: Lidocaine, magic mouthwash, and biotene. 8.1.2 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study. This includes blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and trea tment of other newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions. All blood products and concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study treatment administration until 30 days after the fi nal dose will be recorded in the medical records. 8.1.3 Antiemetics may be used with the exception of oral steroids, at the discretion of the attending physician . 8.1.4 Diarrhea management is per the discretion of the treating physician. Diarrhea could be managed conservatively with medications such as loperamide. • Patients with severe diarrhea should be assessed for intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte imba lances. 8.2 Dose Modifications There will be no dose modifications to the dexamethasone mouthwash on this study. Everolimus dose modifications will be left to the discretion of the treating physician. However, the patient will be allowed to hold the study mouthwash during everolimus dose holds according to the treating physician’s discretion, and allowed to resume the study mouthwash once the patient resumes everolimus. If a CTCAE grade 3 -4 toxicity develo ps that is probably or definitely attributable to dexamethasone mouth rinse or everolimus, study therapy will stop but follow -up assessments will continue until the end of the eight week study period. 8.3 Unblinding Procedures Unblinding can be done only in cases of an emergency or at the end of protocol treatment . Follow the directions below to unblind patient treatment. Please note that if a treatment assignment is unblinded, the patient must discontinue protocol therapy. 8.3.1 Emergency Unblinding Procedures Examples of emergencies incl ude 1) a life -threatening unexpected adverse e vent that is at least possibly related to the investigational agent and for wh ich unblinding would influence treatment decisions; or 2) medication error, such as acciden tal overdose.

We will use daily logs to collect a numerical analog ue mouth pain score, as shown in Appendix II. This was used effectively to assess patient -reported mouth pain in the SWISH study2. Once a week, patients will also be asked to respond to a numerical analogue single -item overall quality of life (QOL) self-assessment (Appendix III ), two NCI -developed PRO - CTCAE items regarding mou th sores (as shown in Appendix IV )21,22,23,24 , two NCI-developed PRO - CTCAE items regarding insomnia , and two regarding fatigue (possible side effects of dexamethasone ), as shown in Appendix III, PRO measures are believed to be more accurate than clinicians’ CTCAE reporting for many toxicities.17,18 For example, in a prospective study including lung cancer patients, PRO measurements of toxicities better reflected patients’ underlying state and functional status than clinicians’ evaluations.18 As in multiple previous Alliance legacy trials,19,20, 21 patien t questionnaires will be utilized to obtain outcome data. 11.1 Numerical Analog ue Mouth Pain Scale ( Appendix I I) This patient -reported mouth pain tool utilizes a numerical analogue scale methodology, which we have validated in numerous trials .29 Completion of the Numerical Analogue Mouth Pain Scale will take less than one minute . 11.2 Numerical Analogue Self -Assessment ( Appendix I II) The single -item Numerical Analogue Scale for quality of life (QOL) has been widely used in a variety of clinical trials for many years,15,30,31 including in patients with advanced cancer,25,26,27,28 , and is routinely included in most Alliance trials. When administered prior to initiation of therapy, better scores on this measure may be prognostic for survival in cancer patients, independent of performance status.32 This measure will be included to assess how the study medication impacts overall quality of life during treatment with everolimus. Completion of this single -item will take less than one minute. 11.3 PRO -CTCAE items (Mouth/throat sore s, Sleep and Fatigue items) ( Appendix IV ) The three 2 -item PRO -CTCAE assessments regarding mouth/th roat sores, sl eep, and fatigue (Appendix IV ) were recently developed and validated for use in cooperative group clinical trials.21, 22, 23 PRO -CTCAE is a library of questions asking patients about specific symptomatic adverse events associated with cancer therapy. Completion of the six tota l PRO -CTCAE items will take less than one minute to complete. 11.4 Patient reported Mouthwash Use frequency (Appendix V) This measure was created specifically for use in this study so that we could collect data regarding how much mouthwash was actually used by the participants (how many of the recommended 28 doses per week were taken), as well as data regarding whether or no t (and when) the optional prescription dexamethasone was initiated. It also includes two questions regarding everolimus to allow us to assess what proportion of patients are able to stay on the full 10 mg starting dose of that drug on each study arm. This measure will take less than one minute to complete. 11.5 Nurse \Research coordinator weekly phone call assessments (Appendix V I) Although patient -reported study data will be collected by daily patient logs and weekly questionnaires, there will also be weekl y nurse phone calls to remind patients to fill out the patient booklets and to collect additional information (Appendix V I). During these approximately 5 -minute weekly calls, nurses will remind participants to:"

The nurse or research coordinator will also collect information on: • Everolimus dose (and reasons for any dose reductions) • Study mouthwash use frequency • If and when the patient obtained the prescription mouthwash • CTCAEs; and • Normalcy of Diet Scale data (See Section 11.6) Items about frequency of use of study and prescription mouthwashes ( Appendix V) were adapted from multiple previous Alliance symptom control clinical trials, as was the nurse telep hone assessment form ( Appendix V I). CTCAE assessments will be performed during these calls to collect mouth symptoms and to assess for toxicities of dexamethasone (i.e., thrush, hyperglycemia, irritability, fatigue, and insomnia) weekly during the study period (during the nurse phone calls if a p atient is not scheduled to be seen in the clinic that week). 11.6 Normalcy of Diet Scale (Appendix VII ) The Normalcy of Diet Scale is part of the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients33, and was chosen for use here primarily because this was used in the SWISH study12 and will allow us to assess the same composite endpoint that was the primary endpoint in that study. This measure will be administered over the phone by a study nurse, who will begin by asking the patient what kinds of foods (s) he has been eating, and then ask what foods are difficult to eat. The nurse will then ask about specific examples of foods, working up from the bottom of the scale (or from the middle if the patient says he/she can eat everything), stopping at the item the patient cannot eat (and giving the patient the score below that item). This allows us to assess how stomatitis related to everolimus reduces a patient’s ability to eat a normal diet on both arms of the study . 12.0 END OF TREATMENT /INTERVENTION 12.1 Duration of Protocol Treatment Protocol treatment is to continue until 8 weeks after start of everolimus treatment .

The respective research hypotheses for the co -primary obj ectives 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 are: 1) Pain will be less common in patients who take dexamethasone preventatively (dexamethasone group) compared with those who initiate dexamethasone at the onset of mouth pain (placebo group) . The research hypothesis for this fi rst co-primary objective is: Dexamethasone taken preventively will substantially decrease the number of patients who develop mIAS. 2) The research hypothesis for this second co-primary objective is: The average severity of mIAS -associated pain over the eig ht week treatment period will be greater in those who initiate dexamethasone at the onset of mouth pain (placebo group) compared to those who take dexamethasone preventatively (dexamethasone group) . 13.2 Sample Size, Accrual time and Study Duration To acco unt for 10% ineligible patients and cancelations, the targeted sample size is 279 patients (evaluable patients for data analysis are 254) . Under a constant accrual rate of 10 -15 patients per month, the study will last 28 months from initiation until the fi nal patient is accrued, and another 2 months until the final patient completes treatment . 13.3 Primary objectives and endpoint s There are two co -primary endpoints in this study. Patient -reported mouth pain is measured by a simple 11 -item response scale [ 0, 1, 2, …, 10] with zero indicating “no pain” and ten indicating “pain as bad as can be” (Appendix II) , and obtained at baseline (within seven days prior to the start of treatment) and then daily for 8 -weeks. 13.3.1 First co -primary endpoint The objective is to compare the incidence rate of mIAS -associated mouth pain between the two arms using a Chi -square test . The first co -primary endpoint is the binary outcome mouth pain (yes; no) defined as a patient reporting at least one serially measured mouth pain score greater than zero during the eight -week study period. 13.3.2 Second co -primary endpoint The objective is to compare the average AUC of the serially measured mIAS -associated mouth pain scores between the two arms using a two -sample t -test. The second co -primary endpoint is the area under the curve (AUC) summary measure calculated for each patient based on t he patient’s serially measured patient -reported mouth pain scores; the AUC calculated for each patient is scaled according to the number of assessable patient -reported mouth pain scores to obtain a transformed AUC score on a scale of 0 -100. 13.4 Secondar y objectives and endpoints 13.4.1 (Objective 2.2.1) Using the same measurement method that was reported in the SWISH trial, we will generate a n endpoint that consists of a co mbination of a patient reported pain scale, data from a normalcy of diet questionn aire, and CTCAE grading of stomatitis /mucositis to determine the incidence of ≥ grade 2 mIAS. Grade ≥ 2 mIAS is defined as having at least one of the following criteria:"
42,page_42,"Allian ce A221701 43 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 1) Oral intake assessed at <50 on the Normalcy of Diet Scale 2) Patient’s reported or al pain (using visual analog ue scale 0 -10) that meets one of the following: • rating of 7 on two consecutive days • rating of 8, 9, or 10 on any one day Our hypothesis is that dexamethasone will substantially decrease the number of patients who develop grade ≥ 2 mIAS. 13.4.2 (Objective 2.2.2 ) We will determine if the initiation of dexamethasone at the start of everolimus increases time to development of mo uth pain. Our hypothesis is that daily numerical analog ue scale data will reveal longer time to the development of at least mild, at least moderate, and severe mouth pain in the upfront dexamethasone arm compared to the placebo arm. 13.4.3 . (Objective 2.2. 3) We will assess if quality of life and adverse related domains are better, as we hypothesize that it will be, when dexamethasone mouth rinse use starts at the same time as everolimus use versus at the time when mouth pain begin s by comparing numerical analogue scale scores ( Appendix II I) and PRO -CTCAE mout h/throat and sleep items regarding level of interference with daily activities (Appendix IV ). 13.4.4 . (Objective 2.2 .4) We will investigate if starting dexamethasone mouth rinse concurrent with starting everolimus improves patients’ ability to adhere to everolimus therapy by comparing mean daily dose of everolimus between the arms, as well as the number of patients who stopped everolimus early and the number who reduced the dose of everolimus per arm between the groups. 13.4.5 . (Objective 2.2.5 ) We will compare dexamethasone prescription fill rates and time to these fills between patients who received placebo versus stud y drug at the initiation of everolimus . 13.5 Analysis Plan and Sample Size Justification The primary analyses will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients randomized who completed the numerical analogue mouth pain scale at least once during the study. For the co -primary endpoints, a fixed -sequence statistical strategy will be used to control the Type I error rate at 0.05. The first co -primary endpoint will be tested, followed by the second co-primary endpoint, both at the same significance level of 0.05, such that the second co -primary endpoint is only tested if statistical significance was achieved on the first co -primary endpoint. Although both co -primary endpoints are clinically relevant, the testing sequence was ordered largely by the likelihood of success. 13.5.1 First co -primary endpoint The sample siz e was determined based on the between arm comparison of the incidence rate of mIAS -associated mouth pain using a Chi -square test. The incidence rate for each arm is defined as the proportion of patients reporting any pain score greater than zero during the eight week study period, based on the single item numerical analogue mouth pain scale ( Appendix II ). Based on prior studies (Section 13.7 ), we assumed that the incidence r ate of mIAS -associated mouth pain in the placebo group is 50%, and hypothesized that the incidence rate of mIAS -associated mouth pain in the dexamethasone group will be 32%. To detect this difference in the incidence rate of mIAS -associated mouth pain wit h 80% power, 127 patients are needed per group or 254 patients total. The"
43,page_43,"Allian ce A221701 44 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 sample size calculation was based on a Chi -square test with a 5% Type I error rate under two-sided alternative . 13.5.2 Second co -primary endpoint: With 127 patients per group (254 total), the study is adequately powered to detect a moderate effect size for the second co -primary endpoint. Specifically, 127 patients per group will provide 97% power to detect a moderate effect size of 0.5 (equivalent to 10 points on the transformed AU C score scaled from 0 -100 divided by an assumed standard deviation of 20 points). We assumed that the place bo group would have a higher transformed mean area under the curve ( AUC , equivalent to increased mIAS -associated mouth pain) than dexamethasone group . This power calculation was based on a two -sample t-test with a two -sided 5% Type I error rate. 13.5.3 Secondary endpoints: The SWISH trial approach incidence rate of grade 2 or higher stomatitis for each treatment group will also be compared by a Chi-square test. The planned tests for the other secondary endpoints are detailed in the table below: Study item Measurement method Statistical test Time to develop at least mild mouth sores per study arm.

Note: The statement regarding the interim analysis in previous Section 13.8 of the protocol was inadvertently carried over from another protocol. It was not meant to be included. 13.7 Primary Endpoint Justification: CTCAE items One option for our primary analysis would be to use the identical endpoint measurement criterion that was developed and used de novo in the SWISH trial. This composite endpoint required that grade 2 or higher stomatitis needed to be confirmed by the investigator or treating physician and at least one of the following: 1) an oral pain score of greater than 8/10 on 1 occasion or 7/10 for 2 days, or 2) that patients could only eat soft chewable foods (or less, like liquids alone) as determined by a Normalcy of Diet Scale score less than or equa l to 50/100. With this rule, a patient with classic CTCAE determination of grade 2 stomatitis could have been downgraded to grade 1 stomatitis if they did not meet the pain or diet criteria to keep them at grade 2 stomatitis (noting that this only happene d for 2 patients in the SWISH trial — unpublished data provided to us). The main reason to consider choosing this measurement method is that it was used in the previously published SWISH trial. However, the downsides of utilizing this novel measurement is that this composite CTCAE clinician -determined measurement is not well validated psychometrically by itself, or by adding the 2 criteria noted above."
45,page_45,"Allian ce A221701 46 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 Additionally, data that can be collected daily by patient questionnaires will allow us to more accurately see daily changes on the days before and after patient actually took prescription dexamethasone (which they would have started because they developed mouth pain); we may not be able to collect CTCAE data at that exact time, if we used the SWISH measuremen t method. Further supporting the use of a PRO measure of mouth sore related pain is that the definition of grade 2 or 3 CTCAE -determined mucositis is primarily based on pain, as is illustrated in the table below (thus the mouth pain that patients developed would have been the predominant factor to determine their CTCAE score). Grade: 1 2 3 4 5 Mucositis oral Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; intervention not indicated Moderate pain or ulcer that does not interfere with oral intake; modified diet indicated Severe pain; interfering with oral intake Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Death Thus, we propose to use the PRO pain score as our primary measurement tool, while using the SWISH trial method as a secondary endpoint for both concurrent validation of the SWISH approach and comparison of the two results . This primary measurement tool will be used both to determine if initial dexamethasone is superior in prevent ing the development of any mouth sores -related pain compared to initial placebo, and to determine if the average severity of mIAS - associated pain over the eight week study period is greater in those who initiate dexamethasone at the onset of mouth pain compared to those who take dexamethasone preventatively , corresponding to the first and second co -primary objectives, respectively. 13.8 Sample Size and Power Considerations 13.8.1 Co-primary endpoint original consideration The effect size estimates from the preliminary trials are profound, exceeding one standard deviation for multiple primary and secondary endpoints. For example, b y 8 weeks, the incidence of grade 2 or worse stomatitis was two (2%) of 85 patients (95% CI 0·29 –8·24), versus 159 (33%) of 482 patients (95% CI 28·8 –37·4) for the duration of the BOLERO -2 study. This represents an effect size in excess of 5 standard deviations and would require only 29 patients per group, an impractically small sample size. Hence, we will use established norms for reasonable clinically meaningful effect sizes established by our group over fifteen years ago and used in numerous clinical trials by ourselves and others for the purposes of power c alculations35, 36. Our clinical colleagues’ expert opinions as to what constitutes a clinically significant effect size were used as a confirmatory check on our effect size estimates. For the first co -primary endpoint, a Chi -square test with 77 patients p er group will have 99% power to detect a difference in the rate of mIAS pain (>50% in the placebo versus <15% in the dexamethasone treatment group) with a two -sided alternative and a 5% Type I error rate. These estimates are based on the SWISH and Bolero t rial data. For the second co -primary endpoint, the independent samples t -test using the simple summary AUC measure will have 87% power to detect a difference in the first co -primary endpoint of AUC for the 8 -week period for the severity of mIAS -associated pain as assessed by the single item measure of 50% times the standard deviation (a moderate effect size equivalent to 10 points on the transformed AUC score scaled from 0 -100, assuming a"
46,page_46,"Allian ce A221701 47 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 standard deviation of 20 points in the AUC) among the two arms of 77 patients each, 154 patients total (type I error rate set at 5% and a two -tailed alternative). This effect size is considered clinically non -ignorable 37 and is a conservative estimate of efficacy given the profound results of the pilot test results. 13.8.2 Re-design co-primary endpoint consideration as a result of NCI CIRB review Questions were raised regarding the sample size by the NCI CIRB regarding: 1) Calculation of initial effect size 2) Potential for patients to use the treatment more because they have r eady access to what they believe is a pain ameliorating intervention. Consideration of effect size: As indicated above in the introduction (section 1.2), the multiple phase II trials that have used this treatment have indicated effect sizes of more than f ive standard deviations in assessing reduction of the incidence of pain reported by patients or assessed by clinicians. The table below illustrates this point in using incidence rates for any stomatitis and grade 2+ stomatitis from the two pilot studies and historical control data from the Bolero study. More specifically, the effect sizes are all well above one standard deviation and require as few as 22 patients per group for a chi -square test for equality of proportions to achieve 80% power with a 5% Type I error rate. The sample size could be as large as 71 per group if we consider the San Antonio study and grade 2+ stomatitis. This is still less than the 77 patients per group required to detect a moderate effect size as described above as a non -ignorable clinically meaningful effec t 38 Source Clinician -reported stomatitis incidence Effect Size Sample size to detect effect size (per group) with 80% power and 5% type I error Historical Control (Bolero) 67% (any), SWISH 21% (any) 46% 22 San Antonio study 29%, 27.5% (any) 38%, 39.5% 31, 29 Historical Control (Bolero) 33% (gr 2+) Bolero -2 2% (gr 2+) 31% 29 San Antonio study 12%, 8% (gr 2+) 21%, 25% 71, 48 We consider the possibility that some patients fill the dexamethasone prescription when they really do not actually have pain, because they think it will prevent them from getting pain. One could assert that the likelihood of doing this should be equivale nt between the treatment and placebo preparations and dismiss potential effect size confounder. However, in case that is not the case, in the extreme case that 1 out of every 6 patients in the treatment arm reports pain in the absence of pain, in order to gain permission to fill the dexamethasone script, compared to none in the placebo group (personal communication, CIRB), this would reduce our initially estimated effect size by 16.7%."
47,page_47,"Allian ce A221701 48 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 Recall that since the preliminary effect sizes were so large, we used a conservative estimate of effect size of ½ standard deviation to come up with our sample size of 71 per group to have 80% power. Our original power calculation was based on an incidence rate of pain in the control and treatment groups of >50% and <15% resp ectively. This provided the chi - square test a sample size of 33 patients per group to detect this difference with 80% power, or more than 99% power with 71 patients per group. If we modify the efficacy rate in the treatment group by 17% (rounding from 16.7 %), then we would be comparing a stomatitis pain incidence of at least 50% in the control group with a rate of 32% (15+17 percent). For the chi -square test to have 80% power to detect this reduced efficacy rate, we would need 127 patients per group. The table below provides required sample size for various assumed percentages of patients unnecessarily taking medication. It indicates that our conservative sample size of 71 patients per group can accommodate just over 10% of the patients taking medication w hen unnecessary. To ensure we cover the proposed estimate of 16.7% of “contamination” rate, we recommend increasing the sample size to 127 patients per group.

The revised sample size of 127 patients per group will provide at least as much power specified f or the AUC co -primary t -test specified for the origin al sample size in section 13.7.1. More specifically, however, 127 patients per group will provide over 95% power to detect a non -ignorable clinically meaningful difference in average AUC of 50% times the standard deviation (a moderate effect size equivalent to 10 points on the transformed AUC score scaled from 0 -100, assuming a standard deviation of 20 points in the AUC, type I error rate set at 5% and a two -tailed alternative). Further, there will be 8 0% power for the t-test to detect a difference of 35% of the standard deviation (equivalent to 7 points on the 0 -100 point transformed AUC score between average AUC in the two groups. In summary, the expanded sample size will provide sufficient power for both co -primary endpoints to detect small to moderate effect sizes. 13.9 Study Monitoring This study will be monitored by the Alliance Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an NCI - approved functioning body. Reports containing efficacy, adverse event, and a dministrative information will be provided to the DSMB every six months as per NCI guidelines. 13.10 Missing Data and sensitivity analysis As a further sensitivity analysis of our primary results, we will employ a further method due to Fairclough et al to producing the area under the curve (AUC) estimates based on using estimated parameters from a repeated -measures (means) mixed model with a random intercept34. The"
48,page_48,"Allian ce A221701 49 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 outcome measures used in the repeated -measures (means) mixed model are the serially measured patient -reported mouth pain scores obtained at baseline and daily during the eight week study period. The covariates included in the model are indicator variables for all assessment time points, an indicator for the treatment approach (initial de xamethasone; initial placebo), and the corresponding two -way interaction terms. This macro will rerun the primary analyses with each alternative approach to imputation to demonstrate the veracity of the results in the presence of missing data. This analyt ic approach to compare the prevention approach vs early treatment approach will maintain the ITT principle and allow for missing data (i.e. under the reasonable assumption of missing at random). Furthermore, it has been shown that this analytic approach i s superior to a simple AUC summary measure in terms of both bias and precision in the presence of missing data34. In this supplemental analysis, we will also account for the two stratification factors in the model, as well as potentially other baseline co variates. To maintain the 5% significance level, this statistical test will only be performed if the first primary endpoint is met."

While some patients experience severe oral mTOR inhibitor -associated stomatitis ( mIAS ), others do not; this is possibly due in part to genetic variability in genes that biotransform everolimus. Everolimus is metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and transported by p -glycoprotein. It binds with high affinity to FK506 binding protein -12 to form a compl ex that inhibits mTOR activation and reduces activity of effectors downstream , blocking cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase and leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis . These proteins are encoded by genes that are genetically polymorphic and whos e activities result in variability in the extent of metabolism of everolimus and variability in signaling associated with the mTOR pathway —all of which might lead to variations in everolimus sensitivity. A recent next -generation sequencing study of tumor s amples from patients identified somatic mutations as genetic markers in mTOR signaling pathway (TSC1, TSC2, MTOR alterations) to be associated with everolimus sensitivity 58 On the other hand, studies have reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in everolimus pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to be associated with everolimus clinical outcomes with varying results. For example in two studies examining FGFR4 rs351855 SNP in neuroendocrine tumors, one reported no association with everolimus efficacy 44and the other reported reduced sensitivity to everolimus and increased tumor progression 45 . A recent review covering pharmacogenetics of mTOR inhibitors’ role in the pharmacodynamics of immunosuppressive drugs ,46 it was highly reco mmended that 3 MTOR SNPs namely rs2024627, rs2295080, rs1883965 be investigated in studies as these were associated with decreases in hemoglobin levels in solid organ transplantation. In the only study to date exploring the impact of germline variation on exemestane - everolimus outcome in 90 women with metastatic breast cancer, Pascual et al. (2017)47 reported that CYP3A4 rs35599367 was associated with higher concentrations of everolimus in blood. The global minor allele frequency of the CYP3A4 rs35599367 SNP is low, 0.015, however in Caucasian s the frequency ranges from 0.03-0.05. In this study by Pascual et al (2017), they found 4 patients with rs35599367 genotype out of 37 patients who had PK data on day 14 of the first everolimus cycle and were able to associate the genotype with plasma everolimus concentration levels. We will not genotype for the CYP3A4 rs35599367 SNP in this study because of its low allele frequency. Polymorphisms in CYP3A5 and CYP2C8 (everolimus metabolism) and in ABCB1 (everolimus transport), and also in genes belonging to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (FGFR4, PHLPP2, AKT2, PIK3R1, RAPTOR, AKT) have also been evaluated for their association with everolimus sensitivity. While SNPs in FGFR4 , RAPTOR and PIK3R1 were associated with toxicities such as leucopenia, hyperglycemia and lymphopenia , only ABCB1 rs1045642 SNP was associated with mucositis47. Furthermore in a GWAS study evaluating everolimus sensitivity in lymphoblast ic cell lines,48 showed that 10 SNPs ( rs218869 , rs7694207 , rs10987149 , rs12932018 , rs2702449 , rs16887552 , rs2832270 , rs1460196 , rs4148330 , rs13272072 ) were highly associated with everolimus sensitivity (p=10-6) even though they did not reach the expected g enome -wide"
51,page_51,"Allian ce A221701 52 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 significance of p<10-8 (Table 1 ). Six other SNPs that showed some association with everolimus after functional studies were reported in the same study ( Table 1 ). The most significant gene whose expression has been reported to associate with everolimus sensitivity is FBXW7 , p=4x10-7.48 This FBXW 7 gene encodes a member of the F -box protein family and functions by binding directly to multiple substrates including cyclin E and targeting cyclin E for ubiquitin -mediated degradation 49,50. Other substrates include c- Myc, c -Jun, Notch, Mcl -1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)51, all of which are involved in cell division, growth, survival and differentiation 50,52,53 FBXW7 also functions as a tumor suppressor and inactivation of the protein is associated with deregulation of well ‑known oncoproteins some of which are indicated above 51,52 and is also one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers .49,51 FBXW7 is genetically polymorphic although no SNP was observed in th e GWAS study48 . However, polymorphisms in this gene have been reported in relation to blood pressure 55and epilepsy56. As such, we will derive tagSNPs for FBXW7 and explore correlat ions of th e polymorphisms with stomatitis . Given that the SNPs mentioned here (see also Table 1 : SNPs1 -16, 22 - 26) have previously been associated with everolimus and everolimus sensitivity (indicated above) and that oral mIAS results from sensitivity to everolimus intake, we will investigate these SNPs in this study to determine if they appear to predispose patients to different levels of stomatitis severity. In addition, we will explore any correlations that the FBXW7 tagSNPs we derive will have on stom atitis severity. Moreover since the study propose s the use of dexamethasone to substantially decrease severity in mIAS -associated pain in the patients on treatment, we will evaluate if the use of dexamethasone changes any observed mIAS - SNP associations in the study . Therefore, we will validate SNPs that have been associated with everolimus sensitivity by associating them with severity of stomatitis. TagSNPs for FBXW7 will be explore for their associations with stomatitis severity. We propos e to do this by following the objectives below : 14.1.2 Objectives 1) To derive tagSNPs for FBXW7 and together with SNPs reported ( Table 1 ), genotype all patient samples for those SNPs 2) To explore the association of the genotypes with severity of everolim us-related stomatitis (mIAS - associated pain) within the patients who initially received placebo at the start of everolimus treatment. 3) To explore the association of the genotypes with severity of everolimus -related stomatitis (mIAS - associated pain) within the patients who initially received dexamethasone at the start of everolimus treatment . 14.1.3 Methods DNA Isolation, SNP selection and Genotyping: Whole blood sample will be collected in 1 x10 mL EDTA vacutainer tube (purple top) from patients at start of study for germline DNA isolation. Blood samples will be sent to the Alliance Biorepository at Mayo Clinic and DNA will be isolated in the Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing (BAP) laboratory .

Further studies are required to determine the clinical utility of TDM in nontransplantation settings59. In oncology settings, 10 mg/day seems to be the maximum tolerated dose. At this dose, everolimus C 0 of up to 17.0 ng/mL have been observed, with large interindividual differences. In patients with m etastatic renal cell carcinoma (n = 42), the median everolimus C 0 was 14.1 ng/mL (range, 2.6 –91.5 ng/mL). Fourteen (67%) versus 8 (38%) patients with median everolimus C 0 above or below 14.1 ng/ mL, respectively, were progression -free at 6 months (P =0.06) ; median progression -free survival was 13.3 versus 3.9 months, respectively [hazard ratio (HR), 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33 –1.31; P = 0.23], and median overall survival was 26.2 versus 9.9 months, respectively (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.28 –1.37; P =0.24).59 Everolimus is orally active, with linear (dose -proportional) PK. Absorption is rapid, with peak concentration reached within 1.5 –2 hours. The free fraction of everolimus (EVR) in plasma is approximately 0.26. There is a good correlation between predose or C0 and area under the concentration –time curve (AUC) at steady state. In blood, everolimus is highly incorporated into erythrocytes, and there is evidence that this binding is concentration dependent, justifying the use of whole blood rather than plasma fo r EVR quantification. Everolimus has a long half -life of approximately 30 hours. Steady -state concentrations are, therefore, generally achieved within 4 –7 days. Everolimus is a substrate of both the efflux pump known as the ATP -binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1; P -glycoprotein) and the CYP metabolic enzyme (particularly CYP3A4, with CYP3A5 and CYP2C8 playing minor roles). Everolimus is prone to substantial PK variability and numerous drug -drug interactions because of the involvement of ABCB1 and CYP3A4 in its PKs. Data regarding the effect of CYP3A4 genetic variations on EVR PK (or pharmacodynamics) are still scarce. The CYP3A4*1B allele (rs2740574; c. -392G.A) showed no association with EVR dose -normalized concentrations in lung transplant recipie nts. No significant influence on everolimus PK was observed in relation to the CYP3A4*22 (rs35599367; c.522191C.T) variant, which was found in 9 of 97 patients; 8 were heterozygous carriers and 1 was a homozygous carrier of the CYP3A4*22 allele. Six studie s have been reported to date, showing no association between the common CYP3A5*3 allele (rs776746; c.219 -237G.A) and everolimus blood concentrations, dose requirement, or PK parameters estimated using population PK approaches. No studies found a significan t relationship between everolimus dosing or blood concentrations and CYP2C8 genotype, which denotes 2 highly linked variants, rs11572080 (c.416G.A; p.R139K) and rs10509681 (c.1196A.G; p.K399R), occurring at relatively high frequency in whites (11% –14%), bu t rarely in Asians and Africans. This is consistent with its minor role in everolimus metabolism. A study in lung transplant recipients failed to demonstrate any association with CYP2C8*2 (rs11572103: c.805A.T; p.Ile199Phe) and CYP2C8*4 alleles (rs1058930: c.792C.G; p.Ile264Met), and a study in heart transplant recipients found no association between CYP2C8*3 and everolimus adverse effects. Three pharmacogenetic studies also investigated the effects of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms on everolimus PK in solid o rgan transplantation and none reported significant associations."
55,page_55,"Allian ce A221701 56 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 Population PK models of everolimus have been developed. A model in heart transplant recipients reported an apparent clearance and distribution volume of 3.33 ± 0.20 L/h and 146 ± 33 L, respec tively, and a significant influence of bilirubin concentration on clearance. In kidney transplant recipients, using a 2 -compartment structural model with first-order absorption with lag time, ideal body weight was found to be significantly related to the v olume of distribution . The intrapatient PK variability of everolimus is reported to be high (45% for C 0, 27% for the AUC in de novo kidney transplant recipients administered CsA), as is interindividual variability (55% for C 0, 31% for the AUC). In a multip le-dose study in kidney transplant recipients, a high -fat meal delayed t max by a median of 1.75 hours and reduced C max by 53% and AUC by 21%. Everolimus C0 showed no food effect, suggesting that although overall exposure is prone to a food effect, this doe s not translate into C 0 variations. We believe we will find in this study that the interpatient variability in eve rolimus exposure (C0) exceeds 50% and that there is a correlation between everolimus exposure ( C0) and its toxicity and the use of dexamethasone. 14.2.2 Objectives 1. To determine the intrapatient and interpatient variability of everolimus exposure (C0) in cancer patients being treated with everolimus. 2. To explore the association of everolimus exposure (C 0) with toxicity 14.2.3 Methods Venous blood samples for everolimus trough concentrations (C 0) will be obtained at baseline, and at the 8 weeks scheduled follow -up clinic visit (and optional at 4 weeks) while still receiving study drug therapy. These samples will have the time of day they were obtained documented. At these follow up visits a patient questionnaire will be filled in which will request information about the timing of prior dosing of everolimus (See Appendix VIII) . This will detail the time of day the last dose of stu dy drug was taken. Drug concentrations will be measured in whole blood using an Liquid Chromatography Tandem -Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) assay to be implemented in the Alliance Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetic core lab at the Univ ersity of Pittsburgh using a modification of e.g. the assay published b y Tszyrsznic, W et al.60 Frequentist approaches will be used for correlation, and if data permits, population modeling approaches may also be employed. 14.2.4 Analyses Objective 1 : We will calculate C 0 variability at 8 weeks as a metric of interpatient variability; while the inclusion of data from 4 week samples will allow calculation of intrapatient variability. We will approach this using a frequentist approach. Objective 2: We will explore relationships between C0 and mucosal toxicity, and dexamethasone use."

We are asking you to take part in a research st udy. We do research studies to try to answer questions about how to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases like cancer ; to reduce side effects from cancer and cancer treatment and to improve the quality of life of cancer patients. We are asking you to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with cancer and you will be receiving a drug called e verolim us as part of your usual care . It is known that this drug can cause painful mouth sores, which can interfere with activities of daily li ving, including eating and drinking. Patients who are not in this study are usually treated for these sores with rinses (or mouthwashes) containing different drugs such as lidocaine to numb the pain . Previous small studies have shown that dexamethasone can help with treating mouth sores. This study is being done to see if dexamethasone can help prevent getting the mouth sores . T aking part in this study is your choice. You can choose to take part or you can choose not to take part in this study. You a lso can change your mind at any time. Whatever choice you make, you will not lose access to your medical care or give up any legal rights or benefits. This document has important information to help you make your choice. Take time to read it. Talk to yo ur doctor, family, or friends about the risks and benefits of taking part in the study. It’s important that you have as much information as you need and that all your questions are answered. See the “Where can I get more information?” section for resourc es for more clinical trials and general cancer information. This study is conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, a national clinical research group supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) . The Alliance is made up of cancer doctors, health professiona ls, patient advocates and laboratory researchers, whose goal is"

Why i s this study being done? This study is being done to answer the following question: Can we lower the chance of getting painful mouth sores by treating you with a dexamethasone mouthwash at the start of your cancer treatment ? We are doing this study to f ind out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for preventing painful mouth sores . The usual approach is defi ned as care most people get for painful mouth sores. What is the usual approach to preventing painful mouth sores? The usual approach is to wait until mouth sores develop before they are treated with medications that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). What are my choices if I decide not to take part in this study? • You may choose to have the usual approach described above. • You may choose to take part in a different research study, if one is available. • You may choose to not get treated. What will happen if I decide to take part in this study? If you decide to take part in this study, you will either get dexamethasone mouthwash for up to eight weeks, or you will get placebo for up to eight weeks, or until you develop mouth pain at which time you will be asked to fill a prescription to start a dexamethasone mouthwash. During the eight week study period, your doctor will watch you for side effects."

It is important for you to think carefully about these as you make your decision. Risks We want to make sure you know about a few key risks right now. We give you more information in the “What risks can I expect from taking part in this st udy?” section. If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that the mouth pain will be worse than it would have been otherwise. There is also a risk that you could have side effects from the dexamethasone mouthwash . These side effects may be worse and may be different than you would get with the usual approach for treating mouth sores. Some of the most common side effects that the study doctors know about are: • Increased blood sugars • Insomnia • Change in energy level • Stomach Upset There may be some risks that the study doctors do not yet know about. Benefits There is evidence that dexamethasone mouthwash is effective in treating mouth sores, so taking it before mouth sores start may help pre vent you from developing mouth pain. It is not possible to know if the mouthwash will prevent your mouth sores as compared to the usual approach. This study will help the study doctors learn things that will help other people in the future . If I decide to take part in this stud y, can I stop later? Yes, you can decide to stop taking part in the study at any time. If you decide to stop, let your study doctor know as soon as possible. If you stop, you can decide if you want to keep letting the study doctor know how you are doin g. Your study doctor will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affect your health or your willingness to continue in the study."

The study doctor may take you off the study if: • Your health changes and the study is no longer in your best interest. • New information becomes available and the study is no longer in your best interest. • You do not follow the study rules. • For women: You become pregnant while on the study. • The study is stopped by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or study spon sor (NCI) . The study sponsor is the organization who oversees the study. It is important that you understand the information in the in formed consent before making your decision. Please read, or have someone read to you, the rest of this document. If there is anything you don’t understand, be sure to ask your study doctor or nurse. What is the purpose of this study? You have cancer and will be receiving everolimus , which may cause painful mouth sores. The purpose of this study is to test whethe r a mouthwash made with a drug called dexamethasone can prevent or reduce the pain caused by mouth sores resulting from everol imus treatment. The effects of a dexamethasone mouthwash will be compared to a placebo. A placebo is a liquid that looks like the study drug but contains no medication. Dexamethasone has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat other disorders. The dexamethasone used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has not been approved by the FDA for the use described in this study. There will be about 279 people taking part in this study. What are the study groups? This study has 2 study groups. You will not be told which group you are in. • Group 1 If you are in this group, you will get dexamethasone mouthwash, which you will swish about 2 teaspoons for two minutes in your mouth and spit, four times per day, for eight weeks. You should take nothing by mouth for thirty minutes before each mouthwash and at least an hour after each mouthwash . However, you may take nystatin for treatment of thrush (a fungal infection of the mouth ). You will also be asked to c omplete a daily pain log and weekly questionnaire s. It should take about one minute to complete the daily log and about five minutes to complete the weekly questionnaire. There will be abou t 140 people in this group."

66,page_66,"Allian ce A221701 67 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 What exams, tests, and procedures are involved in this study? Before you begin the study, your doctor will review the results of your exams, tes ts, and procedures. This helps your doctor decide if it is safe for you to take part in the study. If you join the study, you will have more exams, tests, and procedures to closely monitor your safety and health. Most of these are included in the usual care you would get even if you were not in a study. As part of this study, a nurse will call you every week to remind you to complete your forms, check on your condition, to follow the effects of study treatment, including managing side effects. Some exams, tests, and procedures are a necessary part of the research study, but would not be included in usual care. Listed below are procedures that will be done for research purposes only. If you speak English , and choose to take part in this study, you w ill be asked to fill forms with questions about mouth pain and sores, sleep, fatigue and your general quality of life . Researchers will use this information to learn more about how cancer treatment affects people. Since these forms are being used for research, the responses you provide will not be shared with your study doctor. If you have any serious health issues or other concerns, please talk with your doctor or nurse right away. You will be asked to fill out forms , • before you start treatment • every day wh ile you are using the mouthwash you will be asked about your mouth pain • every week while you are using the mouthwash and after 8 weeks of using the mout hwash you will be asked questions about mouth sores, sleep, fatigue, an d your general quality of life. • You will also receive weekly phone call reminders from your nurse to use your mouthwash and complete the forms . The nurse will ask you some additional questions about your mouthwash use, your everolimus use, and about the ty pes of food you are eating, as well. The daily pain log will take less than a minute to complete and the weekly forms will take about five minutes to complete. Each phone call will take about five minutes. You don’t have to answer any question that mak es you feel uncomfortable. What risks can I expect from taking part in this study? General Risks If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that the study approach may not be as good as the usual approach at preventing or treating your painful mouth sores. You also may have the following discomforts: • Spend more time in the hospital or doctor’s office."
67,page_67,"Allian ce A221701 68 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 • Be asked sensitive or private questions about thi ngs you normally do not discuss. • May not be able to take part in future studies. The medications used in this study could be very harmful to an unborn or newborn baby. There may be some risks that doctors do not yet know about. It is very important that you check with your study doctor about what types of birth control or pregnancy prevention to use during the study. Side Effect Risks The drug used in this study may affect ho w different parts of your body work such as your liver, kidneys, heart, and blood. The study doctor will test your blood and let you know if changes occur that may affect your health. There is also a risk that you could have other side effects from the s tudy drug. Here are important things to know about side effects: 1. The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side effects. 2. Some side effects may go away soon, some may last a long time, and some may never go away. You can ask your study doc tor questions about side effects at any time. Here are important ways to make side effects less of a problem: • If you notice or feel anything different, tell your study doctor. He or she can check to see if it is a side effect. • Your study doctor will wor k with you to treat your side effects. • Your study doctor may adjust the study drugs to try to reduce side effects. Drug R isks The table below show s the most common and most serious side effects doctors know about. Keep in mind that there might be other side effects doctors do not yet know about.

The researchers lea ding this optional study h ope the results will help other people with cancer in the future. The results will not be added to your medical records and you or your study doctor will not know the results. Taking part in this optional study is your choice. You can still take part in the main study even if you say “no” to this st udy. There is no penalty for saying “no.” You and your insurance company will not be billed for this optional study. If you sign up for, but cannot complet e this study for any reason, you can still take part in the main study. Circle your choice of “yes” or “no” f or the following study . Optional sample collections for known laboratory studies and/or storage for possible future studies Researchers are trying to learn more about cancer and other health problems using blood and tissue samples from people who take par t in clinical trials. By studying these samples, researchers hope to find new ways to prevent, detect, treat, or cure diseases. Some of these studies may be about how genes affect health and disease. Other studies may look at how genes affect a person’s response to treatment. Genes carry information about traits that are found in you and your family. Examples of traits are the color of your eyes, having curly or straight hair, and certain health conditions that are passed down in families. Some of the studies may lead to new products, such as drugs or tests for diseases."
71,page_71,"Allian ce A221701 72 NCI version date 8/14/2020 Update #03 Known future studies If you choose to take part in the optional studies , researchers will collect two teaspoons of blood before you start study treatment, for research on why people have different side effects from the treatment. For this study, your blood will be sent to the Alliance biorepository at Mayo Clinic with your initials and collection date on it. These initials will be removed along with other identifiers before the researchers analyze the samples. Please see the “How will information about me be kept private” section below. In addition, o ne teaspoon of blood will also be collected before you sta rt study treatment, at your 4 week clinic visit and at your 8 w eek clinic visit for research on how the study drug changes in your body over time and if that can change your side effects . If you are not scheduled to come back for a 4 week visit, you don’t need to provide this sample. You will also complete a form every time blood is collected for this research. It will take less than five minutes to complete this form. For this study, your blood will be sent to researchers at the University of Pittsburgh C ancer Center with your initials and collection date on it. What is involved in this optional sample collection? If you agree to take part, here is what will happen next: 1. About a total of five teaspoons of blood will be collected from a vein in your arm. 2. Your sample will be stored in the biobank. There is no limit on the length of time we will keep your samples and research information. The samples will be kept until they are used for researc h or destroyed. 3. Researchers can only get samples from the biobank after their research has been approved by experts. Researchers will not be given your name or contact information. 4. Some of your genetic and health information may be placed in central databa ses for researchers to use. The databases will not include your name or contact information. What are the risks in this optional sample collection? • The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and maybe a bruise. • Your me dical and genetic information is unique to you. There is a risk that someone outside of the research study could get access to your study records or trace information in a database back to you. They could use that information in a way that could harm you . Researchers believe the chance that someone could access and misuse your information is very small. However, the risk may increase in the future as people find new ways of tracing information. • In some cases, this information could be used to make it harder for you to get or keep a job and get or keep health insurance."
