Treatment Arms and Duration: There will be 2 treatm ent arms : galcanezumab 120 m g/month;and galcanezumab 240mg/month.The detail is shown in Table CGAP .7.1. Thepatients will be rando mized in a 1:1 rati o to receive 120 mg/month of galcanezumab , or 240 mg/month of galcanezumab at Visit3 of Study CGAN for the patients who roll over fro m Study CGAN (see Section 7.2). Patients who were in the galcanezumab treatm ent arm s for Study CGAN cont inue with the same dose in Study CGAP, while pat ients who were in the placebo arm in Study CGAN are rando mized to 120 mg or 240 mg at Visit 3 of Study CGAN (rando mizat ion rati o = 1:1). Ifpatients who roll over fro m Study CGAN areconfirmed eligible, the patients will begin a 12-month treatment period (Study Period III ). This will be fo llowed by a 4 -mont h follow-up periodduring which pat ients will no l onger receive any study drug ( Study Period IV ). Number of Patients: Approximately 300patients (approximately 150 pati ents per arm ) will be enro lled f or the purposes of regulatory registrati on, to ensure at least 100 patients per arm with 1year of exposure. It is assumed that 30% of patients will not complete the 12- monthtreatm entperiod (Study Period III) . Approximately 240 E Mpatients will be rolled -over from Study CGAN (120 patients for the Study CGAP 120 mg arm, 120 patients for the Study CGAP 240 mg arm). Approximately 60 CM patients will be enrolled (30 patients for Study CGAP 120 mg arm, 30 patients for Study CGAP 240 mg arm). Statistical Analysis: Effect iveness and safet y analyses will be conducted using an intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion, which is to include all pat ients who receive at least 1dose of invest igational product. Statistical summary will be presented by each treatment arm. In the summary of categori cal variables (binary variables), the frequency and percentage will be presented. In the summary of continuous variables, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum will be reported. Aninterim analysis willbe conducted in support of regulatory submissio ns."

Study Rationale Study I5Q-JE-CGA P(CGA P)is a Phase 3 study conducted in Japan intended to assess the safet y of galcanezumab (120 m g/month or 240mg/month)in Japanese pat ientswith migraine . 3.2. Background Migraine is a chronic, debilitat ing condit ion that impacts the qualit y of patients’ lives. In Japan , the prevalence of migraine is est imated to range from 6.0% to 8.4% (Sakai and Igarashi 1997; Takeshima et al. 2004), whi ch is not different from that in the United States (US) .More than 25% of Japanese patients wit h migraine suffer more than 3 headache days per m onth,which lead to loss of working days. On the other hand, less than 10% of migraine patients have continuous visits to the hospital (Takeshima et al. 2004). These data suggest that Japanese migraineurs have a considerable amount of socioeconomic burden ,and they are not satisfied wi th the value of medical services ,compared to the l oss of payment fro m missing working days. Migraine has 2 m ajor subty pes: migraine with aura ;and migraine without aura. The recurrent episodes of headache is a characterist ic of both subty pes;therefore, they are collect ively called episodic migraine ( EM). A subgroup of migraine patients can gradually worsen into a more severe condit ion with very frequent episodes of headach e, and th iscondi tion is categorized as chronic migraine ( CM). The International Criteria of Headache Disorders- (ICHD -) 3beta defines CM as aheadache occurring on 15 or more day s per m onth for m ore than 3 m onths, and which has the features of a migraine headache on at least 8 days per month . Alt hough the prevalence o f CM in Japan is st ill uncertain, it can be est imated to be approximately 7.0% of the total popul ation with migraine (Takeshima 2004), which is consistent with the prevalence in the US (Buse 2012) . Calcitonin gene -related pepti de (CGRP) is implicated in the pathophysio logy of migraine . Infusio n of CGRP to individuals with a history of migraine can tri gger migraine attacks (Lassen et al.2002). The e fficacy o f small -molecule CGRP antagonists was demonstrated in the acute treatment of migraine (Peroutka 2014) and in the prevent ion of migraine (Ho et al. 2014). Increased serum CGRP levels are reported in EM patients ,as well as in those wi th CM (Cernuda -Moroll ón et al . 2013). Thisevidence su ggest sthat the neutralization of the CGRP signal may represent a promising therapeutic approach for the prevent ion of EM and CM. Galcanezumab is a humanized mo noclonal antibody that potently and select ively binds to CGRP, prevent ing CGRP -mediated bio logical effects. In studies of patients with migraine (Studies I5Q - MC-ART1 [ART -01] and I5Q -MC- CGAB [CGAB]), the efficacy data have demonstrated that galcanezumab had si gnificant ly greater mean reductions than placebo in the number of migraine headache days and other efficacy parameters. In these 2studi es, the m ost frequently reported adverse events (AEs) included : inject ion site pain, upper respiratory tract infect ion, abdo minal pain, di zziness, inject ionsite ery thema, rash, hypert ension, and nasopharyngit is."

Invest igators are responsible for data integrity of the paper diary. Note: the end -of-treatm ent phase of Study CGAN ( Visit 12 of Study CGAN) i s equal to the Visit 3 of Study CGAP. The beginning of Study CGAP for EM pati ents is Visit 3, not Visit1; Visit 3 is the first inject ion visit for both EM patients and CM pat ients in Study CGAP. Figure CGAP. 5.1illustrates the study design. Figure CGA P.5.1. Illustration of study design for Clinical Protocol I5Q-JE-CGA P. At Visit 3of Study CGAP (Vi sit 12 of Study CGAN), the study and potenti al risks will be explained to patients. At this time, the patient will sign and date the informed consent form (ICF). Study Period I II(SPI II): This is a 12 -month treatment peri od. If apatient m eets al l requi rements for study eligibilit y, the pati ent will receive galcanezumab at120 mg/month or 240mg/mont h.Patients that were in the 120-mg arminStudy CGAN will cont inue in the"

Andpatients that were in the placebo armin Study CGAN will be assigned to either the 120 -mg or the 240 -mg armin Study CGAP. Thedosing at Visit 3 is blinded for all pat ients(see Section 7.3) . Patients will be trained to keep track of their migraine and headache days ,as well as their medicat ion use days using a paper -based headac he diary (paper di ary) by the si te staff. Retraining will be conducted, as necessary ,based upon review o f paper diary data. After study drug i s administered at Visit 3, the patient must remain at the si tefor observat ionfor at least30minute spost-inject ion .Following subsequent doses, patients will be observed for at least 30 minutes post -injection if they have a significant adverse event following any previ ous inject ion and/or they are judged by the invest igator to have risk of a significan t adverse event after inject ion. Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital signs, weight, electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) , and l aboratory tests. If a patient di scontinues early for any reason during SPIII , the patient will be expected to take the measurement for Early Terminat ion (ET) and to enter the post -treatm ent follow-up period (SPIV)to assess safet y. Study Period I V (SPIV) : This is a 4 -month follow-up period. Patients will no longer receive investigat ional product. However, patients will cont inue to track their headache informat ion. Site visi ts are every 2 months. Patients who discont inue for any reason during S PIV will be expected to take the measurement for ET. 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 300patients (approximately 150patients per arm ) will be enro lled f or the purposes of regulatory registrati on to ensure at least 100 patients per arm with 1year of exposure. Approximately 240 patientswith EM will be rolled -over from Study CGAN. Approximately 60patients with CM will be enro lled. 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the trialis the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities(Secti on2)for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationa le for Study Design The l ength of the 12-monthtreatm ent period is considered sufficient to assess the safet y of a migraine prevent ion medicat ion,and is consistent with regulatory requi rements . A 4-mont h post-treatm ent follow-up periodis included to evaluate patient safet y during wash -out of galcanezumab .

Appendix 2 lists the laboratory tests that wi ll be perform ed for this study . Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days of receipt of confirmed test results. Certain samples may be re tained for a l onger peri od, if necessary , to comply with applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Effectiveness Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Effectiveness Assessments Not applicable. 9.1.2. Secondary Effectiveness Assessments As thi s is an unco ntrolled study , all efficacy measures represent measures o f treatm ent effect iveness or health outcomes. Migraine headache day will be defined to include both migraine and probable migraine days. Patients will be asked to use apaper diaryto record headache symptoms, duration, and severit y. The use of the diary and of the electronic clinical outcom e assessment (eCOA) system is described in the Data Capture System sect ionof Appendix 3 . In addit ion, the fo llowing scales will be used for secondary effectiveness assessments ,as summarized below. 9.1.2.1. Patient Global Impression of Severity The Patient Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty (PGI -S) scale (Guy 1976) is a patient -rated instrument that measures baseline illness severit y. The PGI -S includes a range of possible responses, fro m 1 (“normal, not at all ill”) to 7 (“extremely ill”). 9.1.2.2. Patient Globa l Impression of Improvemen t The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Improvement (PGI -I) scale (Guy 1976) is a patient -rated instrum ent that m easures improvement of the patient’s symptoms. It is a 7-point scale in which a score of 1 i ndicates the patient is “very much better,” a score of 4 indicates the patient has experienced “no change,” and a score of 7 indicates th e pati ent is “very much worse.” 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments All safet y and effect iveness assessments have been well documented ,and are generally regarded as reliable, accurate, and relevant in this pat ient populat ion. Thi s includes healt h outcom es measures considered to be appropriate for evaluat ing changes in qualit y of life, global funct ioning, and disabilit y (Section 9.9)."
32,page_32,"I5Q-JE-CGAP Clinical Protocol Page 32 LY2951742 (galcanezumab)9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered thi s study , and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during th e study . Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt hcare opti on: AEs that are serious or ,otherwise ,medically important, considered related t o the investigational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or i s reasonably explained. The frequency of follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF i s signed, study site personnel will record ,via eCRF ,the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ion(s), including clinically significant signs and symptoms o f the disease under treatment in the study . In addi tion, si te personn el will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs. Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure or invest igational product, via eCRF. The invest igator will interpret a nd document whether an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, or a study procedure, taking into account the disease, concomitant treatm ent,or pathologies. If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying ,if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosage m odificati ons, or discontinuations o f treatm ent. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience ( ie, immediate ri sk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect considered significant by the invest igator for any other reason: important medical events that may not resul t in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious, based upon appropriate medical judgment."
33,page_33,"I5Q-JE-CGAP Clinical Protocol Page 33 LY2951742 (galcanezumab)Although all AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF, SAE reporting begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, it needs to be reported ONLY if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event ,via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telep hone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation. Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposur e to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements ,any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not ob ligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientsummary eCRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or procedure. US 21 Code of Federal Regulat ions312.32 ,European Unio n (EU) Clinical Trial Direct ive 2001/20/EC ,and the associated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requi rements in participat ing countries require the reporting of SUSARs . Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consisten t with global regul ations and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.1.2. Adverse Event Monitoring with a Systematic Questionnaire The C -SSRS (Posner et al .2011) captures the occurrence, severit y, and frequency of suicide - related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the ty pe of informat ion needed to determine if a suicide -related thought or behavior occurred. The tool was developed by the Columbia group (Posner et al .2011) to prospectively catego rize suicide -related events. Before administering the C -SSRS, study site personnel will quest ion the patient about any change in the preexist ing condit ion(s) and the occurrence and nature of any AEs. Non-serious AEs obtained through the questionnaire are recorded and analyzed separately. Only serious AEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion elicited through the C -SSRS are to be recorded as AEs via eCRF. Serious adverse events must be reported to Lilly or i ts desi gnee wi thin24 hours as SAEs. Any suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideat ion per Items 4 or 5 (active suicidal ideati on wi th som e intent to act, ei ther wi thout specific plan or with specific plan and intent) would prompt referral of the pati ent to a m ental health prof essional."

Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process an d product im provements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he /she has a com plaint or probl em with the investi gational product (or drug delivery system such as a prefilled syringe) so that the situation can be ass essed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose No data are available at this stage of development. 9.4. Safety The primary object ive of this study is to eval uate the l ong-term safet y and tol erabilit y of galcanezumab 120 m g/month or 240 m g/month in patients with migraine for 1 y ear of treatm ent. Safety assessments include the o ccurrence of AEs, and changes fro m baseline in vital signs, ECGs , and l aboratory tests . 9.4.1. Vital Signs and Weight Vital signs will include body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured ,in triplicate ,in the sitt ing posit ion prior to bl ood dra ws and study drug administration (see Study Schedule of Activit ies[Secti on2]).Patient weightwill be measured according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2).Any clinically significant findings fro m vital signs m easurement that result in a diag nosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF . 9.4.2. Electrocardiograms For each patient, asingle 12 -lead di gital ECG will be collected according to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2 ). El ectrocardi ograms will have a central overread, and should be recorded according to the study -specific recommendations included in the ECG manual. Any clinically significant findings from ECGs that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or i ts desi gnee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.3. Laboratory Tests Foreach patient, laboratory tests det ailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Activities (Secti on2). Any clinically significant findings from laboratory tests that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via e CRF . In addit ion, an immunogenicit y and pharm acokineti c (PK)serum sample will be co llected, when possible, for any patient who experiences a potential systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during the study as judged by the investigator. This immunogenicit y and PK serum sample"
35,page_35,"I5Q-JE-CGAP Clinical Protocol Page 35 LY2951742 (galcanezumab)shoul d be collected immediately or as soon as possible, taking into considerat ion the availabilit y and well -being o f the patient. Exact date and time of the sample should be recorded on the laboratory requisi tion form. 9.4.4. Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. Invest igators are responsible for monitoring individual pat ient safety throughout the tri al. If a study patient/subject experiences elevated ALT ≥3X ULN, ALP ≥2X ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2X ULN, clinical and laboratory monitoring should be init iated by the i nvest igator. Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory test abnorm alities. To ensure patient/subject safet y and com ply wit h regulatory guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP/CRS re garding collect ion of specific reco mmended clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory tests. See Appendix 4 . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on 2) ,venous blood samples of approximately 2.5mLeach will be collected to determine the serum concentrations of galcanezumab . A maximum of 3 samples may be collected at additional t ime po ints during the study, if warranted and agreed upon between both the investigator and sponsor. Instructions for the collect ion and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor . When a blood sample is co llected, the time and date of last -dose administration prior to blood sampling should be recorded. The actual date and time (24-hour clock time )of each sampling will be recorded. To maintain the blinding in study CGAN, galcanezumab concentrati on inform ation will not be disclo sed to either the investigators or thepatients until the CGAN/CGAP database locks ,including fo llow-up peri ods. Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will be retained for a maximum of 1 year following last patient visit for the study . A validated as say will be used to determine serum galcanezumab concentrati ons. Sam ples will be analyzed at a laboratory approved by the sponsor. 9.6. Pharmacodynamics At the visit s and t imes specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2), venous blood samples will be co llected to determine the plasma concentrations o f CGRP. A maximum o f 3 sam ples may be collec ted at addi tional time points during the study ,if warranted and agreed upon between both the investigator and sponsor. I nstructions for the collection and handling of blood samples will be provi ded by the sponsor. When a blood sample is collected, the time and date of last dose administration prior to blood sampling should be recorded.

All biomarker samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples ,and any data generated, can be linked back to the patient only by the investigator site personnel. Samples will be destroy ed according to a process consistent with local regulat ions. Samples will be retained for a m aximum 15 years after the l ast pati ent vi sit for the study , or f or a shorter period if local regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by the sponsor. Thisretent ion peri od enables use o f new techno logies, response to regulatory questions, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in drug development or when the drug is commercially available . 9.8.1. Samples for Immunogenicity Research Where local regulat ions and ERBs allow, blood samples for immunogenicit y testing will be collected to determine ant ibody producti on against galcanezumab as specified in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a validated assay designed to detect anti -drug ant ibodies (ADA) in the presence of the investigational product. Ant ibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit yto neutralize the activit y of galcanezumab . Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15 y ears after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if regulat ions and ERBs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y selected by the sponsor. The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests related to galcanezumab . 9.9. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health economic, di sabili ty,and qualit y-of-life assessments of galcanezumab in pat ients with migraine ,except for HealthCare Resource Utilizatio n (HCRU ),will be collected through the use ofan eCOA system , asdescribed in the Data Capture System sect ion of Appendix 3 . The assessments will be based on the fo llowing scales: Migraine Disability Assessment test (MIDAS) : The MIDAS was designed to quantify headache -related di sabili ty over a 3 -month peri od. This instrum ent consists of 5items that reflect the number of days reported as missing, or with reduced productivit y,at work or home and social events; a higher value is indicative o f more disabilit y (Stewart 1999; Stewart 2001) . This instrument is considered highly reliable and valid ,and is correlated with clinical judgment regarding the ne ed for medical care (Stewart et al. 1999; Stewart et al. 2001). Migraine Specific Quality of Life questionnaire version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1) : The MSQ v2.1 is a self-administered healt h status i nstrument, and was developed to address physical and emotional limitations of specific concern to individuals suffering fro m migraine headaches . The instrument consists of 14 item s that address 3 domains : (1) Rol e Functi on-Restrictive; (2) Role Function - Prevent ive; and (3) Emotional Funct ion (Jhingran et al. 1998). The instrument was designed with a 4-week recall period, and is considered reliable, valid ,and sensit ive to change in migraine"
38,page_38,"I5Q-JE-CGAP Clinical Protocol Page 38 LY2951742 (galcanezumab)(Jhingran et al.1998; Rendas -Baum et al. 2013). Clinically meaningful differences for each domain have been established ,and are wi dely used in the literature. Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) and Employment status : The HCRU will be solicited by study personnel while document ing patient responses. The HCRU consists of 3questions, asking about hospital emergency room visits, overnight stay s in a hospi tal, and any other visits with a healt hcare professional that occur red since the patients’ last study visit. Patients are also specifically asked about the number of healt hcare events that are related to migraine headaches, outside of visits associated with their participat ion in the clinical trial. The baseline visit w ill include the same quest ions, however ,with the f rame of reference being over the last 6 months. A quest ion on em ployment status i s also solicited, given the correlat ion and potenti al conf ounding wi th health outcom es measures. Participant Satisfaction w ith Medication Questionnaire -Modified (PSMQ -M): The PSMQ -M is a self -rated scal e which measures patients’ level sof satisfact ion with study medicat ion (Kalali 1999). The scale has been modified for use in this study, assessing 3 items related to the clin ical trial treatm ent over the past 4 weeks : satisfact ion, preference, and side effects . Satisfact ion responses range fro m “very unsatisfied” to “very satisfied” wi th the current treatm ent. Preference co mpares the current study medicat ion to previ ous medications, with responses fro m “much rather prefer my previous medicat ion” to “much rather prefer the medicat ion administered to me during the study .”"

54,page_54,"I5Q-JE-CGAP Clinical Protocol Page 54 LY2951742 (galcanezumab)The invest igator will keep records of all original source data. This might include laboratory tests, m edical records, and clinical notes. If requested, the invest igator will provide the sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ERBs with direct access to original source docum ents. Appendix 3.2.1. Data Capture System Any data for which paper documentation provided by the patientwill serve as the source docum ent will be i dentified and documen ted by each si te in that si te’s study file. An electronic data capture sy stem will be used in this study .The site maintains a separate source for the data entered by the si te into the sponsor -provided electronic data capture system. Some or all of a patient’s data will be direct ly entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF )at the tim e the informat ion is obtained. In instances where direct data entry is not used, the site will maintain source documentation in the trial files, and the patient’s data will be transcribed into the eCRF. Any data for which the eCRF will serve as the source document, or any other data not entered directly into the eCRF, will be ident ified and documented by the site in the site’s trial file. For data handled by a da ta management TPO, eCRF data ,and some or all data that are related will be managed and stored electronically in the TPO sy stem . Subsequent to the final database lock, validated data will be transferred to the sponsor. For data handled internally , eCRF d ata and som e or all data that are related will be managed by the sponsor and stored el ectroni cally in the sponsor’s system. In thi s study , pati ent migraine headache data will be collected using a paper -based headache diary (pati ent diary).Patient migraine headache data will be co llected directly via electroni c patient-reported outcome ( ePRO) diary during CGAN from Visi t 11 to Vi sit 12 and these ePRO diary data will be utilized as CGAP Visit 3 data . Patient -rated scales/quest ionnaires will be collected direct ly via an ePRO tablet device at each visit. Data entered into the electroni c clinical outcom e assessment ( eCOA )system will serve as the source data. If eCOA records are stored at a third -party site, investi gator si tes will have continu ous access to the source documents during the study and will receive an archival copy at the end of the study for retenti on. Any data for which the eCOA instrument record will serve to collect source data will be ident ified and documented by each site in that site’s study file. Case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical trial database. Data m anaged by a central vendor, such as laboratory test data or electrocardiogram ( ECG )data, will be stored electronically in the central vendor’s d atabase system. Data will subsequent ly be transferred from the central vendor to the Lilly data warehouse.
