Secondary objective: • To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), antidrug antibody (ADA) formation, and potential effects of alemtuzumab o n other multiple sclerosis (MS) disease characteristics such as cognition and quality of life (QoL). STUDY DESIGN Open -label, rater -blinded, single -arm, before and after switch study of efficacy, safety and tolerability of alemtuzumab in paediatric patien ts from 10 to <18 years of age with RRMS with disease activity on prior DMT. The study will consist of: • Screening period (0 -28 days prior to M -4) - This phase consists of the screening assessments for study eligibility of patients on current DMT. • Prior DMT phase (approximately 4 months) - This phase consists of the efficacy measurements on current DMT, which will be used as comparator group in the study. Subjects will continue the use of their current DMT (limited to beta interferon therapy [IFNB] or glatiramer acetate [GA]) during this period until 7 days prior to administration of first dose of alemtuzumab at M0. • Alemtuzumab treatment phase (approximately 2 years) - This phase starts with administration of first dose of alemtuzumab at M0, after d iscontinuation of current DMT, and ends at M24. The second dose of alemtuzumab will be administered at M12. The MRI based primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed over a 4 month period during the treatment phase compared to an equal period during the pri or DMT phase . Note: EOTP refers to the end of the Alemtuzumab Treatment Phase. • Safety monitoring phase (approximately 3 years) - Additional safety follow -up and monitoring for all patients treated with alemtuzumab will be conducted during this phase to yie ld a total of 5 years of follow -up since first alemtuzumab VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Immune Markers (optional) • Immune Markers (optional): M0/D1 (baseline), M4, M12, M18 and M24/at EOTP. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: At least 60 patients will be screened in this study to ensure 50 evaluable patients to receive alemtuzumab treatment. This sample size will provide at least 85% power to detect a 50% reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during continuation of prior DMT (Period 1) wit h their number in an equal period after the first course of alemtuzumab (Period 2), assuming 10% dropout and a two -tailed significance level of 0.05. These sample size calculations were simulated using a correlated repeated measures negative binomial regre ssion model with generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust variance estimation to account for the within -patient correlation in lesion counts between treatment Period 1 (prior DMT) and Period 2 (alemtuzumab). The sample size calculations also ass ume an overdispersion parameter of 0.7 for both study periods, which is consistent with the variability reported in other paediatric MS studies. Analysis population: Modified ITT (mITT): The primary analysis will be conducted on the population of patients who have received at least 1 dose of alemtuzumab and also have evaluable data for both Period 1 and Period 2. Safety: Safety and tolerability analyses will be conducted on all patients. Primary analysis: The number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during co ntinuation of prior DMT (Period 1) and in an equal length period after the first course of alemtuzumab treatment (Period 2) will be analyzed and compared using a repeated measures negative binomial regression model with GEE. Analysis of secondary endpoints : • Safety and tolerability will be assessed using descriptive statistics and evaluated in comparison to the adult data for the treatment of MS using alemtuzumab. • EDSS (descriptive statistics, eg, percentages of stable/improved/worsened since the end of Period 1). • The ARR at Year 2 will be estimated using a negative binomial model with robust variance estimation. • The change from baseline in cognitive outcomes will be analyzed descriptively.

Its clinical course is typically characterized by initial episodes of transient neurological compromise with full recovery, followed by a phase of cumulative deficits that may i ncrease with each new episode. Most patients eventually develop secondary progression leading to a constellation of chronic sequelae including profound muscle weakness, impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel dysfunction, and cognitive and visual impairments. MS is typically considered to be a disease of young adults. However, paediatric MS is increasingly recognized and accounts for approximately 5 percent of cases ( 2, 3, 4). Differential diagnosis includes leukodystrophies, vasculopathies, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, mitochondrial defects, and other metabolic disorders. The estimated prevalence of paediatric patients among all patients with MS ranges between 2.7% to 10 .5% ( 3), and it is estimated that approximately 20% to 25% of children with MS experience breakthrough disease activity that may trigger a switch to another therapy ( 2, 4). The onset of MS in childhood typically occurs d uring the key formative years. It can restrict school attendance and has the potential to negatively affect the developing neural connections implicated in learning and higher -order information processing. Fatigue may also have a great impact on activities and development. Paediatric MS patients develop disability, as well as shift to the secondary progressive phase of MS, after a longer disease interval but at a younger age, compared with adult MS patients (5, 6, 7). With increased recognition of paediatric MS worldwide, children are now being treated earlier in their disease course with the goal of limiting long -term disability ( 8). There is no approved disease modifying therapy (DMT) indicated for paediatric MS and the effects of DMTs in children have not been formal ly evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The current treatment and prognosis of paediatric MS are based on that of adult patients, because data are limited in paediatric MS and it is assumed that the disease response in children is likely to be similar (9, 10, 11, 12). Off label use of medicinal products in children without proper evidence poses an ethical problem. That is why the need for clinical trials with children has now been widely recognised and is stimulated b y European Union legislation (EU regulation). Trials of alemtuzumab are therefore necessary in the paediatric population to develop a better knowledge of the drug’s effects in children (safety and efficacy ). VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

There is little or no CD52 detected on neutrophils, plasma cells, or bone marrow stem cells. Alemtuzumab acts through antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity and complement -dependent cytotoxicity following cell surface binding to T and B lymphocytes. It effects rapid and sustained lymphocyte depletion and has shown potent efficacy in treatment -naïve as well as treatment -refractory patients with relap sing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Treatment with alemtuzumab 12 mg/day is efficacious in patients with RRMS and was associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in clinical endpoints, imaging endpoints and compos ite disease measures, compared with subcutaneous (SC), high -dose, high -frequency interferon -beta-1alpha (IFNB -1a). MS relapses are caused by focal inflammatory lesions, which are detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as new or enlarging T2 -hyperinte nse and Gd (Gadolinium) -enhancing lesions, in brain or spinal cord. Prior studies have established a strong correlation between relapse outcomes and the occurrence of such lesions ( 13). A correlation between effects on MRI measures and relapses is also seen in alemtuzumab studies. Table 6 shows the odds ratio for the occurrence of at least one relapse (versus no relapses) for patients who developed a t least one new or enlarging T2 lesion (versus no new/enlarging lesions) over the course of the 2 -year study period in studies CAMMS323 or CAM MS324. In both studies, a strong and statistically significant relationship is seen between risk of T2 lesions and relapse, with patients being at least 50% more likely to experience relapse if they have MRI lesion activity. These findings demonstrate that the conclusion from prior studies ( 13) of a strong correlation between this objective MRI outcome and relapse rate applies also to alemtuzuma b clinical studies of adult MS patients, and support the use of new/enlarging T2 lesions as a primary efficacy endpoint in the proposed paediatric MS study.

Measures to detect and manage these effects were implemented early and refined throughout the clinical program. These measures enabled the management of patients within the studies and have laid a foundation for the care of patients outside of the clinical trial setting. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Common IARs include headache, r ash, pyrexia, nausea, urticaria, pruritus, insomnia, chills, flushing, fatigue, dyspnea, dysgeusia, chest discomfort, generalized rash, tachycardia, dyspepsia, dizziness, and pain. Serious reactions occurred in 3% of patients including cases of pyrexia, ur ticaria, atrial fibrillation, nausea, chest discomfort, and hypotension. In addition, anaphylaxis has been reported rarely. Prophylactic use of corticosteroids was useful in alleviating IARs and is part of the recommended prescribing information for alemtu zumab use in MS patients. In addition, modification of the duration of infusion is permitted to help patients tolerate infusions if needed and symptomatic medications such as antihistamines and/or antipyretics were administered often in the studies. Alemtu zumab treatment increases the risk of autoimmune -mediated conditions. Autoimmune thyroid disorders occurred in 36 % of patients in clinical trials in MS through 4 years following first exposure. Observed autoimmune thyroid disorders included hyperthyroidis m and hypothyroidism, which occurred at similar rates. Serious thyroid related events occurred in <1% patients. No consistent pattern was observed with regards to time of onset after treatment initiation, although the highest incidence of thyroid adverse e vents (AEs) was observed in Year 3 after the first treatment course. Therefore, as part of the risk minimization strategy for autoimmune disorders, thyroid function tests must be obtained prior to the initiation of alemtuzumab treatment and every 3 months thereafter until 48 months following the last infusion. This will allow the timely detection and treatment of thyroid disorders for patients treated with alemtuzumab. Immune thrombocytopenia and nephropathies, including antiGBM disease, although potentially more serious than thyroid disorders, were observed infrequently. Serious events of ITP have been observed in approximately 1% of patients treated with alemtuzumab in clinical trials in MS. Fatality in the index case of ITP, which was reported i n the Phase 2 study, highlights the seriousness of the risks associated with the disorder. However, risk minimization measures including patient education and monthly complete blood counts (CBCs) introduced to monitor for ITP and other potential autoimmune cytopenias in the clinical studies allowed the prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients who subsequently developed these conditions. AntiGBM disease was reported rarely in the clinical program. Nephropathies including antiGBM disease have been observed in controlled clinical trials in MS. Patient education and monthly testing of serum creatinine were effective in identifying cases early to allow prompt treatment. Similarly, urinalysis testing was also effective in identifying nephropathies during the cli nical studies. Accordingly, monthly testing including CBC with differential, platelet count and monitoring for any cytopenia as well as serum creatinine testing and urinalysis with microcopy, must be obtained prior to treatment with alemtuzumab and every m onth thereafter until 48 months following the last infusion. This will facilitate the early detection and treatment of these disorders, should they occur. Infections occurred in 71% of patients treated with Lemtrada® 12 mg as compared to 53% of patients t reated with Rebif® (IFNB -1a) in controlled clinical trials in MS up to 2 years in duration and were predominantly mild to moderate in severity. Serious infections occurred in 2.7% of patients treated with alemtuzumab as compared to 1.0% of patients treated with IFNB -1a in controlled clinical trials in MS. The most frequent infections reported in alemtuzumab -treated VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Prophylactic acyclovir treatment was used effectively in the clinical studies to reduce risk of Herpes Simplex virus infection (HSV) and therefore patients should receive concomitant acyclovir starting on the first day of any ale mtuzumab course and continuing for at least 1 month after the last day of the course. Preservation of innate immunity and relative sparing of memory lymphocytes, together with the preservation of serum immunoglobulins ( 14), may contribute to the relatively low rate of serious infections following alemtuzumab treatment in MS patients. During the course of the clinical studies, malignancies were observed in both alemtuzumab - and IFNB -1a-treated patients. However, the annualized rates of malignancy were similar across all treatment groups, and moreover, the malignancy risk was similar to the background incidence in the general population. The risk of malignancy will be further investigated in a long -term observational study. As previously mentioned, the identified risks of alemtuzumab in patients with RRMS include: • IARs (including cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage events). • Serious infections. • Autoimmunity (notably, ITP, thyroid disorders, or rarely nephropathies and autoimmune hepatitis , and hepatic injury ). Alemtuzumab Post -Marketing Updates in Adult In post -marketing pharmacovigilance (PV) monitoring, infrequent cases of temporally associated pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage, myocardial ischemia , stroke (including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke) and cervicocephalic (eg, vertebral, carotid) arterial dissection have been reported. Reactions may occur following any of the infusions during the treatment course. In the majority of cases time to onset was within 1 -3 days of alemtuzumab infusion. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms, and advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur. Post marketing PV monitoring has also identified events reported as autoimmune encephalitis, autoimmune hepatitis , acquired hemophilia A , thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura (TTP) and hepatic injury. Infrequent events reported as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and PML have been noted. The emergence of these events du ring the clinical development program and post -marketing PV reporting prompted the initiation and ongoing modification of risk minimization measures . In conclusion, there are recently identified serious but rare risks associated with alemtuzumab administra tion. Risk minimization measures for clinical studies are in place, and they have been modified based upon post -marketing PV reporting. Alemtuzumab has been approved in the European Union, United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and several other countrie s as Lemtrada for the treatment of active RRMS in adults with RRMS; the specific indicated population varies by country.

This study is based on the paediatric investigational plan (PIP) agreed with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and its Paediatric Committees (PDCO). Patient population • The patient population intended for this paediatric study will be narrower than th e population described in the adult indication to expose only these paediatric patients with high medical need, having MS disease activity while on treatment with prior DMT. The MS disease activity criteria include having at least 2 recorded MS attacks; at least 1 MS relapse in the last year during treatment with an IFNB or GA after having been on that therapy for at least 6 months , and is currently still taking the same therapy ; and having either ≥1 new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion or gadolinium enh ancing lesion while on that same prior therapy (IFNB or GA), or 2 or more relapses in the prior year, or tried at least 2 MS DMTs. The age group eligible to enroll ( from 10 years to less than 18 years) has higher MS prevalence than younger age groups. Interferon -beta (IFNB) and GA have not been formally tested in paediatric MS patients with a relapsing -remitting course during placebo -controlled trials. However, class III and IV evidence of effectiveness resulting from observational open -label studies have p rompted their current use and recommendation. Nonetheless, in about 30% of paediatric MS patients, the disease continues to be active despite immunomodulatory treatment, supporting the need to explore other therapeutic options ( 15). There are few data to support the use of other DMTs in paediatric populations. Considering the high frequency of inadequate response to first -line DMT and the lack o f clinical trial data regarding the efficacy of switching to other DMTs, this paediatric population has a high unmet need. Alemtuzumab dose selection Alemtuzumab will be administered as a daily intravenous (IV) infusion, similar to adult treatment regimen (course 1 at Month 0, 12 mg on 5 consecutive days, and course 2 at Month 12, 12 mg on 3 consecutive days), giving a cumulative dosage of 60 mg at first course, and 36 mg at second course. The adult dose will be adjusted (reduced) proportionately for paedia tric patients <50 kg based on the patient’s weight. Calculation of a paediatric patient’s dose will be based on patient’s last visit weight taken during the physical examination: • For patients ≥50 kg: 12 mg/day . • For patients <50 kg: 0.24 mg/kg/day (this equ ates to 12 mg/day for a 50 kg patient) .

This corresponds to a cumulative dose over 5 days of 1.2 mg/kg at Month 0, with a smaller dose of 0.72 mg/kg at Month 12. Prophylactic administration of methylprednisolone, antiH1 and antiH2 medications will be a part of the alemtuzumab treatment regimen, to minimize infusion associated reactions. MRI The proposed study will have an MRI -based primary endpoint. Recent publications have demonstrated a co rrelation between the MRI lesions and clinical relapse for IFNB or GA based on meta -analysis of data collected in randomized controlled trials ( 17), and for alemtuzumab ( 13). MRI assessments will be available to investigators to assess safety. The period of 4 months for comparison of new or enlarged T2 lesions on prior DMT versus on alemtuzumab was selected on advice of paediatric MS experts as representing the optimum interval to achieve the scientific aims of the study consistent with current patient care practice for children exper iencing disease activity while using IFNB or GA.

The study will consist of : • Screening period (0-28 days prior to M -4) - Patients and parents will receive information on the study and on alemtuzumab. Inclusion/e xclusion criteria will be reviewed. After informed consent signature, screening assessments for eligibility will be performed. Screening assessments may require more than one visit within the screening period which may last a maximum of 28 days. • Prior DMT phase (approximately 4 months): M -4 to M0 - Eligibility confirmation visit: At the end of the screening period (at M -4) patients/parents will come to the site to confirm patient is eligible for the study. Investigator will check that all assessment allow pat ient inclusion. During this visit patients will be reminded to continue their prior DMT (limited to interferon or GA only). - From M -4 visit to D -14 to D -7: Phone calls (approximately every month) will be done, to remind patients to continue on their DMT and check patient status. - Day -14 to D -7 visit : Investigator will confirm patient is eligible for alemtuzumab administration and will tell the patient to discontinue current DMT 7 days prior to administration of first dose of alemtuzumab at Month 0. • Alemtuzumab treatment phase (approximately 2 years) – This phase starts with administration of first dose of alemtuzumab at M0, after discontinuation of current DMT, and ends at M24. The second dose of alemtuzumab will be administered at M12. The MRI based primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed over a 4 month period during this phase compared to an equal period during the prior DMT phase. Note: end of treatment phase (EOTP) refers to the end of the alemtuzumab treatment phase (see graphic study design [ Section 1.1]). • Safety monitoring phase (approximately 3 years) – Additional safety follow -up and monitoring for all patients treated with alemtuzumab will be conducted during this phase to yield a total of 5 years of follow -up since first alemtuzumab treatment, including 4 years post last treatment with alemtuzumab. Note: end of study (EOS) refers to the end of the saf ety monitoring phase (see graphic study design [ Section 1.1]). VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

A baseline MRI will be performed close to M -4 during the screening period and another at Visit 3 . Both MRI will be taken while patients are on their prior DMT. It is importa nt to ensure that these 2 MRI assessments are performed 4 months (±7 days) apart. • Period 2 : will occur from M4 to M8: The MRI performed at the M4 visit will be the baseline MRI for Period 2. A second MRI will be performed after alemtuzumab first course of treatment at M8. It is important to ensure that these 2 MRI assessments are performed 4 months (±7 days) apart. These two periods will be compared for the primary endpoint analysis. 6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PA RTICIPATION 6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 5 years and 5 months: • Screening period: 0-28 days prior to M -4 from signed informed consent to eligibility confirmation. • Prior DMT phase : approximately 4 months from signed informed consent and screening qualification to prior DMT discontinuation. Alemtuzumab treatment phase : approximate ly 2 years, from first dose alemtuzumab administration to one year after last dose of alemtuzumab administration. • Safety monitoring phase: approximately 3 years to complete the 48 months safety follow -up post last treatment with alemtuzumab. 6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) The EOS is defined as being the “last patient last visit” planned with the protocol. The last patient visit will be considered when the la st patient has completed saf ety monitoring phase (M60). The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. 6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS A partial database lock will be done after the last patient has completed efficacy assessments including MRI at the end of Period 2. This database lock will allow comparing lesion counts between Period 1 (M -4 to M0) and Period 2 (M4 -M8). No formal interim analysis will be performed. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appea rance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor (see Section 10.4.7 ). Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, th e Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance As alemtuzumab will be administered by daily IV infusions in a day hospital supervised medical setting, by qualified center personnel, responsibility for compliance with mandatory safety assessments resides with the Study Investigator. 8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments For IMP provided by the Sponsor: Reconciliation of all used, partially -used or unused treatments must be performed at the site by the Investigator and the monitoring team using treatment log forms. Written authorization for destruction will be given by the sponsor once the reconciliation has been completed. This destruction can be performed at the site depending on local regulations and site specific capabilities; alternatively, study drug may be returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction. The Investigator will not destroy the used and unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization. 8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATI ON A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP(s). Concomitant treatments have been detailed for all phases of the study and are not limited to the treatment received with the IMP (treatment phase). Concomitant use of alternative medications (eg, herbal treatments, botanicals, etc) for treatment of MS is discouraged due to concerns of possible interactions with study treatment. Patients should be questioned about their use of such nonprescription therapies, all of w hich will be listed as concomitant medications. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

If the investigator determines that the patient needs to be treated with another DMT, the patient will be discontinued from the study. Prior DMT will be discontinued 7 days before alemtuzumab first administration. Refer to Section 6.1 for further details. No concomitant therapy with any other disease -modifying MS treatments either licensed or investigati onal will be permitted during the screening and prior DMT period. Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of MS relapse is allowed during the DMT period. Alemtuzumab treatment phase Patients who receive any alemtuzumab treatment will continue study participation even if they do not complete the planned treatment regimen. Patients who discontinue study treatment can continue study participation. If a patient is not willing to continue study participation, all efforts should be made to h ave the EOTP visit performed by the patient. No concomitant therapy with any disease -modifying MS treatments either licensed or investigational, including interferons and GA, will be permitted during the alemtuzumab treatment phase. If the investigator det ermines that the patient needs to be treated with another DMT, the patient will be discontinued from the study. In addition, no other investigational MS therapy, including investigational symptomatic therapy, will be permitted. Use of live vaccines is spec ifically prohibited for alemtuzumab -treated patients for the 30 days prior to the first alemtuzumab administration at Month 0 and for the 2 years duration of the alemtuzumab treatment phase of the study. Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of MS relapse is allowed during this period. Safety monitoring phase The safety of MS disease -modifying drugs in patients who receive alemtuzumab has not been established. Alemtuzumab treatment may have long -lasting, unknown effects on a patient’ s immune system. Concomitant therapy with any disease -modifying MS treatments following treatment with alemtuzumab has not been studied in a controlled study conducted by Sanofi Genzyme. Investigators should consider the potential for adverse effects assoc iated with subsequent or concomitant treatment with cytotoxic or immunosuppressant drugs in patients who have received alemtuzumab. Participating patients are prohibited from use of any investigational MS therapy. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

See Section 1.2 and Section 10 for further details. 9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 9.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint The primary endpoint is the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions on brain MRI, during continuation of prior DMT (Period 1) compared to an equal period after the first course of alemtuzumab treatment (Period 2). The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed by brain MRI. 9.1.1.1 Brain MRI For primary endpoint assessment, two periods have been defined • Period 1 : will occur from M -4 up to M0. A n MRI will be performed during the screening period and another at Visit 3 . Both MRI will be taken while patients are on their prior DMT. The two MRIs will be compared by a central assessor to count the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions. It is important to ensure that these 2 MRI assessments are performed 4 months (±7 days) apart. • Period 2 : will occur from M4 to M8: The MRI performe d at the M4 visit will be the baseline MRI for Period 2. A second MRI will be performed after alemtuzumab first course of treatment at M8. The two MRIs will be compared by a central assessor to count the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions. It is importa nt to ensure that these 2 MRI assessments are performed 4 months (±7 days) apart. It is expected that Periods 1 and 2 will be of the same length ±7 days. “Baseline” MRI will be collected during the screening visit (baseline for Period 1) and the M4 visit (baseline for Period 2). The “baseline” lesion volume for the corresponding period will be adjusted in the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Screening MRI is expected to be reviewed locally by PI only for study eligibility confirmation. The MRI assessments will also be available to the investigators to assess safety. In addition to primary endpoint MRIs (Screening, D -7, M4, M8) other MRIs will be performed at M12, M24/at EOTP, and then annually in the Safety Monitoring Phase. All brain MRIs will be reviewed and interpreted by one or more MRI experts at an independent, central facility with no access (ie, blinded) to patients’ treatment thereby avoiding bias. An MRI manual explaining the instructions for standard image acquisition requirements, dat a transfer, archiving and shipping, and outlining the phantom data approval process will be provided to all centers.

Quality of life: • Established generic paediatric QoL measures administered every 6 months over 2 years. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics: • PK serum co ncentration and PK parameters (C max, Tmax, AUC , AUC last, T1/2z) calculated where possible. • PD assessment including lymphocyte subsets. 9.2.1 Secondary efficacy endpoint s 9.2.1.1 Expanded disability status scale Patient disability will be evaluated using the EDSS ( Appendix D ), which has long been considered the standard for assessing disability in patients with MS ( 19). The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale which ranges from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in hal f-point increments.

The subject must be examined as soon as possible, within 7 days from the onset date of the relapse. Relapses are define d as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the neurologist and documented by the functional system scores. The su bject must have objective signs on the neurologist’s examination confirming the event. New or recurrent symptoms that occur less than 30 days following the onset of a relapse should be considered part of the same relapse. The Investigator can, at his/her d iscretion, treat the patient with corticosteroids. Relapses will not be considered as AEs (see AE Section 10.4.3 ). 9.2.1.3 Cognition test scores 9.2.1.3.1 Brief visuospatial memory test - revised The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised (BVMT -R) is a commonly used, commercialized, assessment tool to measure visuospatial learning and memory abilities across research and clinical settings. A visual display of six simple figures arranged in a 2 × 3 matrix on separate pages is shown to participants patients for three consecutive 10 -second trials. After each trial, participants are to draw as many designs as accurately as they can and in the correct location. They are again asked to reproduce the de signs in the exact layout after a 25 -minute delay filled with other distractor tasks. A forced -choice recognition trial is administered immediately following the delayed memory trial. An optional copy trial is included at the end of the test where the part icipants are asked to copy the figure display as accurately as they can. Scoring of the immediate and delayed recall as well as copy trials are based on the accuracy of the drawings and the location of the figures. For each figure, one point is awarded to each satisfactory domain resulting in a maximum of 12 points per trial. Brief Visuospatial Memory Test -Revised will be assessed at Screening, D -7, M4, M8, M12, M18, M24/at EOTP; annually in Safety Monitoring Phase. Central scoring will be performed by an independent rater who is blinded to treatments (ie, current DMT or a lemtuzumab). VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

The PedsQL Measurement Model integrates seamlessly both generic core scales and disease -specific modules into one measurement system. The 23 -item PedsQL Generic Core Scales ( Appendix F ) were designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization, as well as role (school) functioning. Paediatric NeuroQoL questionnaire Paediatri c NeuroQoL (Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders) is a measurement system that evaluates and monitors the physical, mental, and social effects experienced by children living with neurological conditions. Physical effects (fatigue and pain) and mental effects (cognitive function, anxiety, and depression) experienced by patients will be assessed ( Appendix G ). PedsQL and paediatric NeuroQoL questionnaire will be assessed at Screening, D -14 to D -7, M4, M8, M12, M18, M24/at EOTP ; and annually in Safety Monitoring Phase. 9.3 SAFETY ENDPOINTS Safety endpoints will be assessed by : • AE reporting at each visit. • Physical examination and vital signs: Screening, D -14 to D -7, M0/D1, M4, M8, M12, M15, M18, M21, M24/at EOTP; every 6 months in the safety monitoring phase, and at every relapse visit. • Additionally, vital signs will be collected hourly during alemtuzumab infusion and post infusion observation period. • Clinical chemistry laboratories: Screening, D -14 to D -7, M4, M8, M12, M15, M18, M21, M24/at EOTP; quarterly in the safety monitoring phase. In addition, only serum creatinine will be assessed at M0/D1, monthly in alemtuzumab treatment phase (Year 1 and 2); monthly in the safety monitoring phase (inclusive of chemistry panel). • Hematology: Screening, D -14 to D -7, M0/D1, and monthly in alemtuzumab treatment phase (Year 1 and 2); EOTP, and monthly in the safety monitoring phase. • Urinalysis: Screening, D -14 to D -7, monthly in alemtuzumab treatment phase (Year 1 and 2); EOTP, and monthly in the safety monitoring phase. • Thyroid Function tests: Screening, D -14 to D -7, quarterly in alemtuzumab treatment phase (Year 1 and 2); EOTP, and quarterly in the safet y monitoring phase. • Tanner staging: Screening, M12, M24/at EOTP; annually in the safety monitoring phase. • Pregnancy testing (females only): Screening (blood test), D -14 to D -7 and M12 (urine test). • Assessment of ADA: M0/D1 (baseline), post dose M1, M3, M1 2 (prenext dose), M13, M15, M24/at EOTP; and annually in the safety monitoring phase.

However, some IARs may occur beyond 24 hours (such as pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage , stroke, cervicocephalic arterial dissection, myocardial ischemia , thrombocytopenia and myocar dial infarction ). Toxicity grade (severity) of IAR is based on CTCAE. The timing of IAR in relation to alemtuzumab administration and distribution of IARs based on toxicity grade (severity) observed in the study for both study periods will be assessed. Refer to Section 10.4.1 for details. 9.3.2 Laboratory safety variables The clinical laboratory data consist of blood analysis (including hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis). Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion i nto standard international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. All laboratory data listed in this section will be measured at a central laboratory. The laboratory data will be collected at designated visits as shown in study flow chart Section 1.2. It is preferred that CBCs with platelet count (for monitoring for any cytopenia as well as ), serum creatinine, and urinalysis with microscopy be analyzed at the central laboratory, but under special circumstances (eg, if patient is unable to visit the study center weekly or monthly, or results are needed urgently), the assay may be performed at a local laboratory provided that test results are entered into the e -CRF in a timely manner. In addition, at some visits during the safety monitoring phase, there is an option for the nurse to obtain samples for clinical chemistry laboratories, hematology , thyroid function tests, urinalysis and serum creatinine at the patient’s home if needed (refer to study flow chart Section 1.2). The following laboratory safety variables will be analyzed: • Hematology and differential panel: red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, white blood cell count with differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) and platelets. • Complete Chemistry panel: glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, calcium, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT ), gamma -glutamyl transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, direct/indirect bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, inorganic phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, triglycerides, total cholesterol and creatinine phosphokinase.

If the testing is positive, the patient m ay be eligible after the condition has resolved as per the Investigator opinion (eg, follow -up HPV test is negative or cervical abnormality has been effectively treated). An annual follow -up is recommended. • Tuberculosis test screening. It should be perform ed as per local health care authority recommendations. Pregnancy testing: β -Human chorionic gonadotropin. In accordance with international recommendations (20), sampling blood volume will be minimized to approximately 1% of total blood volume at each visit and approximately 3% of total blood volume over a 4 week period. Blood sample volume will range from 9 to 57 ml, depending on test s required at study visits (ie, an average blood sample amount of 23 ml per visit). The total amount of blood withdrawn will be approximately 350 ml in Year 1 and 200 ml in Year 2. During the safety monitoring phase, approximately 120 ml will be drawn each year. How ever, additional blood samples may be collected at the Investigator’s discretion for patient safety monitoring. 9.3.3 ITP, cytopenia, and antiGBM surveillance and monitoring In an effort to identify ITP early and minimize the risk of bleeding due to low platelet counts, this protocol requires safety measures including monthly blood testing to monitor CBCs with platelet count for monitoring for any cytopenia . Patients with certain ab normalities may be required to have more frequent blood tests. See Appendix B (Immune thrombocytopenia). If a cytopenia is suspected, appropriate medical intervention should be promptly initiated, including referral to speciali st. Alemtuzumab has also been associated with antiGBM disease, which can cause a pulmonaryrenal syndrome known as Goodpasture’s disease ( 21, 22). AntiGBM disease is a rare autoimmune disorder in which circulating antibodies are directed against an antigen normally present in the basement membranes of renal glomeruli and pulmonary alveoli. The target antigen is the alpha -3 chain of type IV collagen. The resultant clinical syndrome encompasses a spectrum ranging from mild or no renal involvement to rapidly progressive glomerulonephriti s. Patients may develop pulmonary hemorrhage. In an effort to identify potential cases of antiGBM disease early, all patients in the study will undergo monthly evaluation of serum creatinine levels alone or as part of a full chemistry panel and laboratory urinalysis (minimally including examination of protein and hemoglobin) with VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Follow up of abnormal results will be guided by the algorithm below in Appendix B (Anti -Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease). 9.3.4 Hemophagocy tic lymphohistiocytosis During postmarketing use, HLH has been reported in patients treated with alemtuzumab. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a life -threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation, including fever, swollen lymph nodes, bruising or skin rash. It is associated with high mortality rates if not recognized early and treated. Sympto ms have been reported to occur within a few months to four years following the initiation of treatment. Patients who develop disease manifestations of pathologic immune activation should be evaluated immediately, and a diagnosis of HLH as well as referral of the patient to a specialist should be considered. 9.3.5 Physical examination and vital signs Whenever possible, the same physician should perform the physical examination at all stu dy visits. The findings of each examination will be recorded. A standard physical examination for clinical and neurological assessments which includes examination of major body systems, height and body weight will be performed. Physical examination and vit al signs will be performed at screening, D -14 to D -7, M0/D1, M4, M8, M12, M15, M18, M21, M24/at EOTP; every 6 months safety monitoring phase, and at every relapse visit. The following vital signs: respiratory rate, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body temperature, will be measured during each physical examination and at the following timepoints during alemtuzumab treatment: • Before methylprednisolone infusion. • At a time after methylprednisolone infusion an d prior to alemtuzumab infusion . • 1 hour after the start of alemtuzumab infusion and hourly during and after infusion, until 2 hours after infusion has ended or longer until stabilization . Body temperature will be collected using the same method at each assessment for a given patient. Blood pressure will be measured under standardized conditions using the same method at each assessment for a given patient. It will be determined at each study visit using a well calibrated apparatus. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure must be recor ded. The date of the first menarche should be captured if applicable. The Tanner stage ( Appendix E ) should be assessed until complete sexual maturity at the specified time points, see Study flowchart Section 1.2 for further details. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

The scale defines physical measurements of development based on external primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as the size of the breasts, genitalia, and development of pubic hair. Tanner scale is performed either at the study site by the paediatric neurologist or paediatrician or at a designated site arra nged by the Investigator. 9.3.6 Other safety endpoints The other safety endpoints will be assessed by: • Antidrug antibody formation (ADA). Assessment of ADA formation will be performed at M0/D1 (baseline), post dose, M1, M3, M12 (prenext dose), M13, M15, M24/at EOTP, and annually in the safety monitoring phase. IV infusion of alemtuzumab has been associated with the development of antialemtuzumab antibodies and inhibitory antibodies. Ser um samples will be tested by established assay methods for the presence of antialemtuzumab antibodies and titers will be quantified for positive samples. 9.4 EXPLORATORY ENDPOINT T1 weighted lesions and brain volume will be assessed on MRI as an exploratory endpoint MRI throughout the study period. 9.5 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLE S 9.5.1 Immune markers (optional) Based on the increased risk of autoimmune events observed with alemtuzumab, serum will be collected to support investigation of potential biomarkers predictive of the response to alemtuzumab . The markers to be tested may include cytokines and possibly other serum components; the specific markers to be assessed will be guided by results of ongoing biomarker investigations with alemtuzumab. If the patient accepts to sign the specific informed c onsent form ( ICF), “Future Use of Samples”, serum samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cell will be collected at the visit specified in the study flow chart (designated “immune markers”) and these samples will be stored to support future investigation of potential biomarkers predictive of autoimmunity, such as serum cytokines. 9.6 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS The primary endpoint is the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during continuation of prior DMT (Period 1) and during an approximately equal period of time after Course 1 of alemtuzumab treatment (Period 2) This endpoint was agreed upon by the P aediatric Committee (PDCO to protect the study population from any significant treatment -free period and provide an analysis of VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

The number of new or enlarging hyperintense lesions as detected by T2 -weighted MRI has been used as a surrogate marker of efficacy in MS studies (25, 26). Cranial MRI will be perf ormed at the times specified in Section 1.2. In the analysis of secondary endpoints , 4 primary areas will be prioritized. Safety and tolerability for up to 4 years after last dose of alemtuzumab will be assessed using descriptive stati stics and evaluated in comparison to the adult data for the treatment of MS using alemtuzumab. Adverse events of special interest will be examined including the subsequent development of infusion - related reactions, events of autoimmunity particularly thyro id, ITP and nephropathies; serious infections. Certain exclusion criteria related to prior disease states associated with such reactions will be emphasized during screening. Routine lab monitoring during the course of the study and followup over 4 years fo llowing last infusion is planned. EDSS score changes occurring following Period 1 will be analyzed. The EDSS will be performed by the neurologist at the following visits: Screening, Day -14 to Day -7, Months 4, 8, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24/at EOTP , every 6 mo nths in the safety monitoring phase, and at every relapse visit. The EDSS has long been considered the standard for assessing disability in patients with MS (27, 28). The a nnualized relapse rate (ARR) will be assessed at Year 2 . The annualized r elapse rate is widely used and generally accepted as an indicat or of the efficacy of drugs to reduce cerebral inflammation in MS studies (27, 28). Cognition test scores (BVMT -R and SDMT) will be tested over 2 years. Cognitive decline is recognized as a prevalent and debilitating symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), especially deficits in episodic memory and processing speed. The change from baseline in cognitive outcomes are to be analysed descriptively. The SDMT is a test of speed that screens for organic cerebral dysfunction and has been validated and used in numerous MS clinical trials (29, 30). The BVMT -R is a test of memory that has been validated in MS and has been used in clinical trials (31). Quality of life measures will be assessed using the validated pediatric Neuro -QOL which will be measured at least every 6 months over 2 years. This measure assesses how disease and health factors affects children’s lives (32). VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for nonpatient contact follow -up, eg, medical records check. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow -up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. If possible , the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end -of-study visit. Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited must be documented. Preferably the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent i n writing. All study withdrawals must be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason shou ld be documented. For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws consent for follow -up, the Investigator must make the best effort to recontact the patient (eg, contact patient’s family or private physician, review available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact s uch patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow -up for their primary endpoints will be considered. 10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events 10.4.1.1 Adverse event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not n ecessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death, or , VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, corrective treat ment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s). • The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follo w all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor in the protocol and informed consent. At the prespecified study end date, patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death and related data will be collected. • When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that p atient. • Laboratory, vital signs are to be recorded as AEs only if: - Symptomatic and/or , - Requiring either corrective tr eatment or consultation, and/or, - Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or , - Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, a nd/or , - Defined as an AESI. In this protocol, symptoms and signs of exacerbation or worsening of the disease under trial will usually be captured in the context of efficacy assessment, and recorded on the relapse module of the e -CRF. Therefore, symptoms, r elapses or worsening of MS will not be considered as AEs nor captured on the AE module of the e -CRF unless this event is considered possibly or probably related to the IMP (ie, worsening is not consistent with the anticipated natural progression of the disease) and/or the MS relapse meets the criteria for a serious AE (eg, requires hospitalization). However, for all associated symptoms or events or if an event that was initially considered a possible MS relapse but upon evaluation is found to be any other t ype of event (some example but not limited to: fever, injury, musculoskeletal event, systemic illness, mood disorder, etc) the event must be captured as an AE/SAE.

It will be in compliance with the International Council for Harmonization (ICH) and Food and Drug Administration’s Guidance for Industry: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials. The Sponsor or its designee will perform the statistical analysis of the data from this study. The analysis will be performed using the SAS® statistical software system Version 9.1 or higher. 11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE At least 60 patients aged from 10 years to less than 18 years will be screened in this study to account for screen failures, to ensure that at least 50 patients are evaluable. According to the means and variability reported in other paediatric MS studies ( 17), it was assumed that there is an average of 9 new or enlarging T2 lesions during continuation of prior DMT (Period 1) and an overdispersion parameter of 0.7 for both study periods. Further assuming a conservative within - person correlation of 0.25 for the lesion counts, a 10% dropout rate, and a two -tailed significance level of 0 .05, this sample size will provide at least 85% power to detect a 50% reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions after the first course of alemtuzumab (Period 2) compared to the equal -length Period 1. These sample size calculations were simulat ed using a correlated, repeated measures negative binomial regression model with GEE with robust variance estimation to account for the within -patient correlation in lesion counts between treatment Period 1 (prior DMT) and Period 2 (alemtuzumab). 11.2 DISPOSIT ION OF PATIENTS Appropriate tracking documents for screening, enrollment and follow -up of patients will be established in each center, as needed and in accordance with local regulations. Screened patients are defined as any patient who signed the informed consent. This is an open -label, single -arm, before and after switch study without randomization. Patients who were screened but did not receive any dose of alemtuzumab will b e reported separately, but will not be included in any efficacy or safety population. 11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 11.3.1 Modified Intent -to-treat population Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT ): The primary analysis will be conducted on the population of patients who have received at least 1 dose of alemtuzumab and also have evaluable data for both Period 1 and Period 2. The mITT population will be used for the analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Safety and tolerability analyses will be conducted on all patients in the safety population . At the first database lock after the last patient has completed effic acy asses sments including MRI at end of Period 2, some patients will ha ve follow -up beyond the end of P eriod 2, all available information will be used for safety and tolerability analyses. PK: the PK population consists of patients who have received at lea st 1 dose of alemtuzumab and also have evaluable PK data. PD: the PD population consists of patients who have received at least 1 dose of alemtuzumab and also have evaluable PD data. For patient study status, the total number of patients in each of the fol lowing categories will be presented in the clinical study report using a flowchart diagram or summary table: • Screened patients . • Screened failure patients and reasons for screen failure (if data is available) . • Number and percentage of patients who did not complete prior DMT phase, with corresponding reasons . • Number and percentage of patients who did not complete Period 2 with alemtuzumab, with corresponding reasons . • Number and percentage of patients who did not complete safety monitoring phase (will be included in final study report only), with corresponding reasons. 11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS Analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted using the mITT popul ation. Analyses for the safety endpoints will be conducted using the safety population. Analyses for the PD endpoints will be conducted using the PD populations. Analyses for the PK endpoints will be conducted using the PK populations. Analyses for the exp loratory endpoints will be conducted using the safety population. In the descriptive analyses, summary statistics for continuous variables will minimally include n, mean, standard deviation (SD ), minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Graphical displays will be provided as appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, all baseline values will be defined as the last nonmissing value prior to the fir st course of alemtuzumab. 11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure Alemtuzumab will be administered by IV infusions in a supervised medical setting at a dose of: • For patients ≥50 kg: 1 2 mg/day . • For patients <50 kg: 0.24 mg/kg/day.

The first treatment course includes 5 consecutive days of infusion, and the second treatment course is administered 12 months after the first treatment course and includes 3 consecutive days of infusion. The numbers and percentages of patients that received each possible level of total dose will be presented in the clinical study report. 11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints Analyses for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted using the mITT population. 11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint The number of new or enlarging T2 lesions during continuation of prior DMT (Period 1) and in an equal -length period after the first course of alemtuzumab treatment (Period 2) will be analyzed and compared using a repeated measures negative binomial regression model with GEE. The defaul t log link function will be used to model the expected number of lesions. The robust, sandwich covariance matrix will be constructed assuming an unstructured/exchangeable working correlation matrix. The primary statistical objective is to test superiority of alemtuzumab versus prior DMT at 5% level of significance. No missing data is expected as the mITT population is restricted to the patients with evaluable data for both Period 1 and Period 2. 11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints The annualized relapse rate at Year 2 will be estimated using a negative binomial model with robust variance estimation. The EDSS, descriptive statistics, ( eg, percentages of st able/improved/worsened since the end of Period 1) will be calculated. Descriptive statistics (eg, mean, median, min, max, SD, quartiles) and 95% confidence interval for the means, when appropriate, will be calculated for the change from baseline in cogniti ve outcomes and QoL measures at each prescheduled, postbaseline assessment visit. The proportion of patients with new or enlarging T2 lesions during Period 1 and Period 2 will be analyzed and compared using repeated measures logistic regression model with GEE and robust variance estimation. The analyses will be similar to the primary endpoint analyses with the exception of the use of the logit link function and the Bernoulli distribution. 11.4.2.3 Multiplicity considerations There is no formal hypothesis testing for the secondary efficacy endpoints, therefore the study overall type I error will not need to be adjusted for multiplicity.

The Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the clin ical trial protocol without agreement by the Sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC and/or notification/approval of health authorities (competent regulatory authority) of an amendment, as required by local regul ation, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to clinical trial patients, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. Any change agreed upon will be recorded in writing, the written amendment w ill be signed by the Investigator and by the Sponsor and the signed amendment will be filed with this clinical trial protocol. Any amendment to the clinical trial protocol requires written approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC prior to its implementati on, unless there are overriding safety reasons. In case of substantial amendment to the clinical trial protocol, approval from the health authorities (competent regulatory authority) will be sought before implementation. In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the ICF. The Investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion concerning the revised ICF prior to implementation of the change and patient signature should be recollected if necessary.

AND either of the following: • A confirmed platelet count equal to or above 50,000/ L but below 100,000/ L on at least 2 consecutive occasions over a period of at least 1 month, or , • A confirmed platelet count below 50,000/ L without clumping documented on at least 2 consecutive occasio ns over any period of time. It is recognized that confounding medical conditions may result in other abnormalities to the CBC, which can render diagnosis more difficult. Nonetheless, any alemtuzumab -treated patient who meets the ITP criteria specified imm ediately above will receive no further alemtuzumab and will be immediately referred for hematologic consultation. If upon review of the peripheral smear platelet clumping is present indicative of pseudothrombocytopenia, the Hematology Panel should be rep eated at a laboratory using an anticoagulant other than ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA). In addition, examination of the peripheral smear should reveal a normal platelet estimate. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

(Clatworthy, 2008, N Engl J Med; Coles, 2006, J Neurol) Anti –GBM disease is a rare autoimmune disorder in which circulating antibodies are dire cted against an antigen normally present in the basement membranes of renal glomeruli and pulmonary alveoli. The target antigen is the alpha -3 chain of type IV collagen. The resultant clinical syndrome encompasses a spectrum ranging from mild or no renal i nvolvement to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Patients may develop pulmonary hemorrhage. Signs and symptoms that commonly occur in patients with antiGBM disease include: • Gross hematuria (red or tea colored urine) . • Hemoptysis . • Edema (particularly l ower extremity edema) . • Nonspecific symptoms can include malaise, fatigue, upper respiratory infection, rash . In an effort to identify potential cases of antiGBM disease early, all patients will undergo monthly evaluation of serum creatinine levels alone or as part of a full chemistry panel and laboratory urinalysis (minimally including examination of protein and hemoglobin) with microscopy. Follow up of abnormal results will be guided by the algorithm below in 2 the figures below. Monthly Urinalysis and Ser um Creatinine Monthly Urinalysis with Microscopy*, SCr (Performed at Central Lab; local lab permissible but not preferred) Referral to nephrologist for non-GBM diseaseSite evaluation, Treat UTI if indicated, Non-urgent referral to nephrologistSee Fig. 9-2Normal SCrAbnormal SCr (or, if baseline SCr is abnormal, increase of ≥25%)Negative for BloodNegative for Blood Positive for Protein and/or WBCPositive for Blood Abnormal SCr (or, if baseline SCr is abnormal, increase of ≥25%)Normal SCr Site evaluation, Non-urgent referral to nephrologist Abbreviations: SCr=Serum creatinine; GBM=glomerular basement membrane; UTI=urinary tract infection; WBC=white blood cells*Morning urine preferred; false positive rate high during menses and one week after. If monthly urinalysis is positive for blood, SCr is normal, and the patient is menstruating, the urinalysis should be repeated one week following menses. If a patient has chronic microscopic hematuria or proteinuria that is being evaluated or already adequately evaluated, monthly surveillance should focus on changes in these levels and on SCr.Continue Monitoring VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"

Boys - development of external genitalia Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent. Testes, scrotum, and penis are of about the same size and proportion as in early childhood. Stage 2 : The scrotum and testes have enlarged and there is a change in the texture of the scrotal skin. There is also some reddening of the scrotal ski n. Stage 3 : Growth of the penis has occurred, at first mainly in length but with some increase in breadth. There has been further growth of testes and scrotum. Stage 4 : Penis further enlarged in length and breadth with development of glans. Testes and scrotum further enlarged. There is also further darkening of the scrotal skin. Stage 5 : Genitalia adult in size and shape. No further enlargement takes place after Stage 5 is reached. Girls - breast development Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent; elevation of papilla only. Stage 2 : Breast bud stage; elevation of breast and papilla as a small mound, enlargement of areola diameter. Stage 3 : Further enlargement of breast and areola, with no separation of their contours. Stage 4 : Projection of areola and papilla to form a secondary mound above the level of the breast. Stage 5 : Mature stage; projection of papilla only, due to recession of the areola to the general contour of the breast. Boys/Girls - pubic hair Stage 1 : Pre-adolescent; the vellus over the pubes is not furthe r developed than that over the anterior abdominal wall, ie, no pubic hair. Stage 2 : Sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, straight or only slightly curled, appearing chiefly at the base of the penis (boys) or along the labia (girls). Stag e 3: Considerably darker, coarser, and more curled. The hair spreads sparsely over the junction of the pubes. Stage 4 : Hair is now adult in type, but the area covered by it is still considerably smaller than in most adults. There is no spread to the media l surface of the thighs. Stage 5 : Adult in quantity and type, distributed as an inverse triangle of the classically feminine pattern (girls). Spread to the medial surface of the thighs, but not up the linea alba or elsewhere above the base of the inverse t riangle. VV-CLIN-0254406 5.0"
