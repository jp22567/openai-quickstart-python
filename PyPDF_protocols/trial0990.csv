Study Design: This multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of M281 compared with placebo when administered by intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with gMG. Following a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, approximately 60 eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to one of 5 treatment groups (approximately 12 per group). The randomization will be stratified first by autoantibody type (anti -MuSK vs anti-AChR), and for patients positive for anti -AChR, the randomization will be further stratified by Baseline MG-ADL score (≤10, >10). The treatment groups are as follows: • Group 1: placebo once every 2 weeks (Q2W) • Group 2: 5 mg/kg M281 once every 4 weeks (Q4W) • Group 3: 30 mg/kg M281 Q4W • Group 4: 60 mg/kg M281 as a single dose • Group 5: 60 mg/kg M281 Q2W During the Treatment Period, patients will attend clinic visits be ginning at Baseline (Day 1) and every other week for 8 weeks to receive study drug (placebo or M281) and undergo safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessments. To maintain the study blind with respect to assigned treatment and treatment regime n, all patients will receive an IV infusion (either placebo or M281) every other week; thus, all patients will receive a total of 5 infusions. Pharmacokinetic samples , vital signs, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained before the start of each infusion. Patients will be observed for safety after the first 3 infusions per the Infusion Manual ; if no clinically relevant adverse events (AEs) related to the infusion are observed in these first 3 infusions, the post- infusion observation period is no l onger needed. The last infusion will be administered at the Day 57 visit. During the Follow -up Period (the 8-week period after the last infusion), clinic visits will be conducted for all patients at Day 85 and Day 113 for further safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessments needed to characterize the anticipated prolonged effects of M281. Serum biomarkers may be explored. Upon completion of the study at Day 113, patients have the option to enroll in a separate open-label extension study where they would receive treatment with M281. An independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for oversight of patient safety during the study."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 11 of 56 1 INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, heterogeneous, neuromuscular disease characterized by fluctuating, fatigable muscle weakness. Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is characterized by the fluctuating and variable combination of weakness in ocular, bulbar, limb, neck, and respiratory muscles . Myasthenia gravis is caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against proteins in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. In most patients (approximately 85% of cases ), circulating antibodies target the acetylcholine receptor (AChR); to a lesser extent (<10% of cases), antibodies to the muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), or lipoprotein-related protein 4 are present (Meriggioli and Sanders 2012; Zhang et al 2012). Preferred symptomatic treatment is with the acetylchol inesterase inhibitor, pyridostigmine. However, to meet the treatment goals of restoring or maintaining full or nearly full physical function and high quality of life, most patients with MG also require treatment with immunosuppressive medication(s) ( Gilhus 2016; Gilhus et al 2016; Mantegazza and Antozzi 2018). This includes treatment aime d at reducing the production of autoantibodies, such as immunosuppression with corticosteroids and second -line agents (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid, and B cell modification/ablation), as well as those aimed at increasing autoantibody removal such as plasma exchange, immunoad sorption, or immunomodulatory doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) ( Sanders et al 2016; Gilhus 2016; Gilhus et al 2016). While many patients wit h gMG can be managed with current therapies, 10 %-15% of patients fail to respond adequately to or cannot tolerate multiple therapies for MG and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness and severe disease symptoms that limit function and can be life-threatening (Silvestri and Wolfe 2014; Howard et al 2013; Howard et al 2017; Sanders et al 2016; Sathasivam 2014; Mantegazza and Antozzi 2018), and up to 80% fail to achieve complete and stable remission ( Mantegazza 2018). Despite medical advances in patient care, a recent analysis of data from patient registries indicates that gMG is still associated with increased mortality compared to the general population, with an estimated mortality rate ratio of 1.4 (range 1.24–1.60) (Hansen et al 2016). Thus, there is a clear unmet medical need for new safe and effective treatments for gMG. Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc . (Momenta) is developing M281 for the treatment of MG, with an initial focus on patients with gMG . M281 is a fully human, aglyc osylated immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody that targets the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) IgG binding site with high affinity, thereby interfering with the binding of native IgG . In cells of the reticuloendothelial system, FcRn binding of IgG protects it from degradation and contributes to its long half-life. Interference with FcRn function leads to a decrease in IgG levels. In patients with gMG, M281 is expected to reduce circulating levels of antibodies by blocking IgG recycling, including the pathogenic au toantibodies that cause MG, and to ameliorate manifestations of the disease. The efficacy of blocking FcRn with anti -FcRn antibodies has been demonstrated in an experimental animal model of autoimmune MG. In this study, administration of an anti-rat"
11,page_11,"M281 Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 12 of 56 FcRn monoclonal antibody resulted in a dose -dependent amelioration of disease symptoms induced by administration of an anti -AChR monoclonal antibody , and a corresponding reduction in serum concentration of pathogenic antibody (Liu et al 2007). In humans, intravenous (IV) administration of an anti-FcRn IgG4 monoclonal antibody (rozanolixizumab) was shown to decrease IgG levels in healthy volunteers to approximately 50% of baseline following a single 7 -mg/kg dose (Kiessling et al 2017). Similar results were observed in a Phase 1 study of the humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody , SYNT001, where single IV infusions at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg produced dose -dependent reductions in IgG, with a nadir of 47% in the 30 mg/kg dose group ( Blumberg et al 2017), and a Phase 1 study of the antibody Fc -fragment, ARGX-113, where a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg drug reduced IgG by 50% and multiple infusions (up to 4 weekly infusions) reduced IgG by up to 85% (Argenx 2017). Preliminary data from an ongoing Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ARGX -113 (4 weekly IV infusions of 10 mg/kg ARGX-113 vs placebo) in patients with gMG sh owed promising results, with 75% of patients in the ARGX-113 group showing a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement in symptoms as measured by the Myasthenia Gravis – Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale for a period of at lea st 6 consecutive weeks (versus 25% of patients on placebo) (Argenx 2017). These clinical studies demonstrate that interference with IgG binding to FcRn rapidly decreases IgG to low but predictable steady state levels, and thus should rapidly and effectively decrease circulating levels of pathogenic autoantibodies to ameliorate pathology and morbidity associated with gMG. Potential Risks and Plans for Mitigation Reduction of Serum Albumin Levels: Asymptomatic decreases in se rum albumin concentrations to a mean of 20% to 25% decrease from baseline were observed in the Phase 1 clinical study (MOM -M281-001). This mild hypoalbuminemia was self -limited over the duration of dosing of M281 and recovered rapidly following dose cessa tion. To mitigate any potential risk of hypoalbuminemia in the present study, patients need to have a normal serum albumin level to be eligible for entering the study. Serum albumin levels and clinical symptoms related to hypoalbuminemia will be monitored throughout the study , and hypoalbuminemia -related adverse event (AE) stopping rules are included in Section 6.7.1 of this protocol. Reduction of Circulating IgG Levels: In the Phase 1 clinical study (MOM -M281-001), subjects administered with M281 showed dose-dependent reduction of circulating IgG levels, which is an anticipated pharmacodynamic ( PD) effect of M281 and contribute s to its potential benefit in MG. It is important to note that the normal immune res ponse to produce IgM and IgG in response to a foreign antigen proceeds during treatment with FcRn blockers ( Nixon et al 2015). To date, M281 has not been associated with an increase in infection -related events in nonclinical or clinical studies. Published clinical studies of other investigational agents that interfere with FcRn have not revealed an increase in incidence or severity of infections ( Kiessling et al 2017; Argenx 2017; Blumberg et al 2017 ; Robak et al 2017). These observations are"

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 13 of 56 suggestive, but not definitive, that the risk for infections associated with M281 administration may prove to be low. Given the theoretical potential for increased infection risk with reduced circulating IgG level s, procedures have been included in this protocol to mitigate the theoretical risk, including related criteria for study eligibility and infect ion-related AE stopping rules. Elevation of Serum Creatine Kinase (CK): Transient and asymptomatic elevations in serum CK levels were observed in 3 subjects in the 15 mg/kg multiple-ascending-dose cohort in the Phase 1 study. No CK elevations were observed in any of the preclinical studies of M281. To mitigate any potential risk in the present study, patients who have serum CK level ≥2 × upper limit of normal ( ULN) are excluded from entering the study. Serum CK levels will be monitored during the study a nd CK-related AE stopping rules are included in Section 6.7.1 of this protocol. Altogether, the current evidence from animal and human studies of FcRn blockade suggests that inhibition of FcRn -mediated IgG recyc ling by M281 may prove to be an effective treatment for patients with gMG. A completed study of M281 in healthy volunteers (MOM-M281-001) showed that M281 was well tolerated at single doses up to 60 mg/kg (the highest single dose tested) and at multiple d oses up to 30 mg/kg (the highest repeat dose tested). This first study in patients with gMG will evaluate the therapeutic potential of single (60 mg/kg) and repeat doses of M281 (5, 30, and 60 mg/kg) for the treatment of patients with gMG, with the goal of determining the optimal dose and regimen for the Phase 3 study. 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate: • The safety and tolerability of treatment with M281 in patients with gMG who have an insufficient clinical response to ongoing, stable standard of care therapy , and • The efficacy of M281 for gMG as measured by the change in MG-ADL score. 2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate: • The efficacy of M281 as measured by chan ges in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and the revised Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life – 15 Scale (MG-QoL15r), • The pharmacokinetics (PK) of M281 , and • The PD activity of M281 as measured by effects on total serum IgG concentrations ."

Following a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, approximately 60 eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to one of 5 treatment groups (approximately 12 per group). The randomization will be stratified first by autoantibody type (anti -MuSK vs anti-AChR), and for patients positive for anti -AChR, the randomization will be further stratified by Baseline MG-ADL score (≤10, >10). The treatment groups are as follows : • Group 1: placebo once every 2 weeks (Q2W) • Group 2: 5 mg/kg M281 once every 4 weeks (Q4W) • Group 3: 30 mg/kg M281 Q4W • Group 4: 60 mg/kg M281 as a single dose • Group 5: 60 mg/kg M281 Q2W During the Treatment Period, patients will attend clinic visits beginning at Baseline (Day 1) and every other week for 8 weeks to receive study drug (placebo or M281) and undergo safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessments. To maintain the study blind with respect to assigned treatment and treatment regimen, all patients will receive a n IV infusion"
14,page_14,"M281 Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 15 of 56 (either placebo or M281) every other week; thus, all patients will receive a total of 5 infusions. Pharmacokinetic samples, vital signs, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained before the start of each infusion. Patients will be obs erved for safety after the first 3 infusions per the Infusion Manual ; if no clinically relevant AEs related to the infusion are observed in these first 3 infusions, the post-infusion observation period is no longer needed . The last infusion will be admini stered at the Day 57 visit. During the Follow-up Period (the 8-week period after the last infusion) , clinic visits will be conducted for all patients at Day 85 and Day 113 for further safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity assessments needed to characterize the anticipated prolonged effects of M281. Serum biomarkers may be explored. Upon completion of the study at Day 113, patients have the option to enroll in a separate open-label extension study where they would receive treatment with M281. An independent Drug Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for oversight of patient safety during the study. The Schedule of Study Assessments is provided in Section 6. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group The study will enroll patients with gMG who have an insufficient clinical response (defined as a QMG score of ≥12 and MG-ADL score of ≥4) to ongoing, stable standard of care therapy. Considering the intended effects of M281 on IgG levels and the role of pathogenic autoantibodies in gMG , these patients are likely to benefit from treatment with M281 and a re likely to represent the target population. A randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study design was chosen because it is the most robust study design. A placebo comparator arm was chosen for this study as it provides the most val id comparison versus active treatment for the analyses of safety, efficacy, PK, PD, and immunogenicity. A placebo arm is warranted because patients in this study are not required to stop their current standard of care medications; patients can remain on stable doses of their current pharmacologic therapies (eg, glucocorticosteroids, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, immunosuppressants, other remedies/supplements) throughout the study. The parallel group design allows recruitment of patients for all treatment arms with the same time frame, thus avoiding the potential problem of imbalance when cohorts are recruited sequentially. The doses of M281 chosen for admi nistration during this study (5 mg/kg Q4W, 30 mg/kg Q4W, 60 mg/kg single dose, 60 mg/kg Q2W) were s elected to ensure safety and tolerability while attempting to map the efficacious dose and dose regimen range for the treatment of patients with gMG. The doses consider safety, tolerability, and potential efficacy using data derived from nonclinical studi es in nonhuman and data from the completed Phase 1 study of M281 in healthy normal volunteers, MOM -M281-001. The no observed adverse effect level in the 26-week, repeat-dose, Good Laboratory Practice -compliant toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys was th e highest dose tested of 300 mg/kg, which is 5-fold higher than the maximum proposed dose in this study (60 mg/kg Q2W) on a dose basis and 10-fold higher on a dose-per-week basis. Moreover, all dose levels administered in the Phase 1 study"
15,page_15,"M281 Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 16 of 56 in humans (up to 60 mg/kg single doses and up to 30 mg/kg once weekly for up to 4 weeks) were considered safe and well tolerated. Analysis of PK data following single doses at 60 mg/kg indicates that negligible accumulation will occur with Q2W dosing, suggesting that the clinically observed maximum serum concentration and area under the concentration -time curve are not likely to be exceeded. No accumulation is anticipated with Q4W dose regimens. The efficacy of M281 in gMG is expected to be related to total serum IgG lo wering. Therefore, IgG lowering was examined to select the doses to predict efficacy. The highest dose of 60 mg/kg Q2W was selected to saturate the FcRn target for the full dosing interval (thereby minimizing total serum IgG concentration), while the low est dose of 5 mg/kg Q4W was selected to target minimally differentiated IgG lowering from placebo at trough. Intermediate doses were selected with the goal of maximizing the potential for differentiation with the percentage of total serum IgG lowering. A single-dose arm at the highest planned dose level for this study (60 mg/kg) is included based on observations in the first -in-human study and simulations that indicate a profound IgG lowering effect at this dose level. The effects of M281 on IgG levels an d the potential for symptom improvement are anticipated to be rapid ; therefore, an 8-week Treatment Period is deemed sufficient for this study. The 8-week Follow-up Period will allow for full characterization of the duration of efficacy and PK after the last infusion of M281 and will allow for observation of the return of PD parameters. 3.3 Study Duration and Dates The study includes a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks, an 8-week Treatment Period, and an 8-week Follow-up Period (beginning after the last infusion) for a total study duration of 20 weeks. 4 STUDY POPULATION SEL ECTION 4.1 Study Population Approximately 60 patients with gMG will be enrolled in this study among approximately 60 study centers internationally. 4.2 Inclusion Criteria Each patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for this study. 1.

For the first infusion, vital signs will also be measured after completion of the infusion as specified in the Infusion Manual . d Full physical examinations to be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Day 113, and a focused physical exam ination at all other visits. Focused physical examinations should determine if there has been any change in neurologic function, upper respiratory tract (ears, nose, throat, and sinuse s), eyes and lungs, abdomen, or skin. e 12-lead ECGs will be conducted at every scheduled visit. On infusion days, the ECG will be taken immediately prior to the beginning of the infusion . For the first infusion, a single 12-lead ECG will also be conducted within 10 minutes after the infusion has been completed . f The patient’s acetylcholinesterase inhibitor dose must be withheld for approximately 10 hours or longer prior to performing the MG assessments (including those conducted during the Screening Period to determine patient eligibility ). All MG assessments must be done starting at approximately the same time of day as performed at Screening, and prior to study drug administration on infusion days. The applicable MG assessments must be performed in the order shown in this Schedule of Study Assessments. Patients may take their dose of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor once the MG assessments are completed. g Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to infusion of study drug. Menopausal women must have an elevated follicle-stimulating hormone level (FSH) at Screening; if the FSH is not elevated, menopausal women must have a negative serum pregnancy test to be eligible, and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1 prior to infusion of study drug . h Patients with a positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result are excluded from this study.

After the patient has signed the informed consent, any new clinically relevant finding or worsening of a pre-existing condition will be reported as an AE. Severe infections and hypoalbuminemia will be considered AEs of special interest (AESIs). 6.1.1 Adverse Events An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, concurrent illness, or clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding that emerges or worsens (ie, aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition) during the study. Clinically significant abnormal results of laboratory tests or diagnostic procedures are to be reported as AEs . 6.1.1.1 Performing Adverse Events Assessments At each contact with th e patient, the Investigator or designee will capture AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examination. Patients will be asked non-leading questions to capture medically related changes to their well -being. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, had any accidents, sought care from a health professional, used any new medications/therapies, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter) due to an AE. 6.1.1.2 Timing Reporting of AEs (including SAEs) will start following the patient signing the informed consent form (ICF). Reporting of AEs will end at the final visit ( Day 113). 6.1.1.3 Severity The Investigator will grade the severity/intensity of each AE using the National Cancer Institute, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 (CTCAE) classifications (https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quic k_Reference_8.5x11.pdf )."
28,page_28,"M281 Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 29 of 56 The CTCAE provides specific criteria for grading adverse events as well as laboratory tests; in general, the grades are as follows: Grade 1, Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade 2, Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living Grade 3, Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living Grade 4, Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 5, Death related to AE 6.1.1.4 Relationship The Investigator must assess a ll AEs for relationship to study drug by examining and evaluating the patient based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below : Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship to study drug; other possible contributing factors can be ruled ou t. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the study drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary . Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship to study drug, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disea se or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition . Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship to study drug (eg, the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug). However, other factors may have contributed to the event ( eg, the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “ possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate . Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test re sult, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship"

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 30 of 56 improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study drug) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (eg, the patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to anothe r etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician . 6.1.1.5 Expectedness The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the Reference Safety Information in the Investigator’s Brochure for M281. 6.1.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest For this study, any CTCAE Grade 3 or higher event of severe infection or hypoalbuminemia will be considered an AESI. These cases will be handled similar ly to an SAE for reporting purposes and reviewed by the DSMB as they occur . 6.1.1.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events Investigators will indicate on the lab oratory report whether abnormal values are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS). All CS abnormal laboratory results will be considered as AEs and are to be reported in the eCRF . 6.1.1.8 Serious Adverse Events DEFINITION An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in an y of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this de finition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency o r drug abuse. REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS The Investigator will report to the Sponsor any SAE or AESI within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event, whether or not the event is considered related to study drug. The report"

Send SAE and AESI reports to: MMS Holdings 6880 Commerce Blvd Canton, MI 48187 USA E-mail: MomentaPharmaDrugSafety@mmsholdings.com The Sponsor will be responsible for noti fying the regulatory authorities per local requirements of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. In addition, the Sponsor must notify the regulatory authorities and all participating investigators of any safety reports of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to determine the reportability of SAEs. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Investigator deems the event to be chronic or the patient is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the DSMB or Sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible . 6.1.1.9 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any AE occurring during or after the initiation of the first infusion of study drug. 6.1.1.10 Pregnancy Any pregnancy (including the pregnancy of the partner of a male study patient) occurring from the time the patient signed in the ICF until 30 days (for female patients) or 100 days (for the female partner of a male patient) after the last dose of study treatment must be reported to the Sponsor using a clinical trial pregnancy form . To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor, via MMS Holdings, the safet y group that will be processing the information (see Section 6.1.1.8), within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child. The patient and/or patient’s partner will be requested to provide written informed consent to enable collection of information pertaining to the outcome of the pregnancy. While pregnancy itself is not an AE/ SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate and must be communicated by the Investigator to MMS Holdings within 24 hours of receipt of notification of an event . An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic,"

Similarly, any congenital anomaly birth defect in a child born to a patient exposed to the study treatment should be recorded and reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention after the patient has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug must be promptly reported to MMS Holdings. 6.1.2 Concomitant Medication Assessments From the time the patient signs the informed consent, a ll medications/therapies, and procedures administered to patients at any time during the study , including MG rescue medication/therapy, are to be recorded in the eCRF. Medications to be reported in the eCRF are concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications and supplements. Other therapies and procedures (eg, immunizations) are also to be recorded. 6.1.3 Physical Examination Height will be measured at Screening only. Weight will be measured at Screening and at all other visits. A full physical examination will be performed at Screening, Baseline, and Day 113; at all other visits, a focused physical exam ination will be performed to determine if there has been any cha nge in neurologic function, upper respiratory tract (ears, nose, throat, and sinuses), eyes and lungs, abdomen, or skin . 6.1.4 Vital Signs Vital signs measurements will include recumbent blood pressure and pulse rate, and body temperature. The patient will be r esting in the recumbent position for 3 to 5 minutes before all vital signs are recorded, according to the practices of the investigative site. The Investigator will determine if any of the vital sign measurements are clinically significant or not clinical ly significant. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in assessment results that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (eg, active observation, diagnostic measures, or therapeutic measures). If a clinically significant change from screening values is noted, the clinically significant value and reason for clinical significance will be documented on the AE page of the patient’s eCRF. The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient with additional assessment s until the values have reached reference range and/or the values at Screening, or until the Investigator determines that follow -up is no longer medically necessary. 6.1.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests Patients will be in a seated or supine position during blood col lection. Patients are not required to be fasting. Instructions for blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping are described in the Laboratory Manual.

A central ECG service will measure a nd interpret the ECG recordings. Electrocardiogram reports will include comments on whether the tracings are normal or abnormal, rhythm, presence of arrhythmia or conduction defects, morphology, any evidence of myocardial infarction, or ST segment, T Wave, and U Wave abnormalities. In addition, the following intervals will be measured and reported: RR, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc. The Investigator will determine if the ECG results are CS or NCS. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in assessment re sults that has medical relevance and may result in an alteration in medical care (eg, active observation, diagnostic measures, or therapeutic measures). If an ECG finding is identified as CS, the patient should be assessed by the Investigator for symptoms (for example, palpitations, near syncope, syncope). Any CS finding should be documented as an AE on the AE eCRF, and the Investigator must to continue to monitor the patient until the finding is resolved, or in the judgment of the Investigator, follow -up is no longer medically necessary . 6.1.7 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C-SSRS is administered by trained study personnel (ie, C -SSRS certified). The C-SSRS Baseline/Screening version will be used for the Screening Visit, and the C -SSRS Since Last Visit version will be used for subsequent visits as specified in Table 2. When the C-SSRS is administered on an infusion day, the C -SSRS must be administered before the infusion. Any patient who answers “yes” to Questions 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation section of the C-SSRS at Screening or Baseline should not be enrolled and should be referred to a mental health specialist by the Investigator. During the course of the study after initiation of study treatment, any patient who answers “yes” to Questions 4 or 5 in the Suicidal Ideation section or answers “yes” to any question in the Suicidal Behavior section of the C -SSRS will be referred by Investigators to a mental health specialist. After initiation of study treatment, affirmative answers to Questions 4 or 5 for suicidal ideation or to any question for suicidal behavior will be reported in the eCRF as an AE. 6.2 Efficacy Assessments 6.2.1 Myasthenia Gravis – Activities of Daily Living The MG-ADL is administered by a trained qualified healthcare professional (eg, physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, nurse) and provides a rapid assessment of the patient’s MG symptom severity (Appendix 3). The MG-ADL should be administered by the sa me healthcare professional for a given patient throughout the study, if possible, and the assessment should be performed at approximately the same time of day throughout the study. Eight functions (talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, impairment of ab ility to brush teeth"

The total score can range from 0 to 24. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity. 6.2.2 Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis The QMG test is a standardized quantitative strength assessment comprising 13 components (Appendix 4) and is administered by a trained qualified healthcare professional (eg, physician, physician assistan t, nurse practitioner, nurse) . The QMG should be administered by the same healthcare professional for a given patient throughout the study , if possible, and the assessment should be performed at approximately the same time of day throughout the study. The quantitative results of each strength component are mapped to the following 4-point scale: • 0 = None • 1 = Mild • 2 = Moderate • 3 = Severe The total score can range from 0 to 39. A higher score indicates greater weakness. 6.2.3 Revised Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life – 15 The MG-QoL15r (Appendix 5) is a 15-item, health-related quality of life measure designed to assess limitations related to living with MG (Burns et al 2016). Responses to each item are rated by the patient, using a reflection period of “over the past few weeks” on the following 3-point scale: • 0 = Not at all • 1 = Somewhat • 2 = Very much The total score can range from 0 to 30. A higher score indicates more limitation. 6.2.4 Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post-Intervention Status The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post -intervention Status (MGFA-PIS) is a measure of the patient’s MG status after treatment/intervention (Appendix 6). For the purpose of this study, only two elements of the MG FA-PIS will be assessed. 1. The Investigator will indicate whether or not the patient meets the following definition of Minimal Manifestations : - The patient has no symptoms of functional li mitations from MG, but has some weakness on examination of some muscles (Yes/No)."

The patient’s change in status will be derived as follows: - Improved = A decrease of ≥ 3 in the QMG score from baseline. - Unchanged = No change in the QMG score over baseline. - Worse = Any increase in the QMG score over baseline . - Died of MG = The patient died of MG or of complications of MG therapy. 6.2.5 Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Clinical Classification This clinical classification system was established by the MGFA for clinician/physician assessment of a patient’s MG severity (Jaretzki et al 2000). The system comprises 5 classes of disease severity ranging from Class I (ocular muscle weakness only) to Class V (the patient is intubated). Classes II through IV are each further divided into 2 subclasses based on which muscle groups are primarily affected. The MGFA Clinical Classification should be assessed by the same clinician/physician for a given patient throughout the study, if possible. 6.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments Patients will undergo blood sampling as specified in Table 2 to determine serum M281 concentration(s). Instructions for blood collection, processing, storage and shipping are described in the Laboratory Manual . 6.4 Assessments of Pharmacodynamics and Biomarkers Blood samples for PD analysis of total serum IgG, anti-AChR autoantibodies, and anti-MuSK autoantibodies will be collected. Blood samples will also be collected for assessment of exploratory PD biomarkers in serum ( concentrations of IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM, and IgE). Additional blood samples will be collect ed to explore characteristics of pathogenic MG antibodies (anti -AChR and anti-MuSK). At Screening and Baseline, samples will be tested for both anti -AChR and anti-MuSK; thereafter, samples will only be tested for the antibody that was positive at Screenin g/Baseline. Blood samples will be collected at the time points specified in Table 2. Aside from IgA, IgM, and IgE, the PD parameters could potentially be unblinding; therefore, results of PD parameters obtained after initiation of study drug will not be reported to the patient, Investigator, or Sponsor during study conduct with the exception of total serum IgG at the Day 113 Visit if the patient does not enter the MOM -M281-005 open-label extension study. Instructions for blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping are described in the Laboratory Manual . 6.5 Immunogenicity Assessments Blood samples will be drawn to determine t he presence/absence and titers of total and neutralizing anti-M281 antibodies, if applicable. Knowledge of anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels could potentially be unblinding; therefore, these results after initiation of study drug will not be reported to the patient, Investigator, or Sponsor during study conduct."

The DSMB will be informed abou t any such discussions, with the reason they were initiated, and any laboratory data that was a part of the discussions. Unblinding of study drug in the event of an emergency is the sole responsibility, and will occur at the discretion, of the Investigato r; however, if possible, the Medical Monitor should be consulted before unblinding. Discontinuation of study drug administration does not necessarily mean discontinuation from the study. Patients who discontinue treatment with study drug should be asked t o continue in the study to be followed for safety and to complete all remaining study procedures as indicated by this protocol. Any new clinical finding is to be reported as an AE . 6.7.1 Study Drug Stopping /Interruption Rules for Individual Patients Study drug administration must be stopped , and the Medical Monitor notified , if any of the following events occur: • A patient becomes pregnant. • A patient develops a CTCAE Grade 4 infection. • A patient develops a CTCAE Grade 3 infection that is unresponsive or worsens while on anti-infective therapy. • Any circumstance or finding that, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, would represent undue risk to the patient."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 38 of 56 Study drug administration may be interrupted after consultation with the Medical Monitor for the following events: • If a patient develops a CTCAE Grade 3 infection, the Investigator may elect to withhold study drug until the clinical scenario clarifies whether the infection is improving or getting worse. • If a patient develops 3+ pedal edema, ascites, o r pleural or pericardial effusions, the Investigator will monitor the patient’s condition. The decision to continue treatment or withhold additional doses of study drug will be made by the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor. • If a patient develops elevated CK levels, CK fractionation (CKMB, CKMM) and troponin will be automatically tested by the laboratory. If the CKMB or troponin level is elevated, the patient will be asked to go immediately to the emergency room for further evaluation. For any patient with elevated CK levels, a dditional assessments will be as follows : - CK elevations <5× ULN - further assessment can be made at the discretion of the Investigator. - CK elevations ≥5× ULN - the Investigator will call the patient to inquire about excessive exercise, trauma, and any muscle or cardiac -related symptoms. CK will be repeated and if there is a decrease, no action will be taken. However, if the CK is of similar or higher level, the patient will be asked to return to the clinic, where further investigation will be done (in -depth clinical assessment, ECG, myoglobin in urine, repeat CK with fractionation and troponin level, ALT, and AST). The decision to continue treatment or withhold additional doses of study drug for the patient will be made by the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor . 6.7.2 Study Stopping Rules • In the event of the death of a study patient, treatment will be held in all patients p ending evaluation by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendation , and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authority(ies) to resume . • If a CTCAE Grade 4 event considered potentially related to treatment occurs, treatment will not be initiated in new patients, pending evaluation by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendation, and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authority(ies) to resume . • If a CTCAE Grade 3 or higher infection occurs in three separate patients, treatment will be temporarily held in all patients, pending evaluation by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendation, and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authority(ies) to resume .

Clinical deterioration is defined as any of the following : • An MG crisis, defined as MG -related weakness sufficiently severe to necessitate intubation, or requires noninvasive ventilation to avoid intubation, or would be severe enough to delay extubation following surgery (Sanders et al 2016), with the respiratory failure being due to weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar (oropharyngeal) muscle weakness may accompan y the respiratory muscle weakness, or may be the predominant feature in some patients. • Significant symptomatic worsening on any MG-ADL item of three or more points, excluding double vision or eyelid droop (ie, talking, chewing, swallowing , breathing, upper and lower extremity weakness). • Any patient whom the Investigator believes will jeopardize his/her health if MG rescue therapy is not given (eg, emergent situations). Depending on the severity of worsening of MG -related symptoms, rescue therapy (eg, glucocorticosteroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis) will be permitted, as per the clinical judgement of the Investigator. Patients who receive rescue therapy will be discontinued from study treatment infusions and PK sampling, but will continue all other assessments designated at the Day 85 and Day 113 follow-up visits. Thus, for patients who receive rescue therapy during the Treatment Period, the Day 85 Visit translates to 4 weeks after their last dose of study drug, regardless of the study day of t heir last dose of study drug. Likewise, the Day 113 Visit translates to 8 weeks after their last dose of study drug, regardless of the study day of their last dose in the study. 6.9 Appropriateness of Measurements The measures for assessing efficacy in this s tudy have been shown to be reliable and valid scales for measuring clinical status of patients with MG. The PK and routine safety assessments included in this study are standard for Phase 2 clinical studies in patients. The PD biomarkers being studied ar e relevant for patients with MG based on scientific literature and clinical practice. Although preclinical studies and the first -in-human study with M281 did not indicate any central nervous system effects, t he C-SSRS will be used in this study as an addit ional safety assessment based on the recommendation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for all clinical trials involving the development of drugs or biologics for neurologic indications to assess suicide risk . The US FDA has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials to ensure that patients in clinical trials who are experiencing suicidal ideation and behavior are properly"

Study related procedures will be carried out in accordance with written materials (eg, study manual, Drug Handling Manual, eCRF completion guidelines, etc). To ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements, the Sponsor or a Sponsor’s designee may conduct a quality assurance audit of the study center(s). 8 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 8.1 General Considerations Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for demographic, disposition , and exposure data. The number and percentage of patients who discontinued from the study, along with reasons for discontinuations, will be tabulated and described in listings. Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and, where appropriate, coefficient of variation (CV%) and graphic representation. Categorical data will be summarized by sample size and proportions. Graphs of actual values and changes over time may also be created as appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size Approximately 60 patients will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to one of the 5 treatment arms of the study. Allowing for 15% attrition, it is expected that approximately 50 patients (10 per arm) will be evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint. The study is designed to have at least 80% power and experiment -wise one-sided type I error of 5% to detect a difference from placebo in MG -ADL at Day 57 with 12 patients (10 evaluable) per arm in the placebo, M281 5 mg/kg Q4W, M281 30 mg/kg Q4W, and M281 60 mg/kg Q2W arms, using a dose-responsive test with the doses sorted in ascending order. The M281 60-mg/kg single-dose arm was not included in the powering as its relationship to other doses is not defined. The change from baseline in MD -ADL in the placebo and 60 mg/kg Q2W arms were assumed to be -2 and -6.0 points, respectively , and the common standard deviation was assumed to be 3 points. Additionally, the ratio of within- to between-patient variance was assumed to be 0.2. Power was estimated via simulations performed in R 3.4.4 (R Core Team, 2018) ."

The Safety Population will include all patient s who received any amount of M281 or placebo. The PK Population will include all randomized patients in the Safety Population with at least one evaluable serum concentration of M281. The Per Protocol (PP) Population is a subset of the ITT Population and w ill include patients who complete the study with no major protocol deviations impacting safety, efficacy, or PD assessments. Assignment to the PP Population will be determined prior to unblinding the study. 8.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Descriptive summary statistics will be provided for demographic data and other baseline characteristics for the Safety population overall and by treatment group. 8.5 Primary Endpoints 8.5.1 Primary Safety Endpoint M281 safety and tolerability will be evaluated in terms of the incidence of AEs (including SAEs and AESIs) compared with placebo. Analysis of all safety data will be performed on the Safety Population and will be presented by the treatment received . Adverse events will be coded using a standardized medical dictionary (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA]). Analysis of AEs in terms of incidence by severity and by relatedness will also be provided. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded by the W orld Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced and will be summarized. Medical history will be listed by patient and coded using MedDRA and will be summarized. Descriptive statistics and a summary of abnormalities using shift tables will be presented for safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs, other laboratory parameters , and the C-SSRS. For vital signs and ECGs, descriptive statistics at each visit and change from Baseline at each visit will be provided. Physical examinations will be summarized as shift tables. Listings will also be pr ovided for each type of safety data. 8.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline to Day 57 in the total MG-ADL score for each treatment group compared with placebo."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281-004 28 August 2019, Amendment 3.2 Confidential Page 42 of 56 The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated via dos e-response analyses, as well as mixed-effects model repeated measures (MMRM) analyses , using data at Days 15, 29, 43, and 57. Dose-response analyses will include one -sided tests of linear trend and rank -based association. Models of MG-ADL Day 57 change score versus dose will be explored. MMRM analyses will include variables for baseline MG -ADL score, treatment -by-study week interaction, and autoantibody type, with variance -covariance structure assumed as compound symmetry. Covariates such as corticoster oids dose, use of immunosuppressants, and duration of use may be explored since MG diagnosis may be added to the model along with different variance-covariance structure s. Further details on the statistical analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint will b e in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 8.6 Secondary Endpoints 8.6.1 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints • A model-based analysis of total MG-ADL score change from Baseline and difference from placebo in relationship to total serum IgG percent of Baseline and treatment frequency.
