SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A randomized, double -blind, parallel group, multicenter, stratified study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of repeat doses of GSK3772847 compared with placebo in particip ants with moderately severe asthma. Short Title: A study to evaluate the effect of GSK3772847 in patients with moderatel y severe asthma. Rationale: GSK3772847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surfa ce interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicit y 2 [ST2], also known as Interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as a n add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2-driven disease. At the time of writing this protocol, a two -part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final clinical study report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator brochure (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832 _00). There are no efficacy data available to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa / proof of concept study to investigate efficacy , safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in participants with moderatel y severe asthma. The study will use a n inhaled steroid titration design in order to evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains protection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with ast hma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma control were induced b y medication withdrawal. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthma control ; however ,studies wit h the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relativel y short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies."

10,page_10,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 11Overall Design: This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, stratified , parallel group stud y in participants with moderately severe asthma. There will be a 2 -week Run -in period following Screening (Visit 1). Eligible participants will be randomized at the end of the Run -in period (Visit 2). Randomization will be stratified based on participants’ baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count aiming for at least 30% of participants with eosinophil count <150 cells / L, which is measured at Screening. Number of Participant s: Approximately 300 participants with moderatel y severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose ICS/LABA will be screened to ensure 148 randomized (74 on GSK3772847, 74 on placebo) participants and 140 evaluable participants. High-dose ICS is defined as fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice dail y (i.e. 1000 mcg /day ) or equivalent. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on investig ational product (I P) or who withdraws from IP having met the primary endpoint. Treatment Groups and Duration: When required, a pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can be scheduled for signing the informed consent, up to 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). The pre-screening visit can also occur on the same day as the Screening visit. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will withdraw their regular ICS/LABA treatment for asthma and enter a two -week Run -in period during which they will receive open label background therap y of fluticasone propiona te (FP)/salmeterol (Sal) 500/50 mcg twice dail y (BID) . At the end of the Run -in period at Visit 2 (Week 0) , participant s who meet pre -defined randomization criteria will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to enter a double -blind treatment period and receive the following study treatment every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8 and 12) while initially remaining on the open label background therap y of FP/Sal 500/50 mcg BID at Randomization: GSK37728 47 administered intravenousl y or Placebo administered intravenousl y At Visit 4, t wo weeks after Randomiz ation, the open label background therapy will be switched from FP/Sal 500/50 mcg BID to FP 500 mcg BID for 2 weeks. Visit 4 will be the beginning of a s ix week FP titration period. Every two weeks for the next six weeks the dose of FP will be reduced b y approximate ly 50 % (i.e. FP 250 mcg BID at Visit 5 for 2 weeks, FP 100 mcg BID at Visit 6for 2 weeks, then FP 50 mcg BID at Visit 7for 2 weeks) until co mplete discontinuation at Visit 8, provided that the participant does not meet an y of the loss of asthma control criteria. If any of the pre -defined criteria for loss of asthma control are met during the Treatment period, participants will be withdrawn fro m the investigational product (I P) and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator."
11,page_11,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 12An End of Treatment Phase (ETP) Visit will be performed 4 weeks after the final dose of the blinded study treatment is administered at Week 12. For participants who discontinue IP earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study, an Early Withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator, after protocol defined study assessments are completed. Three Follow -up visits will be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks (Week 20, Week 24, and Week 28) after the ETP/EW Visit for safety assessments . Following randomiz ation participant s will return to the clinic at least every 2 weeks for scheduled FP dose titration and assessment of asthma control until the last dose of blinded study treatment (Visit 9) .Albuterol/salbutamol will be provided for symptomatic relief to be used on an as needed basis from Screening through to the ETP visit. The maximum total duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks ."

Stud y Rationale GSK3772 847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surface receptor interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL - 33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 [ST2], alsoknown as Interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2- driven disea se. At the time of writing this protocol, a two -part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator brochure (IB [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832 _00]). There are no efficacy data available to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa / proof of concept study to investigate effi cacy, safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in participants with moderatel y severe asthma. The study will use a n inhaled steroid titration design in order to evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains prot ection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma control were induced b y medication wit hdrawal [ Bel, 2014; Wenzel , 2013; Nair, 2009]. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthma control ; however ,studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relatively short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies. 3.2. Background Severe asthma re presents approximately 5-10% of the asthma population and is associated with a greater frequency of asthma exacerba tions, decreased health -related quality of life and greater sy mptom burden [ Chung , 2014; Aburuz , 2007; Moore , 2007]. Current biologic agents approved for the management of patients with severe asthma have demonstrated efficacy for T2-driven disease (i.e., eosinophilic and/or elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE ) however, there is no currentl y approved therapy that targets non -T2-driven asthma. GSK3772847 (formerl y CNTO 7160 which was in -licensed from Janssen )is a human IgG2  monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain of interleukin - 33 receptor (IL -33R) a nd neutralizes IL -33-mediated IL -33R signaling. The IL -33R gene codes for both a soluble form (sST2) and a membrane -bound “long” form (ST2L or IL - 33R). Soluble ST2 exists in the serum and is elevated in severe asthmatics during an exacerbation [ Smithgall , 2008; Oshikawa , 2001]."
19,page_19,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 20IL-33R is expressed on immune cells, such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T helper cell ty pe 2 (Th2) cells and has been shown to be upregulated on macrophages, neutrophils , and dendritic cells. It is also expressed on non-immune cells such as endothelial, epithelial and smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. IL-33 has been shown to be released after endothelial or epithelial cell damage during trauma, phy sicochemical / microb arometric stress or infection [Arshad ,2016 ]. IL-33R signalling causes downstream production of Ty pe 2 cy tokines. The engagement of IL -33R with its ligand IL -33 contributes to Th2 -mediated pathologies and allergic responses [ Yagami , 2010; Smithgall , 2008], but has also been shown to promote Th1 -and Th17 -mediated responses [Arshad , 2016; Smithgall , 2008]. Inhibition of IL -33 signalling vi a blockade of the IL - 33R may result in down regulation of immune cell responses and therefore presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma on top of standard of care [Arshad , 2016]. In a 3 -month good laboratory practice (G LP) toxicology study , GSK3772847 was administered to cy nomolgus monkey s as a weekl y 15-minute IV infusion (20 or 100 mg/kg) and was found to be well -tolerated at both doses. Janssen (Study CNTO7160ASH1001) have conducted a Phase I randomized, double - blind , placebo -controlled, intravenous (IV) single ascending dos e stud y in healthy participants and multiple ascending dose stud y in participants with asthma and participants with atopic dermatitis. The study has completed dosing. The final clinical study repor t is still pending. There are no efficacy data available to date. More information about the non -clinical and clinical studies is available in the GSK3772847 IB(GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832 _00). 3.3. Benefit/Risk A ssessment More detailed information about the known and expected benefits, risks and reasonabl y expected adverse events of GSK3772847 may be found in the IB (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832 _00)."

Risk A ssessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Product (IP) [GSK3772847] Cardiovascular (CV) There is evidence to suggest that the IL -33/ST2 pathway may be protective in the cardiovascular system. Components of the IL -33/ST2 pathway are expressed in a number of cellular components of the heart and blood vessels in rodents and human patients. Increased circulating levels of soluble ST2 are markers of a poor prognosis in patients with hemodynamic stress (e.g. hemodynamic - hypertrophy, chamber dilation, fibrosis; ischemic - apoptosis and infarct volume). The effect was abolished in rodents with genetic knockout of ST2. Atherosclerotic plaque development was significantly reduced in ApoE -/-mice gi ven exogenous IL -33 while plaques were larger in mice treated with soluble ST2 (which binds and blocks IL -33).Non-clinical: No GSK3772847 -related changes noted in (non - GLP) IV and SC 4 week monkey study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week, or in the GLP 3 month IV repeat do se toxicity study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week) or subcutaneous (SC) administration. However, it should be noted that the animals in toxicity studies are healthy and, therefore, are unlikely to detect the potential target related CV liability. Clinical : In Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, several episodes of sinus tachycardia on telemetry were reported in a 20-year-oldmale healthy volunteer, between 1 and 9 hours post -dose (10 mg/kg), accompanied on one occasion by mild vertigo and malais e (no chest pain). Troponin I, N - terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were normal pre dose and Day 5, also normal ECG and vital signs including temperature. The event was considered by the investigator to be likely related to the Exclude participants with existing clinically significant organic heart disease (e.g. Coronary artery disease [CAD], New York Heart Association (NYHA )Class III/IV heart failure) and abnormal, clinically significant findings from 12 - lead ECG and 24 -hour holter monitoring (Section 6.2and Section 6.3). CV events will be monitored (including ECG and Holter monitoring) as specified in Section 2. All cardiac -related AEs will be reviewed by an independent safety review committee (iSRC ). Protocol -defined stopping criteria are specified in Section 8.1."

No specific cause was identified. Data on this event was reviewed by GSK (Internal Cardiac Safety Panel and CMO), and was not considered to impact further clinical development. During 12 hours post -dose telemetry monitoring in Part 1 of Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001, 6 out of 60 completed subjects were assessed to have abnormal findings by the investigator. The abnormalities were considered clinically significant and recorded as treatment emergent adverse events . In Part 2 of the Jan ssen study CNTO7160ASH1001, there were four reports of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of these reports, one participant received placebo and two received GSK3772847 at 3 mg/kg and one received GSK3772847 at 10 mg/kg . The events were non -symptomatic , and a monomorphic pattern (i.e., not Torsades de pointes), which is a pattern thought not to be indicative of increased risk for sudden ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Heart rate (HR) analysis did not identify any safety concern (no pattern of increased HR suggestive of an increase in sympathetic tone). All 4 participants had normal results from exercise test and echocardiogram."

Increased risk of infections & immunosuppression Studies in mice indicate a potential role for IL-33 in infection control. IL -33 was shown to activate neutrophils in BALB/c mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture thus preventing polymicrobial sepsis. Similarly, IL -33 is thought to stimulate neutrophil recruitment from the bone marrow to the pe riphery in response to fungal infection. Mice infected with flu virus and administered an IL -33 inhibitor exhibited a lower number of clusters of differentiated CD90+ and cluster of differentiated CD25+ inate lymphoid cells with consequent impaired lung fu nction compared to phosphate buffered saline treated controls. IL -33 has also been shown to be produced in the helminth infected cecum of parasite infected mice and is shown to be important in expulsion of the parasite.Preclinical : No GSK3772847 -related changes in clinical signs, white blood cell count or no microscopi c changes (inflammatory cell infiltrates) in any tissues indicative of infection observed in monkey 4 week IV/SC or IV 3 month toxicity at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week. Clinical : Safety data from Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) has sho wn the most frequent adverse events reported as infections, including nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infection. The frequency of these events was similar in GSK3772847 and placebo groups (18/45 [40%] of participants administered GSK3772847 versus 6/24 [40%] administered placebo). Safety data from Part 2 of the Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 have shown the System - organ class (SOC) with the most frequent adverse events reported was ’Infections and infestations’. The numb er of asthma participants experiencing infections and infestations was Participants with a known, pre -existing parasitic infestation within 6 months prior t o Screening are excluded from participation in the study (Section 6.2) Participants who develop an infection will be requested to seek medical advice, and subject to close monitoring. EU Regulatory guidance on development of asthma drugs request that agents that interact with the immune system should be investigated for their effect on the host response to infection and tumours. The incidence of infections will be monitored in clinical studies. Incidence of tumours and develo pment of paradoxical immune responses (e.g. idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis -like syndrome) will be monitored in clinical trials and routinely as part of the post marketing pharmacovigilance process. Exclude patients with ongoing or recurrent infections."

Based on in vitro cytokine release data and safety experience in Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 the risk of CRS is considered negligible.If a hypersensi tivity or anaphylactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. Agents to treat reactions should be available immediately. Stopping & continuation criteria will be included in protocols. Painkillers c an be prescribed for pain at site of injection. Patients developing hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions or anaphylactic shock will be withdrawn from the study. All doses in this trial will be administered in the clinic. Possible interaction with live virus or bacterial vaccines As GSK3772847 is an immunomodulator, there is a possibility that the subject will not mount an adequate immune response to a vaccine or even Non-clinical : In the monkey 13 week toxicity study no GSK3772847 -related changes in the T cell depende nt B cell response (IgM or IgG) was observed at doses ≤ 100 mg/kg/week. This data is indicative that healthy monkeys were able to In the study, participants should not be vaccinated with live or attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving IP or up to 6 months after dose administration of GSK3772847 .

Steroid withdrawal is expecte dto augment a pro - inflammatory response in the lung of the patients that drives the asthma phenotype. Vaccination will also drive a systemic immune response to the pathogen antigen that runs the risk of causing some immunomodulation of the lung immune re sponses. This has been best studied in murine models where eosinophilic lung inflammation has been suppressed by systemic toll-like receptor activation.mount a response against the antigen challenge during GSK3772847 administration at doses where near complete inhibition of IL -33 was anticipated.

Benefit A ssessment Efficacy of GSK3772847 has not y et been demonstrated and there are no existent data from molec ules with the same or similar mode of action. Taking part in this study may or may not improve a participant’s health, and may or may not directl y benefit a participant. This study will provide additional safety and efficacy information on GSK3772847. Whilst the in vivo models of T2 asthma support a role for IL -33 pathway in eosinophilic asthma disease, it is clear that IL -33 play s a significant role in other t ypes of immune responses and cell ty pes including amplification of Th1 and Th17 responses in comb ination with other cy tokines [Arshad , 2016; Smithgall , 2008] . Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2- driven di sease. Currentl y available marketed biological treatments for the treatment of severe asthma are indicated for patients with T2 -driven disease, refractory eosinophilic asthma, or patients with IgE -mediated asthma. There is currentl y no marketed treatment for non T2 -driven severe asthma. All study participants will receive open label salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma sy mptom relief from Screening to the end of the Treatment Period. Medical assessments are planned during the stud y to evaluate p articipants’ health status. The assessments include ph ysical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitoring, and clinical laboratory evaluation including liver chemistry and blood chemistry panel at a number of clinic visits. Partici pants will be monitored for changes in asthma control through dail y use of an electronic Diary (eDiary ) and twice -daily PEF measurements. The participants will use the eDiary to record asthma sy mptoms, rescue medication use, and nocturnal awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use. Alerts, indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with instructions for the participant to contact the investigator and send the data as soon as possible. Data will also be transmitt ed automatically within 24 hours to the centralised server. Email notifications will be sent to the investigator as soon as the data is transmitted to the centralized server allowing the investigator to contact the participants in order to discuss the part icipants’ symptoms and evaluate whether they experienced loss of asthma control. Participants’ health status will also be evaluated b y ACQ -5 and SGRQ during the stud y. With this built-in safety monitoring and the frequent visit schedule, a participant will be withdrawn from study treatment due to experiencing s ymptomatic or spirometric changes that meet one of the pre -defined loss of asthma control criteria and will be started on alternative standard of care therap y.The aim will be to retain participants i n the study post withdrawal of stud y medication to follow -up for safet y. Potential participants must be clinically stable on their asthma regimen for at least 4 months prior to study entry . The Global Initiative for Asthma ( GINA),2016 Guidelines advocate attempting to discontinue LABA if possible and step -down therapy once adequate asthma control is met. During ICS titration, the lowest effective dose is determined at the dose, below which asthma control deteriorates. According to GINA 2016 Guidelines ,during this process the patients’ asthma status is closely monitored and a clear plan is provided to the patients with instructions on how asthma symptoms should"
27,page_27,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 28be documented b y the patients and the a ction plan that should be followed if previous therap yneeds to be resumed. Similarly , in this study , participants will have their asthma status documented at study entry , their sy mptoms and PEF will be monitored twice dail y, scheduled visits will be arran ged and they will have clear instructions as to what actions to take with an y increase in asthma symptoms. Furthermore, a potential benefit to the subjects would be the ascertainment that asthma control might be maintained on a lower ICS dose than that whi ch the subject received prior to study entry , with the potential for fewer or less severe ICS-related adverse events. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize the risk to the participants participating in the stud y,the balance of anticipated benefits and apparent risks associated with GSK3772847 continues to be acceptable . There is an opportunity to determine if there is a new drug that can be developed for patients with severe asthma who may benefit from the broad spectrum effects hy pothesized for GSK3772847 . 4.

This will mark the beginning of the FP titration period. Every two weeks for the next six weeks the dose of FP will be reduced b y approximately 50 % (i.e. FP 250 mcg BID at Visit 5 for 2 weeks, FP 100 mcg BID at Visit 6 for 2 weeks, t hen FP 50 mcg BID at Visit 7 for 2 weeks) until complete FP discontinuation at Visit 8, provided that the participant does not meet an y of the loss of asthma control criteria. If an y of the pre -defined criteria for loss of asthma control are met during the Treatment Period, participants will be withdrawn from the investigational product (I P) and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator. Participants will be monitored for loss of asthma control through dail y use of an eDiary and twice -daily PEF measurements. The pa rticipants will use the eDiary to record asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, and nocturnal awakening sdue to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use. This information will be transmitted daily to a centralized server and available to the investigators .Alerts for pre -defined changes in PEF or asthma s ymptoms , indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with prompts to the participants to contact the investigator if any of the alert criteria are met (Section 9.1.2.3 ).Additionally , email notifications will be sent to the investigator, if an y of the alert criteria are met, as soon as the data is transmitted to the centralized serve r. The investigator will make every effort to contact the participants in order to discuss the participants’ s ymptoms and evaluate whether they experienced loss of asthma control. For participants who receive all four doses of blinded study treatment, an End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit will be performed 4 weeks after the final dose of the blinded study treatment is administered at Week 12. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator, after protocol d efined study assessments are completed. Three Follow -up visits will be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks (Week 20, Week 24, and Week 28) after the ETP Visit for safet y assessments. For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to par ticipate in the study , anearly withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the remaining protocol -defined visits until thei r EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator. Three Follow -up visits will then be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the EW visit for safet y assessments."
31,page_31,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 32Participants who discontinue I P earl yand withdraw consent to participate in the study should complete as man y assessments planned for the EW visit as possible. Following randomiz ation participant s will return to the clinic at least every 2 weeks for scheduled FP dose titration and asses sment of asthma control until the last dose of blinded study treatment (Visit 9). Albuterol/salbutamol will be provided for s ymptomatic relief to be used on an as needed basis from Screening through to the ETP visit. The maximum total duration of the stu dy is approximately 33 weeks. An independent Safety Review Committee (iSRC) will periodically review unblinded safet y data to protect and maintain participant safety whilst maintaining scientific validity . Members of the iSRC will be independent of the pro ject. The data will include, but not necessaril y be limited to SAEs, Holters, and ECGs. Details are described in the iSRC Charter. 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 300 participants with moderatel y severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose ICS/LABA will be screened to ensure 148 randomized (74 on GSK3772847, 74 on placebo) participants and 140 evaluable participants. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic"
32,page_32,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 33visit whilst remai ning on IP or who withdraws from I P having met the primary endpoint. High -dose ICS is defined as fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (i.e. 1000 mcg total daily dose) or equivalent . 5.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the stud y including, screening, run -in, the randomized treatment phase, and safet y follow -up. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of A ctivities for the last participant in the trial globally . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group and placebo - controlled design. This is a well -established desi gn to evaluate the ef ficacy, safet y,PK and PD profiles of an investigational drug. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma c ontrol were induced b y medication withdrawal [ Bel, 2014; Wenzel , 2013; Nair, 2009]. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthm a control , however studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relativel y short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies. In this stud y, the target population would be participants with moderatel y severe asthma and with an ACQ 5 score ≥1 and <4 whose s ymptoms must have been managed on a stable, high dose ICS/LABA for at least 4 months prior to Screening. The use of loss of asthma control as a composite study endpoint and a criterion for ICS titration allows for the overall clinical eval uation of the participant’s asthma status taking into account both lung function and s ymptom control. Participants will also be monitored through the use of the eDiary . Pre-specified asthma s ymptom scores and participant -measured PEF that is inputted into the eDiary will be used as prompts for contacts between subjects and investigators (Section 9.1.2.3 ). The FP titration period will occur during the Treatment Period of the study . The FP dose reduction will be as sessed and managed at scheduled clinic visits. During the FP titration period the subjects’ FP dose will be reduced as described in Section 5.1and the SoA, unless the subject meets protocol defined criteria for loss of asthma control indicating that it is not acceptable for the participant to further reduce ICS. Prior to each FP dose reduction an assessment of the participants’ asthma control should be completed and the decision to reduce the dose of FP will be based on: 1) the presence and severity of exacerbations, 2) changes in FEV1, 3) changes in the most recent ACQ -5 score, or 4) the ability to titrate ICS as per the pre -defined schedule, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. If loss of asthma control is confirmed during the FP titration period, the participant will discontinue I P immediatel y and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator. A similar methodology was recentl y reported [ Wenzel , 2013] and successfully allowed titration of I CS."
33,page_33,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 34To evaluate the safet y and tolerability of repeat dose of GSK3772847, a placebo arm will be included to allow the absolute effect of GSK3772847 to be assessed. The treatment duratio n of 12 weeks is supported b y pre -clinical study data. Dosing frequency of IP every 4 weeks with endpoints assessments scheduled 4 weeks post final IP dose are determined b y the available target engagement pharmacod ynamic findings. Upon completing the 16 weekTreatment Period (or after I P discontinuation), participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator and will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks before a final safety evaluation. This Follow up Period will ensure that sufficient PK samples are taken to fully characterise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics, and anti -drug antibod y responses in this population. An inhaled short acting beta 2–receptor agonist, salbutamol/albuterol will be provided to all participants to use as needed to relieve asthma sy mptoms from Screening (Visit 1) to end of the Treatment Period. Both safety and efficacy parameters will be assessed regularl y in the clinic to minimise any potential risks to the participants .Participan ts’ safet y will also be assured by having withdrawal crit eria (Section 8.1) in case of loss of asthma control. Should a participant experience loss of asthma control, the same level of pre-study asthma control can be achieved f ollowing treatment/resolution of the acute even t [Matz ,2001; McIvor,1998] . Any event that defines loss of asthma control in this study should not result in an irreversible pathop hysiological process that precludes the subject from achieving the level of asthma control that existed prior to study entry . The proposed study design allows the objectives of the trial to be addressed, but the same objectives will provide appropriate saf ety assessments to minimize the likelihood of participants experiencing an actual exacerbation. 5.5. Dose Justification The dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg IV at Week 0 then Weeks 4, 8 and 12 was selected based on the observed evidence of target suppression followin g single doses in healthy participants (CNTO7160ASH1001). In summary , administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose led to significant (>95%) suppression of serum free sST2 and sustained elevations of total sST2 up to at least 28 day s after dosing. Therefore, t he selected regimen should deliver significant target suppression throughout the treatment period, including at trough, and allow determination of the impact of targeting this pathway on the primary endpoint (measured over 0 -16 weeks). Simulations of expos ure were generated using a preliminary Michaelis Menten (MM) population PK model using the single dose data from 0.03 -10mg/kg up to 28 day s. Safety margins were estimated by comparing the mean clinical exposures (predicted or observed) against the mean ob servations in the 3-month GL P toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey s (T-2013 -007). Area under the curve (AUC) margins were calculated b y comparing the predicted clinical exposures from 0 -28 weeks (end of study ) to the observed exposure from 0 -92 day s (13 w eeks) when the main stud y animals were removed from stud y. Predicted exposures throughout the study and follow up period are significantl y lower than those observed in stud y T-2013 -007as shown in Figure 1"

If any DISKUS inhaler fails to function properl y, the participant should return to the clinic as soon as possible to obtain a new inhaler. The site will use the Interactive Web Response Sy stem ( IWRS )(RAMOS NG) to obtain a new treatment pack number for the participant and dispense a new stud y treatment kit from the site’s study treatment supply as instructed b y the IWRS. Details of the failure will b e documented in the eCRF. Additional information on how to handle medical device incidents can be found in the SRM. 7.2. Dose Modification There are no dose modifications planned for this protocol. 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment Participant s will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule. The randomization code will be generated by GSK using a validated computerized sy stem . Participant s will be randomized using an interactive web response system (IWRS) RAMOS NG. The stud y will use central -based randomization to allocate treatments. Once a randomization number is assigned to a participant it cannot be reassigned to an y other participant in the study . Following the 2 -week Run -inperiod and subject to satisfy ing all eligibility criteria, participant s willbe randomized 1:1to one of the followi ng double -blind treatments for the duration of the Treatment Period : GSK3772847 (10mg/kg) administered intravenously Placebo administered intravenousl y The duration of theTreatment Period for each participant is 16weeks. Each Investigator will be provided with sufficient supplies to conduct the trial. Additional treatment kits will be supplied as needed to the sites. Details of how to use the I WRS sy stem (RAMOS NG) to randomize participan ts and manage stud y treatment supplies (including dispensing) is prov ided in the RAMOS NG manual and SR M. 7.4. Blinding This will be a double -blind study and the following will appl y. The Investigator or treating phy sician may unblind a participant ’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant as judged b y the Investigator . Investigato rs have direct access to the participant ’s individual study treatment."
46,page_46,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 47In case of an emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safet y must alway s be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact GSK prior to unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment unless this could dela y emergency treatment of the participant. If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the Investigator must notify GSK within 24 hours after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant , unless that information is important for the safet y of participants currentl y in the stud y. The date and event or condition which led to the unblinding (i.e. the primary reason) will be recorded in source documentation and in the eCRF. In the event of unblinding th e Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. Should a participant’s treatment assignment be unblinded and the Medical monitor/GSK team determine that the participant must be withdrawn from I P, the part icipant must be followed -up as per protocol until the completion of the Safet y Follow -up assessments . GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 7.5.

Treatment after the End of the Study Participant s will not receive an y additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study or withdrawal of IP because other treatment options are available . The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been g iven to the post - study care of the participant’s medical condition . 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants that permanently stop study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study . Participant s have the right to discon tinue study treatment before the end of the study . A participant may also be asked to discontinue study treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. Participant s who withdraw from study treatment prematurel y (for an y reason) should, where possible, continu e to be followed -up until the completion of the Safety Follow -up assessments: For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study , anearly withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dos e of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the remaining protocol -defined visits until their EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the in vestigator. Three Follow -up visits will then be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the EW visit for safet y assessments."
50,page_50,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 51Participants who discontinue I P earl y and withdraw consent to participate in the study should complete as many assessments planned for the EW visit as possible. If this is not possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the participant to participate in as much of the study as they are willing (or able) to. A participant may be withdrawn from study treatment at any time. A reason for prema ture discontinuation of study treatment (e.g., AE, lack of efficacy [including loss of asthma control] , protocol deviation, I nvestigator discretion, consent withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF . A participant must be withdrawn from study treatment if any of the following stopping criteria are met: 1.Liver Chemistry : Meets any of the protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria . 2.QTc: Meets an y of the protocol -defined stopping criteria . 3.Pregnancy : Positive pregnancy test. 4.Participant meets at least one of the following criteria for ‘loss of asthma control’: ACQ -5 score increase from b aseline (measured at Visit 2) ≥0.5 point . Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from baseline (measured at Visit 2) >7.5 %. Inability to continue inhaled corticosteroid titration which is assessed and determined b y the investigator at an y time point following randomization, including on s cheduled clinic visits. A clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalization). 5.Study treatment unblinded. Note: In the event of unblinding the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawa l is required. 6.Abnormal Holter of Mobitz II AVB, complete AVB, sustained or non -sustained ventricular tach ycardia (VT), parox ysmal supraventricular tach ycardia (PSVT), new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter will be a withdrawal/stopping c riterion. These fin dings on ECG or findings of myocardial ischemia will also result in withdrawal/stopping. 7.Hypersensitivity or anaphy lactic reaction 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure par ticipant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safet y guidance: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid ances/UCM174090.pdf."
51,page_51,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 52Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant. Phase II Liver Chemistry Stopping and Increased Monitoring Algorithm Liver Safet y Required Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in Appendix 7 . 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett’s formula (QTcB), Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine -read or manually over -read. The same QT correction formu la must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the proto col based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception."
52,page_52,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 53The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording pe riod. A participant who meets thebulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc >500 msec OR Uncorrected QT >600 msec Change from baseline of QTc >60 msec For participant s with underly ing bu ndle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block <450 msec , Discontinuation QT c with Bundle Branch Block >500 msec Baseline QTc wit h Bundle Branch Block <450 -480msec , Discontinuation QTc with Bundl e Branch Block ≥530 msec . See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of earl y withdrawal (EW visit) and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Rechallenge 8.1.3.1. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria or any of the individual discontinuation criteria listed in Section 8.1of the protocol are met is not allowed. Additionally , if hy persensitivity or anaphy lactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued and study restart is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investig ator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. Note: In order to achieve the stratification balance, as a result of participants’ eosinophil count it may be necessary to withdraw participants from the study during the Run -in period. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samp les taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of earl y withdrawal (EW visit) and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed."
53,page_53,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 548.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clini c for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the par ticipant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a cer tified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exe mptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, inc luding those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form has been signed by the participant . Selection and modification of the participant ’s medications pr ior to study participation is based on the phy sician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each participant ’s needs. A participant ’s treatment must not be changed merely for the purpose of enabling the participant ’s participation in the stu dy. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments The timings of all efficacy assessments are specified in SoA."

Asthma Control Questionnaire ACQ-5 The ACQ -5 measures attributes of asthma control [ Juniper , 1999], measured with quest ions designed to be self -completed b y the participant. Participants will complete the ACQ -5 with the use of an e -Diary device on a weekly basis. The ACQ -5 includes five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) which enquire about the frequency and/or severit y of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. Th e recall period is the past week. A score of <0.75 indicates well -controlled asthma and a score 1.5 indicates poorly controlled asthma [ Juniper , 2006]. A change of 0.5 in score suggests a clinically important change in score [ Juniper , 2005]. 9.1.1.2. St. George’s Respiratory of Life Questionnaire ( SGRQ) The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire is a well established instrument, comprising 50 questions designed to measure Quality of Life in patients with diseases of airway obstruction, measuring symptoms, impact, and activity . The questions are designed to be self-completed b y the participant [ Jones , 1992 ] with a recall over the past 4 weeks. Higher scores indicate worse health status, and a chan ge of 4 points is considered a clinically relevant change [ Jones , 2005]. 9.1.2. Daily Diaries Participant swill be issued with a PEF/ e-Diary device at Visit 1 for twice daily use(in the morning upon waking and in the evening just before going to bed) throughout the study . The device will be provided by a third -party vendor . Information on the device and its use are documented in the SRM an d the third -party vendor manual . Participant s will be instructed on how to use the devic e in order to record results for the following in the eDiary each day from Visit 1 onwards : Morning and evening peak flow (best of three). Daytime asthma sy mptom score using a 5 -point scale Inhalations of rescue medication usage over the previous 24 -hours Frequency of awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use Morning and Evening use of FP/Sal and FP during the run -in and treatment periods Section 9.1.2 describes the assessments and questi onnaires recorded on the eDiary device, as well as the alerts that can be triggered based on recorded results. The data from the eDiary device will be automatically transmitted to a centralized server. The Investigator and designee(s) will be provided with access to the transmitted eDiary data via a vendor -provided portal and should review the data on an ongoing basis to check for the incidence of alerts as well as subject compliance with eDiary use. Participants will also be issued with a paper Medical Pro blems/Medications Taken worksheet to record medical problems experienced and medications used during the"
55,page_55,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 56study (please refer to the SRM for further details). Participants must also use this paper worksheet to record all healthcare contacts that occur durin g their participation in the study . This paper worksheet will be used to assist participant recall in discussions with the Investigator , for site staff to then enter as appropriate in the electronic case report form ( eCRF) . 9.1.2.1. Night -time A wakening, Day time A sthma Sy mptom Questions Every morning upon waking (from the morning after Visit 1 onwards ), participant s will answer a question on the occurrence of night -time awakenings due to asthma sy mptoms. The participant ’s response to the question on the occurrence o f night -time awakenings will be either ‘Yes’ (i.e. Did y ou wake up due to asthma sy mptoms ( i.e. wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness ) or ‘No’ (i.e. they did not experience at least one night -time awakening due to asthma s ymptoms ). If‘Yes’ ,participant s will be asked to respond either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the question on rescue medication (i.e. when you woke up due to your asthma symptoms did you use an y rescue bronchodilator?). On the evening of Visit 1 (just before going to bed) and eve ry evening there -after, participants will answer a question on day time asthma sy mptoms. These questions will be answered on a 5 -point scale (0 to 4) with ‘0’ representing no day time asthma sy mptoms and ‘4’ representing very severe day time asthma sy mptoms .Please describe the severity of your asthma s ymptoms (i.e. cough, wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath) today [0=no asthma sy mptoms, 1=mild asthma sy mptoms, 2= moderate asthma s ymptoms, 3=severe asthma s ymptoms, 4= very severe asthma sy mptoms]. 9.1.2.2. Morning and Evening Home PEF Participant s will conduct PEF measurements using the PEF/eDiary device each morning and each evening. Three measurements for each session will be recorded by the participant s in the eDiary. Assessments will be performed : After co mpleting all other eDiary assessments Prior to albuterol/salbutamol use Prior to FP/Sal and FP use 9.1.2.3. Alerts For safet y the following alerts, indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with instructions for the participant to contact t he investigator and transmit the data to the centralised server as soon as possible if any of the alert criteria are met. An alert in itself will not qualify as a clinicall y significant exacerbation: Decrease in morning PEF 30% on at least two of three su ccessive day s, compared with Baseline (last 7 day s of run -in). Adaytime symptom score of 3 for at least two of three successive day s. An increase from baseline of ≥4 puffs /day of albuterol/salbutamol use on 2 consecutive day s."

If any of the alert criteria are met, e mail notificat ions will be sent to the investigator as soon as the data is transmitted to the centralized server .The investigator will make every effort to contact the participants in order to discuss the participants’ s ymptoms and evaluate whether they experienced los s of asthma control. 9.1.3. Pulmonary Function Test Spirometry equipment and a device to measure FeNO (see Section 9.1.4 ) will be provided to all sites by a third -party vendor . Spirometry data from this study will be analysed by a third-party vendor .Details on performing the spirometry assessments, including information on the equipment provided and its use as well as specific instructions on performing the spirometry manoeuvres are documented in the SRM and the third -party vendor man ual. 9.1.3.1. Spirometry Spirometry will be performed to assess FEV1 and FVC. At least 3 spirometry manoeuvres (from a maximum of 8 attempts) should be achieved on each occasion that spirometry assessments are performed. For spirometry data collected at Screening ( Visits 1), the best spirometry effort will be selected from a measurement that meets American Thoracic Society (ATS)/ European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines and has a minimum of 2 efforts which are considered valid and repeatable, in accordance with the ATS/ERS standards [ Miller , 2005]. Measurements with 3 valid but non -repeatable efforts will not be accepted. For spirometry data collected during the Treatment Period (Visits 2 –11, including EWvisit) , the best spirometry effort will be selected from a measurement that meets ATS/ERS guidelines and has a minimum of 2 efforts which are considered valid (not necessarily repeatable). As alway s, sites should continue to strive to collect at least 3 valid (with no more than 8) effort s, as per ATS/ERS guidelines. At each visit, spirometry assessments must be performed at the same time of day (2 hour) as the assessment performed at Visit 2 (the baseline assessment ). Participant s should withhold short -acting beta -2-agonists (SABAs) for 6 hours and LABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12or 24hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) prior to the clinic visit, if possible. 9.1.3.2. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ ERS Task force: Standardization of Lung Function Testing [ Miller ,2005]. A baseline spirometry assessment should be performed after a washout period of at least 6 hours for short -acting β2-agonists and 1 dosing interval for long -acting β 2-agonists (or fixed dose combinations of LABA and ICS). To perform the reversibili ty assessment, 4 puffs of the provided salbutamol/albuterol is administered following completion of the baseline assessment. A spacer device may be used for testing, if required. A second spirometry assessment is performed within 10 to 15 minutes after adm inistrati on of the salbutamol/albuterol."
57,page_57,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 58Reversibility assessment at Screening (Visit 1) is not required if there is documented reversibility prior to Screening (Visit 1), or documented history of bronchial hyperreactivity from a bronchoprovocation study (e.g. methacholine challenge) prior to Screening (Visit 1). 9.1.4. Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) FeNO will be measured using a handheld electronic device. Measurements will be obtained in accordance with the ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Proce dures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled L ower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide [Miller ,2005]. All sites will use standardi zed equipment provided b y a central vendor. For each observation, at least 2 me asurements will be obtained to establish reproducibility (up to 8 measurements can be performed). FeNO measurements will be interpreted in accordance with the Official ATS Clinical Practice Guideline: I nterpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels (FeNO) fo r Clinical Applications [Dweik , 2011]. FeNO observati ons must be completed before FEV1 assessments. Participant s should not use their rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical ne ed. Participants should also withhold L ABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12 or 24 hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) before each FeNO assessment. 9.1.5. Review of Loss of Asthma Control Loss of asthma control is defined as at least on e of the following: ACQ -5 score increase from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) ≥0.5 point ) or Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) > 7.5 % or Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre -defined schedule (Section 5.1) or A clinically significan t asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation . At each clinic visit, the Investigator will utilize clinical discretion and available objective evidence (including but not limited to eDiary data, spirometry data, the most recent ACQ5 scores, h istory of exacerbations, conmeds, AEs) to determine if the patient is experiencing loss of asthma control. The paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet must also be reviewed b y the Investigator (or appropriatel y trained designee) at each visit to the study site to assist the I nvestigator in the identification of loss of asthma control. It is expected that the Investigator will indicate which criterion (criteria) the subject met that constituted loss of asthma control. 9.2. Adverse Events The definition s of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . Asthma exacerbations or worsening of asthma should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of an SAE. For the purposes of this study , asthma exacerbation s"
58,page_58,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 59will be collected and recorded on the exacerbations log in the eCRF. The treatment details must also be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of asthma exacerbations will begin from screening and will end after the follow -up period has bee n completed. The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatmen t or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the Visit 2 until the last follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). At Visits 0 and 1 SAE information will be collected onl y for any SAEs considered as related to stud y participation. All AEs will b e collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining infor med consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form ( eCRF ) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee w ithin 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the spons or. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting an AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since your last visit/contact?”"
59,page_59,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 60Participant s will be issued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to record an y medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (See Section 9.1.2 ). 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant a t subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on f ollow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilitie s towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y informatio n e.g. summary or listing of SAEs from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local require ments. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRF s are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medicinal Dictionary for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA) terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occur rence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported."
60,page_60,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 619.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the last follow -up visit. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described above which results in clinical signs and sy mptoms. These should be recorded by the Investigator on the AE/SAE eCRF pages. The dose of GSK3772847 considered to be an overdose has not been defined .There are no known antidotes and GlaxoSmithKline does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. The Investigator will use clinical judgement in treating the sy mptoms of a suspected overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for 16 weeks after the last dose . 3.Obtain a serum sample for PK anal ysis within 7 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a cas e-by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF . Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the Skin, Cardiovascular, R espiratory , Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses."
61,page_61,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 629.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs should be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2) prior to conducting spirometry .Blood pressure (sy stolic and diastolic) and pulse rate will be measured in the supine position after approximately 5 minutes rest. A single set of values will be collected and recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms All sites will use standardised ECG equipment provided by a centralized external vendor. A single 12 -lead ECG and rhy thm strip wi ll be recorded after measurement of vital signs and before other clinical tests such as blood draws and pulmonary function tests . Recordings will be made at the time -points defined in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2). All ECG measurements will be made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for approximately 5 minutes before each reading. Participants should be reminded to avoid caffeine or caffeinated drinks for at least 8 hours before each 12-lead ECG assessment . Also, decongestants are disallowed for at least 24 hours and antihistamines for at least 48 hours before each 12 -lead ECG assessment. For participants who meet the QTc, protocol defined stopping criter ia, triplicate ECGs (over a brief period of time) should be performed ( Section 8). The Investigator, a designated sub -Investigator or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing each 12 -lead EC G. The Investigator must provide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticit y of the ECG machine interpretation. All ECGs will be electronically transmitted to an independent cardiologist and evaluated. The independe nt cardiologist, blinded to treatment assignment, will be responsible for providing measurements of heart rate, QT intervals and an interpretation of all ECGs collected in this study . A hard cop y of these results will be sent to the I nvestigator. The Inves tigator must provide his/her dated signature on the confirmed report, attesting to his/her review of the independent cardiologist’s assessment. Details of the cardiac monitoring procedures will be provided b y the centralized cardiology service provider. 9.4.4. Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) Continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) assessments have been added to the protocol to allow for a quantitative assessment of abnormal rhythm events. Holter monitors will be provided b y a third part y vendor to each site. The dev ice should be connected and electrodes attached to the participant as per the vendor’s instructions."

Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the eCRF . The laboratory reports must be fil ed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laborat ory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 5 days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered signif icantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required labor atory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institutio n’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Whole blood samples of appro ximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of GSK3772847 as specified in the SoA . The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. The actual d ate and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of GSK3772847. Samples collected for analyses of serum concentration may also be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects related to concerns aris ing during or after the study . Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the SRM 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacody namic (PD) Biomarkers Blood (serum) samples will be collected during this study for the purposes of mea suring free and total sST2 levels .Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA.

Genetics Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogenetic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 6. The I EC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency must approve the PGx and genet ic assessments before these can be conducted at the site. The approval(s) must be in writing and will clearl y specify approval of the PGx and genetic assessments (i.e., approval ofAppendix 6). In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated. When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be conducted. 9.8. Biomarkers 9.8.1. Exploratory Biomarkers Blood (serum ) and sputum ( Section 9.8.1.1 ) samples will be collected during this study and may be used for the purposes of measuring asthma biomarkers or endoty pes of asthma , as well as response to GSK3772847 . Biomarkers will include, but not be limited to, serum total IgE, Eosinophilic Cationic Protein (ECP) and Ty pe-2 chemokines (e.g. CCL13, CCL 17) as well as sputum cell counts (e.g. percentage eosinophils). Samples may also be used to identify factors that may influence the development o f asthma and/or medically related conditions. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA. 9.8.1.1. Sputum Sub -Study At selected sites onl y, consenting participants who are eligible for randomisation at Visit 2 will be entered into the Sputum sub-study . In a subset of approximately 50% of eligible participants ,sputum samples will be collected as specified in the SoA. The participants in the Sputum Sub -Study will be randomised equall y inthe two treatment groups. Details of the sputum collecti onand processing methodology will be provided in the SRM. 9.8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments Serum samples will be collected and tested for the presence of antibodies that bind to GSK3772847, as specified in the SoA. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded . The presence of anti -GSK3772847 antibodies will be assessed using a tiered approach including a screening assay , a confirmation assay and calculation of titre."

Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study . 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypotheses The primary null hy pothesis ( ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions of subjects with loss of asthma control from randomi zation to Week 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is unity . The alternative hy pothesis ( ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions of subjects with loss of asthma control from randomi zation to Week 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is not unity . The h ypothes is will be tested by calculating the posterior probability that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25%, 50% and 80% reduction) and supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. A non -informative prior will be used. Although the success of the study will be assessed by calculating posterior probabilities of the treatment effect reaching various thresholds and not statistical significance, a frequentist anal ysis will also be performed testing the a bove h ypothesis . 10.2. Sample Size Determination The study will randomiz e 74 participants per treatment arm with the aim of having 70 evaluable participants per arm. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on IP or who withdraws from IP having met the primary endpoint. See Section 10.4.1 for how subjects who withdraw early from IP for reasons other than loss of asthma con trol are handled in the anal ysis."
65,page_65,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 66In addition to testing the hy pothesis in the overall population, the study will randomize a sufficient number of participants to evaluate trends in pre -defined subgroups (e.g. eosinophil strata). The true proportion of par ticipants that would experience a loss of asthma control on each treatment is unknown. However in a similar stud y of Dupilumab compared with placebo, the proportion of participants with loss of control were 6% and 44% for Dupilumab and placebo respectivel y. Table 4gives the power to detect a statisticall y significant difference (at the two -sided 5% level) between the two treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44% and the true pro portion with loss of control on active is 6%, 11%, 19% and 22% [ Fleiss , 2003]. Table 4 Table of Po wer A chievable for Different Treatment Comparisons using N=70 per arm calculated using PA SS True proportion on PlaceboTrue proportion on GSK3772847Reduction Power 44% 6% 86% > 99% 44% 11% 75% > 99% 44% 19% 57% 90% 44% 22% 50% 80% Assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, then with 70 evaluable participants per arm, the study will have at least 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on GSK3772487 is at most 22% ( Table 4). With 70 evaluabl e participants per arm and assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, the smallest observed difference that would lead to rejection of the null hy pothesis (minimum detectable effect) is 31% corresponding to a proportion with loss of control on GSK3772847 of 28%. There is a single primary endpoint so no adjustments are required for multiplicity . 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participant s who sign the ICF. Randomized All participants who were randomized. A subject who is recorded as a screen or run -in failure and also randomized will be considered to be randomized in error provided they have not performed any study assessments. Modified Intent -to-treat (mITT)All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually"
66,page_66,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 67Population Description received. PKAll randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, an d for whom at least one pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analyzed and was measurable. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses All efficacy analy ses will be performed on the mITT Population. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryThe primary end point proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control will be analyzed using both Bayesian and Frequentist methods. A subject is deemed to have met the endpoint of loss of asthma control if they meet the criteria for any of the components of the definit ion of loss of asthma control. The posterior probabilities that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25 %, 50% and 80% reduction) will be cal culated analytically assuming a non -informative prior .This will be supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately. In addition, the proportion of participants w ith loss of asthma control will be analyzed using logistic regression allowing for baseline eosinophils strata. The odds ratio, 95% CI and p -value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be presented. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately by fitting a separate model with an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment interaction. The effect of eosinophils as a continuous covariate will also be examined in a separate -logistic regression model. Missing d ata will be handled using the following methods: 1)The loss of asthma control will be set to missing for participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control 2)A sensitivity analysis will be performed where participa nts who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control will have the endpoint set to loss of control SecondaryThe following secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same statistical analysis as described for the pr imary endpoint: Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation"
67,page_67,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 68Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation) Proportion of participants with Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from Baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) >7.5 % Proportion of participants with Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre -defined schedule (Section 5.1) Proportion of participants with ACQ -5 score increase from Baseline (measured at the e nd of Run -in) ≥0.5 point. Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation or inability to titrate ICS according to the pre -defined schedule. In these analyses, the endpoint will be set to missing for participants who withdraw f rom IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control. Time to loss of asthma control will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier analysis. Percentiles for time to loss of control will be presented for both treatment groups, along with graphical s urvival plots. Any early withdrawals from IP that did not experience loss of control will be censored. Results will be presented for both of the two eosinophil strata separately, and combined. The following endpoints will be analyzed using repeated logis tic regression. This analysis will be repeated including an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment by visit interaction to provide estimates for the two eosinophil strata separately: Proportion of ACQ -5 responders (a ≥0.5 point improvement from baseline at Week 16) Proportion of SGRQ responders (at least a 4 unit improvement from baseline at Week 16 These analyzes will be performed using two different methods for handling missing data: 1)If endpoint at a visit is missing then the responder status is set to missing 2)If endpoint at a visit is missing and the endpoint is also missing at all subsequent visits then the responder status is set to non -responder The odds ratio, 95% CI and p -value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be present ed for all models. Mixed model repeated measures will be used to analyze the following endpoints. The baseline value of each endpoint will be included along with baseline*visit and treatment*visit interactions. Treatment differences, 95% confidence interv als and p -values will be presented . Change from baseline in ACQ -5 absolute score Change from baseline in SGRQ total score Change from baseline in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 Change from baseline in FeNO This analysis will be repeated including an additional term for eosinophil"

Safety Analyses All safet y anal yses will be performed on the mITTPopulation. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary There is no primary safety analysis. Secondary The followin g secondary safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by treatment group:  Incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs  Vital signs  12-lead ECG  24 hours Holter  Clinical laboratory evaluation  Incidence of and titres of anti -GSK3772847 antibodies. Details w ill be described in the reporting and analysis plan Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of subjects experiencin g at least one AE of an y type, AEs within each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal"

Deaths and SAEs, if applicable, will be documented in case narrative format. 10.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses All safet y anal yzes will be performed on the PKPopulation. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary There is no primary pharmacokinetic analysis. SecondaryThe serum GSK3772847 levels from this study will be summarised by treatment and nominal time. Further details will be described in the report and analysis plan. 10.4.4. Pharmacody namic Analy ses All pharmacod ynamic analy sis will be described in reporting and anal ysis plan . 10.4.5. Other A nalyses PK, pharmacod ynamic, and biomarker exploratory anal ysis will be described in the reporting and anal ysis plan. Anypopulation PK analy sis and pharmacod ynamic anal ysis will be reported separately from the main clinical study report (CSR). Should a genetic/PGx analy sis be performed, a separate reporting and anal ysis plan will be generated ( SeeAppendix 6: Genetics). 10.4.6. Interim A nalyses Formal analy ses will be performed at two timepoints. End of Treatment Phase Analysis: This will take place after all participants have completed the Week 16 visit. The data will be cleaned, the treatments unblinded and all clinic visits up to and inclu ding week 16 frozen. However, whilst no further efficacy data will be collected post week 16, due to an inability to lock log forms used for collection of exacerbation data, the end of treatment phase anal ysis will be considered an interim anal ysis for bot h efficacy and safet y. An y safet y data collected for participants who have completed clinic visits after Week 16 will also be cleaned and included in the anal ysis. There will be no modifications to dosing regimens, sample size or any other aspects of the trial based on this data, as all study assessments, apart from follow -up, will have alread y been completed. As such an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)"
70,page_70,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIAL 207597 71 will not be used, as no further investigationa l product will be prescribed after this analysis has taken place. Final Analysis: This will take place after all subjects have co mpleted the study. Data for visits after Week 16 as well as data collected on log pages will be cleaned and the database frozen. This will be the final analysis for the study. The Reporting and Analysis Plan will describe the planned analyses in greater detail. Instream review: An iSRC will periodically review unblinded safety data to protect and maintain participant safety whilst maintaining scien tific validity. Members of the iSRC will be independent of the project. The data will incl ude, but not necessarily be limited to SAEs, Holters and ECGs. Details are described in the Charter."

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical s tudy participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or di sease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinic al sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" constitutes an AE or SAE."
83,page_83,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 84Events NOT Meeting the AE Defi nition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The d isease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition th at leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to prog ression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death a t the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the par ticipant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur duri ng hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalizatio n for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."
84,page_84,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 85d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fun ctions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as i mportant medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitio n. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospit alization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revasculari zation"
85,page_85,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 86Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator wi ll then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF . It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Mod erate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilize d for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe."
86,page_86,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 87Assessme nt of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initia l report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perf orm or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or inv estigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information."
87,page_87,"2017N311825_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 88Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Repor ting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collectio n tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF . After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent t he entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can r eport this information on a paper SAE form or to the assigned SAE contact by telephone. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper eCRF Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper eCRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the assigned SAE contact by telephone . In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE eCRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page ."

SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A randomized, double -blind, parallel group, multicenter, stratified study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of repeat doses of GSK3772847 compared with placebo in participants with moderately severe asthma. Short Title: A study to evaluate the effect of GSK3772847 in patients with moderatel y severe asthma. Rationale: GSK 3772847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surface interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicit y 2 [ST2], also known as Interleukin- 1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non- T2-driven disease. At the time of writing this protocol, a two- part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final clinical study report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator broc hure (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832_00) . There are no efficacy data available to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa / proof of concept study to investigate efficacy , safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in participants with moderatel y severe asthma. The study will use a n inhaled steroid titration design in order to evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains protection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma control were induced b y medicatio n withdrawal. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthma control ; however , studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relativel y short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies."

117,page_117,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 16Overall Design: This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, stratified, parallel group stud y in participants with moderately severe asthma. There will be a 2 -week Run -in period following Screening (Visit 1). Eligible participants will be randomized at the end of the Run -in period (Visit 2). Randomization will be stratified based on participants’ baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count aiming for at least 30% of participants with eosinophil count <150 cells / L, which is measured at Screening. Number of Participant s: Approximately 300 participants with moderatel y severe asthma who are maintained on high-dose ICS/LABA will be screened to ensure 148 randomized (74 on GSK3772847, 74 on placebo) participants and 140 evaluable participants. High -dose ICS is defined as fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice dail y (i.e. 1000 mcg /day ) or equivalent. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on investigational product (I P) or who withdraws from IP having met the primary endpoint. Treatment Groups and Duration: When required, a pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can be scheduled for signing the informed consent, up to 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). The pre- screening visit can also occur on the same day as the Screening vi sit. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will withdraw their regular ICS/LABA treatment for asthma and enter a two -week Run- in period during which they will receive open label background therap y of fluticasone propiona te (FP)/salmeterol (Sal) 500/50 mcg twice dail y (BID) . At the end of the Run- in period at Visit 2 (Week 0) , participant s who meet pre -defined randomization criteria will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to enter a double- blind treatment period and receive the foll owing stud y treatment every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8 and 12) while initially remaining on the open label background therap y of FP/Sal 500/50 mcg BID at Randomization: GSK3772847 administered intravenousl y or Placebo administered intravenousl y At Visit 4, t wo weeks after Randomiz ation, the open label background therapy will be switched from FP/Sal 500/50 mcg BID to FP 500 mcg BID for 2 weeks. Visit 4 will be the beginning of a six week FP titration period. Every two weeks for the next six weeks thedose of FP will be reduced b y approximate ly 50 % (i.e. FP 250 mcg BID at Visit 5 for 2 weeks, FP 100 mcg BID at Visit 6 for 2 weeks, then FP 50 mcg BID at Visit 7for 2 weeks) until complete discontinuation at Visit 8, provided that the participant does n ot meet an y of the loss of asthma control criteria. If any of the pre -defined criteria for loss of asthma control are met during the Treatment period, participants will be withdrawn from the investigational product (I P) and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator."
118,page_118,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 17An End of Treatment Phase (ETP) Visit will be performed 4 weeks after the final dose of the blinded study treatment is administered at Week 12. For participants who discontinue IP earl y, but have not wi thdrawn consent to participate in the study , an Early Withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator, after pr otocol defined study assessments are completed. Three Follow -up visits will be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks (Week 20, Week 24, and Week 28) after the ETP/EW Visit for safety assessments. Following randomiz ation participant s will return to the clinic at le ast every 2 weeks for scheduled FP dose titration and assessment of asthma control until the last dose of blinded study treatment (Visit 9) . Albuterol/salbutamol will be provided for sy mptomatic relief to be used on an as needed basis from Screening throug h to the ETP visit. The maximum total duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks."

Stud y Rationale GSK3772847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surface receptor interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL - 33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 [ST2], also known as Interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty pe 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2- driven disease. At the time of writing this protocol, a two- part, single and multip le ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator brochure ( IB [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832_00]) . There are no efficacy data available to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa / proof of concept study to investigate efficacy , safety and tolerability , pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in participants with moderatel y severe asthma. The study will use a n inhaled steroid titration design in order to evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains protection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhal ed) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma control were induced b y medication withdrawal [ Bel, 2014; Wenzel , 2013; Nair , 2009]. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthma control ; however ,studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relatively short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies. 3.2. Background Severe asthma represents approximately 5-10% of the asthma population and is associated with a greater frequency of asthma exacerba tions, decreased health- related quality of life and greater sy mptom burden [ Chung , 2014; Aburuz , 2007; Moore , 2007]. Current biologic agents appr oved for the management of patients with severe asthma have demonstrated efficacy for T2-driven disease (i.e., eosinophilic and/or elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE ) however, there is no currentl y approved therapy that targets non -T2-driven asthma. GSK 3772847 (formerl y CNTO 7160 which was in- licensed from Janssen) is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain of interleukin - 33 receptor (IL -33R) and neutralizes IL -33-mediated IL -33R signaling. The IL -33R gene codes fo r both a soluble form (sST2) and a membrane -bound “long” form (ST2L or IL - 33R). Soluble ST2 exists in the serum and is elevated in severe asthmatics during an exacerbation [ Smithgall , 2008; Oshikawa , 2001]."
126,page_126,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 25IL-33R is expressed on immune cells, such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T helper cell ty pe 2 (Th2) cells and has been shown to be upregulated on macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. It is also expressed on non -immune cells such as endothelial, epithelial and smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. IL-33 has been shown to be released after endothelial or epithelial cell damage during trauma, phy sicochemical / microbarometric stress or infection [Arshad , 2016 ]. IL-33R signalling causes downstream production of Ty pe 2 cy t okines. The engagement of IL -33R with its ligand IL -33 contributes to Th2 -mediated pathologies and allergic responses [ Yagami , 2010; Smithgall , 2008], but has also been shown to promote Th1 -and Th17- mediated responses [Arshad , 2016; Smithgall , 2008]. Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL - 33R may result in down regulation of immune cell re sponses and therefore presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma on top of standard of care [Arshad, 2016]. In a 3 -month good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology study , GSK3772847 was administered to cy nomolgus monkey s as a weekl y 15-minute IV infusion (20 or 100 mg/kg) and was found to be well- tolerated at both doses. Janssen (Study CNTO7160ASH1001) have conducted a Phase I randomized, double - blind, placebo -controlled, intravenous (IV) single ascending dos e stud y in he althy participants and multiple ascending dose stud y in participants with asthma and participants with atopic dermatitis. The study has completed dosing. The final clinical study report is still pending. There are no efficacy data available to date. More i nformation about the non -clinical and clinical studies is available in the GSK3772847 IB(GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832_00 ). 3.3. Benefit/Risk A ssessment More detailed information about the known and expected benefits, risks and reasonabl y expected adverse events of GSK3772847 may be found in the IB (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2017N316832_00)."

Risk A ssessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Product (IP) [GSK3772847] Cardiovascular (CV) There is evidence to suggest that the IL -33/ST2 pathway may be protective in the cardiovascular system. Components of the IL- 33/ST2 pathway are expressed in a number of cellular components of the heart and blood vessels in rodents and human patients. Increased circulating levels of soluble ST2 are markers of a poor prognosis in patients with hemodynamic stress (e.g. hemodynamic - hypertrophy, chamber dilation, fibrosis; i schemic - apoptosis and infarct volume). The effect was abolished in rodents with genetic knockout of ST2. Atherosclerotic plaque development was significantly reduced in ApoE -/- mice given exogenous IL -33 while plaques were larger in mice treated with soluble ST2 (which binds and blocks IL -33).Non-clinical: No GSK3772847 -related changes noted in (non - GLP) IV and SC 4 week monkey study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week, or in the GLP 3 month IV repeat do se toxicity study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week) o r subcutaneous (SC) administration. However, it should be noted that the animals in toxicity studies are healthy and, therefore, are unlikely to detect the potential target related CV liability. Clinical : In Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, several episodes of sinus tachycardia on telemetry were reported in a 20-year-oldmale healthy volunteer, between 1 and 9 hours post -dose (10 mg/kg), accompanied on one occasion by mild vertigo and malaise (no chest pain). Troponin I, N- terminal prohormone of brain natriur etic peptide (NT-proBNP) were normal pre dose and Day 5, also normal ECG and vital signs including Exclude participants with existing clinically significant organic heart disease (e.g. Coronary artery disease [CAD], New York Heart Association (NYHA )Class III/IV heart failure) and abnormal, clinically significant findings from 12 - lead ECG and 24 -hour holter monitoring (Section 6.2and Section 6.3). CV events will be monitored (including ECG and Holter monitoring) as specified in Section 2. All cardiac -related AEs will be reviewed by an independent safety review committee (iSRC ). Protocol -defined stopp ing criteria are specified in Section 8.1."

The event was considered by the investigator to be likely related to the investigational product . No specific cause was identified. Data on this event was reviewed by GSK (Internal Cardiac Safety Panel and CMO), and was not considered to impact further clinical development. During 12 hours post -dose telemetry monitoring in Part 1 of Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001, 6 out of 60 completed subjects wer e assessed to have abnormal findings by the investigator. The abnormalities were considered clinically significant and recorded as treatment emergent adverse events . In Part 2 of the Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001, there were four reports of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of these reports, one participant received placebo and two received GSK3772847 at 3 mg/kg and one received GSK3772847 at 10 mg/kg . The events were non -symptomatic, and a monomorphic pattern (i.e., not Torsades de pointes), which is a pattern thought not to be indicative of increased risk for sudden ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Heart rate (HR) analysis did not"
129,page_129,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 28Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy identify any safety concern (no pattern of increased HR suggestive of an increase in sympathetic tone). All 4 pa rticipants had normal results from exercise test and echocardiogram. Dosing was continued as planne d, and the dose escalated to 10 mg/kg. Increased risk of infections & immunosuppression Studies in mice indicate a potential role for IL -33 in infection control. IL -33 was shown to activate neutrophils i n BALB/c mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture thus preventing polymicrobial sepsis. Similarly, IL -33 is thought to stimulate neutrophil recruitment from the bone marrow to the periphery in response to fungal infection. Mice infected with flu virus and administered an IL -33 inhibitor exhibited a lower number of clusters of differentiated CD90+ and cluster of differentiated CD25+ inate lymphoid cells with consequent impaired lung function compared to phosphate buffered saline treated controls. IL -33 has also been shown to be produced in the helminth infected cecum of parasite infected mice and is shown to be important in expulsion of the parasite.Preclinical : No GSK3772847 -related changes in clinical signs, white blood cell count or no microscopic changes (inflammatory cell infiltrates) in any tissues indicative of infection observed in monkey 4 week IV/SC or IV 3 month toxicity at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week. Clinical : Safety data from Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 Single Ascending Dose (SAD) has shown the most frequent adverse events reported as infections, including nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, gastroenteritis and upper respiratory tract infection. The frequency of these events was similar in GSK3772847 and placebo groups (18/45 [40%] of participants administered GSK3772847 versus 6/24 [40%] administered placebo).Participants with a known, pre -existing parasitic infestation within 6 months prior to Screening are excluded from participation in the study (Section 6.2) Participants who develop an infection will be requested to seek medical advice, and subject to close monitoring. EU Regulatory guidance on development of asthma drugs request that agents that interact with the immune system should be investigated for their effect on the host response to infection and tumours. The incidence of infections will be monitored in clinical studies. Incidence of tumours and developm ent of paradoxical immune responses (e.g. idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis -like syndrome) will be monitored in clinical trials and routinely as"

The number of asthma participants experiencing infections and infestations was similar between the group receiving GSK3772847 (9/18 [50%]) and the group receiving placebo (4/6 [66.7%]). The frequency of infection events in participants with atopic dermatitis was gre ater in participants in the GSK3772847 group compared with the placebo group (6/11 [54.5%] versus 1/4 [25%]).

Clinical : Not observed in Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 in healthy volunteers following single doses up to 10 mg/kg, and multiple doses in asthma and atop ic dermatitis patients at doses up to 10 mg/kg (3 doses, once every two weeks [ q2W]over four weeks). Based on in vitro cytokine release data and safety experience in Janssen study If a hypersensiti vity or anaphylactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy instituted. Agents to treat reactions should be available immediately. Stopping & continuation criteria will be included in protocols. Painkillers can be prescribed for pain at site of injection. Patients developing hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions or anaphylactic shock will be withdrawn from the study. All doses in this trial will be administered in the clinic."
131,page_131,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 30Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy CNTO7160ASH1001 the risk of CRS is considered negligible. Possible interaction with live v irus or bacterial vaccines As GSK3772847 is an immunomodulator, there is a possibility that the subject will not mount an adequate immune response to a vaccine or even cause the infection the vaccine should protect against. Steroid withdrawal is expected to augment a pro - inflammatory response in the lung of the patients that drives the asthma phenotype. Vaccination will also drive a systemic immune response to the pathogen antigen that runs the risk of causing some immunomodulation of the lung immune resp onses. This has been best studied in murine models where eosinophilic lung inflammation has been suppressed by systemic toll-like receptor activation.Non-clinical : In the monkey 13 week toxicity study no GSK3772847 -related changes in the T cell dependent B cell response (IgM or IgG) was observed at doses ≤ 100 mg/kg/week. This data is indicative that healthy monkeys were able to mount a response against the antigen challenge during GSK3772847 administration at doses where near complete inhibition of IL -33 was anticipated. Base d on this data GSK3772847 is considered unlikely to blunt/inhibit the generation of a response to vaccinations. Clinical : Not observed in Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 in healthy volunteers following single doses up to 10 mg/kg, and multiple doses in asthm a and atopic dermatitis patients at doses up to 10 mg/kg (3 doses, once every two weeks over four weeks).In the study, participants should not be vaccinated with live or attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving IP or up to 6 months after dose administration of GSK3772847 . However , vaccines containing killed bacteria or inactivated virus will be permitted.

Benefit A ssessment Efficacy of GSK3772847 has not y et been demonstrated and there are no existent data from molecu les with the same or similar mode of action. Taking part in this study may or may not improve a participant’s health, and may or may not directl y benefit a participant. This study will provide additional safety and efficacy information on GSK3772847. Whil st the in vivo models of T2 asthma support a role for IL- 33 pathway in eosinophilic asthma disease, it is clear that IL- 33 play s a significant role in other t ypes of immune responses and cell ty pes including amplification of Th1 and Th17 responses in combi nation with other cy tokines [Arshad , 2016; Smithgall , 2008]. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both ty p e 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2- driven dis ease. All study participants will receive open label salbutamol/albuterol to use as needed for asthma sy mptom relief from Screening to the end of the Treatment Period. Medical assessments are planned during the stud y to evaluate participants’ health status . The assessments include ph ysical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitoring, and clinical laboratory evaluation including liver chemistry and blood chemistry panel at a number of clinic visits. Participants will be monitored for changes in asthma control through daily use of an electronic Diary (eDiary ) and twice -daily PEF measurements. Safet y alerts will be provided to the participants and the sites in case of worsening of asthma. Participants’ health status will also be evaluat ed by ACQ- 5 and SGRQ during the stud y. Participant s’ safet y will be assured b y having criteria for withdrawal from study medication/reinstatement of usual care in case of loss of asthma control. The aim will be to retain participants in the study post withdrawal of study medication to follow- up for safety . 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize the risk to the participants participating in the stud y, the balance of anticipated benefits and apparent risks associate d with GSK3772847 continues to be acceptable . There is an opportunity to determine if there is a new drug that can be developed for patients with severe asthma who may benefit from the broad spectrum effects hy pothesized for GSK3772847 ."

STUDY DESIGN 5.1. Overall De sign This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, stratified, parallel group stud y. There will be a 2 -week Run -in period following Screening (Visit 1). Eligible participant s will be randomize d at the end of the Run -in per iod (Visit 2). Randomi zation will be stratified based on participants’ baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count aiming for at least 30% of participants with eosinophil count <150 cells/L, which i s measured at Screening. In order to achieve the stratific ation balance ,as a result of participants’ eos inophil count it may be necessary to withdraw participants from the study during the Run-in period. When required, a pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can be scheduled up to 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). The pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can also occur on the same day as the Screening visit ( Visit 1). Participant s who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will withdraw their regular ICS/ long-acting beta -2-agonists (LABA )treatment for asthm a and enter a two -week Run- in period during which they will receive open label background therap y of fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (Sal) 500/50 mcg BID. At the end of the Run- in period at Visit 2 (Week 0), participants who meet pre -defined randomi zation criteria (Section 6.3) will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to enter a double - blinded Treatment Period and receive the following stud y treatment every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8 and 12) while initially remaining on the open label background therap y of F P/Sal 500/50 mcg BID at Randomiz ation: GSK3772847 administered intravenousl y or Placebo administered intravenousl y At Visit 4 (i.e. two weeks after Randomiz ation) the open label background therap y will be switched fro m FP/Salmeterol 500/50 mcg BID to FP 500 mcg BID for 2 weeks. This will mark the beginning of the FP titration period. Every two weeks for the next six weeks the dose of FP will be reduced b y approximately 50 % (i.e. FP 250 mcg BID at Visit 5 for 2 weeks, FP 100 mcg BID at Visit 6 for 2 weeks, then FP 50 mcg BID at Visit 7 for 2 weeks) until complete FP discontinuation at Visit 8, provided that the participant does not meet an y of the loss of asthma control criteria.

Participants will be monitored for loss of asthma control through dail y use of an eDiary and twice -daily PEF measurements. The pa rticipants will use the eDiary to record asthma symptoms, rescue medication use, and nocturnal awakening sdue to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use. This information will be transmitted daily to a centralized server and available to the investigators .Alerts for pre -defined changes in PEF or asthma s ymptoms, indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with prompts to the participant s to contact the investigator if any of the alert criteria are met (Section 9.1.2.3 ).Additionally , email notifications will be sent to the investigator, if an y of the alert criteria are met, as soon as the data is transmitted to the centralized server. The investigator will make every effort to contact the participants in order to discuss the participants’ s ymptoms and evaluate whether they experienced loss of asthma control. For participants who receive all fo ur doses of blinded study treatment, an End of Treatment Period (ETP) Visit will be performed 4 weeks after the final dose of the blinded study treatment is administered at Week 12. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determin ed by the investigator, after protocol defined study assessments are completed. Three Follow-up visits will be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks (Week 20, Week 24, and Week 28) after the ETP Visit for safet y assessments. For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study , anearly withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the rema ining protocol -defined visits until their EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator. Three Follow -up visits will then be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the EW visit for safet y assessments . Participants who discontinue I P earl y and withdraw consent to participate in the study should complete as man y assessments planned for the EW visit as possible."

Albuterol/salbutamol will be provided for s ymptomatic relief to be used on an as needed basis from Screening through to the ETP visit. The maximum total duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks. An independent Safety Review Committee (iSRC) will periodically review unblinded safet y data to protect and maintain participant safety whilst maintaining scientific validity . Members of the iSRC will be independent of the project. The data will include, but not necessaril y be limited to SAEs, Holters, and ECGs. Details are described in the iSRC Charter. 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 300 participants with moderatel y severe asthm a who are maintained on high-dose ICS/LABA will be screened to ensure 148 randomized (74 on GSK3772847, 74 on placebo) participants and 140 evaluable participants. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on IP or who withdraws from I P having met the primary endpoint. High -dose ICS is defined as fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (i.e. 1000 mcg total daily dose) or equivalent ."

Participant and Study Comp letion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the stud y including, screening, run -in, the randomized treatment phase, and safet y follow-up. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last sche duled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities for the last participant in the trial globally . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group and placebo - controlled design. This is a well -established desi gn to evaluate the efficacy, safet y,PK and PD profiles of an investigational drug. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which changes in the level of asthma control were induced b y medication withdrawal [ Bel, 2014; Wenzel , 2013; Nair , 2009]. This design may not reflect real world fluctuations in asthma control , however studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on changes in asthma control in a relativel y short period of time, before further in vestigations are conducted in longer term studies. In this study, the target population would be participants with moderatel y severe asthma and with an ACQ 5 score ≥1 and <4 whose s ymptoms must have been managed on a stable, high dose ICS/LABA for at least 4 months prior to Screening. The use of loss of asthma control as a composite study endpoint and a criterion for ICS titration allows for the overall clinical eval uation of the participant’s asthma status taking into account both lung function and s ymptom control. Participants will also be monitored through the use of the eDiary . Pre-specified asthma s ymptom scores and participant -measured PEF that is inputted into the eDiary will be used as prompts for contacts between subjects and investigators (Section 9.1.2.3 ). The FP titration period will occur during the Treatment Period of the study . The FP dose reduction will be assessed and managed at scheduled clinic visits. During the FP titration period the subjects’ FP dose will be reduced as described in Section 5.1and the SoA, unless the subject meets protocol defined criteria for loss of asthma control indicating that it is not acceptable for the participant to further reduce ICS. Prior to each FP dose reduction an assessment of the participants’ asthma control should be completed and the decision to reduce the dose of FP will be based on: 1) the presence and severity of exacerbations, 2) changes in FEV1, 3) changes in the most recent ACQ -5 score, or 4) the ability to titrate ICS as per the pre-defined schedule, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment. If loss of asthma c ontrol is confirmed during the FP titration period, the participant will discontinue I P immediatel y and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator. A similar methodology was recentl y reported [ Wenzel , 2013] and successfully allowed titration of I CS. To evaluate the safet y and tolerability of repeat dose of GSK3772847, a placebo arm will be included to allow the absolute effect of GSK3772847 to be assessed. The treatment duration of 12 weeks is supported b y pre -clinical study data. Dosing frequency of IP"
140,page_140,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 39every 4 weeks with endpoints assessments scheduled 4 weeks post final IP dose are determined b y the available target engagement pharmacod ynamic findings. Upon completing the 16 weekTreatment Period (or after I P discontinuation), participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator and will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks before a final safety evaluation. This Follow up P eriod will ensure that sufficient PK samples are taken to fully characterise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics, and anti -drug antibod y responses in this population. An inhaled short acting beta 2–receptor agonist, salbutamol/albuterol will be provided to all participants to use as needed to relieve asthma symptoms from Screening (Visit 1) to end of the Treatment Period. Both safety and efficacy parameters will be assessed regularl y in the clinic to minimise any potential risks to the participants .Participan ts’ safet y will also be assured by having withdrawal crit eria (Section 8.1) in case of loss of asthma control. 5.5. Dose Justification The dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg IV at Week 0 then Weeks 4, 8 and 12 was selected based on the obse rved evidence of target suppression following single doses in healthy participants (CNTO7160ASH1001). In summary , administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose led to significant (>95%) suppression of serum free sST2 and sustained elevations of total sST2 up to at least 28 day s after dosing. Therefore, the selected regimen should deliver significant target suppression throughout the treatment period, including at trough, and allow determination of the impact of targeting this pathway on the primary endpoint (mea sured over 0- 16 weeks). Simulations of exposure were generated using a preliminary Michaelis Menten (MM) population PK model using the single dose data from 0.03 -10mg/kg up to 28 day s. Safety margins were estimated by comparing the mean clinical exposures (predicted or observed) against the mean observations in the 3-month GL P toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey s (T-2013 -007) . Area under the curve (AUC) margins were calculated b y comparing the predicted clinical exposures from 0 -28 weeks (end of study ) to the observed exposure from 0 -92 day s (13 weeks) when the main study animals were removed from stud y. Predicted exposures throughout the study and follow up period are significantl y lower than those observed in stud y T-2013 -007 as shown in Figure 1"

The site will use the Interactive Web Response Sy stem ( IWRS )(RAMOS NG) to obtain a new treatment pack number for the participant and dispense a new stud y treatment kit from the site’s study treatment supply as instructed b y the IWRS. Details of the failure will b e documented in the eCRF. Additional information on how to handle medical device incidents can be found in the SRM. 7.2. Dose Modification There are no dose modifications planned for this protocol. 7.3. Method of Treatment A ssignment Participant s will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule. The randomization code will be generated by GSK using a validated computerized sy stem . Participant s will be randomized using an interactive web response system (I WRS) RAMOS NG. The stud y will use central -based randomization to allocate treatments. Once a randomization number is assigned to a participant it cannot be reassigned to an y other participant in the study . Following the 2 -week Run- inperiod and subject to satisfy ing all eligibility criteria, participant s willbe randomized 1:1 to one of the followi ng double -blind treatments for the duration of the Treatment Period : GSK3772847 (10mg/kg) administered intravenously Placebo administered intravenously The duration of the Treatment Period for each participant is 16weeks. Each Investigator will be provided with sufficient supplies to conduct the trial. Additional treatment kits will be supplied as needed to the sites. Details of how to use the I WRS sy stem (RAMOS NG) to randomize participan ts and manage stud y treatment supplies (including dispensing) is provided in the RAMOS NG manual and SR M. 7.4. Blinding This will be a double- blind study and the following will appl y. The Investigator or treating phy sician may unblind a participant ’s treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency OR in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the stud y treatment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant as judged b y the Investigator . Investigator s have direct access to the participant ’s individual study treatment. It is preferred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the Medical Monitor or appropriate GSK study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the participant ’s treatment assignment."
153,page_153,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 52If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the Investigator must notify GSK within 24 hours after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant , unless that information is import ant for the safet y of participants currentl y in the stud y. The date and event or condition which led to the unblinding (i.e. the primary reason) will be recorded in source documentation and in the eCRF. In the event of unblinding the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. Should a participant’s treatment assignment be unblinded and the Medical monitor/GSK team determine that the participant must be withdrawn from I P, the participant must be follow ed-up as per protocol until the completion of the Safet y Follow -up assessments . GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited reg ulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy. 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountab ility GSK3772847 a white to yellow, uniform ly ophilized cake in a 5ml clear glass vial with 20mm closure sealed b y red metal and yellow overseal. Each vial contains 100 mg of a lyophilised GSK3772847. When reconstituted with 2.0 mL of WFI, the final concen tration of GSK3772847 is 50 mg/mL . Excipients include: sucrose, sodium phosphate buffer, and polysorbate 20 at a pH of 7.3. Vials contain no preservatives and thus are for single use. Vials must be stored 2º – 8C, protected from light. Protection from light during preparation and administration is not required. Full details on specific 2º to 8C storage temperature conditions, preparation and administration including requirements for filtration are provided separatel y. Commercially available sterile normal saline will be used for dilution of study agent and will also serve as placebo for this study . Use of study agent sterile normal saline as placebo for injection provides an adequate comparator to broadl y assess safety in earl y clinical development. GSK3 772847 must be prepared b y an unblinded pharmacist or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel and administered according to each participant’s body weight at Screening (Visit 1 ). A different site staff member, who will be blinded to the treatment assignment, will administer the study agent. Aseptic procedures must be used during preparation and administration of the study agent. Diluted GSK3772847 at volumes of 50 mL are to be administered by IV infusion over a period of at least 30 minutes us ing an in -line 0.22 micron filter. At least 30 mL of commercially available sterile normal saline will be used to flush diluted drug from the administration set to ensure full stud yagent administration. Unblinded site staff will be responsible for receip t, storage, reconstitution, and labelling, and accountability of investigational product."

Treatment after the End of the Study Participant s will not receive an y additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study or withdrawal of IP because other treatment options are available . The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant’s medical condition. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants that permanently stop study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study . Participant s have the right to discontinue study treatment before the end of the study . A participant may also be asked to discontinue study treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. Participant s who withdraw from study treatment prematurel y (for an y reason) should, where possible, continue to be followed-up un til the completion of the Safety Follow -up assessments: For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study , anearly withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the remaining protocol- defined visits until their EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator. Three Follow-up visits will then be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the EW visit for safet y assessments. Participants who discontinue I P earl y and withdraw consent to participate in the study should complete as many assessments planned for the EW visit as possible. If this is not possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the participant to participate in as much of the study as they are willing (or able) to. A participant may be withdrawn from study treatment at any time. A reason for premature discontinuation o f study treatment (e.g., AE, lack of efficacy [including loss of asthma control] , protocol deviation, I nvestigator discretion, consent withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF ."
157,page_157,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 56A participant must be withdrawn from study treatment if any of the followin g stopping criteria are met: 1.Liver Chemistry : Meets any of the protocol- defined liver chemistry stopping criteria . 2.QTc: Meets an y of the protocol -defined stopping criteria. 3.Pregnancy : Positive pregnancy test. 4.Participant meets at least one of the follow ing criteria for ‘loss of asthma control’: ACQ -5 score increase from baseline (measured at Visit 2) ≥0.5 point . Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from baseline (measured at Visit 2) >7.5 %. Inability to continue inhaled corticosteroid titration which is a ssessed and determined b y the investigator at an y time point following randomization, including on scheduled clinic visits. A clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalization). 5.Study treatment unblinded. Note: In the event o f unblinding the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. 6.Abnormal Holter of Mobitz II AVB, complete AVB, sustained or non -sustained ventricular tach ycardia (VT), parox ysmal supraventricular tach ycardia(PSVT), new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter will be a withdrawal/stopping criterion. These findings on ECG (baseline, V4, V6) or findings of m yocardial ischemia will also result in withdrawal/stopping. 7.Hypersensitivity or anaphy lactic reaction 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safet y guidance: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid ances/UCM174090.pdf. Discontinuation of study treatment for ab normal liver tests should be considered b y the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant."

QTc Stopping Criteria The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett’s formula (QTc B), Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine- read or manually over -read. T he same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not b e changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period."
159,page_159,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 58A participant who meets the bulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treat ment: QTc >500 msec OR Uncorrected QT >600 msec Change from baseline of QTc >60 msec For participant s with underly ing bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block <450 msec , Discontinuation QT c with Bundle Branch Block >500 msec Baseline QTc wit h Bundle Branch Block <450 -480msec , Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block ≥530 msec . See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of earl y withdrawal (EW visit) and follow -up and for an y furt her evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Rechallenge 8.1.3.1. Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Additionally , if h ypersens itivity or anaph ylactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued and study restart is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discre tion of the investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. Note: In order to achieve the stratification balance, as a result of participants’ eosinophil count it may be necessary to withdraw participants from the study during the Run -in period. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of earl y withdrawal (EW visit) and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need tobe completed. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site."
160,page_160,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 59The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain wh ether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y des ign requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form has been signed by the participant . Selection and modification of the partici pant’s medications prior to study participation is based on the phy sician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each participant’s needs. A participant’s treatment must not be changed merely for the purpose of enabling the partic ipant ’s participation in the stu dy. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments The timings of all efficacy assessments are specified in SoA. 9.1.1. Questionnaires 9.1.1.1. Asthma Control Questionnaire ACQ-5 The ACQ -5 measures attributes of asthma control [ Juniper , 1999] , measured with questions designed to be self -completed b y the participant. Participants will complete the ACQ -5 with the use of an e- Diary device on a weekly basis. The ACQ -5 includes five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) which enquire about the frequency and/or severit y of"
161,page_161,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 60symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The recall period is the past week. A score of <0.75 indicates well -controlled asthma and a score 1.5 indicates poorly controlled asthma [ Juniper , 2006]. A change of 0.5 in score suggests a clinically important change in score [ Juniper , 2005]. 9.1.1.2. St. George’s Respiratory of Life Questionnaire ( SGRQ) The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire is a well established instrument, comprising 50 questions designed to measure Quality of Life in patients with diseases of airway obstruction, measuring symptoms, impact, and activity . The questions are designed to be self-completed b y the participant [ Jones, 1992] with a recall over the past 4 weeks. Higher scores indicate worse health status, and a change of 4 points is considered a clinically relevant change [ Jones, 2005]. 9.1.2. Daily Diaries Participant s will be issued with a PEF/ e-Diary device at Visit 1 for twice daily use(in the morning upon waki ng and in the evening just before going to bed) throughout the study . The device will be provided by a third -party vendor . Information on the device and its use are documented in the SRM and the third- party vendor manual . Participant s will be instructed on how to use the device in order to record results for the following in the eDiary each day from Visit 1 onwards : Morning and evening peak flow (best of three). Daytime asthma sy mptom score using a 5- point scale Inhalations of rescue medication usage over the previous 24- hours Frequency of awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use Morning and Evening use of FP/Sal and FP during the run -in and treatment periods Section 9.1.2 describes the a ssessments and questionnaires recorded on the eDiary device, as well as the alerts that can be triggered based on recorded results. The data from the eDiary device will be automatically transmitted to a centralized server. The Investigator and designee(s) will be provided with access to the transmitted eDiary data via a vendor -provided portal and should review the data on an ongoing basis to check for the incidence of alerts as well as subject compliance with eDiary use. Participants will also be issued wit h a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to record medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (please refer to the SRM for further details). Participants must also use this paper worksheet to record all healthcare contacts that occur during their participation in the study . This paper worksheet will be used to assist participant recall in discussions with the Investigator , for site staff to then enter as appropriate in the electronic case report form ( eCRF) ."
162,page_162,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 619.1.2.1. Night -time Awakening, Day time A sthma Sy mptom Questions Every morning upon waking (from the morning after Visit 1 onwards ), participants will answer a question on the occurrence of night- time awakenings due to asthma sy mptoms. The participant ’s response to the questio n on the occurrence of night- time awakenings will be either ‘Yes’ (i.e. Did y ou wake up due to asthma sy mptoms ( i.e. wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness ) or ‘No’ (i.e. they did not experience at least one night -time awakening due to asthma s ymptoms ). If ‘Yes’ ,participants will be asked to respond either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the question on rescue medication (i.e. when you woke up due to your asthma symptoms did you use an y rescue bronchodilator?). On the evening of Visit 1 (just before going to bed) and every evening there- after, participants will answer a question on day time asthma sy mptoms. These questions will be answered on a 5- point scale (0 to 4) with ‘0’ representing no day time asthma sy mptoms and ‘4’ representing very severe day time asthma sy mptoms .Please describe the severity of your asthma s ymptoms (i.e. cough, wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath) today [0=no asthma symptoms, 1=mild asthma sy mptoms, 2= moderate asthma s ymptoms, 3=severe asthma s ymptoms, 4= very severe asthma sy mptoms]. 9.1.2.2. Morning and Evening Home PEF Participant s will conduct PEF measurements using the PEF/eDiary device each morning and each evening. Three measurements for each session will be recorded by the participant s in the eDiary. Assessments will b e performed: After completing all other eDiary assessments Prior to albuterol/salbutamol use Prior to FP/Sal and FP use 9.1.2.3. Alerts For safet y the following alerts, indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with instructions for the par ticipant to contact the investigator and transmit the data to the centralised server as soon as possible if any of the alert criteria are met. An alert in itself will not qualify as a clinicall y significant exacerbation: Decrease in morning PEF 30% on at least two of three successive day s, compared with Baseline (last 7 day s of run- in). Adaytime symptom score of 3 for at least two of three successive day s. An increase from baseline of ≥4 puffs /day of albuterol/salbutamol use on 2 consecutive day s. Awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use for at least two of three successive nights. If any of the alert criteria are met, e mail notificat ions will be sent to the investigator as soon as the data is transmitted to the centralized server .The investigator will make every effort to contact the participants in order to discuss the participants’ s ymptoms and evaluate whether they experienced loss of asthma control."
163,page_163,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 629.1.3. Pulmonary Function Test Spirometry equipment and a device to measure FeNO (see Section 9.1.4 ) will be provided to all sites by a third -party vendor. Spirometry data from this study will be analysed by a third-party vendor .Details on performing the spirometry assessments, including information on the equipment provided and its use as well as specific instructions on performing the spirometry manoeuvres are documented in the SRM and the third- party vendor man ual. 9.1.3.1. Spirometry Spirometry will be performed to assess FEV1 and FVC. At least 3 spirometry manoeuvres (from a maximum of 8 attempts) should be achieved on each occasion that spirometry assessments are performed. For spirometry data collected at Screening ( Visits 1), the best spirometry effort will be selected from a measurement that meets American Thoracic Society (ATS)/ European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines and has a minimum of 2 efforts which are considered valid and repeatable, in accordance with the ATS/ERS standards [ Miller , 2005]. Measurements with 3 valid but non -repeatable efforts will not be accepted. For spirometry data collected during the Treatment Period (Visits 2 – 11, including EWvisit) , the best spirometry effort will be selected from a m easurement that meets ATS/ERS guidelines and has a minimum of 2 efforts which are considered valid (not necessarily repeatable). As alway s, sites should continue to strive to collect at least 3 valid (with no more than 8) efforts, as per ATS/ERS guidelines. At each visit, spirometry assessments must be performed at the same time of day (2 hour) as the assessment performed at Visit 2 (the baseline assessment ). Participant s should withhold short -acting beta -2-agon ists (SABAs) for 6 hours and LABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e.  12or 24hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) prior to the clinic visit, if possible. 9.1.3.2. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ ERS Task force: Standardization of Lung Function Testing [ Miller ,2005]. A baseline spirometry assessment should be performed after a washout period of at least 6 hours for short -acting β2-agonists and 1 dosing interval for long -acting β 2-agonists (or fixed dose combinations of LABA and ICS). To perform the reversibili ty assessment, 4 puffs of the provided salbutamol/albuterol is administered following completion of the baseline assessment. A spacer device may be used for testing, if required. A second spirometry assessment is performed within 10 to 15 minutes after adm inistrati on of the salbutamol/albuterol. Reversibility assessment at Screening (Visit 1) is not required if there is documented reversibility prior to Screening (Visit 1), or documented history of bronchial hyperreactivity from a bronchoprovocation study (e.g. methacholine challenge) prior to Screening (Visit 1)."
164,page_164,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 639.1.4. Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) FeNO will be measured using a handheld electronic device. Measurements will be obtained in accordance with the ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Proce dures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled L ower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide [Miller ,2005]. All sites will use standardi zed equipment provided b y a central vendor. For each observation, at least 2 me asurements will be obtained to establish reproducibility (up to 8 measurements can be performed). FeNO measurements will be interpreted in accordance with the Official ATS Clinical Practice Guideline: I nterpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels (FeNO) fo r Clinical Applications [Dweik , 2011]. FeNO observati ons must be completed before FEV1 assessments. Participant s should not use their rescue medication for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical ne ed. Participants should also withhold L ABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12 or 24 hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) before each FeNO assessment. 9.1.5. Review of Loss of Asthma Control Loss of asthma control is defined as at least on e of the following: ACQ -5 score increase from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) ≥0.5 point ) or Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) > 7.5 % or Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre- defined schedule (Section 5.1) or A clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation. At each clinic visit, the Investigator will utilize clinical discretion and available objective evidence (including but not limited to eDiary data, spirometry data, the most recent ACQ5 scores, history of exacerbations, conmeds, AEs) to determine if the patient is experiencing loss of asthma control. The paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet must also be reviewed b y the Investigator (or appropriatel y trained designee) at each visit to the study site to assist the I nvestigator in the identification of loss of asthma control. It is expected that the Investigator will indicate which criterion (criteria) the subject met that constituted loss of asthma control. 9.2. Adverse Events The definition s of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . Asthma exacerbations or worsening of asthma should not be recorded as an AE, unless they meet the definition of an SAE. For the purposes of this study , asthma exacerbation s will be collected and recorded on the exacerbations log in the eCRF. The treatment details must also be recorded in the eCRF. The time period for collection of asthma exacerbations will begin from screening and will end after the follow -up period has bee n completed."
165,page_165,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 64The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatmen t or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the Visit 2 until the last follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). At Visits 0 and 1 SAE information will be collected only for any SAEs considered as related to stud y participation. All AEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining infor med consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form ( eCRF ) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee w ithin 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting an AE and/or SAE. Open- ended and non- leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since your last visit/contact?” Participant s will be issued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to record an y medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (See Section 9.1.2 )."
166,page_166,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 659.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant a t subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on f ollow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilitie s towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g. summary or listing of SAEs from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV eCRF s are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medicinal Dictionary for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA) terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occur rence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the last follow- up visit."
167,page_167,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 66If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described above which results in clinical signs and sy mptoms. These should be recorded by the Investigator on the AE/SAE eCRF pages. The dose of GSK3772847 considered to be an overdose has not been defined .There are no known antidotes and GlaxoSmithKline does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. The Investigator will use clinical judgement in treating the sy mptoms of a suspected overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for 16 weeks after the last dose . 3.Obtain a serum sample for PK anal ysis within 7 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF . Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the Skin, Cardiovascular, R espiratory , Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs should be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2) prior to conducting spirometry .Blood pressure (sy stolic and"
168,page_168,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 67diastolic) and pulse rate will be measured in the supine position after approximately 5 minutes rest. A single set of values will be collected and recorded in the source documentation and eCRF . 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms All sites will use standardised ECG equipment provided by a centralized external vendor. A single 12 -lead ECG and rhy thm strip wi ll be recorded after measurement of vital signs and before other clinical tests such as blood draws and pulmonary function tests. Recordings will be made at the time- points defined in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2). All ECG measurements will be made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this position for approximately 5 minutes before each reading. Participants should be reminded to avoid caffeine or caffeinated drinks for at least 8 hours before each 12-lead ECG assessment . Also, decongestants are disallowed for at least 24 hours and antihistamines for at least 48 hours before each 12 -lead ECG assessment. For participants who meet the QTc, protocol defined stopping criter ia, triplicate ECGs (over a brief period of time) should be performed ( Section 8). The Investigator, a designated sub- Investigator or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing each 12 -lead EC G. The Investigator must provide his/her dated signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticit y of the ECG machine interpretation. All ECGs will be electronically transmitted to an independent cardiologist and evaluated. The independe nt cardiologist, blinded to treatment assignment, will be responsible for providing measurements of heart rate, QT intervals and an interpretation of all ECGs collected in this study . A hard cop y of these results will be sent to the I nvestigator. The Inves tigator must provide his/her dated signature on the confirmed report, attesting to his/her review of the independent cardiologist’s assessment. Details of the cardiac monitoring procedures will be provided b y the centralized cardiology service provider. 9.4.4. Continuous ambulatory ECG (Holter) Continuous ECG monitoring (Holter) assessments have been added to the protocol to allow for a quantitative assessment of abnormal rhythm events. Holter monitors will be provided b y a third part y vendor to each site. The device should be connected and electrodes attached to the participant as per the vendor’s instructions."
169,page_169,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 689.4.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the eCRF . The laboratory reports must be fil ed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laborat ory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 5 days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered signif icantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required labor atory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non- protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institutio n’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Whole blood samples of approximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of GSK3772847 as specified in the SoA . The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. The actual d ate and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of GSK3772847. Samples collected for analyses of serum concentration may also be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects related to concerns aris ing during or after the study . Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided in the SRM 9.6. Pharmacody namics Pharmacody namic (PD) Biomarkers Blood (serum) samples will be collected during this study for the purposes of mea suring free and total sST2 levels .Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA. The timing of the collections may be adjusted on the basis of emerging PK or PD"
170,page_170,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 69data from this study or other new information in order to ensure optimal e valuation of the biomarker endpoints. 9.7. Genetics Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogenetic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 6. The I EC/IRB and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency must approve the PGx and genet ic assessments before these can be conducted at the site. The approval(s) must be in writing and will clearl y specify approval of the PGx and genetic assessments (i.e., approval ofAppendix 6). In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated. When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of the study will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be conducted. 9.8. Biomarkers 9.8.1. Exploratory Biomarkers Blood (serum ) and sputum ( Section 9.8.1.1 ) samples will be collected during this study and may be used for the purposes of measuring asthma biomarkers or endoty pes of asthma , as well as response to GSK3772847 . Biomarkers will include, but not be limited to, serum total IgE, Eosinophilic Cationic Protein (ECP) and Ty pe-2 chemokines (e.g. CCL13, CCL 17) as well as sputum cell counts (e.g. percentage eosinophils). Samples may also be used to identify factors that may influence the development o f asthma and/or medically related conditions. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA. 9.8.1.1. Sputum Sub -Study At selected sites only, consenting participants who are eligible for randomisation at Visit 2 will be entered into the Sputum sub-study . In a subset of approximately 50% of eligible participants, sputum samples will be collected as specified in the SoA. The participants in the Sputum Sub -Study will be randomised equall y inthe two treatment groups. Details of the sputum collecti onand processing methodology will be provided in the SRM. 9.8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments Serum samples will be collected and tested for the presence of antibodies that bind to GSK3772847, as specified in the SoA. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. The presence of anti -GSK3772847 antibodies will be assessed using a tiered approach including a screening assay , a confirmation assay and calculation of titre."

Health Economics OR Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health Economics/Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypotheses The primary null hy pothesis ( ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions of subjects with loss of asthma control from randomiz ation to W eek 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is unity . The alternative hy pothesis ( ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions of subjects with loss of asthma control from randomiz ation to W eek 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is not unity . The h ypothes is will be tested by calculating the posterior probability that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25%, 50% and 80% reduction) and supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. A non -informativ e prior will be used. Although the success of the study will be assessed by calculating posterior probabilities of the treatment effect reaching various thresholds and not statistical significance, a frequentist anal ysis will also be performed testing the above h ypothesis . 10.2. Sample Size Determination The study will randomiz e 74 participants per treatment arm with the aim of having 70 evaluable participants per arm. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on IP or who withdraws from IP having met the primary endpoint. See Section 10.4.1 for how subjects who withdraw early from IP for reasons other than loss of asthma co ntrol are handled in the anal ysis."
172,page_172,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 71In addition to testing the hypothesis in the overall population, the study will randomize a sufficient number of participants to evaluate trends in pre- defined subgroups (e.g. eosinophil strata). The true proportion of participants that would experience a loss of asthma control on each treatment is unknown. However in a similar stud y of Dupilumab compared with placebo, the proportion of participants with loss of control were 6% and 44% for Dupilumab and placebo respectivel y. Table 4gives the power to detect a statisticall y significant difference (at the two -sided 5% level) between the two treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44% and the true pr oportion with loss of control on active is 6%, 11%, 19% and 22% [ Fleiss, 2003]. Table 4 Table of Po wer A chievable for Different Treatment Comparisons using N=70 per arm calculated using PA SS True proportion on PlaceboTrue proportion on GSK3772847Reduction Power 44% 6% 86% > 99% 44% 11% 75% > 99% 44% 19% 57% 90% 44% 22% 50% 80% Assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, then with 70 evaluable participants per arm, the study will have at least 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on GSK3772487 is at most 22% ( Table 4 ). With 70 evaluab le participants per arm and assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, the smallest observed difference that would lead to rejection of the null hy pothesis (minimum detectable effect) is 31% corresponding to a proportion with loss of control on GSK3772847 of 28%. There is a single primary endpoint so no adjustments are required for multiplicity . 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participan ts who sign the ICF. Randomized All participants who were randomized. A subject who is recorded as a screen or run -in failure and also randomized will be considered to be randomized in error provided they have not performed any study assessments. Modifie d Intent -to-treat All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually"
173,page_173,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 72Population Description (ITT) received. Safety This population will be the same as the Modified Intent -to-treat populatio n. PKAll randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication, and for whom at least one pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analyzed and was measurable. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryThe primary endpoint proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control will be analyzed using both Bayesian and Frequentist methods. A subject is deemed to have met the endpoint of loss of asthma control if they meet the criteria for any of the com ponents of the definition of loss of asthma control. The posterior probabilities that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25 %, 50% and 80% reduction) will be calculated analytically assuming a non -informative prior .This will be supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately. In addition, the propor tion of participants with loss of asthma control will be analyzed using logistic regression allowing for baseline eosinophils strata. The odds ratio, 95% CI and p- value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be presented. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately by fitting a separate model with an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment interaction. The effect of eosinophils as a continuous covariate will also be examined in a separate -logistic regres sion model. Missing data will be handled using the following methods: 1)The loss of asthma control will be set to missing for participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control 2)A sensitivity analysis will be per formed where participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control will have the endpoint set to loss of control"
174,page_174,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 73Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods SecondaryThe following secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same statistical analysis a s described for the primary endpoint: Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation) Proportion of participants with Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from Baseline (measured at the end of Run- in) >7.5 % Proportion of participants with Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre -defined schedule (Section 5.1) Proportion of participants with ACQ -5 score increase from Basel ine (measured at the end of Run -in) ≥0.5 point. Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation or inability to titrate ICS according to the pre -defined schedule. In these analyses, the endpoint will be set to missing for parti cipants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control. Time to loss of asthma control will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier analysis. Percentiles for time to loss of control will be presented for both treatment groups, along with graphical survival plots. Any early withdrawals from IP that did not experience loss of control will be censored. Results will be presented for both of the two eosinophil strata separately, and combined. The following endpoints will be analyze d using repeated logistic regression. This analysis will be repeated including an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment by visit interaction to provide estimates for the two eosinophil strata separately: Proportion of ACQ -5 responders (a ≥0.5 point improvement from baseline at Week 16) Proportion of SGRQ responders (at least a 4 unit improvement from baseline at Week 16 These analyzes will be performed using two different methods for handling missing data: 1)If endpoint at a visit is missing then the responder status is set to missing 2)If endpoint at a visit is missing and the endpoint is also missing at all subsequent visits then the responder status is set to non- responder The odds ratio, 95% CI and p- value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be presented for all models. Mixed model repeated measures will be used to analyze the following endpoints. The baseline value of each endpoint will be included along with baseline*visit and treatment*visit interactions. Treatment differences, 95% confidence intervals and p -values will be presented . Change from baseline in ACQ -5 absolute score Change from baseline in SGRQ total score"
175,page_175,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 74Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Change from baseline in Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 Change from baseline in FeNO This analysis will be repeated in cluding an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment by visit interaction to provide estimates for each eosinophil strata separately. No adjustment will be made for missing data. Further information on how the following endpoints will be analyzed will be described in the report and analysis plan: Hospitalisation or ER visit during the study treatment period Morning and evening PEF Daily asthma symptom score Rescue medication use (albuterol/salbutamol): number of occasions per day Night -time awake nings due to asthma symptoms requiring rescue medication Any changes to the planned analysis methods will be documented in the reporting and analysis plan. Details of subgroup analyses for the primary and secondary endpoints will be described in the repor ting and analysis plan. Exploratory Will be described in the reporting and analysis plan 10.4.2. Safety Analyses All safet y anal yses will be performed on the Safety Population. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary There is no primary safety analysis. Secondary The following secondary safety endpoints will be analyzed descriptively by treatment group:  Incidence and frequency of AEs and SAEs  Vital signs  12-lead ECG  24 hours Holter  Clinical laboratory evaluation  Incidence of and titres of anti- GSK377284 7 antibodies. Details will be described in the reporting and analysis plan Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the standard GSK dictionary , Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), and grouped by body system. The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one AE of any type, AEs within"
176,page_176,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 75each bod y system and AEs within each preferred term will be presented for each treatment group. Separate summaries will be provided for all AEs, drug related AEs, fatal AEs, non- fatal SAEs , adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and AEs leading to withdrawal. Deaths and SAEs, if applicable, will be documented in case narrative format. 10.4.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses All safet y anal yzes will be performed on the PKPopulation. Endpoint Statisti cal Analysis Methods Primary There is no primary pharmacokinetic analysis. SecondaryThe serum GSK3772847 levels from this study will be summarised by treatment and nominal time. Further details will be described in the report and analysis plan. 10.4.4. Pharmacody namic Analy ses All pharmacod ynamic analy sis will be described in reporting and anal ysis plan . 10.4.5. Other A nalyses PK, pharmacod ynamic, and biomarker exploratory anal ysis will be described in the reporting and anal ysis plan. Anypopulation PK analy sis and pharmacod ynamic anal ysis will be reported separately from the main clinical study report (CSR). Should a genetic/PGx analy sis be performed, a separate reporting and anal ysis plan will be generated ( SeeAppendix 6: Genetics). 10.4.6. Interim A nalyses Formal analy ses will be performed at two timepoints. End of Treatment Phase Analysis: This will take place after all participants have completed the Week 16 visit. The data will be cleaned, the treatments unblinded and all clinic visits up to and including week 16 frozen. However, whilst no further efficacy data will be collected post week 16, due to an inability to lock log forms used for collection of exacerbation data, the end of treatment phase anal ysis will be considered an i nterim anal ysis for both efficacy and safet y. An y safet y data collected for participants who have completed clinic visits after Week 16 will also be cleaned and included in the anal ysis. There will be no modifications to dosing regimens, sample size or an y other aspects of the trial based on this data, as all study assessments, apart from follow -up, will have"
177,page_177,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 76alread y been completed. As such an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will not be used, as no further investigational product will be presc ribed after this analysis has taken place. Final Analysis: This will take place after all subjects have completed the study . Data for visits after Week 16 as well as data collected on log pages will be cleaned and the database frozen. This will be the fin al anal ysis for the study . The Reporting and Analysis Plan will describe the planned anal yses in greater detail. Instream review: An iSRC will periodically review unblinded safety data to protect and maintain participant safety whilst maintaining scientif ic validity . Members of the iSRC will be independent of the project. The data will include, but not necessaril y be limited to SAEs, Holters and ECGs. Details are described in the Charter."

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiologica l scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unles s it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clini cal sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" constitutes an AE or SAE."
190,page_190,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 89Events NOT Meeting the AE Def inition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected a t the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to pro gression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the pa rticipant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur dur ing hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalizati on for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE."
191,page_191,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 90d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life fu nctions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi talization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascular ization"
192,page_192,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 91Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator w ill then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF . It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make a n assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utiliz ed for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe."
193,page_193,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 92Assess ment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causa l relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the tempor al relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SA E, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the init ial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follo w-up information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to pe rform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or i nvestigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information."
194,page_194,"2017N311825_01 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 93Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Rep orting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF . After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the assigned SAE contact by telephone. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper eCR F Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper eCRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the assigned SAE contact by telephone . In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a c opy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE eCRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. Contacts f or SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page ."

They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests) related to GSK3772847 or other treatments which may regulate neutrophils and eosinophils or other study treatments including, but not limited to, steroids, long - acting beta -agonists, and other d rugs used in the treatment of asthma, or for asthma and related diseases. Genetic research may consist of the anal ysis of one or more candidate genes or the analy sis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or analysis of the entire genome] (as appropriat e). DNA samples may be analy zed for genetic effects on response. This may include, but not be limited to, an investigation as to whether poly morphisms from IL33 and IL1RL1 gene regions associate with IL33 or soluble ST2 expression levels or associate with efficacy or safet y responses. Additional anal yses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data. The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi- study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to GSK3772847 or study treatments of this class. The results of genetic anal yses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality . The samples will be retained while research on GSK3772847 (or study treatments of this class) or asthma and related diseases continues but no longer than 15 years after the last subject last visit or other period as per local requirements."

SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A randomized, double -blind, parallel group, multicenter, stratified study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of repeat doses of GSK3772847 compared with placebo in participants with severe asthma. Short Title: A study to evaluate the effect of GSK3772847 in patients with severe asthma. Rationale: GSK3772847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 si gma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surface interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicit y 2 [ST2], also known as Interleukin -1 receptor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both type 2 (T2) -driven and non -T2-driven disease. At the time of writing this protocol, a two-part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final clinical study report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator brochure. There are no efficacy data available to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa study to investigate efficacy , safet y and tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK377284 7 in participant s with severe asthma. The study will use a steroid titration design in order to induce instability and evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains protection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants wit h asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which exacerbations were induced b y medication withdrawal. This design may not reflect real world exacerbations; however studies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on exacerbations in a relatively short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies."

Randomiz ation will be stratified based on participant s’ baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count aiming for at least 30% of participant s with eosinophil count <150 cells /L,which is measured at Screening. Number of Participant s: Approximately 300 participants with severe asthma who are maintained on high -dose ICS/LABA will be screened to ensure 148 randomize d (74 on GSK3772847, 74 on placebo) participants and 140 evaluable participants. For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant is defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on investigational product ( IP)or who withdraws from I P having met the primary endpoint .High -dose ICS is defined as fluticasone propionate 500mcg twice daily (i.e. 1000 mcg /day )or equivalent . Treatment Groups and Duration: When required, a pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can be scheduled for signing the informed consent, up to 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). The pre -screening visit can alsooccur on the same day as the Screening visit. Participant s who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will withdraw their regular ICS/LABA treatment for asthma and enter a two -week Run -in period during which they will receive open label background therap y of fluticasone propiona te (FP)/salmeterol (Sal) 500/50 mcg twice dail y (BID) . At the end of the Run -in period at Visit 2 (Week 0) , participant s who meet pre -defined randomiz ation criteria will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to enter a double -blind treatment period and receive the following study treatment every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8 and 12) while initially remaining on the open label background therap y of F P/Sal 500/50 mcg BID at Randomiz ation: GSK3772847 administered intravenousl y or Placebo administered intravenousl y At Visit 4, t wo weeks after Randomiz ation, the open label background therapy will be switched from FP/Sal 500/50 mcg BID to FP 500 mcg BID for 2 weeks .

Stud y Rationale GSK3772847 is a human immunoglobulin G2 sigma isoty pe (IgG2 ) antibody that binds Domain 1 of the cell -surface receptor interleukin -33 receptor (IL -33R). Inhibition of IL - 33 signalling via blockade of the IL -33 receptor (Suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 [ST2], also known as Interleukin -1 recep tor like -1 [IL -1RL1]) presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma as an add -on to standard of care. Agents targeting this mechanism could be expected to have effects on both type 2 ( T2)-driven and non -T2- driven disease. At the time of writing this protocol, a two-part, single and multiple ascending dose first time in human (FTIH) study has completed dosing (final report is pending). The safet y information from this study is included in the investigator brochure. There are no efficacy data avail able to date. The present stud y is the first GSK sponsored study with GSK3772847. It is a Phase IIa study to investigate efficacy , safet y and tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacod ynamic (PD) profiles of GSK3772847 in participant s with severe as thma. The study will use a steroid titration design in order to induce instability and evaluate whether GSK3772847 maintains protection of asthma control. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participants with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which exacerbations were induced b y medication withdrawal [Bel,2014; Wenzel ,2013; Nair,2009]. This design may not reflect real world exacerbations; however stud ies with the design of steroid titration have shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on exacerbations in a relativel y short period of time, before further investigations are conducted in longer term studies. 3.2. Background Severe asthma r epresents approximately 5-10% of the asthma population and is associated with a greater frequency of asthma exacerba tions, decreased hea lth-related quality of life and greater sy mptom burden [ Chung ,2014 ; Aburuz ,2007 ; Moore ,2007 ]. Current biologic agents approved for the management of patients with severe asthma have demonstrated efficacy for T2-driven disease (i.e., eosinophilic and/or elevated serum immunoglobuli n E (IgE )however, there is no currentl y approved therapy that targets non -T2-driven asthma. GSK3772847 (formerl y CNTO 7160 which was in -licensed from Janssen )is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular domain of interleuk in- 33 receptor (IL -33R) and neutralizes IL -33-mediated IL -33R signaling. The IL -33R gene codes for both a soluble form (sST2) and a membrane -bound “long” form (ST2L or IL - 33R). Soluble ST2 exists in the serum and is elevated in severe asthmatics during an exacerbation [ Smithgall ,2008; Oshikawa ,2001]. IL-33R is expressed on immune cells, such as mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T helper cell ty pe 2 (Th2) cells and has been shown to be upregulated on macrophages,"
219,page_219,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 18neutrophils, and dendritic cells. It is also expressed on non-immune cells such as endothelial, epithelial a nd smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. IL-33 has been shown to be released after endothelial or epithelial cell damage during trauma, phy sicochemical / microbarometric stress or infection [Arshad ,2016 ]. IL-33R signalling causes downstream production of Ty pe 2 cy tokines. The engagement of IL -33R with its ligand IL -33 contributes to Th2 -mediated pathologies and allergic responses [Yagami ,2010 ; Smithgall ,2008 ], but has also been shown to promote Th1 -and Th17 -mediated responses [Arshad ,2016; Smithgall ,2008 ].Inhibition of IL -33 signalling via blockade of the IL - 33R may result in down regulation of immune cell responses and therefore presents a potential novel treatment for severe asthma on top of standard of care [Arshad ,2016]. In a 3 -month good labor atory practice ( GLP )toxicology study , GSK3772847 was administered to cy nomolgus monkey s as a weekl y 15-minute IV infusion (20 or 100 mg/kg) and was found to be well -tolerated at both doses. Janssen (Study CNTO7160ASH1001) have conducted a Phase I randomi zed, double - blind, placebo -controlled, intravenous (IV) s ingle ascending dose study in healthy participants and multiple ascending dose stud y in participants with asthma and participants with atopic dermatitis. The study hascompleted dosing. The final clinical study report is still pending. There are no efficacy data available to date. More information about the non -clinical and clinical studies is available in the GSK3772847 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 3.3. Benefit/Risk A ssessment More detailed information about the known and expected benefits , risks and reasonabl y expected adverse events of GSK3772847 may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure ."

Risk A ssessment Potential Risk of Clini cal Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Product (IP) [GSK3772847] Cardiovascular (CV) There is evidence to suggest that the IL -33/ST2 pathway may be protective in the cardiovascular system. Components of the IL -33/ST2 pathway are expressed in a number of cellular components of the heart and blood vessels in rodents and human patients. Increased circulating levels of soluble ST2 are markers of a poor prognosis in patients with hemodynamic stress (e.g. hemodynamic - hypertrophy, chamber dilation, fibrosis; ischemic - apoptosis and infarct volume). The effect was abolished in rodents with geneti c knockout of ST2. Atherosclerotic plaque development was significantly reduced in ApoE -/-mice given exogenous IL -33 while plaques were larger in mice treated with soluble ST2 (which binds and blocks IL -33).Non-clinical: No GSK3772847 -related changes noted in (non - GLP) IV and SC 4 week monkey study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week, or in the GLP 3 month IV repeat do se toxicity study at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week) or subcutaneous (SC) administration. However it should be noted that the animals in toxicity studies are healthy and, therefore, are unlikely to detect the potential target related CV liability. Clinical : In Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, several episodes of sinus tachycardia on telemetry was reported in a 20 year old male healthy volunteer, betw een 1 and 9 hours post -dose (10 mg/kg), accompanied on one occasion by mild vertigo and malaise (no chest pain). Troponin I, N- terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were normal pre dose and Day 5, also normal E CG and vital signs including Exclude participants with existing clinically significant organic heart disease (e.g. Coronary artery disease [CAD], New York Heart Association (NYHA )Class III/IV heart failure) and abnormal, clinically significant findings from 12 - lead ECG and 24 -hour holter monitoring (Section 6.2and Section 6.3). CV events will be monitored (includ ing ECG and Holter monitoring) as specified in Section 2. Allcardiac -related AEs will be reviewed by an independent safety review committee (iSRC ). Protocol -defined stopping criteria are specified in Section 8.1."

The event was considered by the investigator to be likely related to IP. No specific cause was identified. Data on this event was reviewed by GSK (Internal Cardiac Safety Panel and CMO), and was not considered to i mpact further clinical development. In Part 2 of the Janssen study CNTO 7160ASH1001, there were three reports of non - sustained ventricular tachycardia. Of these reports, one participant received placebo and two received GSK3 772847 at 3 mg/kg. The events w ere non -symptomatic, and a monomorphic patte rn (i.e., not Torsades de pointes), which is a pattern thought not to be indicative of increased risk for sudden ventricular tachycardia and sudden death. Heart rate (HR) analysis did not identify any safety conc ern (no pattern of increased HR suggestive of an increase in sympathetic tone ).Dosing was continued as planne d, and the dose escalated to 10mg/kg."
222,page_222,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 21Potential Risk of Clini cal Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy In Part 2, abnormal Holter findings of 2nd degree AV block were observed in two participants at 10 mg/kg. Following review, an independent electrophysiologist stated that these Holter findings were not evidence of “malignant conduction disease”. The Janssen Safety Management team advised that one subject should not receive the final scheduled dose; the 2ndsubject had received the final dose b y the time of review by the Safety Management team. Following unblinding it was noted that one participant received GSK3772847 whilst the other participant had received placebo. Increased risk of infections & immunosuppression Studies in mice indicate a potential role for IL -33 in infection control. IL -33 was shown to activate neutrophils in BALB/c mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture thus preventing polymicrobial sepsis. Similarly, IL -33 is thought to stimulate neutrop hil recruitment from the bone marrow to the periphery in response to fungal infection. Mice infected with flu virus and administered an IL -33 inhibitor exhibited a lower Preclinical : No GSK3772847 -related changes in clinical signs, white blood cell count or no microscopic changes (inflammatory cell infiltrates) in any tissues indicative of infection observed in monkey 4 week IV/SC or IV 3 month toxicity at doses ≤100 mg/kg/week.

Possible interaction with live virus or bacterial vaccines As GSK3772847 is an immunomodulator, there is a possibility that the subject will not mount an adequate vaccine response or even cause the infection the vaccine should protect against.Non-clinical : In the monkey 13 week toxicity study no GSK3772847 -related changes in the T cell dependent B cell response (IgM or IgG) was observed at doses ≤100mg/kg/week. This data is indicative that healthy monkeys were able to mount a response against the antigen challenge during GSK3772847 administration at doses where near complete inhibition of IL -33 was anticipated. Based on this data GSK3772847 is co nsidered unlikely to blunt/inhibit the generation of a response to vaccinations. Clinical : Not observed in Janssen study CNTO7160ASH1001 in healthy volunteers following single doses up to 10 mg/kg, and multiple doses in asthma and atopic dermatitis patients at doses up to 10 mg/kg (3 doses, q2W over four weeks).In the study, subjects should not be vaccinated with live or attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving IP or during the study.

STUDY DESIGN 5.1. Overall Design This is a Phase IIa, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind, stratified, parallel group stud y. There will be a 2 -week Run -in period following Screening (Visit 1). Eligible particip ants will be randomize d at the end of the Run -in period (Visit 2). Randomi zation will be stratified based on participant s’ baseline peripheral blood eosinophil count aiming for at least 30% of parti cipants with eosinophil count < 150cells/L, which i s meas ured at Screening. When required, a pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can be scheduled up to 2 weeks prior to Screening (Visit 1). The pre -screening visit (Visit 0) can alsooccur on the same day as the Screening visit ( Visit 1). Participant s who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will withdraw their regular ICS/ long-acting beta -2-agonists (LABA )treatment for asthma and enter a two -week Run -in period during which they will receive open label background therap y of fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (Sal) 500/50 mcg BID. At the end of the Run -in period at Visit 2 (Week 0), participant s who meet pre -defined"
228,page_228,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 27randomiz ation criteria (Section 6.3)will be randomize d in a 1:1 ratio to enter a double - blinded Treatment Period and receive the following stud y treatment every 4 weeks for 12 weeks (Week 0, 4, 8 and 12) while initially remaining on the open label background therap y of F P/Sal 500/50 mcg BID at Randomiz ation: GSK3772847 administered intravenousl y or Placebo administered intravenousl y At Visit 4 (i.e. two weeks after Random ization )the open label background therap y will be switched from FP/S almeterol 500/50 mcg BID to FP 500 mcg BID for 2 weeks. This will mark the beginning of theFP titration period. Every two weeks for the next six weeks the dose of FP will be reduced b y approximately 50 % (i.e. FP 250 mcg BID at Visit 5for 2 weeks, FP 100 mcg BID at Visit 6for 2 weeks, th en FP 50 mcg BID at Visit 7for 2 weeks) until complete FP discontinuation at Visit 8, provided that the participant does not meet an y of the loss of asthma control criteria. If an y of the pre -defined criteria for loss of asthma control aremet during the Treatment P eriod, participants will be withdrawn from the investigational product (I P) and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined by the investigator . For participants who receive all four doses of blinded study treatment, a n End of Treatment P eriod (ETP) Visit will be performed 4 weeks after the final dose of the blinded study treatment is administered at Week 12. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator, after protocol defined study assessments are completed. Three Follow -up visits will be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks (Week 20, Week 24, and Week 28) after the ETP Visit for safet y assessments. For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to pa rticipate in the study , an earl y withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete allassessments at the remaining protocol -defined visits until th eir EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator.

Distinguish between the end of the study (EU definition) and study completion (US CT Registry definition: Final date on which data was or is expected to be collected) if they are not the same. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities for the last participant in the trial globally . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study will use a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group and placebo - controlled design. This is a well -established desi gn to evaluate the efficacy, safet y,PK and PD profiles of an investigational drug. The design of steroid titration (oral or inhaled) in participant s with asthma has been used in various studies with different investigational products, in which exacerbations were induced b y medication withdrawal [Bel,2014; Wenzel ,2013 ; Nair,2009 ]. This design may not reflect real world exacerbations, however studies with the design of steroid titration hav e shown the ability to assess effects of a potential treatment on exacerbation s in a relativel y short period of time, before further investigation s are conducted in longer term studies. In this stud y, the target population would be participants with seve reasthma and with an ACQ 5≥1.5whose s ymptoms must have been managed on a stable, high dose I CS/LABA for at least 4 months prior to Screening. The use of loss of asthma control as a composite study endpoint and a criterion for ICS titration allows for the overall clinical evaluation ofthe participant’s asthma status taking into account both lung function and sy mptom control. Participants will also be monitored through the use of the eDiary . Pre-specified asthma sy mptom scores and participant -measured PEF that is inputted into the eDiar y will be used as prompts for contacts between subjects and investigators (Section 9.1.2.3 ). The FP titration period will occur during the Treatment Period of the study . The FP dose reduction will be assessed and managed at scheduled clinic v isits. During the FP titration period the subjects’ FP dose will be reduced as described in Section 5.1and the SoA, unless the subject meets protocol defined criteria for loss of asthma control indicating that it is not acceptable for the participant tofurther reduce ICS. Prior to each FP dose reduction an assessment of the participants’ asthma control should be completed and the decision to reduce the dose of FP will be based on:1) the presence and severity of exacerbation s, 2) changes in FEV1, 3) changes in the most recent ACQ -5 score ,or 4) the ability to titrate ICS as per the pre -defined schedule ,according to the investigator ’s clinical judgment . If loss of control is confirmed during the FP titration period, the participant will discontinue I P immediatel y and should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator . A similar methodology was recently reported [Wenzel ,2013 ] and successfully allowed titration of ICS."
231,page_231,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 30To evalua te the safet y and tolerability of repeat dose of GSK3772847, a placebo arm will be included to allow the absolute effect of GSK3772847 to be assessed. The treatment duration of 12 weeks is supported b y pre -clinical study data. Dosing frequency of IP every 4 weeks with endpoints assessments scheduled 4 weeks post final IP dose are determined b y the available target engagement pharmacod ynamic findings. Upon completing the 1 6week Treatment P eriod (or after I P discontinuation), participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as determined b y the investigator and will be followed up for an additional 12 weeks before a final safety evaluation. This Follow up Period will ensure that sufficient PK samples are taken to fully charact erise the pharmacokinetics, pharmacod ynamics, and anti -drug antibod y responses in this population. An inhaled short acting beta 2–receptor agonist, salbutamol/albuterol will be provided to all participant s to use as needed to relieve asthma sy mptoms from Screening (Visit 1) to end of the Treatment Period. Both safety and efficacy parameters will be assessed regularl y in the clinic to minimise any potential risks to the participant s.Participant s’ safet y will also be assured by having withdrawal crit eria(Section 8.1) in case of loss of asthma control. 5.5. Dose Justification The dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg IV at Week 0 then Weeks 4, 8 and 12 was selected based on the obser ved evidence of target suppression following single doses in healthy participant s (CNTO7160ASH1001). In summary , administration of a single 10 mg/kg dose led to significant (> 95%) suppression of serum free sST2 and sustained elevations of total sST2 up to at least 28 day s after dosing. Therefore, the selected regimen should deliver significant target suppression throughout the treatment period, including at trough, and allow de termination of the impact of targeting this pathway on the primary endpoint (measured over 0 -16 weeks). Simulations of exposure were generated using a preliminary Michaelis Menten (MM) population PK model using the single dose data from 0.03 -10mg/kg up to 28 day s. Safety margins were estimated by comparing the mean clinical exposures (predicted or observed) against the mean observations in the 3-month GL P toxicology study in cynomolgus monkey s (T-2013 -007). Area under the curve ( AUC )margins were calculate d by comparing the predicted clinical exposures from 0 -28 weeks (end of study ) to the observed exposure from 0 -92 day s (13 weeks) when the main study animals were removed from stud y. Predicted exposures throughout the study and follow up period are signifi cantl y lower than those observed in stud y T-2013 -007as shown in Figure 1"

243,page_243,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 42If GSK personnel are not contacted before the unblinding, the Investigator must notify GSK within 24 hours after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded particip ant, unless that information is important for the safet y of participants currentl y in the stud y. The date and event or condition which led to the unblinding (i.e. the primary reason) will be recorded in source documentation and in the eCRF . In the event of unblinding the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. Should a participant’s treatment assignment be unblinded and the Medical monitor/GSK team determine that the participant must be withdrawn from I P, the participant must be followed -up as per protocol until the completion of the Safet y Follow -up assessments . GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant w ith an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability GSK3772847 a white to yellow, uniform ly ophilized cake in a 5ml clear glass vial with 20mm closure sealed b y red metal and yellow overseal.

Commercially available diluent will be used for dilution of study agent and will also serve as placebo for this study . Use of study agent diluent as placebo for injection provides an adequate comparator to broadl y assess safet y in early clinical devel opment. GSK3772847 must be prepared b y an unblinded pharmacist or other appropriately licensed and authorized personnel and administered according to each participant ’s bod y weight at Screening ( Visit 2). A different site staff member, who will be blinded to the treatment assignment, will administer the study agent. Aseptic procedures must be used during preparation and administration of the study agent. GSK3772847 must be filtered with a 0.22 micron filter before being diluted in sterile commercially avai lable diluent. Diluted GSK3772847 at volumes of50mLare to be administered by IV infusion over a period of at least 30 minutes using an in -line 0.22 micron filter. At least 30 mLof commerciall y available diluent will be used to flush diluted drug from t he administration set to ensure full study agent administration . Unblinded site staff will be responsible for receipt, storage, reconstitution, and labelling, and accountability of investigational product."
244,page_244,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 43GSK3772847 should be inspected visuall y for parti culate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

Administration will be documented in the source documents and reported in the eCRF . 7.7. Concomitant Therapy All asthma medicat ions used within approximate ly 12 weeks prior to screening and during the stud y (including the post -treatment period) should be recorded in the eCRF . All non -asthma medications taken during the study (after randomiz ation including post - treatment) and an y changes to concomitant medica tions will be recorded in the eCRF . Note: Study provided FP/S al, FP, and albuterol/salbutamol should not be recorded in the ConMeds page of the eCRF . The minimum requirement is that the drug name, reason for use, dose (including unit e.g. mcg) and frequency , route and the dates of adm inistration are to be recorded. 7.7.1. Permitted Non -asthma Medications The following medications are permitted during the study : Medications for rhinitis (e.g., intranasal corticosteroids, antih istamines [including ocular and intranasal], cromoly n, nedocromil, nasal decongestants) Antibiotics for short term treatment of acute i nfections. L ong term treatment with topical or ophthalmic antibiotics are permitted. Decongestants :Participant s may take decongestants during the study ,but these are disallowed for 24 hours prior to ECG measurements . Immunotherap y: Immunotherap y for the treatment of allergies is allowed during the study provided it was initiated 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 and participant s remain in the maintenance phase for the duration of the study . Topical and ophthalmic corticosteroids . 7.7.2.

Treatment after the End of the Study Participant s will not receive an y additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study or withdrawal of IP because other treatment options are available . The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consider ation has been given to the post - study care of the participant ’s medical condition . 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants that permanently stop study treatment are encouraged to remain in the study . Participant s have the right to discontinue study treatment before the end of the study . A participant may also be asked to discontinue study treatment at the Investigator’s discretion. Participant s who withdraw from study treatment prematurel y (for an y reason) should, where possible, continue to be followed -up until the completion of the Safety Follow -up assessments : For participants who discontinue I P earl y, but have not withdrawn consent to participate in the stud y, an earl y withdrawal (EW) visit will be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of blinded study treatment. These participants should continue in the study and complete all assessments at the remaining protocol - defined visits until their EW visit. Participants should resume regular treatment for their asthma, as de termined by the investigator. Three Follow -up visits will then be performed 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the EW visit for safety assessments. Participants who discontinue I P earl y and withdraw consent to participate in the study should complete as many assess ments planned for the EW visit as possible. If this is not possible, the I nvestigator must encourage the participant to participate in as much of the study as they are willing (or able) to. A participant may be withdrawn from study treatment at any time. A reason for premature discontinuation of study treatment (e.g., AE, lack of efficacy [including loss of asthma control ], protocol deviation, I nvestigator discretion, consent withdrawn etc.) must be captured in the eCRF . A participant must be withdrawn from study treatment if any of the following stopping criteria are met:"

Note: In the event of unblinding the Medical monitor/GSK team should be contacted to determine whether subject withdrawal is required. 6.Abnormal Holter of Mobitz II AVB, complete AVB, sustained or non -sustained ventr icular tach ycardia (VT), parox ysmal supraventricular tach ycardia (PSVT) , new onset atrial fibrillation/flutter will be a withdrawal/stopping criterion. These findings on ECG (baseline, V4, V6) or findings of m yocardial ischemia will also result in withdrawal/stopping . 7.Hypersensitivity or anaphy lactic reaction 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] premarketing clinical liver safety guidance). These protocol guidelines are in alignment with FDA premarketing clinical liver safet y guidance: http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceR egulatoryInformation/Guid ances/UCM174090. pdf. Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm or if the investigator believes that it is in the best interest of the participant."
248,page_248,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 47Phase II Liver Chemistry Stopping and Increased Monitoring Algorithm Liver Safet y Required Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in Appendix 7 . 8.1.2. QTc Stopping Criteria The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett’s formula (QTcB), Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine -read or manually over -read. The same QT correction formula must be used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study . This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB , then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formula must continue to be us ed for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis . Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a bri ef (e.g., 5 -10 minute) recording period."
249,page_249,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 48A participant who meets thebulleted criteria based on the average of triplicate ECG readings will be withdrawn from study treatment: QTc >500 msec OR Uncorrected QT >600 msec Change from baseline of QTc >60 msec For participant s with underly ing bundle branch block, follow the discontinuation criteria listed below: Baseline QTc with Bundle Branch Block <450 msec , Discontinuation QT c with Bundle Branch Block >500 msec Baseline QTc wit h Bundle Branch Block <450 -480msec , Discontinuation QTc with Bundle Branch Block ≥530msec . See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of early withdrawal (EW visit) and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.1.3. Rechallenge 8.1.3.1. Study Treatment Restart or Re challenge Study treatment restart or rechallenge after liver chemistry stopping criteria are met by any participant in this study is not allowed. Additionally , if h ypersensitivity or anaph ylactic reaction occurs, infusion should be discontinued and study restart is not allowed. 8.2. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdraw n at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety , behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected befor e such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at t he time of early withdrawal (EW visit) andfollow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit:"
250,page_250,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 49The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and coun sel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant shou ld continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. No study related procedures may be performed until the informed consent form has been signed by the participant . Selection and modification of the participant ’s medications prior to study participation is based on the phy sician’s judgment according to sound medical practice, principles, and each participant ’s needs. A participant ’s treatment must not be changed merely for the purpose of enabling the participant ’s participation in the stu dy. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments The timings of all efficacy assessments are specified in SoA. 9.1.1. Questionnaires 9.1.1.1. Asthma Control Questionnaire ACQ-5 The ACQ -5measures attributes of asthma control [ Juniper ,1999], measured with questions designed to be self -completed b y the participant. Participants will complete the ACQ -5with the use of an e -Diary device on a weekly basis . The ACQ -5 includes f ive questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) which enquire about the frequency and/or severit y of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions co nsist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The recall"
251,page_251,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 50period is the past week. A score of <0.75 indicates well -controlled asthma and a score 1.5 indicates poorly controlled asthma [ Juniper ,2006]. A change of 0.5 in score suggests a clinically important change in score [ Juniper ,2005]. 9.1.1.2. St. Geo rge’s Respiratory of Life Questionnaire (SGRQ ) The St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire is a well established instrument, comprising 50 questions designed to measure Quality of Life in patients with diseases of airway obstruction, measuring symptoms, imp act, and activity . The questions are designed to be self-completed b y the participant [Jones ,1992] with a recall over the past 4 weeks. Higher scores indicate worse health s tatus, and a change of 4 points is considered a clinically relevant change [ Jones ,2005]. 9.1.2. Daily Diaries Participant swill be issued with a PEF/ e-Diary device at Visit 1 for twice daily use(in the morning upon waking and in the evening just before going to bed) throughout the study . The device will be provided by a third -party vendor . Information on the device and its use are documented in the SRM an d the third -party vendor m anual . Participant s will be instructed on how to use the device in order to record results for the following in the eDiary each day from Visit 1 onwards : Morning and evening peak flow (best of three). Daytime asthma s ymptom score using a 5-point scale Inhalations of rescue medication usage over the previous 24 -hours Frequency of awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use Morning and Evening use of FP/Sal and FP during the run -in and treatment periods Section 9.1.2 describes the assessments and questionnaires recorded on the eDiary device, as well as the alerts that can be triggered based on recorded resul ts. The data from the eDiary device will be automatically transmitted to a centralized server. The Investigator and designee(s) will be provided with access to the transmitted eDiary data via a vendor -provided portal and should review the data on an ongoin g basis to check for the incidence of alerts as well as subject compliance with eDiary use. Participants will also be issued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to record medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (please refer to the SRM for further details). Participants must also use this paper worksheet to record all healthcare contacts that occur during their participation in the study . This paper worksheet will be used to assist participant recall in discu ssions with the Investigator , for site staff to then enter as appropriate in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 9.1.2.1. Night -time A wakening, Daytime Asthma Sy mptom Questions Every morning upon waking (from the morning after Visit 1 onwards ), participant s wil l answer a question on the occurrence of night -time awakenings due to asthma sy mptoms. The participant ’s response to the question on the occurrence of night -time awakenings"
252,page_252,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 51will be either ‘Yes’ (i.e. Did y ou wake up due to asthma sy mptoms ( i.e. wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness ) or ‘No’ (i.e. they did not experience at least one night -time awakening due to asthma s ymptoms ). If ‘Yes’ ,participant s will be asked to respond either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ to the question on rescue medication (i.e. when you woke up due to your asthma symptoms did you use an y rescue bronchodilator?). On the evening of Visit 1 (just before going to bed) and every evening there -after, participant s will answer a question on day time asthma sy mptoms. These questions will be answered on a 5 -point scale (0 to 4) with ‘0’ representing no day time asthma sy mptoms and ‘4’ representing very severe day time asthma sy mptoms .Please describe the severity of your asthma s ymptoms (i.e. cough, wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath) today [0=no asthma sy mptoms, 1=mild asthma sy mptoms, 2= moderate asthma s ymptoms, 3=severe asthma s ymptoms, 4= very severe asthma sy mptoms]. 9.1.2.2. Morning and Evening Home PEF Particip ants will conduct PEF measurements using the PEF/eDiary device each morning and each evening. Three measurements for each session will be recorded by the participant s in the eDiary. Assessments will be performed : After completing all other eDiary assessmen ts Prior to albuterol/salbutamol use Prior to FP/Sal and FP use 9.1.2.3. Alerts For safet y the following alerts, indicative of worsening asthma, will be programmed into the eDiary with instructions for the participant to contact the investigator if any of the alert criteria are met. An alert in itself will not qualify as a clinicall y significant exacerbation: Decrease in morning PEF 30% on at least two of three successive day s, compared with B aseline (last 7 day s of run -in). A symptom score of 3for at least two of three successive day s. An increase from baseline of ≥4 puffs /day of albuterol/salbutamol use on 2 consecutive day s. Awakening due to asthma sy mptoms requiring rescue medication use for at least two of three successive nights. 9.1.3. Pulmonary Function Test Spirometry equipment anda device to measure FeNO (see Section 9.1.4 ) will be provided to all sites by a third -party vendor . Spirometry data from this study will be analysed by a third -party vendor .Details on performing the spirometry assessments, including information on the equipment provided and its use as well as specific"
253,page_253,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 52instructions on performing the spirometry manoeuvres are documented in the SRM and the third -party vendor manual. 9.1.3.1. Spirometry Spirometry will be performed to assess FE V1and FVC. At least 3 spirometry manoeuvres (from a maximum of 8 attempts) should be achieved on each occasion that spirometry assessments are performed . The best spirometry effort will be selected from a measurement that meets American Thoracic Society (ATS) /European Respiratory Society (ERS)guidelines and has a minimum of 2 efforts which are considered valid and repeatable , in accordance with the ATS/ ERS standards [ Miller ,2005]. At each visit, spirometry assessments must be performed at the same time of day (2 hour) as the assessment performed at Visi t 2(the baseline assessment). Participant s should withhold short -acting beta -2-agonists (SABAs) for 6 hours and LABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12or 24hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) prior to the clinic visit, if possible. 9.1.3.2. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/European Respiratory Societ y (ERS) Task force: Standardization of L ung Function Testing [ Miller , 2005]. A baseline spirometry assessment should be performed after a washout period of at least 6 hours for short -acting β 2-agonists and 1 dosing interval for long -acting β 2- agonists (or fixed dose combinations of L ABA and I CS). To perform the reversibility assessment, 4 puffs of the provided salbutamol/albuterol is administered following completion of the baseline assessment. A second spirometry assessment is performed within 10 to 15 minutes after administrati on of the salbutamol/al buterol. Reversibility assessment at Screening (Visit 1) is not required if there is documented reversibility prior to Screening (Visit 1), or documented history of bronchial hyperreactivity from a bronchoprovocation study (e.g. methacholine challenge) pr ior to Screening (Visit 1). 9.1.4. Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) FeNO will be measured using a handheld electronic device. Measurements will be obtained in accordance with the ATS/ERS Recommendations for Standardized Procedures for the Online and Offline Measurement of Exhaled L ower Respiratory Nitric Oxide and Nasal Nitric Oxide [Miller ,2005]. All sites will use standardi zedequipment provided b y a central vendor. For ea ch observation, at least 2 measurements will be obtained to establish reproducibility (up to 8 measurements can be performed). FeNO measurements will be interpreted in accordance with the Official ATS Clinical Practice Guideline: I nterpretation of Exhaled Nitric Oxide Levels (FeNO) for Clinical Applications [Dweik ,2011]. FeNO observati ons must be completed before FEV1 assessments. Participant s should not use their rescue medic ation for at least 6 hours before each FeNO assessment, unless essential for clinical need. Participants should also"
254,page_254,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 53withhold L ABAs for 1 dosing interval (i.e. 12 or 24 hours based on the prescribed dosing interval of the product) before each FeNO assessment. 9.1.5. Review of Loss of Asthma Control Loss of asthma control is defined as at least one of the following: A clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation) or Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) > 7.5 % or Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre -defined schedule (Section 5.1) or ACQ -5 score increase from baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) ≥0.5 point. At each clinic visit, the Investigator will utilize clinical discretion and available objective evidence (including but not limited to eDiary data, spirometry data, the most recent ACQ5 scores, hist ory of exacerbations, conmeds, AEs) to determine if the patient is experiencing loss of asthma control. The paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet must also be reviewed b y the Investigator (or appropriatel y trained designee) at each visit to th e study site to assist the I nvestigator in the identification of loss of asthma control. It is expected that the Investigator will indicate which criterion (criteria) the subject met that constituted loss of asthma control. 9.2. Adverse Events The definitions o f an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 4 . The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.2.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAE swill be collected from the Visit2until the last follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2).At Visit s 0 and 1SAE information will be collected onl y for any SAEs considered as related to stud y participation. All AE swill be collected from the signing of the ICF until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences t hat begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form ( eCRF ) not the AE section. All SAE swill be recorded and reported to the s ponsor or designee w ithin 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 4 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available."
255,page_255,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 54Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 4 . 9.2.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting an AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since your last visit/contact?” Participant s will be issued with a paper Medical Problems/Medications Taken worksheet to record an y medical problems experienced and medications used during the study (See Section 9.1.2 ). 9.2.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each partic ipant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to saf ety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary ."
256,page_256,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 55An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y informatio n e.g. summary or listing of SAEs from the sponsor will r eview and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 4 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions reg arding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRF s are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medicinal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up re ports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.2.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until the last follow -up visit. If a pregnancy is re ported, the investigator should inform GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 5. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose An overdose is defined as a do se greater than the total doses described above which results in clinical signs and sy mptoms. These should be recorded by the Investigator on the AE/SAE eCRF pages. The dose of GSK3772847 considered to be an overdose has not been defined .There are no kn own antidotes and GlaxoSmithKline does not recommend a specific treatment in the event of a suspected overdose. The Investigator will use clinical judgement in treating the sy mptoms of a suspected overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately . 2.Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities for 16 weeks after the last dose ."

Decisions regarding dose interruptions o r modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.4. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. 9.4.1. Physical Examinations A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the Skin, Cardiovascular , Respiratory , Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.4.2. Vital Signs Vital signs should be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2) prior to conducting spirometry .Blood pressure (sy stolic and diastolic) and pulse rate will be measured in the supine position after approximately 5 minutes rest. A single set of values will be collected and recorded in the source documen tation and eCRF . 9.4.3. Electrocardiograms All sites will use standardised ECG equipment provided by a centralized external vendor. A single 12 -lead ECG and rhy thm strip will be recorded after measurement of vital signs. Recordings will be made at the time -points defined in the Schedule of Activities (SoA) table ( Section 2). All ECG measurements will be made with the participant in a supine position having rested in this p osition for approximately 5 minutes before each reading. For participant s who meet the QTc, protocol defined stopping criteria, triplicate ECGs (over a brief period of time) should be performed ( Section 8). The Investigator, a designated sub -Investigator or other appropriatel y trained site personnel will be responsible for performing each 12 -lead ECG. The Investigator must provide his/her date d signature on the original paper tracing, attesting to the authenticit y of the ECG machine interpretation. All ECGs will be electronically transmitted to an independent cardiologist and evaluated. The independent cardiologist, blinded to treatment assignm ent, will be responsible for providing measurements of heart rate, QT intervals and an interpretation of all ECGs"

Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the eCRF . The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically signif icant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 5 days after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at t he institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the eCRF . 9.5. Pharmacokinetics Whole blood samples of approximately 3mL will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of GSK3772847 as specified in the SoA . The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. Samples will be used to evaluate the PK of GSK3772847.

Genetics Information regarding genetic/ pharmacogenetic (PGx) research is included in Appendix 6.The I EC/IR B and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency must approve the PGx and genetic assessments before these can be conducted at the site. The approval(s) must be in writing and will clearl y specify approval of the PGx and genetic assessments (i.e., a pproval ofAppendix 6). In some cases, approval of the PGx and genetic assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the study . If so, then the written a pproval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx and genetic assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx and genetic assessments, can be initiated. When PGx and genetic assessments will not be approved, then the approval for the rest of th e study will clearl y indicate this and therefore, PGx and genetic assessments will not be conducted. 9.8. Biomarkers 9.8.1. Exploratory Biomarkers Blood (serum) and sputum ( Section 9.8.1.1 ) samples will be collected during this study and may be used for the purposes of measuring asthma biomarkers or endoty pes of asthma , as well as response to GSK3772847 . Biomarkers will include , but not be limited to, serum total IgE, Eosinophilic Cationic Protein (ECP) and Ty pe-2 chemokines (e.g. CCL13, CCL 17) as well as sputum cell counts (e.g. percentage eosinophils). Samples may also be used to identify factors that may influence the develo pment of asthma and/or medically related conditions. Samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the SoA. 9.8.1.1. Sputum Sub -Study At selected sites only,consenting participants who are randomize d at Visit 2 will be entered into the Sputum sub-study . In a subset of approximately 50% of eligible participants sputum samples will be collated as specified in the SoA. Details of the sputum collection and processing methodology will be provided in the SRM. 9.8.2. Immunogenicity Assessments Serum samples will be collected and tested for the presence of antibodies that bind to GSK3772847, as specified in the SoA. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded . The presence of anti -GSK3772847 antibodies will be as sessed using a tiered approach including a screening assay , a confirmation assay and calculation of titre."

STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypotheses The primary null hy pothesis (   ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions o f subjects with loss of asthma control from randomi zation to Week 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is unity .   :               ℎ            ℎ                   16       3772847               ℎ            ℎ                   16           =1 The alternative hy pothesis (   ) for this study is that the ratio of the proportions of subjects with loss of asthma control from randomi zation to Week 16 between GSK3772847 and placebo is not unity .   :               ℎ            ℎ                   16       3772847               ℎ            ℎ                   16           ≠1 The h ypothes is will be tested by calculating the posterior probability that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25%, 50% and 80% reduction) and supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. A non -informative prior will be used. Although the success of the study will be assessed by calculating posterior probabilities of the treatment effect reaching various thresholds and not statistical significance, a frequentist anal ysis will also be performed testing the above hy pothesis . 10.2. Sample Size Determination The study will randomiz e 74 participants per treatment arm with the aim of having 70 evaluable participants per arm . For the purpose of this study an evaluable participant i s defined as a participant who completes the Week 16 clinic visit whilst remaining on IP or who withdraws from IPhaving met the primary endpoint . See Section 10.4.1 for how subjects who withdraw early from IP for reasons other than loss of asthma control are handled in the anal ysis."
262,page_262,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 61In addition to testing the hy pothesis in the overall population, the study will randomize a sufficient number of participants to evaluate trends in pre -defined subgroups (e.g. eosinophil strata). The true proportion of participants that would experience a loss of asthma control on each treatment is unknown. However in a similar stud y of Dupilumab compared with placebo, the proportion of participants with loss of control were 6% and 44% for Dupilumab and placebo respectivel y.Table 4gives the power to detect a statisticall y significant difference (at the two -sided 5% level) between the two treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on pl acebo is 44% and the true proportion with loss of control on active is 6%, 11%, 19% and 22% [Fleiss , 2003] . Table 4 Table of Po wer A chievable for Different Treatment Comparisons using N=70 per arm calculated using PA SS True proportion on PlaceboTrue proportion on GSK3772847Reduction Power 44% 6% 86% > 99% 44% 11% 75% > 99% 44% 19% 57% 90% 44% 22% 50% 80% Assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, then with 70 evaluable participants per arm, the study will have at least 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatments assuming the true proportion with loss of control on GSK3772487 is at most 22% (Table 4). With 70 evaluable participants per arm and assuming the true proportion with loss of control on placebo is 44%, the smallest observed difference that would lead to rejection of the null hy pothesis (minimum detectable effect) is 31% corresponding to a proportion with loss of control on GSK3772847 of 28%. There is a single primary endpoint so no adjus tments are required for multiplicity . 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participants who sign the ICF. Randomized All participants who were randomized. A subject who is recorded as a screen or run -in failure and also randomized will be considered to be randomized in error provided they have not performed any study assessments. Modified Intent -to-treat All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually"
263,page_263,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 62Population Description (ITT) received. Safety This population will be the same as the Modified Intent -to-treat population. PKAll randomized su bjects who received at least one dose of study medication, and for whom at least one pharmacokinetic sample was obtained, analyzed and was measurable. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods PrimaryThe primary endpoint proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control will be analyzed using both Bayesian and Frequentist methods. A subject is deemed to have met the endpoint of loss of asthma control if they meet the criteria for any of the components of the definition of loss of asthma control. The posterior probabilities that the ratio of the proportion of subjects with loss of asthma control on GSK3772847 compared with placebo is less than 1.0, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 (i.e. a 0%, 25%, 50% and 80% reduction) will be calculated analytically using a no rmal approximation for the logarithm of the ratio of proportions. This will be supported by an estimate of the ratio with a 95% credible interval. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately. In addition, the proportion of participant s with loss of asthma control will be analyzed using logistic regression allowing for baseline eosinophils strata. The odds ratio, 95% CI and p -value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be presented. Results will also be presented for the two eosinophils strata separately by fitting a separate model with an additional term for eosinophil strata by treatment interaction. The effect of eosinophils as a continuous covariate will also be examined in a separate -logistic regression model. Missing data will be handled using the following methods: 1)The loss of asthma control will be set to missing for participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control 2)A sensitivity analysis will be performed where participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control will have the endpoint set to loss of control"
264,page_264,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 63Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods SecondaryThe following secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same statistical analysis as descr ibed for the primary endpoint: Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation (requiring OCS and/or hospitalisation) Proportion of participants with Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 decrease from Baseline (m easured at the end of Run -in) >7.5 % Proportion of participants with Inability to titrate inhaled corticosteroid according to the pre -defined schedule (Section 5.1) Proportion of participants with ACQ -5 score increase from Baseline (measured at the end of Run -in) ≥0.5 point. Proportion of participants with a clinically significant asthma exacerbation or inability to titrate ICS according to the pre -defined schedule . In these analyses, the endpoint will be set to missing for participants who withdraw from IP prior to Week 16 for reasons other than loss of asthma control. Time to loss of asthma control will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier analysis. Percentiles for time to loss of control will be presented for both treatment groups, along with graphical survival plots. Any early withdrawals from IP that did not experience los s of control will be censored. Results will be presented for both of the two eosinophil strata separately, and combined. The following endpoints will be analyzed using repeated logistic regression. This analysis will be repeated including an additional t erm for eosinophil strata by treatment by visit interaction to provide estimates for the two eosinophil strata separately: Proportion of ACQ -5 responders (a ≥0.5 point improvement from baseline at Week 16) Proportion of SGRQ responders (at least a 4 unit improvement from baseline at Week 16 These analyzes will be performed using two different methods for handling missing data: 1)If endpoint at a visit is missing then the responder status is set to missing 2)If endpoint at a visit is missing and the endpoint is also missing at all subsequent visits then the responder status is set to non -responder The odds ratio, 95% CI and p -value for the comparison of GSK3772847 with placebo will be presented for all models. Mixed model repeated measures w ill be used to analyze the following endpoints. The baseline value of each endpoint will be included along with baseline*visit and treatment*visit interactions. Treatment differences, 95% confidence intervals and p -values will be presented . Change from ba seline in ACQ -5 absolute score Change from baseline in SGRQ total score"

No adjustment will be made for missing data. Further information on how the following endpoints will be analyzed will be described in the report and analysis plan: Hospitalisation or ERvisit during the study treatment period Morning and evening PEF Daily asthma symptom score Rescue medication use (albuterol/salbutamol): number of occasions per day Night -time awakenings due to asthma symptoms requiring rescue medication Any changes to the planned analysis methods will be documented in the reporting and analysis plan.

Other A nalyses PK, pharmacod ynamic, and biomarker exploratory analysis will be described in the reporting and anal ysis plan. Anypopulation PK analy sis and pharmacod ynamic analysis will be reported separately from the main clinical study report (CSR). Should a genetic/PGx analy sis be performed, a separate reporting and anal ysis plan will be generated ( SeeAppendix 6: Genetics). 10.4.6. Interim A nalyses Formal analy ses will be performed at two timepoints. End of Treatment Phase Analysis: This will take place after all participants have completed the Week 16 visit. The data will be cleaned, the treatments unbli nded and all clinic visits up to and including week 16 frozen .However, whilst no further efficacy data will be collected post week 16, d ue to an inability to lock log forms used for collection of exacerbation data , the end of treatment phase anal ysis will be considered an interim anal ysis for both efficacy and safet y. An y safet y data collected for participants who have completed clinic visits after Week 16 will also be cleaned and included in the anal ysis. There will be no modifications to dosing regimens, sample size or any other aspects of the trial based on this data, as all study assessments, apart from follow -up, will have"
267,page_267,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 66alread y been completed. As such an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will not be used, as no further investigational pro duct will be prescribed after this analysishas taken place. Final Analysis: This will take place after all subjects have completed the st udy. Data for visits after Week 16 as well as data collected on log pages will be cleaned and the database frozen. Th is will be the final anal ysis for the stud y. The Reporting and Anal ysis Plan will describe the planned anal yses in greater detail. Instream review: An iSRC will periodically review unblinded safety data to protect and maintain participant safety whilst maintaining scientific validity . Members of the iSRC will be independent of the project. The data will include, but not necessaril y be limited to SAEs, Holters and ECGs. Details are described in the Charter."

Appendix 4: A dverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (i ncluding an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to pro gression of underly ing disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medica tion. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacologi cal action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the d efinition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action ""constitutes anAE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y"
280,page_280,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 79assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgica l procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospit alization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was ne cessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza,"
281,page_281,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 80and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to pre vent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF ."
282,page_282,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 81It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the parti cipant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK /AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participa nt number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (no t the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents nor mal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationsh ip. Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has"
283,page_283,"2017N311825_00 CONFIDENTIA L 207597 82minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK .However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before th e initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteri a used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF . The investi gator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section). The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF . After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or recei ves updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or to the"
