The product under study is currently marketed in the United States and has been cleared via 510(k) by the FDA under application K053082 and K163461 in combination with the Halyard Radiofrequency (RF) Generator (PMG -115-TD/PMG -230-TD, or PMG - BASIC/PMG -ADVANCED K072478 ) for use in creating radiofrequency lesions in nervous tissue. It is also indicated for creating radiofrequency lesions of the genicular nerves for the management of moderate to severe knee pain of more than 6 months with conservat ive therapy, including medication, in patients with radiographically -confirmed osteoarthritis (grade 2 -4) and a positive response (≥ 50% reduction in pain) to a diagnostic genicular nerve block. A Long -Term Extension will captur e data allowing the assessment of the long term clinical outcomes (such as current level of pain, function, and progression of disease) for patients who received COOLIEF* as their initial treatment. Subjects who received COOLIEF* as their initial treatment will be asked to return for 2 additional visits representing 18 and 24 months post initial treatment."

Non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first line treatment for OA for the purpose of reducing pain and inflammation and allowing for the maintenance of act ivities. Physical therapy or other exercise - based modalities are also considered to be standards of care in the earliest stages of OA to maintain patient mobility to the extent possible. While total joint replacement is a well -established terminal treatment for late stage OA of major joints , such as the hip and knee, not all patients are well -suited for this procedure due to issues of age, health, or other factors. In addition, total knee replacement, while generally considered effective, has been associated in at least one study with ongoing moderate to significant pain in up to 53% of patients, with patients in that study noting a median average pain score of 3 of 10 and worst pain score of 5 of 10 .1 Currently , there are a limited number of treatment options available for patients who are not candidates for total joint replacement and/or for whom drugs are either ineffective or are interfering with their overall quality of life and gener al health . Corticosteroid injection provides significant short term improvement as far as pain relief 2, but multiple treatments are required and the steroid and analgesic medication may actually exacerbate cartilage destruction if used over an extended p eriod of time .3 Viscosupplementation (the injection of protein -based gel/fluids into the joint space to improve synovial fluid viscosity) has show n some moderate effectiveness in some studies ,4 5 but its clinical utility for knee OA has recently been called into question by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS).6 COOLIEF™ (CRFA) is a well -established method for delivering lesions into nervous tissue to accomplish neurotomy procedures . Multiple references exist in the literature noting the clinical outcomes of patients treated with CRFA cooled radiofrequency for pain managing denervation in other anatomic locations, including the sacroiliac joint7,8,9,10 and the lumbar spinal disc.11,12,13 Recent human studies have started to demonstrate the effects of CRFA when specifically used for genicular neurotomy procedures in patients with chronic knee pain resulting from conditions such as OA14. Sensory innervation of the knee joint is accomplished by the articular branches of several nerves, including the femoral, tibial, saphenous, obturator, and common peroneal nerves. As a group, these nerves have been termed “genicular nerves.”15,16 Radiofrequency -generated lesions of the genicular nerves (i.e., genicular neurotomy ) using standard, non -cooled radiofrequency ablation has been defined"
11,page_11,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 12 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 in the literature. Choi and colleagues17 published a prospective, randomized, double -blind controlled trial of genicular neurotomy in a series of 38 elderl y OA patients with severe knee pain who had failed conservative therapy but responded to a diagnostic block. In this study , the superomedial and inferomedial branches of the saphenous nerve and the superolateral branch of the femoral nerve were targeted fo r treatment. The probe placement is demonstrated in the figure below taken from Choi , et al . They showed statistically significant improvements in pain, Oxford Knee Score, and global perceived effect when compared to placebo at up to 3 months post treat ment. Ikeuchi and colleagues18 also published a prospective randomized study comparing RF neurotomy to diagnostic block alone. In their study, at 12 weeks post treatment, 44% of the RF group rated “good or excellent” compared to only 12% of the block grou p. The probe placement and lesioning pattern in the Ikeuchi, et al study differed from the method of Choi, et al. A recent sponsored study was completed which compared CRFA to intraarticular steroid injections (IAS) for painful OA of the knee and demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pain, function , and global perceived effect of CRFA at 614 and 12 months19. A subset of those patients were followed through 24 months and it was identified that CRFA has the potential to provide sustai ned effect through this time period. This potential was previously suggested by Ho 2015 where patients reported 24 months of relief following CRFA when used to ablate the lateral branches that innervate the sacroiliac joint20 . The nerve targets were identi cal to those utilized in the Choi research . In 2014, Franco21 et al completed a cadaveric dissection study which confirmed the locations of the genicular nerves identified by Choi et al and identified an additional nerve target – the middle branch from the vastus intermedius , which will be incorporated as part of the lesioning for this protocol."
12,page_12,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 13 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 This protocol outlines a prospective, single arm, multicenter study examining pain relief as well as other important clinical efficacy indicators of using CRFA to create lesions of the genicular nerve s. The probe placement method and lesioning pattern will include the 3 targets utilized in the Choi et al and Davis et al with targeting of the superomedial and inferomedial branches of the saphenous nerve and the superolate ral branch of the femoral nerve, and will include the additional nerve target identified by Franco et al - middle branch from the vastus intermedius . 4.2 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION S AND INTENDED USE The following is a summary description of the Study Device. For additional information, please refer to the COOLIEF* “Instructions for Use ” (Appendix 1) . The COOLIEF™ system components utilized in the study are the same in form and function regardless of specific product branding ( COOLIEF* , SInergy *, or Halyard Health ). The COOLIEF™ system is comprised of three primary components (collectively known as ‘disposables’) and is used in conjunction with the Pain Management generator , pump unit , connector cables (collectively known as ‘Hardware’) and dispersive electrodes ( also known as ‘ grounding pads ’): • Cooled Radiofrequency Sterile Tube Kit (sterile, single use, non -body contact): It is used for closed -loop circulation of sterile water through a Cooled Radiofrequency Probe. It includes a burette and tubing. • Cooled Radiofrequency Introducer (sterile, single use): It is to be used with the Probes only. The Cooled Radiofrequency Introducer provides a path for the Probe to the targeted nervous tissue. • Cooled Radiofrequency Probe (sterile, single use): It is inserted through a n Introducer into or near nervous tissue. The active tip extends 4mm from the introducer and delivers energy. Sterile water circulates internally to cool the Probe while it delivers radio frequency energy. A thermocouple in the Probe measures the cooled electrode temperature throughout the procedure. The product is comprised of an electrically insulated shaft with an active tip that functions as an electrode for RF energy delivery, a handl e, tubes with luer locks and a cable with a 7 -pin connector. The Introducer includes an insulated stainless steel cannula and a stylet. The Tube Kit is comprised of a burette and flexible tubing fitted with luer locks for connection to the Probe. The Probe , Introducer, and Tube Kit are ethylene oxide sterilized and supplied sterile. These components can be packaged together in a kit or as separate components . The devices should be stored in a cool, dry environment. The Instructions For Use (IFU) documents (Appendix 1) are included in each kit. Avanos Medical maintains a list of all model numbers and sizes for the system components ."

Hylans are derivatives of hyaluronan (sodium hyaluronate). Hylan G -F 20 is unique in that the hyaluronan is chemically crosslinked. Hyaluronan is a long -chain polymer containing repeating disacchari de units of Na -glucuronate -N- acetylglucosamine. Synvisc -One is a single injection regimen therapy indicated for the treatment of pain in OA of the knee in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conservative nonpharmacologic therapy and simple an algesics, e.g., acetaminophen. The Synvisc -One® (hylan G -F 20) Instructions For Use is attached as Appendix 2. 4.3 EXEMPT STUDIES DETERMINATION As both products being utilized in this study are commercially available and are being used according to their labeled indications, t he sponsor has determined that this study meets the criteria for the ‘Exempt Studies’ as specified in 21 CFR 812.2 (c)(2) and confirmed in the Information Sheet Guidance For IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors - Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices (January 2006) , which states that “s tudies of an already cleared medical device in which the device is used or investigated in accordance with the indications in the cleared labeling are exemp t from Part 812 .” 4.4 SUMMARY OF PRIOR INV ESTIGATIONS As mentioned above, a recent investigation has been performed in this population using the COOLIEF* device for performing genicular neurotomy procedures for managing patients with chronic knee pain due to conditions such as osteoarthritis 14. This prospective randomized study compared CRFA against intraarticular steroid injections (IAS) and th e two treatment groups were homogenous for demographic, pain and functional parameters at b aseline. Mean Numeric Rating Scale (NRS ) at baseline was 7.3 ± 1.2 (Mean ± SD) for the CRFA group and 7.2 ± 1.0 for the IAS group. One hundred and twenty -six (126) patients remained in the study and were evaluated at 6 -months post treatment (n = 58 CRFA an d n = 68 IAS). In the CRFA group, 74.1% of patients had ≥ 50% reduction in NRS pain score compared to 16.2% in the IAS group at 6 month follow up ( p < 0.0001, primary endpoint). At 6 months, the resting mean NRS was 2.5 ± 2.3 for the CRFA group and 5.9 ± 2 .2 for the IAS group ( p < 0.0001), representing a 4.9 point drop in NRS for the CRFA group. The mean Oxford Knee Score (measure of function) improved from 16.7 ± 4.4 at baseline to 35.7 ± 8.8 in the CRFA group at 6 months , compared to 22.4 ± 8.5 in the IAS group ( p < 0.0001) . At 6 months, 91.4% of subjects in the CRFA group reported improvement in Global Perceived Effect (GPE) compared to 23.9% in the IAS group ( p < 0.0001). No serious adverse events"

These results were sustained at the 12 month time point in that 65.4% of subjects reported ≥ 50% reduction in NRS pain score in the CRFA group. In addition, the CRFA patient group’s Oxford Knee Score indicated continued functional improvement at 12 months with a mean score of 34.3 ± 11.1 . 75% of subjects reported being ‘Improved’ on their GPE 12 months after treatment.19 A subset of these subjects were followed through 2 4 months . Eighteen ( 18) subjects returned at 24 months post CRFA procedure and their average NRS score was reported as 3.6 ± 2.7 for these subjects. Eleven (11) of the 18 reported pain levels that were ≥ 50% reduced from their baseline values. Functional improvements were maintained as well.22 Multiple prior investigations using the CRFA device for delivering radiofrequency lesions into nervous tissue have been conducted and published, as described in se ction 4.1 above. Information related to clinical experience with the control product (HA) can be found in the Synvisc -One Instructions for Use document ( Appendix 2). 4.5 RATIONALE FOR STUDY This prospective, multi -center , randomized, comparison study is exam ining the effects of the COOLIEF * Cooled Radiofrequency Probe used for radiofrequency neurotomy compared to a single injection of Hyaluronic Acid (Hylan G -F 20) i n subject s to manag e knee pain. The study does not introduce any experimental procedures , as both products will be used in a manner that is consistent with their labeled indications. The primary rationale for conducting this study is to assist with reimbursement support for the product. The rationale for th e long -term extension is to capture da ta to understand the long term clinical effects of utilizing CRFA for the treatment of OA knee pain. 4.6 POTENTIAL RISKS & BE NEFITS The potential benefits of COOLIEF * when used for creating radiofrequency lesions in the genicular nerves of knee pain subject s are to provide pain relief, improve function, improve overall quality of life, and reduce the need for other modalities to control pain such as prescription opioids . Avanos Medical follows rigorous Quality Control procedures throughout the life of a pro duct, from the business analysis phase through development, market release, and post -market surveillance.

The potential risks to subjects in which a radiofrequency neurotomy procedure is performed, regardless of the treatment modality, may include the following , all of which are anticipated adverse events that have been identified as possible complications of procedures involving lesioning of nervous tissue : • Infection, • Damage to collateral nervous tissue , • Increased pain, • Visceral injury, • Failure of technique, • Superficial burns; • Damage to collateral tissue (i.e., bruising or hematoma) , • Deafferentation dysesthesiae • Paralysis, and • Death The potential risks specifically associated with the use of COOLIEF* for radiofrequency neurotomy are anticipated to be the same as those listed above , with the exception of visceral injury and paralysis , as the device will not be used in any anatomic location in this study other than the index knee . As described in Appendix 2, t he potential benefit s of single injection of Hyaluronic Acid (Hylan G -F 20) include short to medium term pain relief, assistance with therapeutic exercise, and some restoration of function. Hylan injection involves inserting a needle directly into the space inside your knee. This procedure carries certain risks, including: • Arthralgia • Arthritis • Arthropathy • Gait disturbance • Injection site pain • Joint effusion • Joint stiffness • Joint swelling • Joint warmth"
16,page_16,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 17 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 There are other Hylan products on the market which have reported the following risks: • Rash • Hives • Itching • Fever • Nausea • Headache • Dizziness • Chills • Muscle cramps • Paresthesia • Peripheral edema • Malaise • Respiratory difficulties • Flushing • Facial swelling 5 STUDY OBJECTIVES This study is designed to: • Determine the effectiveness (primarily measured by pain relief) of COOLIEF * when used to create radiofr equency lesions of the genicular nerve s compared to pain relief following a single injection of Hyaluronic Acid (Hylan G -F 20) ; and • Confirm the safety of COOLIEF * when used to perform radiofrequency lesions of the genicular nerve s in subject s to manage knee pain compared to safety of single injection of Hyaluronic Acid (Hylan G -F 20) . • To describe the long term clinical effects ( such as current level of pain, function , and progression of disease through 24 months) for patients who initially randomized to and received CRFA for treatment of their OA knee pain. 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 6.1 STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized , multicenter comparison study examining the outcomes of subject s with OA and knee pain undergoing a procedure to create a radiofrequency lesion of the genicular nerve s with the CRFA system compared to subjects receiving HA. A total of approximately 168 subjects will be enrolled into this study , with subject s undergoing either CRFA or HA injection in a 1:1 randomization schem e. Follow up will be conducted for a total of 12-months post randomized procedure with the"

In addition, the endpoints listed above will also be summarized at 18 and 24 months post treatment. 6.3 MEASURES TO M INIMIZE/ AVOID B IAS All subject s presenting to the study centers who report knee pain will be evaluated for eligibility for study participation . Routine evaluations of all site screening logs will be conducted to assure that no subject s are excluded based on investigator bias. Further , the primary endpoint measurements in this study are primarily subject generated and are not based on the opinion of the investigator, thus minimizing the potential for bias related to the outcome of the procedure. Independent monitoring, Dat a Managemen t and Statistics will also be utilized to ensure accuracy of the data collected. 6.4 DURATION OF SUBJECT PARTICIPATION The screening period could take up to 60 days to complete for all subjects. Subjects will participate in th e study for approximately 13 month s from time of randomization treatment visit + 12-month follow up , except for subject s who participate in the optional crossover group or the long -term extension . Crossover subject s will be on study for approximately 15 months from randomization (initial treatment + 6-month follow -up followed by crossover treatment with an additional 6-month follow up period ). Those who initially received CRFA at Visit 2 will be given the option to return for 2 additional visits, representing 18 and 24 months post initial procedure. If they agree, their entire study participation will be approximately 25 months. Enrollment is anticipated to take approximately 8 -10 months. 6.5 STUDY -STOPPING CRITERIA The study may be terminated if the sponsor determines that there is a clinical or other reason to do so .

Subject s will be noted as positive responders if the participant experiences a decrease in numeric pain scores of at least 50% at least 15 minutes after the injection . All subject s with a positi ve response will be eligible for the study. Subject s randomized to CRFA will be placed in a supine position on a fluoroscopy table with a pillow under the popliteal fossa to alleviate discomfort. The true AP fluoroscopic view of the tibiofemoral joint wil l be obtained to show the tibiofemoral joint space with equal width interspaces on both sides. An appropriately sized cooled radiofrequency needle w ill be placed overlying the affected knee joint and using fluoroscopic guidance , the needle will be advanced to a bony endpoint on the superiolateral portion of the femoral condyle of the affected knee. A second needle will be advanced to a bony endpoint on the superiomedial portion of the femoral condyle. A third needle will be advanced to the bony end point at the inferiomedial portion of the tibial condyle. The final needle will be placed at the midline of the femur about 2 cm cephalad of the upper patellar border . Lateral x -ray views should be taken to confirm appropriate location at 50% depth of the femur and tibia prior to lesioning. Care should be taken to avoid inserting the RF probe into the inferolateral area of the knee to avoid the common peroneal nerve and potential foot drop. If pooling of blood or fluid is seen in the stylet , aspirate and re position as necessary. AP and lateral x -ray views should be taken during the procedure which show all the needles in final positioning for maintenance in the source documentation. Motor stimulation must be tested a t 2.0 volts with no leg movement. Sensory stimulation should be conducted at < 0.5 volts in all four locations with concordant pain reproduction. A mixture consisting of lidocaine (1% or 2% preferred) should then be slowly injected. Then , radiofrequency ablation of each of the four targete d geniculate nerves will be conducted at 60 °C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds at each of the 4 anatomic locations . At the conclusion of the procedure, the needles will be removed, the insertion sites will be treated with appropriate closure, and the subject will be allowed to properly recover prior to discharge home. Instillation of p ost-operative analgesic pain medication is permissible per institutional standard of care. Additionally, selected sites will also collect information during the procedure from the generators utilizing a sponsor provided laptop computer loaded with the TeraTerm Software package. This open sourced software collects blinded information from the generator during the procedure. The laptops should be attached to the generator prior to the initiation of the procedure. The reports will be saved utilizing the subject number assigned to the study as an iden tifier, and the data will be s ent to the sponsor for analysis . Specific training will be provided for participating sites and details will be described in a TeraTerm Plan."

The preferred approach is the suprapatellar, pending anatomic limitations. Strict aseptic administration technique must be followed and the procedu re should be performed per the instructions for use for the product . • Optional: If necessary, u sing an 18 - to 20 -gauge needle, remove synovial fluid or effusion before injecting Synvisc -One. • Do not use the same syringe for removing synovial fluid and for in jecting Synvisc -One; however, the same 18 - to 20 -gauge needle should be used. • Twist the tip cap before pulling it off, as this will minimize product leakage. • To ensure a tight seal and prevent leakage during administration, secure the needle tightly while firmly holding the luer hub. Precaution: Do not over tighten or apply excessive leverage when attaching the needle or removing the needle guard, as this may break the syringe tip. • Inject the full 6 mL in one knee only. If concurrent minor procedures , such as arthrocentesis , are performed on the index knee prior to administration of either treatment, volume information should be captured in the subject’s source documentation. Subject s will be encouraged to refrain from strenuous activity for 48 hours following both procedures . 6.6.5 Test Article/ Supply Accountability The investigator must ensure that accurate records of receipt of study devices, dispensing information, and the prompt return or destruction of unused supplies are maintained at all times . A de vice accountability log will be supplied to the site for the purposes of recording study device dispensation and will be monitored by periodically sponsor personnel. All provided supplies and unused test articles must be returned or destroyed per the spons or at the end of the study after final accountability has been conducted by sponsor personnel. 7 SUBJECT SELECTION Subjects will include male and non -pregnant females ≥ 21 years of age who present with chronic knee pain resulting from osteoarthritis and meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria."

If a subject is withdrawn or the study is terminated, investigators will revert to institutional standard s-of-care. 10.6 Crossover visit (visit 5a) Only subjects initially ran domized to the control group ( HA injection) who remain in significant pain at Visit 5 are eligible to receive crossover. Significant pain is defined as pain substantial enough to warrant receipt of a minimally invasive procedure (i.e., CRFA ) per the investigators and subject assessment. Subjects do not need to formally requalify for the study to receive crossover per the inclusion/exclusion criteria ; however , confirmation and documentation is needed that subjects remain a medically appropriat e candidate for the CRFA procedure in order to be eligible . Prior to receiving the Crossover procedure, the subject should be reminded of the risks of the CRFA procedure as described in section 4.6 and should sign the Crossover section of the informed co nsent document as noted in Section 8.2."
31,page_31,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 32 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 If the subject is still receiving relief from the HA injection at the time of this visit and/or is not medically appropriate for the C RFA procedure or elects not to Crossover , the subject should not receive cross over treatment and should continue to complete Visit 6. It is anticipated that the Crossover procedure will occur on a different day than the 6 Month visit (Visit 5); however , it is allowable to perform the procedure on the same day if the Visit 5 items are completed first. Otherwise, t he crossover treatment should occur within 30 days of Visit 5. If Visit 5A occurs on the same day as Visit 5, overlapping assessments noted below that were completed as part of Visit 5 do not need to be re -done (i.e., NRS, WOMAC, Healthcare Utilization, etc.). If a subject choses crossover, the timing of their follow up visits (5B, 5C and 6) will now be based off the ir Visit 5A treatment date . Visit 5B/1 Month Visit should occur at post -operative day 30 ± 7 days. Visit 5C/ 3 Month Visit should occur at post -operative day 90 ± 14 days and the 6 Month Visit/Visit 6 should occur at post-operative day 180 ± 14 days. At the Crossover Visit, t he following assessments must be performed. (1) Verify Crossover consent was obtained (2) Verify and document that the subject remains medically appropriate for the procedure. (3) Obtain a Numeric Rating Scale for pain (subject completed questionnaire). (4) Obtain WOMAC Score (subject completed questionnaire). (5) Obtain an EQ -5D-5L Assessment (subject c ompleted questionnaire). (6) Obtain a Global Perceived Effect Score (subject completed questionnaire). (7) Obtain Healthcare Utilization Form (8) If applicable, f ollow site standard procedures for confirming preg nancy status prior to treatment. (9) Perform CRFA procedure per section 6.6.4 . (10) Perform adverse event assessment. (11) Assess concomitant medications. (12) Provide subject with perioperative care and at home care instructions. (13) Schedule next clinic visit s (1, 3, and 6 months as noted above ). 11 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 11.1 ADVERS E EVENTS (AE) ASSESSMENT Subjects should be instructed to contact the Investigator (or designee) immediately if an AE occurs. At each visit, the investigator (or authorized desi gnee) should further query the subject to determine if any"

Adverse Events will be assessed from the time the subject signs consent until study exit. All adverse events must be reported according to the following procedure. Sites will be instructed to follow their normal /routine processes for adv erse event reporting of post market products to the FDA per 803.20 – Individual Adverse Event Reports, however; related events that result in death, serious injury or malfunction that could cause death or serious injury will be specifically monitored for. As an additional measure of control, the sponsor will periodically review reported events as described in section 11.6 looking for items t hat meet the reporting criteria. 11.1.1 Definition s and C lassification Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a subject or clinical investigatio n subject using a study device including any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study device, whether or no t considered related to the device. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) : An AE that begins or worsens in severity afte r the subject has used at least one study device Non-Treatment Emergent Adverse Event: An AE that begins or worsens in severity between the time that the consent form is signed and the first use of the study device Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : A Serious Adverse Event is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence that falls into one of the following categories: A. Results in death B. Is life threatening, meaning that the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; this does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. C. Requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existing hospitalization D. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity E. Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in a subject’s fetus or baby F. Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but that may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscr asias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization."
33,page_33,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 34 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE): Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death cause by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application, or any other unanticipated serious problem asso ciated with the device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 11.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS The Investigator (or authorized delegate) will assess the severity of each AE based on the following definitions : 11.3 RELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EV ENTS For each AE, the Investigator (or qualified delegate) will assess the causality/relationship to the investigational device according to the following criteria: Relatedness Definition Unrelated A clearly evident relationship to other etiologies , such as concomitant medications or conditions or subject’s know n clinical state Unlikely Based upon available information regarding subject history or disease process, relationship of adverse event to test article(s) is unlikely Possible The association of the AE with the test article is unknown; other etiologies are also possible Severity Definition Mild An AE in which the subject is aware of signs or symptoms, but which does not interfere with the subject’s usual activiti es of daily living, or is transient and resolves without treatment or sequelae Moderate A sign or symptom which interferes with the subject’s usual activities of daily living or requires treatment Severe An AE that results in incapacity with inability to do work or do usual activities of daily living. Severe AEs require treatment or medical intervention to resolve"

All AEs must be recorded in the subject’s medical record and the appropriate eCRF. The description of the AE will identify the date of onset, date of remission, severity, causal relationship to the study product, action tak en along with the results of any diagnostic procedures or laboratory tests, all treatments that were required and the outcome of the event. B. The Investigator will follow all study device related AEs until there is a return to baseline or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved. 11.5 REPORTING SERIOUS AD VERSE E VENTS The Investigator must report any SAE to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. All deaths, whether or not considered study -related, must be reported immediately to the Sponsor with a copy of the autopsy report and death certificate provided when and if available.

35,page_35,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 36 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 The Investigator and the Sponsor will review each SAE report to evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to study device. In addition, the Sponsor will determine if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan. Based on the Investigator and Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a decision will be made concerning the need for further action. All SAEs will be captured from signing of informed consent throughout the study. The Investigator must notify the IRB in writing of all SAEs in accordance with IRB requirements. 11.6 CLINICAL SAFETY M ONITORING Avanos Medical’s Medical Director will conduct periodic safety monitoring and oversight throughout the course of the study by reviewing all Serious Adverse Event reports, conducting A dverse Event listing reviews, and monitoring post -market surveillance reports. Upon receipt of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) report at Avanos Medical , the medical monitor will review the SAE report for completeness and when necessary , will request cla rification and/or additional information from the investigator . The designated medical monitor is responsible for reviewing the investigator’s assessment and classification of each event. If the designated medical monitor disagrees with the investigator’s classification of the event, the rationale will be provided to the investigator. If the investigator agrees with the designated medical monitor, the subject’s Adverse Event Report Form will be updated accordingly. If the investigator does not agree with th e designated medical monitor classification, both determinations will be documented within the study report. However, the Avanos Medical determination will be used for analysis purposes. Given the ‘Exempt’ status of this study, Avanos Medical has determin ed that a Data Monitoring Committee (or DSMB) is not required based on the FDA guidance document, “Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees”. 12 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS Prior to initiation of the analysis , a stand -alone Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be prepared , which will provid e detailed methods for the analyses outlined below. Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated study report. The primary a nalysis is planned when the last enrolled subject completes the 6 -month follow -up visit. The subjects will continue to be followed through 12 months, and a final analysis is planned at the conclusion of the study after the last subject completes the 12 -month follow -up visit."
36,page_36,"Genicular Nerve Lesion Study Confidential Protocol # 105-17-0001 Version #: 4.0 Page 37 of 62 Version Date: 28Mar19 An additional analysis will be conducted once the last subject completes the extension study to analyze data collected at 18 and 24 months. 12.1 DETERMINATION OF SA MPLE SIZE A non -inferiority approach on response rate was used to estimat e the sample size for this study , with “response” defined as ≥ 50% reduction in pain on the NRS scale from baseline . The upper bound of a 2 - sided 95% CI will be calculated for the rate difference between treatments ( Standard minus Test). If the upper boun d is less than (δ), then “non -inferiority” is achieved for the test treatment relative to standard treatment , as described in the table below: Success Rate of C RFA (based on 50% Pain Score Reduction in VAS) Success Rate of Standard (Based on 30% Pain Sco re Reduction in VAS) Non-Inferiority Margin (δ) Sample Size 5% Level of Significance (2-sided) 90% Statistical Power 62%* 40%** 5% 134 * - 14 Davis, et al, RAPM 2017, In Press /FDA clearance K163461 ** - 5 Chevalier, X et al. “Single, intra -articular treatment with 6 ml Hylan G -F 20 in patients with symptomatic primary osteoarthritis of the knee: a randomized, multi -center, double -blind, placebo controlled trial” Ann Rheum Dis 2010 69: 113 -119. Assuming an attrition rate of 20%, 168 subjects enrolle d into the study will yield 134 completers . 12.1.1 Disposition of Subjects The number and percentage of subjects entering the study will be presented. Reasons for any screen failures and /or early terminations will be summarized . A flow chart will present the aggregate disposition of subjects from Visit 1 (Screening Visit) through the final 24-month visit , including all subject s who cross over from the viscosupplementation injection group to the CRFA denervation group . 12.1.2 Protocol Deviations Deviations from the protocol , including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria , will be a ssessed as “minor” or “major” by the sponsor prior to database lock and analysis . Major deviations from the protocol will lead to the exclusion of a su bject from the Per -Protocol Set. Certain clinical situations may require waivers for the safety of the subjects enrolled, integrity of the data or scheduling conflicts. Any waiver request will be reviewed on an independent basis and must be documented i n writing prior to the event occurrence. Clinical decisions will be made by the medical monitor."

Continuous data will be summarized by randomized device assignment and other subset (center, age, etc.) groupings using descriptive statistics (number, mean, median, standard deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). Categorical data will be summarized by randomized device assignment and other subset groupings using frequency tables (frequencies, percentages, confidence intervals). The natural log transformation will be applied to variables which are highly skewed. If the model assumptions for the ANOVA are not met, transformation of the data or non - parametric analysis may be implemented. 12.5 DEMOGRAPHICS, BASELI NE CHARACTERISTICS, AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS Demographic data, medical history, and concomitant medication s will be summarized by means of descriptive statistics."

Each subject’s response to the treatment will be treated as an independent binomial event : Ho: πC - πT ≥ 0.05 Ha: πC - πT < 0.05 Where: ΠT: proportion of subjects with ≥ 50% decrease from baseline in NRS pain score from baseline at the 6 month s post randomization in the CRFA group ΠC: proportion of subjects with ≥ than 50% decrease from baseline in NRS score from Screening at the 6 month s post randomization in the HA injection group The non -inferi ority margin is set at 5% for the primary efficacy parameter expressed as proportion. The difference of proportions between treatment groups will be calculated and a two sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed using Wald asymptotic confidence lim its approach or exact binomial limits approach. If the upper bound is less than 0. 05, then ‘Non -inferiority’ is established for the CRFA group relative to the HA injection group. If, in addition, the upper bound of the confidence interval is below zero, the CRFA group can be determined to be ‘Superior’ to the HA injection group. Treatment by study center interaction may be ex amined graphically across study cente r to determine the association between treatment and response rate is in the same direction or using logistic regression with response rate at 6 months as the response variable, and the study center, treatment group, study center by treatment group interac tion as predictor variables in the model. 12.6.2 Secondary Effectiveness Analysis If the null hypothesis is rejected for the primary endpoint, i.e., CRFA is concluded to be either non -inferior or superior to the HA injection, the secondary endpoints will be compared between treatment groups as detailed below. 12.6.2.1 Knee Pain Reduction"

Lead Principal Investigator will be listed as the lead author, the Steering Committee will be represented, then authorship order will be determined by enrollm ent ranking pending journal allowances . Enrollment is defined as the number of patients who successfully reached the primary objective taking into account major data quality issues . A Working Group will be created which may allow for inclusion of participating investigators or referring sub -investigators who provided significant scientific contribut ion leading to the success ful conduct of the trial. 18.4 PRIMARY PRESENTATION S Study presentations occurring at a public conference or meeting. Author affiliation with the associated society will be taken into account as part of the decision -making process for choosing presenters. • Primary speaker: Principal investigator of the study shall have first right of refusal. • Secondary speaker or back -up speaker: if more than one speaker is necessary or the principal investigator of the study is not available, the principal investigator of the highest enrolling center will be given the next priority , and so on . If neither of the first two options are available or interested, a steering committee member will be chosen. Speakers for subsequent presentations can be any of the authors noted and should be confirmed by the steering committee. 19 REFERENCE S"
